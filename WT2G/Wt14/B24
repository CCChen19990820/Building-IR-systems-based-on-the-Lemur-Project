<p>
<b><center>ACKNOWLEDGMENTS</center></b><p>
<p>
It was a pleasure and privilege to work with the dedicated and capable group of
people who make the Day Care Centre Programme a success.<p>
<p>
I am particularly grateful to the DCC supervisors (Malek, Zarina, Zubeda,
Naina, Chaya and Noorbanu) for their willingness to share their wisdom, for
their hard work during long hours while we were together in Rajkot and the
field. They were very patient with me, a non-Gujarati
speaking foreigner, and they made me feel very much at home and part of a team,
despite my own frustration at not being able to communicate directly.<p>
<p>
The staff of the Rajkot office (Mrs. Batavia, Munir and Anwar) were efficient
in all local arrangements (including the translation and production of
interview schedules under a very tight schedule). But they did not stop with
administrative matters; rather, they participated fully in
the discussions and field work, adding their insights, and folding in a sense
of humor. That was also true of Ila from CHETNA, without whom I would have
understood very little during the field visit.<p>
<p>
The guidance of Nirupa Bhangar and of Hina Hallani from the Bombay office of
AKES was invaluable. A large share of the burden of translations fell on their
shoulders. I appreciate both their substantive inputs into the process and
their gracious hospitality.<p>
<p>
I owe thanks to Rajni Khanna and Judith Evans for asking me to carry out this
consultancy and for making the administrative arrangements necessary to set it
in motion.<p>
<p>
Finally, I am grateful for the kindnesses shown by the villagers of Sangodhra
and Chitravad who invited me into their homes and who answered our many
questions in spite of time pressures and social conventions that could have
kept them from participating in the survey. The visit to Sangodhra was
particularly memorable: we were fed and housed and made a part of the
Community's January 19th celebration honoring the 1983 visit of His Highness.<p>
<p>
In short, this was an exciting and rewarding experience<p>
<b><center>INTRODUCTION</center></b><p>
<b>The Charge</b><p>
<p>
The general charge set out in the terms of reference of my consultancy was:<p>
<ul>
	"to provide information and suggestions that will facilitate policy
formulation, planning and programme implementation of the DCC project."<p>
<p>
	More specifically, I was asked to:<p>
<p>
 <li> examine the quality of service delivery, including the educational,
nutritional and health components of the programme, parental education and
participation;<p>
<p>
<li> examine the management structure, with special attention to operation of the
Local Management Committees, the decentralization process, and training and
supervision arrangements;<p>
<p>
 <li>assess the programme impact and its cost-effectiveness.</ul><p>
<p>
In addition, it was hoped that I might shed some light on functioning of
"coaching classes" at the primary school level and comment on the replicability
of the experience.<p>
<b>Organization of the Report</b><p>
<p>
This report is presented in five sections. The remainder of this introductory
section will set out sources of information, describe the method followed in
carrying out the survey of DCC children, parents, teachers, and other programme
participants, and comment briefly on the changing context within which the
review has been carried out. Section II will focus on the coverage, quality and
impact of the services delivered through the DCC programme, with attention
specifically to education, health, nutrition, and adult education. In Section
III, comments and recommendations will be made about management, administration, and
organization. Included in the section will be a discussion of costs and
finances as well as comments on the process of administrative decentralization.
A fourth section will be devoted specifically to looking at coaching classes
and the idea of beginning AK primary schools. The final section will present
more general conclusions and recommendations. A fuller description of the DCC
survey and of results obtained can be found in Attachment B.<p>
<p>
<b>Method and Sources of Information</b><p>
<p>
Background reading for the consultancy included a review of (1) previous
evaluations, (2) recent quarterly reports detailing DCC activities, (3) the
original and revisions of the 1986-1990
Five Year Plan, (4) training reports, and (5) my own consultancy report written
in July, 1986. (See Attachment A for a list of the documents consulted.)<p>
<p>
It was also possible to draw upon (6) an evaluation of the DCC centres
completed during 1989 by CHETNA. This evaluation examined the effectiveness
with which teachers were implementing the new project method, introduced by
CHETNA in a series of training sessions carried out during 1988 and 1989.
Results of the CHETNA evaluation were made available upon arrival in Rajkot.<p>
<p>
(7) A "Programmewise Review" written in December 1989 by Nirupa Bhangar was
very helpful in providing background and setting the issues. The main source of
information for the programme evaluation, however, came from (8) a survey of
DCC centres carried out between January 15 and 23, 1990, and from (9) field-based
discussions of the survey. Participating in the survey were the six DCC
supervisors, AKES staff from the Bombay and Rajkot offices, and members of
CHETNA. The main purpose of the survey/review was to generate information
useful for planning and programming. A secondary, but nevertheless important
purpose was to provide a learning experience for all involved through active
collaboration in a process of formulating questionnaires, choosing samples of
centres and children, systematically collecting data based on the
questionnaires, and analyzing the data as a group.<p>
<p>
An assumption behind the approach taken was that the supervisors, who spend a
great deal of time in the field and who are in a crucial intermediate position,
are most knowledgeable about how the DCC programme actually functions. The
participatory review was in large part an attempt to draw out supervisors'
insights, based however on current information collected in a systematic way,
and reflecting the condition of the entire programme rather than of particular
villages or a particular supervisor. As might be expected, the qualitative
observations and specific comments of participants in the survey proved to be as important (or more so)
than the descriptive totals arrived at quantitatively. Group discussions at the
outset of the process, leading to the formulation of questions, and group
discussion at the time of the analysis provided, independently, a rich source
of general and detailed information about the operation of the DCC project and
excellent suggestions for improvements.<p>
<p>
Details of the methodology followed in the survey and a summary of results are
provided in Attachment B. Here, it may be sufficient for the reader to know
that a random sample of 12 DCCs was selected and that 6 children within each
DCC were randomly chosen (3 from the youngest of the three age groups in the
centre and 3 from the oldest) to give a general picture. Separate schedules
were created to collect information about the children , and to guide
interviews with parents of the selected children, as well as interviews with
teachers and members of local Management Committees (LMC). In addition, an
attempt was made to follow DCC graduates into primary schools. And, in the two
villages where coaching classes were being carried out, these classes were
observed and the teachers were interviewed.<p>
<p>
Finally, (10) discussions were held, after the field visit, with AKES and AKHS
staff in the Bombay office, and (11) some time was spent going over budgets,
finances and costs.<p>
<p>
<b>The Context</b><p>
<p><ul>
	<b>AKF(I): Organization and Guidelines</b></ul><p>
<p>
The organizational separation of programmes dealing with education, health,
rural development, housing and construction, and women helps to set programme
planning, implementation, and review tasks, as do several basic guidelines.
From my reading and conversations, I understood the most important of the
programme guidelines to be:<p>
<ul>
		1. Programmes should respond to local needs. They should build upon and
foster local involvement.<p>

		2. Programmes should seek self-sufficiency
over time, with responsibility for the financial and administrative matters
residing in the local community.<p>

		3. Programmes should involve both Ismailis and non-Ismailis.<p>
		4. Programmes should place emphasis on quality.<p>
		5. Programmes should be replicable.</ul><p>
These principles have led to an approach that requires a long-term
commitment  and a broad, altruistic perspective by participants at all levels.
They also suggest that a labor-rather than capital-intensive
approach is needed, without which both broad participation and sustainability
are difficult to achieve. The principles dictate progressive movement toward
decentralization within a "Partnership in Social Development"<p>
<p>
The ease or difficulty of applying these principles is affected by extra-organisational
concerns that also form a critical part of the context for the programme and
for this evaluation<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Economic Changes and the Drought</b></ul><p>
<p>
The economic hardships introduced by drought during the period from 1985-1988
have made it more difficult than originally envisaged to think in terms of self-sufficiency.
At the same time, these conditions have probably facilitated the growth of a
more labor-intensive
approach (rather than the wholesale construction of expensive premises, for
instance). And, with few occupational alternatives available as a result of the
drought, it was easier to attract and maintain good teachers during the drought
period than at present. The status of teachers was enhanced.<p>
<p>
The passing of the drought and the (at least temporary) upturn in economic
activity brings new challenges even as it opens new possibilities. With the
economic upturn, the potential for local support has increased; however, that
potential is not uniform among communities or between Ismailis and non-Ismailis,
with non-Ismailis
often unable to contribute economically at the same level as Ismailis. How to
increase and sustain Ismaili contributions when non-Ismailis
constitute an increasing portion of the DCC participants becomes an issue. In
addition, the changing economic conditions make it more difficult to select and
retain good teachers who now have more lucrative work options.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Expansion of Government Programmes</b></ul><p>
<p>
Since the DCC programme began, government programmes have expanded
(particularly the Integrated Child Development Service and the Primary
schooling) providing new options for villagers. These options compete with the
AKES offerings, making attainment of self-sufficiency
more difficult for DCCs. At the same time, this expansion increases the
possibility of, and need for, collaborative efforts and, perhaps ironically,
also increases the demand for better-quality
service of the kind AKES can provide ("Programmewise Review", pg.4).<p>
<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Programme Expansion and Changing Attitudes</b></ul><p>
<p>
Now that the DCC programme is more than 10 years old and has grown to include
centres in 49 locations, its needs have changed from what they were at the
outset. The programme must now contend with such problems as maintaining
motivation (time erodes motivation and the incentive for involvement has
shifted with the success of the programme in including ever higher percentages
of non-Ismaili
participants), of turnover in personnel, and of other problems related to
continuity and to sustainability. Programme successes change the context and
bring new problems.<p>
<p>
Against this background of organizational guidelines, extraorganizational
changes and a maturing programme, we turn now to look at the coverage, quality,
and impact of the DCC services.<p><p>
<center>
<b>SECTION II</b><p>
    <p>
<b>DCC SERVICES: COVERAGE, QUALITY AND IMPACT</b></center><p>
    <p>
    <p>
<b>Coverage and Participation</b><p>
<p>
Over the period since 1987, the DCC programme has shifted from a programme
catering to a limited number of Ismaili children in facilities within prayer
halls to a programme for all village children in premises outside prayer
halls.<p>
<p>
Since 1985, the programme has almost doubled in size -- from 25 to 49 DCCs, and from 1,108 children to an estimated 2,200. With the
opening of only one more centre in 1990, the quantitative target of the five-year plan will have been reached. However, the number of total students
falls far short of the 3,384 figure set in the original five-year
plan, and does not reach the revised figure of 2,500 set in 1987. One reasons
that the enrollment may be lower than originally estimated is that ICDS centres
have been opened in many of the locations where DCC centres exist, creating
some competition.<p>
<p>
Of the 49 DCCs, only four still operate in prayer halls. And, since 1985, the
percentage of non-Ismailis
participating has increased from 16 percent to 41 percent. These results
surpass the targets of 36 upgraded or consolidated centres (centres outside
Jamatkhanas), and of 30% non-Ismailis participation set in the original 1986-1990
plan. The figures suggest that the principle of involving both Ismailis and non-Ismailis
in the programme has been taken seriously and pursued vigorously.<p>
<p>
<b>Quality</b><p>
<p>
At the outset, the DCC programme was essentially a "Day Care Programme", as its
name suggests. An early childhood education component was based on free play
and the provision of some materials, but was not guided by a particular
methodology and teachers had received little training. In 1982, an attempt was
made to upgrade quality by formulating and applying "performance objectives"
and by beginning systematic training of teachers. Objectives were set for the
health, nutrition and early education of the children and for the involvement
of parents and older siblings. Heavy emphasis was placed on the cognitive
development of children. Additional equipment and play materials were provided.
With these developments, the centres began to shift from being "day care
centres" to being "pre-school centres".<p>
An evaluation of the DCCs in 1985, (by NIPPCD), was very positive and it was
decided to expand the number of centres. However, quality was to be improved as
well, through changes in content, in training of teachers, and by strengthening
the supervisory process. Both 1983 and 1985 evaluations noted that the
nutrition and health component was weak, and efforts were made within the five-year
plan to bolster that component. CHETNA was contracted to help. In 1987, a
decision was made to shift to a more active curriculum, based on "projects". In
1988 and 1989, training in the new curriculum was provided by CHETNA. A new set
of activities to involve parents was projected. With these shifts, the DCCs
began to change from being "pre-school
centres" to becoming "integrated child development centres"<p>
<p>
But has the quality of the DCC programme improved as a result of these efforts?
Although lack of baseline data and a clear definition of what constitutes
quality do not allow a systematic and objective view of changes over time, it
is possible to examine the present quality of the service delivery, as
requested in the terms of reference. That will be done in three ways: first by
offering a very subjective assessment based on my own experience with a variety
of similar programmes; second, by looking at the quality of various inputs to
the programme (staff, buildings, materials and equipment, and the curriculum);
and third, by drawing on observations of the DCCs in operation, examining the
education, nutrition, health and parental education components.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>A Subjective Assessment</b></ul><p>
Quality is a relative concept.<p>
<p>
Comparing the DCCS with ICDS centres I have visited, I have no hesitation in
saying that the quality of DCC teachers, supervisors and plant and equipment in
higher, and that the organization of DCC centres to incorporate an educational
component into the centre is far superior.<p>
<p>
Comparing DCCS with private pre-school
centres I have visited that are run for the elite in New Delhi, the DCCs do not
have teachers trained at the same level, nor can they expect to have the same
kinds of expensive and abundant equipment and materials as the New Delhi
private pre-schools. However, the curriculum is as good in concept (and in the best DCCS,
probably in practice) as that of elite schools.<p>
<p>
Comparing the DCCs with similar programmes in similar settings throughout Asia,
Africa, and Latin America, they would more than hold their own, and some of the
DCCs would have to be classified as among the best of these centres I have been
privileged to visit. The worst of the DCC centres are no worse than the average
pre-school
centre elsewhere being run by a para-professional.<p>
<p>
<p><ul>
<b>	The quality of programme inputs</b></ul><p>
<p>
First, a general comment: looking across the DCC centres, one cannot help but
be struck by the huge differences in quality from one centre to another.
Leveling up these differences by bringing sub-standard
centres up to par is a major challenge.<p>
<p><ul>
<b><u>	Teachers</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
Quality in the DCC programme depends on the quality of the teacher more than on
any other element (except, perhaps, the quality of the children when they enter
the programme). Teacher quality is a product of the teacher's personal and
social characteristics, training and motivation.<p>
<p>
<b>Selection.</b> Personal and social characteristics of the teacher can only
be controlled through the selection process. Once selections are made, it is
difficult to make any fundamental change, although training and organisational
adjustments may help to compensate for deficiencies. For instance, a teacher
who is an outsider to the village and who does not relate well personally to
parents will have a difficult time carrying out at least part of her job. No
training can change her status in the village. Training in inter-personal
relations is unlikely to make much of an impact on villagers' perceptions of
that teacher. Therefore, selection is crucial.<p>
<p>
There is no reason to believe that the present group of teachers are better in
terms of the characteristics they bring to the job than pervious DCC teachers.
Indeed, there is some reason to think that the availability of good teachers
might have decreased somewhat because, following the drought, other jobs have
become available that compete with the teaching position. The appointment of
some younger teachers, with better educational levels, could be taken as an
improvement in quality, but that is not necessarily the case.<p>
	<b>Training.</b> A concerted effort has been made over the last two Years to
train teachers. Attention has been given to health and nutrition as well as to
introducing an active education curriculum. In addition, the strengthening of
the supervisory structure has allowed on-the-job
training for teachers. In this sense, the quality of the teaching input has
been improved (performance will be discussed below). Improvements have,
however, been eroded by an increase in teacher turnover.<p>
<p>
	<b>Motivation.</b> The service motivation that attracted some teachers to the
DCCs at the outset of the programme has declined as centres have shifted from
Ismaili centres to mixed centres and as more non-Ismaili
teachers have been selected. Monetary and non-monetary
incentives related to work satisfaction have become more important sources of
motivation. Recognizing this shift, the programme has, in my opinion, done a
good job of looking for new ways to keep teacher motivation high and,
therefore, to maintain and improve the quality of teacher performance.
These include the introduction of a standard pay scale with increments, the
strengthening of personal attention through a good supervisory system, offering
them possibility of promotion within the system, and instituting a teacher's
day award. In spite of these efforts, teacher turnover is running at about 20%,
and a feeling was expressed during the review that the salary received is not
commensurate with the workload. Additional ways must be found to rationalize
the workload, to adjust the salary schedule, and to provide additional non-monetary
incentives for teachers. If this is not done, teacher performance will suffer
and the turnover rate will continue to be high, affecting quality. Several
suggestions of ways to maintain and improve motivation are made in Section V of
this report.<p>
<p>
In brief, changing attitudes and conditions have required new actions in order
to maintain the quality of teacher inputs. While the quality of the system as a
whole has probably been maintained as a result of these actions, the quality of
particular centres has fluctuated with the coming and going of teachers.
Creative ways will be required in the future to strengthen both the abilities
and the motivation of teachers if the quality of DCCs is to be improved and
differences in quality are to be reduced.<p>
<p><ul>
<b><u>	Teacher Helpers (Masimas)</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
Provision of a training programme for Masimas represents a step forward,
recognizing the importance of the Masima's contribution to the quality of a
DCC.<p>
<p>
Although the role of the Masima was not examined specifically in this
evaluation, it became clear during the review that centres occasionally closed
because the Masima was not present, and that some Masimas carried a very heavy
workload and additional help was needed. In addition, the definition of the
Masimas role simply in terms of cooking and feeding needs to be re-examined;
she can provide a greater input into the quality of the centre than at
present.<p>
<p><ul>
<b><u>Supervisors</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
Perhaps the greatest improvement in the quality of the inputs to the DCC system
has been in the development of a supervisory structure, the selection of
supervisors from among teachers, and the provision of training for supervisors.
These accomplishments should not be underestimated. A recent review of
"successful" programmes in India concluded that success was directly related to
development of a good supervisory system (Heaver, 1988).<p>
<p>
The CHETNA evaluation had this to say about supervisors:<p>
<ul>
The supervisors have played a dynamic role in the programme. They have helped
in sustaining the teacher's interest and continuing CHETNA's training in the
field. There is a marked difference in the performance of the supervisors from
the time CHETNA team met them for the first time and at present. They have
grasped the teachers' training and the training given to them very well. They
have become more confident, clear about the goals of the DCC and goals of
supervision. They have been able to identify the weaknesses of their centres.
(CHETNA, p.22)<p></ul>
<p>
During the review, supervisors noted a number of concerns, beginning with the
salary level. As with the teachers, there is a feeling by supervisors that the
salary is not commensurate with the workload. If one compares the amount and
quality of the work-for-salary
of DCC supervisors with work-for-salary
of the ICDS supervisors (including their travel allowance), the DCC supervisors
seem to have a legitimate complaint.<p>
<p>
Other problems or needs mentioned by the supervisors included: the problem of
where to stay when visiting some centres, the lack of time required to do the
reporting and self-evaluations
requested, the lack of authority with respect to some matters (particularly
matters within the jurisdiction of the LMCs) that also makes it difficult for them to offer
solutions, a need for training focused on inter-personal
relationships, a need for exposure to other organisations (in addition to
CHETNA) that provide training assistance), and a need for additional
literature.<p>
<p>
Within financial limitations, all that can be done should be done to maintain
the motivation and dedication of the supervisors, to up-grade
their skills and to guard against turnover. If the supervisors continue to
improve and are highly motivated, the quality of the DCCs will continue to
improve.<p>
<p><ul>
<b><u>Premises</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
The facilities within which one must work have an influence on programme
quality. Although having fancy facilities does not indicate or guarantee
quality in a programme, poor facilities can make it difficult even for a good
teacher to do her job properly. Although I have always felt that facilities are
a secondary consideration, one could not help but be impressed by the concerns
related to facilities that were expressed during the review by teachers, LMCs,
and supervisors. Space limitations, or the need to share premises with another
group (at different times of day), for instance, can make it very difficult to
honor the particular method and curriculum teachers have been trained to use.
(There is no space for "corners" or the corners and posters must be put away
each day.) Changing locations can disrupt and drastically change how a centre
functions. Unsanitary or unsafe locations create major problems. In addition,
rents paid for poor locations represents money that simply disappears instead
of being applied toward construction or acquisition of a permanent location of better quality.<p>
<p>
For these reasons, an effort to help communities help themselves by building or
purchasing a permanent location should be encouraged. Several suggestions to
this effect are included in the final section.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b><u>Equipment and Materials</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
In general, AKES has been generous in its supply of equipment and teaching
materials. The DCC centres, when compared with similar centres elsewhere, seem
to be well equipped. However, as with premises, the provision of adequate toys
and materials does not guarantee programme quality. Indeed, it may inhibit
quality work by the teacher by cutting down on the need to be creative.
Although some comments on the need for additional play materials came out in
the evaluation, this was not a major concern. In some of the older centres,
toys and materials need to be replaced because of heavy use over a long time.
Locally-made
replacements are appropriate in some instances.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>The Quality of Programme Components and Activities</b><p>
    <p>
<b><u>	The Education Component</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
In general, a visitor to a DCC centre will find children actively engaged. Most
children seem to enjoy the DCC, and some even want to continue participating
after they have entered primary schooling. The extent to which this is so seems
to depend as much on the enthusiasm and creativity of the teacher as it does on
other considerations.<p>
<p>
Over the past two years, a change in methodology has been introduced into the
DCCs. During the review, it was difficult to determine whether this change has
been for the better, but responses from both teachers and supervisors exposed
to both methods would indicate that the change does mark an improvement. In
addition, responses to questions about what children like best and least
suggest that the children have accepted the new approach.<p>
<p>
Parental awareness of the change does not seem to be high but there is
apparently some feeling that the new method is not as good because it does not
put sufficient emphasis on the alphabet and on learning English.<p>
<p>
Visitors to the 12 centres selected for the review were asked to make
subjective assessments of several characteristics of the DCC environment and
process. For the most part, these were favorable (see Attachment B). Most
classrooms were characterized as attractive and well organized, with adequate
equipment and materials, and a teacher who encourages rather than orders
children and who allows children to ask questions. However, in about one-fourth
of the centres, these positive characteristics were not found. And, with
respect to some specific aspects of the new methodology (the proposed
organisation of "corners" in accordance with a particular project), failure to
meet standards was higher.<p>
<p>
An evaluation by CHETNA provides similarly hopeful conclusions, and also
identifies a number of centres and some specific areas where additional work is
needed. Although most teachers were found to make a plan, following the plan
and implementing the project method was more difficult.
This was particularly so in cases where teachers manage three age groups. The
evaluation indicates that teachers need to learn to identify easily available
resources from the environment that can be used in project implementation.
Also, the idea of field trips needs to be strengthened because a relatively low
percentage of teachers were using field trips. Further:<p><ul>
<p>
...though the teachers have tried to create a stimulating environment in their
centres (36 of 41), almost in 50% of the centres this environment does not
really help in stimulating children because:<p><ul>
i. The work areas are not well spaced for free mobility of children.<br>
ii. The teachers have not made efforts to encourage the children to use these
work areas.<br>
iii. The corners or work areas are arranged stereotypically throughout the year
so that the children lose interest. (CHETNA, p. 13)<p></ul></ul>
<p>
The need for additional work on the project method is reflected also in
teachers comments made in response to questions about what they like least to
do and about problems encountered.<p>
<p>
In brief, although the quality of the educational component of the programme
has been helped by attention to planning and by a new emphasis on an active
project method, additional reinforcement and motivation and practice, spiced
with more attention to creativity by the teacher, will be necessary to take
proper advantage of the method. The supervisors will have a major role in
making this happen, through on-the-job
training.<p>
<p><ul>
<b><u>The Nutrition Component</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
The nutrition component of the DCC programme seems to have improved over the
years. In general, feeding of the children is regular, the diet is relatively
nutritious, and the quantity is adequate. Malnutrition does not seem to be a
serious problem among DCC children (see results from the evaluation in
Attachment B). Whether this is because of the programme or because the general
economic situation of these children has improved is not clear.<p>
<p>
Again, however, the quality of the programme varies from place to place. CHETNA
indicated that the snacks given to children were sufficient in only two-thirds
of the centres and added the impression that the snacks do not really provide
one-third
of the daily requirements of calories
and protein that an ideal programme should provide.<p>
<p>
While there have been improvements in the ability of teaches to weight and use
the growth chart, supervisors comments, the CHETNA evaluation, expressions by
teachers of the need for further instruction, and the results of our survey all
suggest that continuing attention to learning how to weight and chart is
needed. Moreover, although the diagnostic ability which handling the growth
chart provides, seems to have improved, follow-up
nutritional counseling still needs emphasis.
"Teachers have to be guided in the method of giving nutritional counseling to
mothers." (CHETNA, p.19)<p>
Problems encountered initially with the shift to the use of CARE food seem to
have been taken care of, for the most part, by making policy adjustments to
cover cases in which food does not arrive or is spoiled, and by providing
recipes to make the food more attractive and varied.<p>
<p><ul>
<b><u>The Health Component</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
Children have relatively few major health problems. According to our
evaluation, medical check-ups,
immunization, and the administration of Vitamin A and deworming tablets, are
occurring as they should in most centres. Severe anemia is, apparently, very
rare. Although there is need for continuing attention to the personal hygiene
of children, most are clean when they come to the DCC. We found no children who
could be classified as "very dirty". (This overall picture is somewhat more
positive than that found in the CHETNA evaluation done several months ago.
Since then, a number of measures have been taken to improve the health
situation, including some additional training and provision of first aid kits
to all centres.)<p>
<p>
In spite of this relatively positive picture and the apparent improvement in
this component over time (see earlier evaluations), there are a number of
measures that can be taken to improve the health situations in centres that lag
and to improve attention in all centres. One of these is to pay greater
attention to environmental hygiene, and particularly to the lack of bathroom
facilities and to the bathroom habits of the participating children.
Improvements can be made also In the coordination with AKHS and public health
personnel, as well as in working with parents to improve the health environment
at home.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b><u>Parental Education and Participation</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
The quality of this programme component is not high; of all the programme
components, this is probably the weakest. The survey and discussion of results
brought out a long list of reasons why this seems to be so. These include:<p>
<p><ul>
 <li>Difficulties caused by the status of the teacher in the community (outsider,
too young)<br>
 <li>Time and a heavy work load.<br>
<li> Not knowing how to organize and carry out a meeting that will capture the
interest of parents.<br>
 <li>Lack of support from IMCs.<br>
 <li>Failure to see parental education and involvement as a central part of the
teacher's responsibility.<br>
 <li>Lack of proper orientation of parents before a centre is opened.<br>
 <li>Inappropriate scheduling of meetings.<br></ul>
<p>
It is my impression from the survey and from conversations that annual events
and occasional outings stimulate participation. Involvement in Vali meetings is
somewhat less successful. Participation by parents in the DCC, or even
observations of activities of the children, rarely occurs.<p>
<p>
Home visiting by teachers is not seen as an educational opportunity, rather it
seems to be carried out only when necessary to recruit new children, to inform
parents about a Vali meeting, or sometimes to inquire about absences or inform
parents about results of weighing or the medical check-up.<p>
<p>
A number of excellent suggestions were made for improving parental involvement.
These are included in the concluding section of the report.<p>
<p>
<b>Impact of the Programme</b><p>
<p>
The most challenging and difficult of the terms of reference given for this
evaluation is that requesting an assessment of programme impact and cost-

effectiveness.
Strictly speaking, it will not be possible to measure programme impact. To do
so would require baseline data that are
not available. It would also involve looking at a comparison group, something
that was not possible to do within the time available for the evaluation.
Nevertheless, it is possible to provide reasonably grounded opinions about the
programme's impact on children, parents, and the communities based on
observations of supervisors, parents, primary school teachers and others.<p>
<p>
Nor can the cost-effectiveness
of the programme be determined in a strict sense. That is because the measures
of effectiveness and impact are weak. However, costs can be assessed (see
Section III) and, when put together with judgments about effectiveness,
reasonable conclusions can be drawn.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>The Impact on Children</b><p>
    <p>
<b>	<u>Parental perceptions</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
Although no baseline data were available, we thought it would be possible to
get an idea of the programme impact on children by asking a sample of parents
whether they saw improvements in the child as a result of their participation
in the DCC. As explained in Attachment B, this question brought an almost
unanimous response of "yes" to questions about improvement in health, food
habits, mental and social development, and self-confidence.
(In some cases, a "no" answer was given, but because parents said the child was
already healthy or self-confident.)
This consistent response would seem to provide strong evidence that parents
think the programme has had an impact. The results must be qualified, however,
because not all parents were clear about what was
meant by the terms used, and there is a tendency to tell interviewers what one
thinks they want to hear. Nevertheless, we have one piece of evidence.<p>
<p>
Another attempt to get at programme impact was to be made by asking parents to
compare older siblings who had not participated in the DCC with younger
siblings who had. Unfortunately, this question was mangled in translation and
did not provide the intended comparison.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b><u>Primary school entrance, progress and performance</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
In several earlier evaluations, programme impact was inferred from anecdotal
evidence about children's primary school records. It was said that DCC children
were often placed ahead, in second grade, upon entering primary school, because
they were more prepared for school than
others. It was also common to quote principals or teachers as saying that DCC
children seem to be brighter and sometimes helped to teach other children.
Similar comments were made by supervisors at the outset of our evaluation
exercise.<p>
<p>
To try and obtain a more objective assessment of these claims, the evaluation
attempted a small pilot study -- following into the primary school 10 children from each of the 12 DCCs in the
sample, who were in the upper age group in 1987, into the primary school.
(Information about the methodology used, the problems encountered, and the
results are described in Attachment B.) It was possible to locate a high
percentage of the children.<p>
<p>
From the exercise we learned that none of the 1987 children followed had been
placed forward upon entrance. But we also came away with the distinct
impression that DCC children do better in primary school than non-DCC
children. This impression is based on (1) an unsystematic look at the marks
given to children in two primary schools (we did not expect to find marks
recorded because a system of automatic promotion is in effect and so had not
asked surveyors to look at marks), and on (2) responses to a question asking
primary school teachers whether or not the children were in the upper 20% of
the students. Although the DCC students were found to be disproportionately in
the upper 20%, we do not know whether that is because they come from favored
backgrounds or because they passed through the DCC.<p>
<p>
The encouraging part about these various hints at programme impact is that they
are generally consistent with each other. The only information that did not
stand up to expectations was the finding about forward placement. We discovered
that some children from the 1987 group were
indeed in advanced grades, but found that to be a matter of their age and of
simultaneous attendance in 1987 at the DCC and a primary school.<p>
<p>
In the final section, a recommendation is made for a more careful and
comparative examination of the school-going
behaviour of DCC graduates.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b><u>Health and Nutritional Status</u></b></ul><p>
<p>
As commented on above, the general nutritional and health status of the DCC
children is relatively good. Severe malnutrition seems to be absent and major
health problems occur but are not widespread. The present condition of the
children cannot be compared with past information, but the clear implication is
that improvements have occurred over time related to the presence of the
children in the DCCs. This is made more plausible by the fact that in many of
the places in which the DCCs function, there is no primary health care centre;
a main vehicle for preventive health care has been the DCC.<p>
<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>The Impact on Families</b></ul><p>
<p>
In the survey of parents, questions were asked about the educational and
occupational expectations for their children. In general, expectations were
high. There was a difference between the expectations for boys and girls, but
not as great as might have been expected. Because we have no baseline data with
which to compare, there is no way of saying whether these parents have raised
their expectations since enrolling children in the DCCs.<p>
<p>
From discussion with supervisors came a number of suggestions regarding the
cumulative effect of the DCC programme on parents and families. The following
statements were made that cannot be verified, but which would be interesting to
pursue:<p>
<ul>
 <li>Women are made more aware because of the DCC which has provided them with
reasons for coming out of the house. (Before one had to visit the home and
enroll children; now women come to the DCC.) They are more aware of the
importance of education, particularly for girls, and are more willing to
consider sending girls outside the village to study.<p>
<p>
 <li>Over time, there has been an improvement in the cleanliness of homes -- particularly kitchens.<p>
<p>
 <li>The child demands a greater variety of food at home, helping to change the
diet.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>Impact on Other Institutions</b></ul><p>
<p>
In several communities, Mahila Mandels have been formed in conjunction with the
DCCs.<p>
<p>
The DCCs put pressure on both the primary schools and the primary health system
to improve. There is no evidence regarding the effect of that pressure, but it
exists.<p>
<p>
The decision to include non-Ismailis
in the DCCs provides a space in which to work out issues regarding the
relationship between Ismailis and non-Ismailis.<p>
<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>In Sum</b></ul><p>
<p>
Clear evidence that the DCC programme has had a specific impact on children,
families, and other social institutions remains elusive. However, the
consistent observations of people who have watched the programme grow over
time, positive testimonials from a range of people at the community level, the
continuing participation of families in the programme, and the suggestive
evidence from the pilot follow-up
study of DCC graduates all point in the same direction. Taken together, they
provide a reasonable basis for concluding that the DCC programme has had an
impact and that continuing efforts to improve the programme should be pursued
with vigor.<p>
<center>
<b>SECTION III</b><p>
    <p>
<b>MANAGEMENT, ADMINISTRATION AND ORGANISATIONS</b></center>
Major advances have been made in the organisation and management of the DCC
programme over the last five year period and particularly in the last two
years. AKES can point with some pride to:<p>
<ul>
<li> A well staffed and functioning district office<br>
 <li>Evolution of the supervisory structure<br>
 <li>Creation of a Policy and Procedures Manual<br>
 <li>Improvements in the budgeting process<br>
 <li>A regularised and unified salary structure with increments<br>
 <li> Measures for expediting grant payments<br>
 <li> An agreement with CARE to provide food to DCCs and measures to cope with
difficulties caused by the shift<br>
 <li> The inclusion of a woman in IMCs<br>
 <li> Creation of a circular<br>
 <li> Improved communication with ARMS<br>
 <li> A revised and simplified check list for monitoring<p></ul>
<p>
These accomplishments should be recognised and kept in mind as problems are
discussed.<p>
<p>
The programme has been less successful in dealing with:<p>
<ul>
 <li> Regularising the functioning of LMCs<br>
 <li> Transfer of greater authority to the LMCs (although a start has been made)<br>
 <li> Expediting appointments<br>
 <li> Instituting a systematic procedure for assessing impact<br>
 <li> Solving the problem of premises<br>
 <li> The question of self-sufficiency<p></ul>
<b>Decentralisation</b><p>
<p>
The Rajkot office. With the transfer to a district office of some functions
formerly carried out by Bombay, a major step has been taken toward successful
decentralisation. Measures currently being taken, such as the relocation of
quarters, with space for meetings, should reinforce that process.<p>
<p>
I found the staff of the district office to be capable and knowledgeable. The
administrative problems that were reported were, for the most part, minor and
amenable to solution. These include occasional delays in grant payments
(sometimes because they have not received the funds themselves on time),
failing to respond in a timely fashion to correspondence, and failing to
provide letters acknowledging contributions made at the local level.<p>
<p>
As the office become more established, it should be possible for it to play a
more active role, developing budgets, helping to motivate LMCs, calling
regional meetings of political and religious leaders from the DCC communities
to strengthen their understanding and backing, and providing participating
communities with assistance in developing local plans for long term
financing.<p>
<b>Local Management Committee</b><p>
It is clear that the IMCs have played an important role in the success of DCCs.
Where the committees have taken a strong interest, development has gone well.
The committees have made considerable contributions in terms of fund raising
and the collection of fees, handling the procurement of food, dealing with the
problems of premises, and the payment of salaries. They have sometimes made
direct financial contributions and have helped to organise annual events.<p>
<p>
However, the dedication and force of management committees varies widely from
place to place. With the passage of time, there has been turnover in the
chairmen of LMCs. In a number of cases, the change has been from those who
helped to get the DCC going and took it as a personal project to newly
appointed individuals who are not as involved or dedicated. Ways must be found
too strengthen and support LMC members in their work (see suggestions in
Section IV).<p>
<p>
When IMC members were asked in the survey whether they thought they had
sufficient authority, almost all answered that they did. There was little
desire to take on more. Still, it seems possible, with a division of tasks, to
place additional responsibility with the LMC, in a continuing process of
decentralisation. "The more responsibility LMCs are given, the more they will
take."<p>
<p>
<b>Linkages</b><p>
<p>
As indicated above, strides have been made in developing links to between the
AKES and the AKHS. However, additional effort is needed. Linkages with other
parts of the AK structure are weaker and need to be strengthened.<p>
<p>
Supervisors commented on what at times to be competitive attitude among parts
of the AK structure, centering around a need to receive credit for successes.
This is a difficulty that needs attention at the highest levels of
coordination.<p>
<p>
Supervisors also commented on the need to make other institutions more aware of
DCC activities. These include the Gran Panchayat.<p>
<p>
The linkage to primary schools has, to date, been a one-way
affair. Apparently, primary school teachers are invited to DCC events, but the
reverse is not true.<p>
<b>Costs</b><p>
Per student operating costs for the period 1984 through 1988 have been
calculated and are presented in the document by Nirupa Bhangar titled
"Programmewise Review." These are respectively:<p><pre>

		1984	Rs 251		1987	Rs 459
		1985	Rs 173		1988	Rs 308
		1986	Rs 181<p>
<p></pre>
The calculations were made by adding together costs of supplies (mainly food),
support and administrative costs, salary costs and development costs (including
training), and then dividing by the number of children enrolled in the
programme. This basis seems to me to be adequate, but might be modified
slightly because training and development activities have an extended life, so
can be treated as a capital cost and spread out the cost three or more years.
This would reduce the per student figure for operating costs only slightly.<p>
<p>
The sizeable jump in costs in 1987 reflects an increase in efficiency, but also
results from postponing some 1988 activities until 1989.<p>
<p>
Translating the 1988 per student figure into US dollars (at a rate of 15 which
is about the exchange rate at the time), gives a per student figure of SUS
20.53 per year or SUS 1.71 per month. This figure compares very favorably with
a figure of $1.49 per month that has been calculated for the ICDS programme
(Berg, 1988). The quality of DCC programme is clearly much higher than that of
the ICDS programme and the benefits, although not quantifiable, can be presumed
to be higher as well. This suggests that the DCC programme is cost-effective
when compared to be ICDS.<p>
<p>
A calculation of per student costs was carried out for 1989. During that year,
the operating costs of the programme increased because salaries, development
costs, and training costs all increased. The comparative figures for 1988 and
1989 are as follows:<p><pre>
					       1988	       1989
					       (000)           (000)
	Supplies 			    Rs  144		270
	Support and Administration		110		230
	Staff costs				287		509
	Development costs			  6	 	 86
	Training				 60		141<p>
<p></pre>
If the 1989 total of Rs 1,236,000 is divided by 2200, the estimated number of
enrolled students, the operational cost per student for 1989 is Rs 562. This
is, however, an inflated figure.<p>
<p>
The following adjustments seem to be justified. An adjustment downward of the
salary figure by Rs 22,000 reflecting the fact that part of the time of Nirupa
Bhangar was devoted during 1989 to other programmes. An adjustment downward of
the development cost by Rs 21,000, by assuming a 5-year
life of the audio-visual
materials developed during 1989 and spreading the cost out over five years. a
reduction of Rs 47,000 from the training costs, assuming that these should be
spread over a three-year
period. When these adjustments are made, the per student cost decreases to Rs
479.<p>
This figure is still inflated in all likelihood because the figures used for
the calculation were estimated end-of
year expenditures rather than real expenditures. Judging from past experience,
several of the items projected at the actual budget level will come in under
budget (the actual cost of rent, for example). For illustrative purposes, let
us assume that another reduction of approximately 50 is justified. that would
bring the per student cost down to Rs 457.<p>
<p>
The figure that we have used includes an amount of Rs 125 that was not expended
by the AKES but represents the CARE contribution of food to the programme. If
this amount were subtracted out to estimate the per student operating cost for
AKES, the figure would be Rs 400 per student.<p>
<p>
The point of these various calculations is to establish an approximate range
within which we can say the per student operating costs for 1989 will fall.
This range is between Rs. 562 (Rs 47 per month), making no adjustments, and Rs
400 (Rs 33 per month), making all the adjustments listed, including the
adjustment for costs borne by CARE. Translating these figures into US dollars
(using a mid-year
exchange rate of about 16 rather that the year end rate), gives costs of $US 35
and $US 25, respectively. Taking the mid-point
of these two, we can estimate the per student cost for 1989 at about $US 30, or
$2.50 per student per month. That seems to be a reasonable estimate.<p>
<p>
Whether this is considered a high or low cost is in the eye of the beholder. I
do not have a figure for the Indian minimum wage at hand, but, taking one
dollar per day as the approximate minimum wage depending on the area of the
State), and figuring 25 working days in a month, the cost per student would be
roughly equivalent to one-tenth
of a minimum wage. That means if the DCC charged full fare, a laborer, under
the assumptions made, would have to spend one-tenth
of his/her total salary for pre-school,
an amount that seems unlikely. From this it follows, again assuming the rough
calculations made are more or less realistic, that some subsidy must be sought
for poorer families who would like their children to participate in the DCCs.
This leads us to the next topic, "financing and self-sufficiency."<p>
<p>
<b>Financing and Self-sufficiency</b><p>
<p>
It is estimated by the Bombay office that approximately 20% of the costs to
AKES of the DCC programme's operation are covered by fees. This corresponds
roughly to the calculation we have made above. The lowest per student cost
figure (which takes out the CARE contribution) is Rs 33
per month and 20% of that is between Rs 6 and 7. Fees run between Rs 5 and 10
per month.<p>
<p>
In the survey of parents, a generally positive response was given to a question
asking whether they would keep their children in the DCC if fees were raised.
That would mean, however, a considerable sacrifice, and is probably beyond the
means of many who now participate.<p>
<p>
The almost inescapable conclusion is that AKES will have to continue to
subsidize the DCC programme if it is to include children from economically
disadvantaged families; or that a way must be found to build a capital fund
that can make up the difference between the ability of individual families to
pay and the total costs. Suggestions for building such a fund are made in
Section V.<p>
Although it has been suggested that external donations might be captured to
cover the difference in costs, this is a short term solution -- unless the external resources are put into a capital fund.<p>
<p>
At present, two centres are self-sufficient.
a more careful study of what it means to be self-sufficient
needs to be carried out. In at least one of the cases, self-sufficiency
has meant a considerable sacrifice in quality.<p>
<center>
<b>SECTION IV</b><p>
<b>COACHING CLASSES (RPE), AND AK PRIMARY SCHOOLS</b><p></center>
    <p>
<b>Coaching classes</b><p>
<p>
Information about the functioning of coaching classes was gathered in two
villages -- Sangodhra and Chitravad -- from the RPE teachers, children in the classes, parents and IMC members. In
addition, classes were observed in action. Opinions were also gathered from
supervisors.<p>
<p>
In Sangodhra, the teacher was dealing with 12 children (of 23 enrolled, with
the rest scheduled for another hour). These children were divided into two
groups according to their primary school level. The instruction, dealing with
subtraction, was very effective and the children were engaged. A "roll-up"
chalk board was the main prop.<p>
<p>
We visited Chitravad on a Saturday morning. The RPE class was functioning with
two teachers and about 40 students (of the 50 enrolled), but on Saturdays, we
were told, the class is very informal. Children were outside, singing songs and
playing games as a group.  One game played was a kind of mathematics game. The
rest of the time, several children (the stars of the group) performed a
traditional song,  with actions, in the centre of the circle of children. It
was difficult to judge the ability of the teachers.<p>
<p>
The teachers thought the curriculum of the coaching classes was adequate. They
said that parents were generally cooperative (although fee payment was a
problem in some cases), and that the LMCs were supportive, but taking little
interest. Children attended regularly and seem to show progress, as determined
by their improving responses to questions and on tests. Primary school
teachers, they said, have a good opinion of the coaching programme, although in
Chitravad they were skeptical at the beginning.) In another village, not
visited, the coaching idea has apparently been adopted by primary school
teachers.<p>
<p>
When asked about problems, the Sangodhra teacher said she had no basic
problems, but the work with more than 20 children is demanding and she thought
another teacher was needed. Also, she said the pay was too low.<p>
<p>
The Chitravad teachers had a number of concerns. They are using the DCC
premises, but would like their own premises, where they could have cupboards
and files. They also wanted additional teaching aides -- particularly alphabet charts, story charts, and library books. The main
concern, however, was their responsibility for collecting fees. This has indeed
caused problems, as we heard from a parent who was upset because her child had
been sent home, without warning, when the fee was not paid promptly at the
beginning of the month. In Chitravad, we found that the teachers were also
holding classes on their own for 4th and 5th standard children, using DCC
premises in the afternoons. This has caused some friction with the DCC Masima
and the teachers.<p>
<p>
Children seemed to be enjoying the classes and expressed that when asked. They
also said the coaching was helping them in school. Parents also felt the
coaching was helping their children with school work and even suggested that
the coaching should be extended to the 4th and 5th
standards. One parent said English should be taught in the coaching classes.<p>
<p>
Because the RPE is to be a self-sufficient
programme, some children are being enrolled who have less need. On the other
hand, the fee is high enough that many children who would like to attend and
could profit from the classes, cannot afford to do so.<p>
<p>
When LMC members were asked whether they thought the RPE was a good idea, 17
out of 24 said "yes" and 15 of those 17 said the ZMC should be willing to take
responsibility (the two who did not think the LMC should take responsibility
were from Chitravad). Those who said "no" gave as reasons that there were too
few children in their village or pointed to the problem of fees.<p>
<p>
<b>Comment.</b> Although there are obviously problems to be sorted out, the
idea of holding coaching classes seems to be well accepted and to be helping
children in school. It seems unfortunate that the classes are divorced totally
from the primary school and do not seem to take into
account as a criterion help for those children who most need the help.<p>
<p>
<b>Primary Schools</b><p>
<p>
When LMC members were surveyed regarding their opinion about starting primary
schools, most (17 out of 23 who replied) said it was a good idea, 2 of whom
suggested that a joint primary school be started with a neighboring village
because there would not be enough children otherwise. However, when asked about
possible problems that might arise, the list was lengthy, including the
contracting of good teachers, the problem of competitive pay scales, creating
ill will with existing primary schools, premise problems, the need for a good
administrator, and possible problems with governmental permissions. The
probability of high fees and a related problem of obtaining sufficient
enrollments were mentioned along with the difficulty of self-sufficiency.
The clear impression was that it would be extremely difficult, and probably too
costly, to set up the primary schools.<p>
<p>
These reactions and others raise a question about the advisability of
establishing separate primary schools.<p>
<center>
<b>SECTION V</b><p>
<b>SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS</b><p></center>
    <p>
<b>Service Delivery</b><p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Teachers</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <b>Selection.</b> <i>Where possible, look for a mix when selecting teachers,
married with younger, Ismaili and non-Ismaili.</i><p>
<p>
This suggestion is made because the review revealed that whereas more mature,
older women seem to be better equipped to run Vali meetings, the younger,
unmarried girls are sometimes better accepted for home visits because they are
local girls. An Ismaili teacher is better equipped to deal with some problems
in the community, but a non-Ismaili
teacher can help to deal with and attract non-Ismaili
families to the DCC. Obviously, other features such as personality and
educational level and the ability to work with children will be as important or
more so than age or marital status or Ismaili/non-Ismaili
status; but recognizing that, a mix should be sought.<p>
<p>
2. <b>Increasing teacher contact with supervisor and peers.</b><i> Institute one-day
group meetings every three months, of each supervisor with her specific group
of teachers.</i><p>
<p>
This device would reinforce the sense of group, provide opportunities for group
discussion of common problems, allow the supervisor to draw on the special
talents and ideas of individual teachers in a peer-to-peer
way, and increase the contact of the supervisor with her charges without having
to increase the number of visits to individual centres.<p>
<p>
The venue for these "circle" meetings would depend on logistics. If centres are
relatively close, the venue might be rotated so that teachers have an
opportunity to see the conditions in which others are working. Or, the group
meetings might be held in the proposed &#147;model&#148; centres. Every attempt
should be made to avoid the necessity for teachers to stay over night, avoiding
that logistic problem where possible.<p>
<p>
3. <b>On-the-job Training.</b> The group meetings suggested above, together with the periodic
visits by supervisors and a yearly "refresher" training, should be seen as
constituting a system of on-the-job
training (rather than simply as a system of monitoring).<p>
<p>
<i>The training to occur in conjunction with the "circle" meetings should include the following steps:</i><p>
<p><ul>
<i>		(a) Each group of teachers would define areas in which they would like to
upgrade their skills with the help of the supervisor (and/or the specialists
who might be brought into a particular meeting of the group).</i><p>

<i>		(b) a topic would be discussed during a group meeting, supported by
materials (to be supplied by Bombay), and drawing out suggestions from the
teachers about how to handle possible problems. In the meeting, agreement would
be sought from the group regarding specific activities or methods to be tried
out upon return to their centres.</i><p>
<i>		(c) On each interim visit, the supervisor would discuss any problems the
teacher might have encountered in carrying out the task and would look for ways
of overcoming that problem.</i><p>
<i>		(d) The first part of the following group meeting would be devoted to a
group discussion of problems and solutions surrounding the particular topic,
before going on to the next theme (or continuing with the same one if that
seems called for).</i><p></ul>
<p>
A number of the topics for these sessions can be anticipated -- indeed, were suggested by the teachers during the interviews done as a part of
the review. For instance, it is clear that additional attention is desired and
needed in the area of planning, particularly in planning projects so that the
project method can work well. Material supporting a discussion of the project
method can be sought in advance.<p> In addition, it would be possible to introduce
an occasional theme where, in the supervisors judgments, that particular theme
needed to be treated -- even though the teachers did not choose the topic. For instance, if
difficulties continue with weighting, completing the growth chart, and
following up the results, a session might be assigned for that. Or, just before
the rainy season, the topic of diarrhoea (or another health topic linked to the
changing season) might be introduced, with discussions of oral rehydration
therapy.<p>
<p>
Over time, a set of pamphlets, one for each theme, could be built up -- either by creating pamphlets or by looking for existing materials that serve
(and translating them into Gujarati where that is necessary). For instance, the
Mobile Creches programme already has created a set of such pamphlets (Mina
Swaminathan) that could be reviewed for their relevance. And, UNICEF has a
wealth of materials that might be called upon in support of such on-the-job
training efforts. Indira Swaminathan's booklet (COPPC Manual) could be used for
several sessions. CHETNA material is also useful.<p>
<p>
Also, over time, the experiences with this system could be built into a
training guide, emphasizing more the process than a fixed syllabus.<p>
<p>
<i>Once teachers had participated in a certain number of refresher courses and
"circle" training sessions, and had successfully carried out agreed-upon
tasks in their workplace, they might be provided with a certificate -- say after two Years (or having participated in 6 sessions plus two refresher
courses). This certificate might entitle them to an increment in salary.</i><p>
<p>
<b>4. Rationalizing the workload.</b><p>
<p><ul>
		<i>(a) Assign specific duties to a "head teacher" (for instance, record
keeping, or organisation of Vali meetings). Provide a small amount of extra pay
to this teacher on the assumption that some duties will be carried out outside
regular hours.</i><p></ul>
<p>
This suggestion would not only help to rationalize the work load, but would
recognize that some tasks may have to be done outside regular hours, and create
an increment for teachers serving as an incentive for them to stay on the job
so that turnover might be reduced.<p>
<p><ul>
		<i>(b) Utilize local volunteers. An experiment might be tried in which
children are fed and supervised (or, better, played with), by community
volunteers during one morning each week (Saturday 1), freeing teachers to visit
homes, or to attend a circle meeting on that day. Where there is more than one
teacher, one teacher might stay to work with the community volunteers while the
others made their visits during one week, and another teacher stay in the
centre the next.</i><p></ul>
5. <b>Creating non-monetary
incentives.</b> <i>Provide an opportunity for teachers to gather together,
perhaps once a year, for awards and to demonstrate such skills as story-telling,
song, dance, toy-making,
with prizes for teachers judged best. This might be combined with refresher
training. The monthly circular could be used to publish suggestions from
teachers.</i><p>
<p>
Behind this suggestion are two ideas. First, people are more apt to work well
if they feel they are part of a group of people. Second, non-monetary
as well as monetary recognition is important to individuals in their work. Such
recognition may help to cut turnover and increase work satisfaction.<p>
<p>
6. <b>Monetary incentives.</b> <i>At a minimum, pay should be competitive with
the ICDS honorarium. The system of increments should be continued. The
possibility of introducing pay differentials related to differences in the cost
of living between urban and rural areas should be explored. The system of
yearly increments should be continued.</i><p>
<p>
Pay differentials might be set using as an adjustment figure, a certain
percentage of the differences in the labor wage. For instance, if the daily
labor rate is 10 Rs. in one area, but 15 in another, one might take, say, 40%
of the difference as the basis for adjusting the salary where costs are higher.
In this case, that would mean adjusting by a factor of 20% (15-10 = 5); 5/10 = 50% x 40% = 20%). That would mean that if a teacher was paid 250 rupees per month in the
area of the lower labor rate, the teacher in the areas of the higher labor rate
would be paid 250 + 50 =300 Rs.<p>
<p>
7. <b>Facilitating transition when turnover occurs.</b> <i>When turnover is
anticipated, a new appointment should be expedited, so that the new teacher is
hired before the old leaves, allowing some time of overlap. Periodically,
training sessions for new teachers will have to be organized.</i><p>
<p>
The system of periodic circle meetings should help to socialize new teachers
more quickly.<p>
<p>
8. <b>Relating to and involving parents.</b> <i>Additional training is needed
for teachers related to their interactions with parents -- both in Vali meetings and in home visits. </i>This might be taken up in
refresher courses or circle meetings.<p>
<p>
Given the positive responses by many parents in the review to the idea of
assisting with the DCC, ways should be explored for obtaining direct parent
participation in the DCCs regular activities, This can include help in the
classroom (as is done in Manpura through the Mahila Mandels) or with cooking,
or on outings. (See also suggestion 4.)<p>
<p>
Occasionally providing teachers with a set of brief questions that they should
ask parents would provide a reason for going to homes to talk and observe.
Teachers should also be trained to use a set of home visiting materials such as
the cartoon set developed in Indonesia. These materials are useful for
stimulating discussions in Vali or other group meetings as well as during home
visits.<p>
<p>
9. <b>Monitoring teacher's health.</b> <i>When they are hired, and at the time
children have a check-up,
teachers should have health check-ups
as well.</i><p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Masimas</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <b>Equipment.</b> <i>Efforts should be made to assure that the Masima has
adequate cooking utensils.</i> In several locations this did not seem to be the
case at the time of the review.<p>
<p>
2. <b>Monitoring Masima's health. </b><i>The Masima should have a health check-up
before she begins to work and at the time of the periodic check-ups
given to the children.</i><p>
<p>
3. <b>Help for the Masima.</b> <i>Other village women can be asked to help the
Masima on a rotating basis or to fill in when the Masima is not able to make
it.</i><p>
<p>
4. <b>Training.</b> <i>Training for the Masima should include some information
about interaction and play with children.</i> Included in that instruction
might be ways in which children can be actively involved in the feeding
process. Eating time can be a learning time. Children can assist with serving
the food and with washing utensils. Selected children might even be asked to
help in the preparation. As servings are dished out, a counting ritual might be
instituted, or a song might be sung.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Supervisors</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <b>Training.</b> <i>Provide supervisors with additional opportunities for
self-improvement.</i><p><ul>
<i>		(a) Respond to the request made by supervisors for training to help
develop interpersonal relations.</i> Training could have a heavy role-playing
component and could be carried out by AKES staff.<p>
<i>		(b) Provide supervisors with more general information about how a child
grows and develops, linking "theory" to their practical experience.</i> Use slide
presentations available from UNICEF about how a child learns to think,
etc.<p>
<i>		(c) Where there is a desire to learn English, that should be
encouraged.</i><p></ul>
<p>
 2. <b>Travel.</b> <i>Regularize the arrangements for supervisors to stay
overnight in villages so that it will not always be necessary to stay with the
teachers.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Establish circle meetings so that, once every three months the teachers will
come to the supervisor.</i><p>
<p>
3. <b>Reinforcing the training role of supervisors.</b> See Suggestion 3 for
teachers that sets out a process of on-the-job
training in which supervisors serve as trainers. Note also the suggestion that
materials be created or provided that the supervisors could use in this
process, mostly in pamphlet form and dealing with individual themes.<p>
4. <b>Advancement.</b> <i>Pursue the idea of hiring supervisors as AKES staff --

as additional decentralisation of AKES occurs.</i><p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Premises</b></ul><p>
<p>
 1. <b>Bathrooms.</b><i> Adequate bathroom facilities should be present on
premises.</i> An arrangement should be sought with AK Rural Development (or
whatever the most appropriate AK arm) to help with construction of proper
latrines where that can be done.<p>
<p>
 2. <b>Matching funds for construction.</b> <i>The AKES should consider
offering matching funds -- up to a certain level for the construction of permanent premises. Matching
funds could be collected locally or from outside sources. This process might be
linked to project savings in rental costs so that the first several months of
savings are put into a fund to be used for maintenance.</i><p>
<p>
Setting a limit on the amount of the matching funds available would discourage
villages from building an overly expensive building.<p>
<p>
If the building to be constructed is seen as a community centre, the amount of
matching funds might be raised somewhat (see following recommendation).<p>
<p>
The system of matching funds would encourage communities to declare the
contributions that can be drawn from the community rather than "hiding" them,
as is apparently done in some instances, for fear that help will not be
forthcoming from AKES if local assistance is identified.<p>
<p>
3. <b>A "Progress Centre".</b> <i>When permanent premises are considered that
should be done in the context of more general use by the village --
including a meeting hall and, perhaps, other facilities.</i> The idea of a
"Progress Centre", (rather than simply a DCC) is attractive, as has been
done in Sangodhra.<p>
<p>
Construction of a community building could be done in stages, with the DCC
being built first and other parts being added over time as funds become
available to complete the overall plan.<p>
<p>
Incorporating DCCs into a community centre should encourage parental and
community participation in the DCCs.<p>
<p>
4. <b>Cooking.</b> <i>Every effort should be made to remove the cooking process
and cooking materials from the classroom areas of the DCCs.</i> (This would, of
course, be made easier if permanent facilities could be located or built.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Improving the Quality of Programme Components</b><p>
<p>
1. <b>Education.</b><p><ul>
		(a) <b>Method.</b> <i>Additional work is needed with teachers on
understanding how to apply the activity approach, to plan projects, and to
arrange and use corners. Supervisors should take a leading role in this.</i><p>
		(b) <b>Toys and equipment.</b> <i>The mix of locally-made
and purchased toys and equipment still seems to be slanted too heavily toward
purchased items.</i> Indira Swaminathan's book (available from AKF(I)) and/or
Mina Swaminathan's book (available from UNICEF), or others showing how to make
toys, could provide the basis for a session on toys. This might be linked to
adult involvement (see below).<p>
<p>
     (c) <b>Teaching English.</b> <i>Teachers need to be reinforced in their
efforts not to teach English and/or to have children write letters of the
Alphabet.</i> This will require work by supervisors with parents and the
discovery of various ways in which the idea of postponing English learning can
be presented. (The ideas used by Malek when making a presentation to the
parents' meeting in Sangodhra should be written down and elaborated as part of
this process.)<p>
<p>
		(d)<b> Planning.</b> <i>The formal aspects of "planning" should be played
down in favour of greater stress on creativity.</i><p>
<p>
		(e) <b>Making books.</b> Older children can be helped to create their own
"books" using pictures cut from old magazines of combining 3 or 4 drawings that
illustrate a story the child has made up. The teacher can write a word or two
on each page. If this idea is of interest, further
information could be provided.<p>
<p>
		(f) <b>Numbers of children.</b> <i>Another look should be taken at the number
of children for whom each teacher is responsible.</i> (We found one teacher
with 47 children in the youngest age group in Chitravad.)<p>
<p>
		(g)<i> This set of recommendations should be read together with those of the
CHETNA evaluation.</i><p>
<p>
		(h) <i>See also suggestions for teachers at the outset of this section.</i><p></ul>
<p>
2. <b>Health and Nutrition</b><p>
<p><ul>
		(a) <b>Growth Monitoring.</b> <i>Continuing attention needs to be given to
improving the proficiency of weighting and recording weights on the growth
chart.</i> This procedure is still not carried out correctly in various
centres. In other centres, weighting is not done regularly
and/or cards are not available for the children.<p>
<p>
As a system of primary health care is introduced by AKHS in some locations, it
will be necessary to coordinate so that growth charts kept by health during the
period from birth to age 3 are passed on to the DCC.<p>
<p>
		(b) <b>Follow-

up
activities.</b> <i>Additional attention is needed to follow-

up
activities.</i> This might be facilitated by assuring that the local nurse
and/or MPW is present at the periodic medical check-

ups.
Filling out medical cards in Gujarati might also help (they are now filled out
in English and sometimes in jargon).<p>
<p>
		(c) <b>Health visits.</b> <i>Supervisors should make a point of trying to
visit the health centre or MPH every third visit.</i><p>
<p>
		(d) <b>Immunization.</b> <i>Immunization procedures should be re-

examined
to assure that only the children who need boosters receive them.</i><p>
<p>
		(e) <i>Consideration should be given to removing the responsibility for
administering deworming medicine from the teachers.</i><p>
<p>
		(f) <i>A proper study should be done of the level of anemia and coordination
should be arranged with AKHS to obtain folic acid tablets (available from the
government) for administration when and where needed.</i><p>
<p>
		(g)<i> Each child should be given an eye examination once a year. a simple
eye chart can be distributed to each centre.</i><p>
		(h) See also above suggestions concerning construction of latrines (under
Premises).<p></ul>
<p>
3. <b>Adult education and parental involvement</b><p>
<p><ul>
		(a) <i>Instruction should be provided in how to use the audio-

visual
materials that are now in preparation for use in Vali meetings.</i><p>
<p>
		(b) <i>AKHS personnel should be invited to give presentation to Vali meetings
from time to time.</i> These might be timed to occur just before the rainy season,
when the risk of various health problems increases, or could be focused on
particular problems of particular communities -

-

or both.<p>
<p>
		(c) <i>Teachers should help parents, through home visits and Vali meetings,
to recognize that they are the child's first "teacher" and that there are
simple things they can do at home to help the child learn, beginning at birth.</i>
Materials are needed in support of this effort.<p>
(d)<i> Parents should be encouraged to help out in the DCC.</i> (See above
comments and comments from the parent's responses during the review, Attachment
B.)<p></ul>
<p>
<b>Management and Administration</b><p>
    <p><ul>
<b>	Local Management Committees</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <i>Assign specific duties to each LMC member. Include assignment of duties
in the policy and procedures manual.</i><p>
<p>
2. <i>Give greater importance to the position of Secretary. Consider providing
a small honorarium to secretaries, charging them with the responsibility for
seeing that members get notified of meetings, that minutes are recorded, etc.
</i>The Secretary should be a person who is likely to stay in the position for
at least three years.<p>
<p>
3. <i>Include two women on the LMC.</i><p>
<p>
This seems to be important because the lone woman now serving on the committee
seems to be isolated; she needs moral support.<p>
<p>
4. <i>Empower the LMC to spend up to a certain amount each year (Rs. 500-

700?)
without first obtaining permission from outside, but with the obligation to
account for expenditures.</i><p>
<p>
5. <i>When a new committee is formed (or a new chairman selected) arrange an
orientation meeting involving outgoing members, incoming members, and, if
possible, a member from the Rajkot office.</i> That meeting should, among other
things, include going over the policy and procedures manual.<p>
<p>
6. <i>Include information in the manual about how to calculate the pre-child
amounts for food under different circumstances (when no CARE food, when CARE
food, when CARE food is available, but spoiled).</i><p>
<p>
7. <i>The amount on deposit locally upon which the LMC can draw to pay teachers
should be increased to at least two months so that delays in payments at the
local level will not occur as a result of delays at the district or higher
levels.</i><p>
<p>
8. <i>The fund-

raising
role of the LMC could be helped by creating a matching fund (see above) and by
giving responsibility for handling a small lean fund (see suggestions below
under "financing").</i><p>
<p><ul>
	<b>District Office</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <i>Additional effort is needed to assure that grant payments arrive on
time</i> (but see above suggestion for increasing the cushion available at the
local level).<p>
<p>
2. <i>The office should give greater attention to motivating LMCs</i>, for
instance, by responding promptly to correspondence, writing letters of
recognition and appreciation to local donors, and through occasional visits to
the field.<p>
<p>
3. <i>A meeting of Mukhis and/pr Mukhi-cameras
should be organized to inform and discuss the DCCs</i>. This should be done by
the District Office, but with support from Bombay.<p>
<p>
The reason for recommending this measure is that support for DCCs is still very
dependent on the support of these individuals. They need to give their firm
backing to the activities of the LMC and assure that good people will be
appointed.<p>
4. <i>Appointments need to be expedited.</i><p>
<p>
5. <i>The idea of additional District officers seems to be a good one to
pursue. In each office, attention should be given to the coordination of
programme efforts at the District level.</i><p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Bombay Office</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <i>More direct responsibility might be taken for training.</i><p>
<p>
2. <i>Additional efforts can be made to coordinate activities among the various
committees, with, for instance, joint circulars going to the field.</i><p>
<p><ul>
<b>Financing</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. <i>Establish matching funds to support the local construction of
premises.</i><p>
<p>
2. <i>Experiment with developing a capital fund.</i><p>
<p>
One way of doing this would be by AKES (or another) providing money for small
loans which, on repayment, would go into capital funds to be managed by the
LMC.<p>
<p>
After several years, interest from the capital fund could be used to supplement
fees, to support the basic operating costs of the centre, and, hopefully,
achieve self-

sufficiency.<p>
This method has been used successfully by the Christian Children's Fund in
similar villages of Northeast Thailand.<p>
<p><ul>
	<b>Linkages</b></ul><p>
<p>
1. Within the Aga Khan system<p>
<p><ul>
		(a) <i>Joint circulars involving AKHS and AKES and several points of
collaboration have been suggested above. In addition, it will be necessary, as
the integrated primary health care programme advances, to define more clearly
the roles of health personnel and of the DCC teacher, and to coordinate record
keeping.</i><p>
<p>
		(b) <i>An effort should be made through the women's programme, to establish
Mahila Mandels in the villages with DCCs, and to involve them in the DCCs.</i>
If MM's run income generating programmes, consideration might be given to
running the loan programme suggested above as a possible road to self-

sufficiency,
through the Mahila Mandels.<p>
<p>
		(c)<i> Forms of collaboration with the Social Welfare Board and the Rural
Development Programme should be explored.</i><p></ul>
<p>
 A committee on Child and Family Welfare should be formed in Bombay and should
meet regularly to effect programme coordination. a parallel committee might be
formed at the district level. Consideration should be given to forming one
village, or Child and Family Welfare committee at the local level in order to
foster integration at that level as well.<p>
<p>
2. With other organisations<p>
<p><ul>
		(a) <i>Make other institutions more aware of the DCCs by inviting (for
instance primary school teachers and Gran Panchayat members) to come and
observe, and by inviting them to DCC functions. Inform village leaders when
visitors come.</i><p>
<p>
		(b) Call on persons from specific fields (e.g. health) to participate in Vali
meetings when appropriate.<p>
<p>
		(c) <i>Explore further ways in which the DCCs and LCI)S might work together.</i>
For instance, training experiences might be shared.<p>
<p>
		(d) <i>Explore ways to work more closely with the primary schools.</i><p>
<p></ul>
 <b>Coaching Programmes</b><p>
<p>
1. <i>Additional effort might be put into improving coaching classes before
moving to establish alternative primary schools.</i><p>
<p>
2.<i> Link programmes more closely to progress/performance of children in
primary school, with special attention to children who are having
problems.</i><p>
<p>
3. <i>Unburden the coaching teachers from the need to collect fees.</i><p>
<p>
<b>Primary Schools</b><p>
<p>
<i>A very cautious approach should be taken toward establishing Aga Khan
primary schools.</i> Such schools would be even more difficult than DCCS to put
on a self-

sufficiency
basis and would create a continuing burden. Recruitment of good teachers would
be difficult. Competition with existing primary schools would be created. In
all probability, the primary schools would serve only those with the ability to
pay.<p>
<p>
<b>Research and Evaluation</b><p>
<p>
1. <i>To facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of the DCC programme, a
"Readiness Profile" (RP) for children who are age 5 should be developed.</i>
The profile would incorporate indicators of health and nutritional status, of
reading and writing readiness skills, of a child's self-

esteem
and of parental expectations. The profile could be administered each year to a
random sample of DCC children to see what improvements occur over time. In
addition, the RP could be administered to a sample of non-

DCC
children (probably in villages where no DCC exists, and to a sample of children
matched on social, cultural and economic criteria.)<p>
<p>
2. <i>A systematic follow-

up
study of children should be undertaken using the two samples defined above. The
study should include attention to performance in primary schools as well as to
progress through the system.</i><p>
<p>
3. <i>Questions about who cares for preschool children and about parental
beliefs about early learning should be included in the primary health care
survey to be carried out with AKHS funds.</i><p>

<p>
	<b>Selection of the DCC Sample.</b> The survey was limited to the 32 DCC centres in

classified according to the following variables:<p>
<p><ul>

participants in the evaluation (6 teams of 2 people each), it was decided to
choose a sample of 12 centres. That would provide variation and allow each team
to spend 2 days in each of 2 villages. a stratified random sample was chosen by
taking 3 centres from the 8 classified as of "a" quality, 5 of the 15 centres
classified as "B", 3 of the 8 centres classified as both of "C" quality and not
self-sufficient,
and 1 of the 2 self-sufficient
centres classified as "C". The resulting sample (see attached listing) included
2 of the 5 villages in which an RPE programme had been started, and provided a
mix of villages in terms of population site (with a slight bias toward smaller
villages), in levels of development, and in the age of the centre (with a
slight bias toward older centres). The centres were geographically dispersed,
and included one centre in the Kutch.<p>
<p>
	<b>Formulation of Questions.</b> Following a day of general discussions
focussing on problems of organisation, operation, and participation as
perceived by the supervisors, and on changes observed in DCC centres and
villages, a preliminary set of schedules was written out to guide collection of
data on children and from parents, teachers, and Local Management Committee
(LMC)  members. On the second day, the schedules were discussed. As each
question was translated into Gujarati, adjustments were made in wording as well
as in categories to be used for answers where that was  appropriate. The
adjusted results were then typed up. No back translation into English was done,
causing problems in three or four questions were the sense of the question
somehow got lost when the final Gujarati version was set.<p>
<p>
<b>Choosing a sample of children.</b> Given time constraints, it was decided to choose
only 6 children from each DCC -- 3 from among children ages two and one-half
to three and one-half,
and 3 from
children ages four and one-half
to five and one-half.
No children in the intermediate age group were included. To make the selection,
names of children in each see group were written on slips of paper. The papers
were folded, mixed up, and 3 names were drawn from each age set. If all three
children were the same sex, the last name drawn was put back and a new name
drawn until a member of the opposite sex was chosen. The total number of
children selected was 72. If enrollments are approximately equal between boys
and girls, the sample was biased toward girls, with 41 boys vs. 31 girls.<p>
<p>
Information was collected about the health, nutrition and attendance of the
selected children.<p>
<p>
	<b>A sample of parents and the home interview.</b> The sample of parents was derived
directly from the sample of children. When visiting the homes of these
children, the first choice for interview in the home was the mother. In most
cases mothers could be interviewed, often in the evening, however because they
worked in the fields during the day. When this was not possible the child's
caretaker (usually the grandmother of mother-in-law)
was interviewed. In summarizing results, no special treatment has been given to
sorting out the results by the source of information (although that could be
done).<p>
<p>
<b>Teacher interviews.</b> All teachers in the DCC were interviewed. Two
centres had 3 teachers; four had two teachers, and four had only one teacher,
making a total of 21 teachers.<p>
<p>
<b>Choosing LMC members.</b>   Two of the six LMC members were to be selected
for interview.     One of the two was to be either the Chairman or the
Secretary. Preference for the second interview was to be given to the female
member of the committee, but if that was not possible, any other member could
be interviewed.<p>
<p>
<b>Primary School follow-up.</b>
From the 1987 "graduates" of each DCC, 10 children were randomly selected.
These children could be expected to have entered primary school in 1987. In the
normal course of events, such students would be expected to appear as enrolled
in the third standard of primary school. However, evaluators were asked to rook
for records of students for Ist, 2nd, and 3rd standards (or more, if
necessary). Anticipating a certain level of migration among the graduates, it
was decided to choose additional names so that information would be available
for 10 students. The process would also provide a general idea of the degree of
migration.<p>
<p><ul>
    The following information was sought:<p>
<p><ul>
	1.	Whether migrated.<br>
	2.	The standard in which the DCC graduate was placed initially<br>
	3.	The actual standard in which the student was found at the time of the
survey.<br>
	4.	Attendance<br>
	5.	Teacher estimates of student performance (whether children were in the
upper 20% of their class and whether they had behaviour problems).<p></ul></ul>
<p>
<b>Analysis and Discussion</b><p>
<p>
Upon return from the field, the information gathered was brought together in a
group process which, although somewhat laborious, gave each team an idea of
answers obtained by others and allowed for some discussion of each question.<p>
<p>
	Again, given limits on time, it was not possible to tabulate responses to
every question, but, as will be evident from the summary sheets that follow,
most questions were tabulated. That task was facilitated in some cases because
the questions were not very discriminating. There was a tendency for those
interviewed to give "yes" or positive answers so the tabulation could be done
by simply asking for those who responded "no." Open-ended
questions were obviously much more time consuming.<p>
<p>
	No cross-tabulations
were done (except for parental expectations). Had there been more time, it
would have been interesting to sort the condition of the children and some of
the parental answers by gender and by comparing Ismailis and non-Ismailis.
(That would be possible for the Bombay office to do, if interested.)<p>
<p>
	It will be evident that many of the results need to be interpreted with
caution. The qualitative observations of the interviewers (and of the those
interviewed) often turned out to be more interesting and revealing than the
quantitative results. In the following pages, we present summaries of results
from the various questionnaires, qualitative observations will be included
where they seem particularly appropriate.<p>

<b>DCC CHILDREN: SUMMARY</b><p></center>
    <p>
<b>Comments on the information</b><p>
<p>
	There is a need to check the information obtained from records against current
measures and observations for each child. There was doubt, for instance, that
the growth chart provides an accurate basis for indicating the nutritional
status of children; some of the teachers are still not confident about the
weighing and recording process. Nevertheless, we used growth chart data as the
nutrition indicator for children in the 2 and 112 -
                                                                                                 

3 and 1/2 age group; an anemia check was used as the nutrition indicator for
older children. The anemia information was gathered by looking at eyes,
fingernails and palms of each child, and making a, judgement. This provides
only the roughest of indicators.<p>
<p>
<b>Information summary</b><p>
<p><ul>
	1. <b>Weight Gain.</b> Of 33 children for whom there was information, 21
(639.) had experienced at least one period during which there was no weight.
gain or there was a weight loss; 8 (2490) showed no gain, or loss for two or
more consecutive weighings.<p>
<p>
	2. <b>Nutrition Level.</b> When children were classified according to their
nutritional revel, 17 of 35 for whom there was information were
&#147;normal.&#148; 17 showed "mild" malnutrition, and one child was moderately
malnourished, This is a reasonably optimistic picture, even keeping in mind
possible bias from inaccurate record-
                                                                                                 
keeping
by some teachers. It would suggest that, although children have intermittent,
short-
                                                                                                 
run
problems leading to weight decline (or no rise), they tend
to recover from these.<p>
<p>
	3. <b>Anemia.</b> Using the rough observational indicators, no children in the
4 and 112 to 5 and 112 age group were classified as severely anemic and only 8
of 36 (259.) were judged to be moderately anemic. (See comments below under
"medical check-
                                                                                                 
up.")<p>
<p>
    4. <b>Immunisation.</b> We found no information for 8 children, 7 of whom
were concentrated in two centres. These 7 children had recently enrolled and so
did not yet have a medical card or a growth chart. Of the 64 children for whom
information was available, 7 (spread across 4 centres) had not been immunised
fully, apparently because they were recently enrolled. In general, immunisation
seems to occur. Indeed, sometimes it seems that all children in a centre are
given a DT booster shot whether they need it or not.<p>
<p>
5. <b>Vitamin A.</b> According to the records, 259, (18 of 72) children had not
been given a Vitamin a dosage. However, in one centre where none had been
administered (6 children), the problem seems to be one of record keeping
because the supervisor for that centre said she was present when administration
occurred. Another 6 cases were located in one centre, leaving only 6 others,
most of which seem to be related to new enrollments. In general, then, Vitamin
a seems to be given as it should be. The situation in two centres needs
clarification.<p>
<p>
    6. <b>Deworming.</b> According to records, 72% of the children had been
dewormed and in 8 of the 12 villages, all children had been dewormed. In one
village, failure to deworm was intentional because children had not received a
medical check-
                                                                                                 
up.

is required first because there are some conditions under which the deworming
tablets should not be given -

jaundice, for instance). ) In two villages no child had been given tablets, but
a reason was not provided or sought for this oversight.<p>
<p>
    7. <b>Medical Check-
                                                                                                 
up.</b>
In two of 12 centres, no medical check-

had been done in the last year. Another 5 children (in 4 different centres),
making 17 in all (24%), had not received check-                                                                         
ups.
Of the 55 who had been checked, 13 (24%) were identified as having problems
requiring follow-
                                                                                                 
up.
We did not make a complete listing of the problems, but they included a fairly
serious upper respiratory tract infection, skin disease, a congenital problem
involving a child's hand, an apparent case of mental slowness, and in one
centre, 5 cases of anemia. Where anemia had been diagnosed (and it is
interesting why this happened to appear in one centre and not in others),
children were apparently given folic acid tablets as follow-
                                                                                                 
up.
(The observational check in that centre during the survey resulted in
classifying two of the three children checked as moderately anemic, and one as
OK.)<p>
<p>
    8. <b>Cleanliness.</b> Observers were asked to rate, subjectively, each
child according to whether they appeared to be clean, unclean, or very dirty
(categorisation suggested by the supervisors). Of the 70 children rated, none
were judged to be very dirty, and 21 (30%) were judged unclean.<p>
<p>
    9. <b>Absences.</b> In the period from October thru December (Approximately
70 "school" days), almost half of the children had been absent for more than 5
days and, of these, half (one-
                                                                                                 
fourth
of the total) had been absent 11 days or more. This suggests that on any given
day, more than ten percent of the enrolled students might be expected to be
missing throughout the system. In four of the 12 centres, absence rates were
considerably higher, with 4, 5, or all 6 of the sampled children absent for 6
or more days during the period. In several centers, attendance was excellent.<p>

<b>DCC PARENTS: SUMMARY</b><p></center>
<b>Comments on the data collection</b><p>
<p>
	Visits to homes and discussions with parents may have been the most
interesting, useful, and revealing part of the survey. However, the information
collected in response to specific questions must be interpreted cautiously in
light of the tendency for parents to respond with answers they think
interviewers: want to hear. On some matters, parents were not informed or had
not thought about the particular question.  For Instance, parents were
generally unaware of what their children liked best or least about the DCC.
Nevertheless, the question was useful, setting parents to thinking and,
sometimes, resulting in questions to the children that were revealing. Nor had
parents thought much about whether the DCC had brought improvements in, for
instance, their child's health or mental development. The tendency was to
answer &#147;yes.&#148; The supervisors observed that mothers in nuclear
families and mothers who seemed to have a high self-esteem
(independent of education) were more likely to express themselves openly than
mothers in joint families (where the mother-in-law
factor sometimes came into play) or with low self esteem.<p>
<p>
<b>Information summary</b><p>
<p>
    The following summary presents results from selected questions only. There
was not time to analyze all questions.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 2. Has the DCC brought improvements in hearth, food habits, mental
development, social development, and self-confidence?</b>
The answers to this set of questions were highly favorable to the DCC
programme. If taken at face value, they would indicate a high level of impact
and programme success. Almost invariably, the answer to this set of questions
was &#147;yes.&#148; For instance, in 72 interviews, only 5 parents answered
"no" with respect to mental development. The supervisors felt this might be a
reasonably realistic representation of parental views. And that is probably the
case, but...<p>
<p>
	It is a bit difficult to interpret the meaning of these results. For instance,
it was not clear how parents defined the concepts used. As an example, mental
development seemed to be indexed by whether children did or said things at home
that repeated something they had learned in the DCC. It did not seem to
represent a perception of children being smarter, or of greater curiosity or
questioning or cleverness on the part of the children. Moreover, several
parents who said the DCC had not helped their children responded in that way
because they thought their children were already healthy or had self confidence
when they entered the DCC, or, they thought that social
interaction was simply not a problem ("All children play").<p>
<p>
	In short, this "measure" of perceived impact turned out to be very positive,
but not as strong as we would have liked it to be. <p>
<b>Question 3. Does the child
attend the DCC enthusiastically?</b> Of the 72 responses, only 5 said "no," and 3
of those were from one village. It was agreed, however, that these answers
needed to be checked against a more systematic observation of arrivals than
was
done. One supervisor had observed a child clinging to the mother and crying
when    the mother left her in the DCC. In general, however, observations   of
arrivals suggested that children do attend enthusiastically. Their enthusiasm
is tempered by the enthusiasm and actions of the teacher (in the village where
unenthusiastic attendance was reported, a child said that what he liked least
about the centre was to be slapped by the teacher).<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 4. What does the child like best about the DCC?</b> Many responses
were given to this open-ended
question, often as a result of the parent asking the child to answer. It is
encouraging that most of the 77 responses recorded were related to play, song,
dance, stories, or particular developmental activities such as cutting paper or
painting or "knowing new things. Writing was specifically mentioned by 7
respondents. The degree to which these responses reflect what the child likes
best vs. what the parent likes best is not clear, but what does emerge is
apparent satisfaction with the emphasis on play and developmental activities.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 5. What does the child like least about the DCC?</b> There were
less answers to this question (32) than to #4, but the answers given were
revealing. Nine of 32 said the child liked "writing" the least. Another named
"recognition of letters." Two children, when asked by their parents, said they
did not like to be hit. Two others did not like fighting. One did not like to
sit still. One did not like &#147;English&#148; (an English coaching element
had been incorporated into the programme in this DCC).<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 6. Illness during the last 3 months.</b> Almost no serious
illnesses appeared in the sample during the last three months. There were five
cases of fever, 2 of diarrhea, and one of malaria. One case was reported of
reaction to deworming tablets. These results, if accurate, suggest that the
general health condition of the DCC children is good.<p>
<p>
	<b>Questions 7 and 8 were not tabulated.</b> The interviewers had some
difficulty with responses in non-nuclear
families and in families where the mother works in the field. In these cases,
the mother was not necessarily the person with the most accurate knowledge
about what the child had eaten.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 9. Parental involvement in the DCC.</b> Answers to this set of
questions varied markedly from place to place. Overall, 61% of the parents had
participated in Vali meetings and 58% in Annual Events. In most villages, the
participation was somewhat higher, with the average brought down by the fact
that no Vali meetings had been called in two villages and no annual events had
been organised in two villages.<p>
<p>
	No mothers answered that they had provided direct assistance within the DCC
(although in Manpura, there is a system of assistance that operates through the
Mahila Mandel). However, when asked if they would be willing and able to help,
only 44% of the mothers responded "no." Of those who said "yes," some put
conditions ("if I have time,"; "if I am informed in advance"). In some villages,
the idea of helping with cooking was readily accepted. In one, for instance,
the DCC had been closed for 2 days because the Masima was unable to prepare the
food. It had not occurred to teachers (who were new) to request parents to fill
in, nor to parents to volunteer, but once the suggestion was made, volunteers
were available from among those interviewed.<p>
	<b>Question 10. Educational Aspirations.</b> In general, the educational
aspirations for children were high. More than three-fourths
of the parents (77%) expected their children to complete
higher secondary education and go on to college. Only 8 parents expected
children to end their education with primary school. It is worth noting that 7
of the 8 were girls.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 11.</b> Occupational expectations were also high, with 50% of
those responding indicating a professional or self-employed
business position for their child. Only 10 percent expected their children
to hold totally"unskilled" positions. (For girls, a distinction was made
between being a "housewife," which  was classified as unskilled or "0", and a
"home-maker
with community work," which was classified as B".<p>
<p>
	When cross-tabulations
were done, occupational expectations were found to vary with the sex of the
child and by level of the mother's education. 58% of the boys vs. 40% of the
girls were expected to hold a professional position. When this calculation was
done for children of mothers with 4 or less years of primary schooling, the
percentage was 63% for boys, but only 25% for girls, suggesting that with
higher education for mothers, the differential in expectations for girls and
boys is reduced. Only 5% of the boys vs 17% of the girls were assigned to an
unskilled occupation. As with educational expectations, the gender of the child
is significant.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 12. Has the teacher made a home visit?</b> Fifty percent of the
homes had been visited according to respondents. Supervisors, however, thought
the rate of non-visiting
is higher and at least two villages were identified in which "yes" answers to
the question seemed to be made up. In general, it can be said that home
visiting is infrequent and seems to be restricted (see teacher summary) to
cases where specific problems appear such as prolonged absence or sickness, or
to a visit to inform the parents of an up-coming
Vali meeting.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 13. If fees were raised would you continue to send your child?</b>
Almost all parents answered &#147;Yes&#148; to this question, some with
considerable reluctance, saying that to do so would involve considerable
sacrifice. It is difficult to interpret these results. No analysis was possible
by economic level of parents, and no attempt was made to push behind the
question. In general, however, the answer indicates that parents do appreciate
the DCCs.<p>
<p>
	<b>Questions 13 and 15.</b> The answers to these questions were not
tabulated.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 16.</b> This question proved to be somewhat confusing in the
translation.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 17. Is the management of the DCCs effective?</b> Most parents
answered &#147;yes&#148;but the level of awareness did not seem to be high.<p>
<p>
	<b>Are books and toys present in the home?</b> Answers to this question came
from informal observations of the surveyors. The answer was &#147;yes&#148; in
only 31 of the 72 homes. This must be qualified, however, by the fact that the
question was sometimes answered in terms of the purchased toys rather than the
home-made toys. It was observed that very few books were seen, and in the few
cases where books were present, they tended to be the textbooks of older
siblings. Only one doll was seen in all the visits. Generally toys seem to be
for outdoor play rather than indoor play; this seemed to account for the
absence in the home. This response does seem to point to an area that could be
worked on at Vali meetings and during home visits and it might be useful to
look more closely at the actual situation as a first steep to making
recommendations for action.<p>

<b>DCC TEACHERS: SUMMARY</b><p></center>
<p>
	<b>Question 1. Do you enjoy your work? What do you most and least
interesting?</b> All teachers claimed they were enjoying their work. They
varied in the things they found most interesting, with no one category standing
out. As might be expected, the least interesting parts of their work tended to
be organisational (grouping, the project method, making and following a lesson
plan) and administrative (record keeping, handling the growth chart and medical
card).<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 2. Are you able to accomplish your work?</b>Of the 21
teachers, only one answered "no", but 13 said they required extra
time to do what they had to do. The amount of extra time varied from about 4
hours each month to 2 hours per day.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 3. What are the main problems you encounter?</b> A long list of
"main problems" emerged from the questionnaire: These included
problems with:<p>
<p><ul>
 <li>Parents (insisting on English or math), lack of support.<br>
 <li>The LMC (uncooperative, cannot call a meeting)<br>
 <li>The village (cannot speak freely in Vali meeting)<br>
 <li>Children (do not arrive on time, new children are difficult, the numbers too
large)<br>
 <li>Management (salaries not paid on time, collecting fees)<p></ul>
<p>
	However, most problems were related to operation of the DCC and to teaching.
For instance:<p>
<p><ul>
 <li>Too many children to handle<br>
 <li>Reporting problems (growth card)<br>
 <li>Planning and organising (grouping lesson plans, arranging Vali programmes)<br>
 <li>Particular aspects of work (corners, creative activities)<br>
 <li>Hygiene<br>
 <li>Home visits<p></ul>
<p>
	<b>Question 4. Is the new or old curriculum better?</b> Perhaps the most
interesting part of the answer to this question is that only 8 of the 21
teachers interviewed had experienced both the old and the new curricula. This
is due mostly to turnover and only in small part to expansion. (Reasons given
for the turn over included: marriage last year when the Aga Khan visited;
salary not competitive.)<p>
<p>
	Of the 8 teachers who had experienced both curricula, all said the new
curriculum was better. One teacher said the villagers thought the older
curriculum was better, presumably because it allowed more attention to working
on alphabets.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 5. Were you satisfied with training?</b> Only 2 teachers expressed
dissatisfaction, and one of these was because she had had only one training and
thought that was not enough. Suggestions for additional training offered by the
teachers were varied.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 6. Do you receive support from the LMC?</b> Although almost all
teachers (18) said they did receive support, it was clear that this was not
always the case from other statements and from suggestions made about how to
improve matters. One teacher suggested that one or more parents should serve on
the LMC. More regular meetings of the LMC were desired. One teacher wanted the
LMC to collect fees.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 7. Do you receive support from the supervisors?</b> All teachers
said they received support, with 1 indicating this was so only when help was
requested. There were several suggestions for improving supervisor support:
come every month rather than every 2
months; stay for two days; provide guidance on health and on lesson
planning; demonstrate teaching methods by taking over the DCC when
comes; accompany on home visits; help to run Vali meetings.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 8. Do you receive support from AKHS?</b> All said "yes," however,
one centre had to hire a private doctor to make check-ups.
Suggestions made to improve the support included: providing health education to
parents and teachers, including a better understanding of the medical health
check-up;
asking the health board chairman and the local nurse (or MPW ) to be present;
at. the medical check-                                                                                                               
up
so that they could help with follow-up
activities.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 9. Do you make home visits? Do you feel well received and at
ease?</b> Only 3 teachers said they did not make home visits, and all claimed
that they were well received in homes and felt at case. (This question was
probably too general; a better question might have tried to distinguish the
cases where the reception is good from those in which it is not.)<p>
<p>
	<b>Why do you visit?</b> The main reasons given for visiting were nutrition- and health-related
(growth faltering, illness, cleanliness, to provide information about the
medical check-up
). Other reasons included: to collect fees, inform about Vali meetings, check
on irregular attendance, and see if DCC activities were being repeated at home.
Notable by its absence was the idea of parental education or consciousness
raising through home visits, particularly with respect to mental development of
the children.<p>
<p>
	<b>Do you feel comfortable at Vali meetings?</b> All but one of the teachers
who replied said "yes," but there was also considerable desire for supervisors
to help.<p>
<p>
	<b>How can work with parents be made more satisfying?</b> Suggestions included:<p>
<p><ul>
 <li>Form Mahila Mandels.<br>
 <li>The supervisors should help more<br>
 <li>Announce Bali meetings in advance/send note/hold at night<br>
 <li>Assure that LMC chairman present at all Vali meetings<br>
 <li>Before opening a new centre, devote time to informing and motivating members
of the community.<br>
 <li>Parents should visit DCCs during activities and assist<br>
 <li>Invite prestigious people to Vali meetings<br>
 <li>Help parents to make things for themselves<br>
 <li>Audio-visuals
would help<br>
 <li>Use a parent-to-parent
method<br>
 <li>Assure the Muki Camera's support<p></ul>
<p>
<p>
	Not included in the questionnaire were potential problems of teachers related
to Ismaili/non-Ismaili
status, being a woman, age, caste, or personal relationships.<p>

<b>LOCAL MANAGEMENT COMMITTEES: SUMMARY</b></center><p>
<p>
	<b>General comment.</b> Many of the "Yes/No" questions did not have much value
because there was a strong tendency to give a positive answer. However, when
LMC members were asked why they had answered as they did or were asked open-ended
questions, the answers were often revealing. Also, answers depended very much
on who was interviewed. a chairman might have very different views from the
secretary, for instance.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 1. Is the DCC Service adequate? What can be improved?</b> All
"yes," but suggestions for improvement showed this was not always the case. The
suggestions included: improvements in the location and quality of premises, in
medical follow-ups,
in administrative matters, in the kind and amount of training, in the amount of
food given, in the workload of teachers, in teacher selection, and in
equipment.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 2. How strong is your interest?</b> All but one evinced a strong
interest.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 3. Does the LMC have sufficient authority?</b> Only four
individuals thought the level was not sufficient. Two requested that LMCs be
given authority to spend up to 500-700
rupees per year without permission, but accounting for expenditures.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 4. What are the appropriate responsibilities of the LMC?</b> In
general, members saw themselves in a supportive role to the teacher, but there
were few specific suggestions mentioned checking the teacher's
performance; another, taking responsibility for annual events; another
mentioned food. The question brought out some comments on functioning of
committees. These included the need to be informed of meetings, to involve all
committee members in decisions, to hold meetings regularly and to improve
attendance at the meetings.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 5. What should the responsibility be of AKES?</b> The question
brought few answers, but did point to a need for timely responses and a regular
cash flow. Only one person mentioned giving more equipment. One member thought
building grants should be made by AKES.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 5b. Can the DCC become self-sufficient?</b>
Discounting the centre that was already self-sufficient,
only 3 LMC members thought self-sufficiency
was possible -- through community donations and increased support. The main reasons given for
not reaching self-sufficiency focussed on the poverty of the villages and the
inability to raise fees. To increase the degree of self-sufficiency it was
suggested that some economies might be made and that in some cases it
might be possible to obtain more donations of time and money.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 6. Are you satisfied with the premises?</b> 0f the 24 interviewed,
23 expressed dissatisfaction with premises. a variety of problems with premises
appeared, specific to each location.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 7. What suggestions do you have for increasing parental
involvement?</b> Suggestions included involving in field trips, making home
visits, arranging slide shows and Vali "camps," and general efforts to motivate
and counsel. One respondent said increased involvement of parents was not
desirable and could hinder more than help the DCCs.<p>
	<b>Question 8. Support from AKHS, SWB, and YSB?</b> All respondents
said they received support from these AK groups.<p>
<p>
	When asked whether it might be possible to combine local boards, most thought
that would be possible, but there were six detractors. The question should have
been phrased more specifically because it was not clear whether combining
committees would mean replacing old ones with one new board or would simply
mean choosing a representative from existing committees to participate in an
umbrella organisation.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 9. Are your relationships good with the Gran Panchayat</b> (all
answered "yes" ), <b>with ICDS</b> (four answered "no"), <b>primary health</b>
(all answered "yes") <b>and the government health unit</b> (not analyzed)?<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 10. Is the RPE (Coaching classes) a good idea?</b> 7 of 21
respondents (concentrated in 4 villages) did not think the RPE was a good idea.
They gave fee problems and the lack of sufficient children to merit the
programme as their reasons.   Among the 14 who thought RPE was a good idea, all
but one said the LMC would be willing to take local responsibility for the
programme.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 11. Is the creation of primary schools by AKES a good idea?</b>
Again, 7 LMC members said it would not be a good idea. Two said it would be
good to start a school in the neighboring community which this community could
use. Nine LMC members said they thought it was a good idea and the LMC should
take responsibility while one though it good but no responsibility should fall
to the LMC.<p>
<p>
	When asked what problems they might foresee in setting up an AKES primary
school, the responses seemed to indicate that the problems would be substantial
and tended to place in doubt some of the more positive answers to the initial
question. It was pointed out that it would be difficult to recruit local
teachers, to meet the pay scale for teachers that would be necessary to compete
with the governmental system, to get governmental permission, to get enough
enrollment if fees were charged at the level that would probably be necessary,
and to maintain the present good relationship with the government primary
schools.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 12. Have you read the Policy and Procedures Manual and is it
adequate?</b> Half of those interviewed said they had not read the manual and
others indicated they had read only parts. Of those who said they had read it,
all but two said they found it adequate with respect to matters concerning the
teacher, food, and finances. The suggested improvement was to add a section
showing how to calculate the food payment amounts under the most recent
arrangement.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 13. What contributions in money or kind has the LMC made during
the past year?</b> The purpose of this question was primarily to give the LMC a
chance to tell what it had done. The answers could not be quantified easily.
They also differed widely, and some, according to supervisors, were suspect. It
should be noted, however, that LMCs in some communities do make significant
financial contributions, particularly in conjunction with outings and annual
events. In some places, they help to subsidise those who cannot meet fees.<p>
<p>
	<b>Question 14. Is the organisation of the LMC appropriate, and if not what
suggestions do you have for improvement?</b> Almost all expressed satisfaction
with the organisation. One suggestion was made to include more than one woman
on the committee. Another pointed to the need for organised distribution of
work responsibilities (something that has recently been suggested, is being
followed in some places, but is not yet written into the procedures).<p>
<p>
	<b>General suggestions.</b> These were usually very specific to a location and
often focussed on a premise problem. There was some concern that grants arrive
too slowly. In several places it was noted that a separate place is needed for
cooking.<p>

<p><ul>
	1. The general conclusion of the supervisors, somewhat to their surprise, is
that carrying out a follow-up
study is feasible. This is, however, much easier far small villages which have
only one or two primary schools children attend than in peri-urban
or urban areas where the number of primary school possibilities is much
higher.<p>
<p>
	2. In some cases, the number of 1987 "graduates" was less than the 10 that
surveyors were asked to try and follow up.<p>
<p>
	3. The means of tracing the students varied from place to place. In several
villages it was possible to go directly to the primary school where records
were available for all children. In another case parents had be consulted in
order to know which primary schools were being attended. In another, where all
children were Ismaili, the teacher of religious studies was able to provide the
information. In yet another, going to nearby schools resulted in locating half
of the children, but time did not allow pursuing other avenues.<p>
<p>
	4. Although the common assumption before going to the field was that automatic
promotion had eliminated grading systems (exams and marks ), it was discovered
that quarterly evaluations are made in the first year and evaluations each six
months in the 2nd and 3rd years. It would, therefore, be possible to compare
the ratings of students. This was not done as part of the study.<p>
<p>
	5. School records seem to be thorough and up-to-date.<p></ul>
<p>
<b>Results</b><p>
<p><ul>
	1. Contrary to the belief that some DCC students are placed ahead a standard
when they Enter primary school, all children for whom records were located had
entered in the first standard (or, in a very few cases in which entrance was an
English medium school, entrance was at the kindergarten level).<p>
<p>
	2. However, some children were found to be in the 4th or 5th standard. In
these cases, the child was "ahead" only because, at time of leaving the DCC,
the child was overage and was attending both the DCC and the primary school.
This practice was allowed in 1987 but is now discouraged.<p>
<p>
	3. The amount of out migration differed considerably. In Manpura, it was
necessary to "replace" 5 students in the sample because 5 of the first 10 drawn
had migrated. a very rough estimate of the migration for the system as a whole
would be between 10 and 20 percent.<p>
<p>
	4. Prior to the exercise, it was assumed that the only repetition that would
be found would be in cases where students had fallen below the minimum number
of attendance days to be promoted. However, cases were found in at least 2
villages in which students were asked to repeat because of poor performance. In
order to do that, headmasters/teachers were required to obtain the signed
permission of the child's parents. In Sangodha, 3 students (of 11) had been
kept back in first standard; in Chritravad, 1 (of 10) was asked to repeat. It
is not clear how widespread this practice is. In other villages, cases of
repetition were few and seemed to be related to irregular attendance.<p>
<p>
	5. Based on the marks that were recorded in two villages and on the ratings
given by teachers in other schools, a moderately disproportionate percentage of
DCC graduates seem to fall in the upper 20%. a more detailed study of
performance in primary school by DCC graduates could be carried out, and
comparisons of DCC and non-DCC
children could be made, something that was not done in this pilot study.<p>
<p>
	6. Primary school attendance by DC C graduates was generally regular and did
not seem to be a large problem.<p></ul>

<b>Preface</b><p>
<p>
	This report was prepared at the request of the World Bank as part of a mission
to assist the Government of India and concerned state governments in preparing
two projects for support by the IDA. The purpose of the projects under
discussion is to strengthen and expand the Integrated Child Development Service
(ICDS) in Andra Pradesh, Bihar, Madaya Pradesh, Orissa, and Tamil Nadu. The
specific purpose of our consultancy was to assist in the design of a project
component intended to improve the quality, efficiency, and effectiveness of pre-school
education within ICDS. That charge was broadened, in conversations with ICDS
and the Bank, to include discussion of ways to strengthen the education,
socialization, and stimulation dimensions of early childhood development for
children under age 3, in conjunction with the health and nutrition education
being provided for caregivers.<p>
<p>
	We would like to thank the staff of the Women and Child Development Section of
the Ministry of Social Welfare for taking time at a particularly busy moment to
discuss issues, and for facilitating conversations with others in New Delhi and
in Orissa (see Annexure 2 reporting on a visit to Orissa by Landers). Our
conversations were held with individuals in the GOI and in technical support
institutions (the National Institute of Public Cooperation and Child
Development -- NIPCCD; the National Council of Educational Research and Training -- NCERT; the Indian Council for Child Welfare -- ICCW);
with independent Indian scholars and practioners; and with individuals in
international assistance organizations (UNICEF, CARE, the Aga Khan foundation).
Annexure 1 lists the institutions and individuals with when we spoke during our
visit.<p>
<p>
	The comments that follow are not only based on what we saw and heard during
this visit, but also during previous visits to India. We have drawn as well on
our reading of manuals and of a portion of the extensive literature that exists
dealing with ICDS and the non-formal
pre-school/child development component. We hope that the reflections offered will be
constructive and well-informed,
and that they will serve as a basis for further discussion as the process
proceeds, of arriving at a specific set of proposals.<p>

<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
<p>
	Within a holistic view of child development, the ICDS seeks to "lay the
foundation for proper psychological, physical, and social development of the
child". In addition to reducing mortality,<p>
morbidity, and malnutrition, it seeks also to reduce school dropouts. In this
report, we will emphasize two components of ICDS directed toward achieving
these goals:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	  Non-formal
education for children ages 3 to 8, helping to prepare children mentally and
socially for school and for a changing world.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Family and community education for child care and development, helping to
increase their ability to provide stimulating and educative experiences
responding to psychological and social as well as health and nutritional needs
of their children, from birth to age 6, but particularly in the period from 0
to 3.</ul>
	Giving greater attention to stimulation, socialization, and education of the
young child through these components within ICDS is essential because:<p>
<p>
<ol>	1. Early months and years of a child's life are critical in formation of
intelligence, personality, and social behaviour.<p>
<p>
	2. Stimulation and education activities will affect health and nutrition as
well as cognitive and social developnent. An active, alert, inquisitive,
secure, and communicative child will be<p>
healthier, better nourished, and more likely to survive than a passive, inert,
reticent, insecure and uncommunicative child. He or she will also be more
likely to succeed in school and life.<p>
<p>
	3. Interventions combining education/stimulation with health and nutrition
activities can more significantly affect the development of a child and
readiness for schooling than any one of
these interventions applied in isolation.<p>
	4. Strengthening caregiver education and the non-formal
pre-school
component can help to improve the situation of "the girl child," affecting both
parental attitudes and the girl child's
preparation for schooling.</ol>
	With these justifications in mind, we will set out some general principles
providing a guide to actions, present the issues and concerns most often
mentioned as obstacles to strengthening both the pre-school
and parental education components, and discuss specific actions that were
mentioned as ways of helping to overcome these obstacles.<p>
<p>
	Rather than try to report separately on each of our visits and conversations,
we will incorporate ideas gleaned from them within the discussion of various
issues and actions, as appropriate. This general organization will be followed
first for the non-formal
pre-school
component, then for caregiver education.<p>
<p>
<b><center>Non-Formal Preschool Education</center></b><br>
<p>
	As might be expected in a system as large and varied as the ICDS, the non-formal
preschool service for children ages 3 to 6 functions well in some centres, in a
perfunctory way in many others, and barely at all in still others. According to
a pilot study of ICDS social components carried out by NIPCCD (Sharma, 1987)*,
a relatively high proportion of Anganwadi Centres (AWC) are perceived first as
feeding centres, with little or no attention given to the
non-formal
pre-school
education component. In some places, therefore, the first task of ICDS is to
build in the preschool component; in others it will be to strengthen the
component.<p>
<p>
	The apparent neglect of pre-schooling
by some communities and the generally weak condition of the component occurs in
spite of conditions that, in theory, should support and strengthen it. For
example:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 Many innovative demonstration projects have been carried out showing how the
preschool component might be strengthened, and repeated attempts have been made
to incorporate (sometimes successfully) the fruits of this experimentation into
the administrative guidelines and manuals of ICDS.  (NIPCCD, August, 1988)<p>
<p>
	 <li>There is a relatively high level of agreement among professionals concerning
the obstacles to proper implementation and about the form the preschool
component should take.</ul>

Moreover:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 The organization of non-formal
preschool education occupies a prominent place and is detailed in the
description of  job responsibilities and tasks of an AWW found in the
pre-service job training syllabus INIPCCD, 1989, pp. 3-11).<p>
<p>
	 <li>In the syllabus, 83 of 432 hours are scheduled for preschool education (p.
15). This compares favorably, for instance, with 94 hours for nutrition and
health activities, including nutrition and health education.<p>
<p>
	 <li>The preschool responsibility confers prestige on the AWW, allowing her to be
seen within the community as a "teacher."<p>
<p>
	 <li>When the AWW is questioned about what aspect of their work  she likes best, the pre-school
component is often identified as the most satisfying.</ul>
	Against this background, the problem, as we see it, is not so much to to invent
new possible solutions (most have been tried out somewhere), or to establish
new principles, or to identify issues, bottlenecks and obstacles (most of which
are known). Rather, operational solutions must be found to facilitate the
continuing translation of existing principles and knowledge and experience into
action at the local level, and to motivate people sufficiently to
act vigorously at various levels of the system. Accordingly, even though we
will cite principles, discuss issues, and comment on specific actions below,
the main challenge is organizational and
motivational.<p>
<p>
*Adarsh Sharma, Monitoring Social Components of Integrated Child Development
Services: A Pilot Project, New Delhi, NIPCCD, 1987, This study covered a sample
of  blocks, including tribal, rural and urban blocks. In addition to drawing on
records and reports available at the AWC, information was obtained from census
data of the project areas, a household survey, interviews with ICDS
functionaries, representatives of local organizations and community members,
and actual observation of programme implementation using an Observation
Proforma, The study contains a wealth of information about how AWCs are
actually organized and function, about the perceptions and actions of the AWWs,
supervisors, and CDPOs, and about such matters of interest as the distribution
of AWW time, the frequency of visits, the perceptions of beneficiaries, etc. We
have found the study very useful in broadening our own understanding of
the preschool components of ICDS.<p>
<p>
<b>Principles: Some areas of relative agreement</b><p>
<p>
	From conversations held with Indian professionals and practioners, a
relatively high degree of consensus appears suggesting that:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> A more interactive, participatory approach should permeate the non-formal
preschool component of the ICDS system based on the principle of guided
learning through active experience (whether at the level of the child or in the
training of functionaries) in which individuals are helped to construct their
own knowledge.<p>
<p>
	To achieve this shift, most of the people consulted thought it would be
necessary to continue the move away from a highly structured and directive
curricula for children, and away from an over-emphasis
on learning letters and numbers, to greater emphasis on learning basic concepts
through discovery  and play. It would be necessary, also, to move away
lecturing functionaries in time-bounded
programmes of pre-service
training and refresher courses with few links to daily practice, to a system of
continuous training and learning on the job, guided by
supervisor/facilitators.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Promoting imagination and creativity is a key to improving quality. In pre-school
education programmes, imagination and creativity, together with mastery of some
general principles of working with children and knowing how to take advantage
of existing materials in the environment are more important than providing a
particular set of toys and materials or mastering a specific curriculum.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Improving quality is more a matter of using AWW time more effectively than of
extending hours to be used for education and socialization activities.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Motivating functionaries at all levels is as important  improving their
competency in particular skills.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Flexibility and decentralization are crucial. The vast differences in
geography and culture within India require flexibility and variety in structure
as well as content, so that generic programme principles can be adapted to
local circumstances. This suggests a need to decentralize actions as much as
possible.</ul>

<b>Some Issues and Concerns</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Training and Supervision</b><p>
<p>
	Wherever our conversations began, they seemed to wind up with a disussion of
training/supervision. Therefore, more of this report will be devoted to
training and supervision (which we feel are inseperable) than to other issues
raised during these conversations. To help structure the discussion, we will
pose, and comment on several questions.<p>
<p>
	<b>1.  Who is to be trained?</b><p>
<p>
	This may be the most important question of all. The selection of individuals
for training will influence both the organization and content of training, and
will have an effect on the
outcomes of training as well.<p>
<p>
	During our visit, we heard a range of opinions about the selection of AWW.
NIPCCD's study of social components concluded that married AWW between the ages
of 25 and 44 years were less likely to turn over (and therefore to use the
training they receive). However, the fact that many women in this age range
have very young children and additional household responsibilities makes it
difficult to recruit them. The study also identified a positive
relationship between educational level and worker performance, A more
subjective opinion was that the most successful AW are those who are creative
and musically-inclined
and empathetic, regardless of their level of education.<p>
<p>
	In some places, AWW from tribal areas are trained in special programmes rather
than in the regular centres using the regular syllabus. This is at least in
part because of the generally lower
level of formal education of the tribal girls, but it is also related to other
cultural differences. Tribal groups have particular beliefs and child rearing
practices as well as forms of community
organization that should be respected and built upon in the training and
implementation of the programme.<p>
<p>
	As one moves up the ladder in the ICDS hierarchy to supervisors and CDPOs, a
major consideration for trainers is whether or not these individuals are
promoted from within the ICDS system or whether they come from outside and so
have not had previous exposure
to ICDS. To the extent that they are promoted, they will bring with them the
cumulative benefits of both experience and previous training. This would make
it easier to link training and practice.<p>
<p>
	An important implication of the above is that it may be necessary to relax
some qualifications in order to select motivated, creative, and empathetic
individuals, and to build a "career line" within ICDS allowing advancement for
those who show ability on the
job (regardless, for instance, of their formal educational qualifications).<p>
<p>
	Another issue related to the question of who should be trained was related to
the recognized value of joint training (see below). The ANM and the local dai,
and the helper should have some knowledge of the pre-school
component. Additional thought needs to be given to both the content and the
logistics of training these supportive individuals in ways that would allow
them to be more supportive of the AWW. For the most part, that probably means
incorporating them
into selected in-service
training sessions.<p>
<p>
	<b>2.  Who will do the training?</b><p>
<p>
	The 300-plus
institutions now charged with training the AWW are known to vary widely in the
quality and content of the training provided. We encountered some
dissatisfaction with the present system, related in part to structural
problems. Trainers have little job security (contracts are for one year) and
lack incentives. To provide greater security and incentives, a variety
of suggestions were made including the extension of contracts to five years,
holding periodic meetings and workshops for trainers, constructing residential
accomodations, and selecting trainers from within the system.<p>
<p>
	There is a tendency to turn to academic specialists for training, assuming
that they know better how non-formal
pre-schools
should be organized and run. This is reflected in the current
procedures for pre-service
training in which specialists on a particular theme are often brought in to
lecture on that particular topic. It is reflected in a desire by some to
involve university
faculties of social welfare, child development, and education more prominently
in the training.<p>
<p>
	At the same time, we constantly heard the need to tie training more closely to
field experience and to make it more practical. To do that not only requires
changes in the content and organization of training; sore importantly, it
implies selection of trainers with practical ICDS field experience. It is
consistent with the idea that each training institution should also have
responsibility for overseeing the implementation of programmes in at least one
block. By so doing, trainers would be more in touch with the realities faced by
grassroots workers and supervisors.<p>
<p>
	The need to tie training to experience also reinforces the idea that
supervisors should be much more prominent in the training of AWWs .<p>
<p>
	<b>Supervisor as Trainer.</b> If supervisors are to be expected to do more of
the training than they have done in the past, a major effort will need to be
made to assist the supervisor in that role. A number of suggestions were made
with that in mind.<p>
<p>
<ul><li> First, the training of supervisors should be adjusted to include additional
attention to group organization and to such techniques as role playing,
eliciting exchanges of experience, and use of questions, in order to overcome
the natural tendency to train through lecturing.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Second, supervisors should be provided with a set of materials that would
facilitate discussion at the circle level as well as transmit information (see
below).<p>
<p>
	 <li>Third, a monthly training/discussion meeting of supervisors could be organized.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Fourth, a master supervisor's post should be created specifically to help
supervisors in their facilitating/training capacity.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Fifth, the AWW/supervisor role should be reduced so that contact with AWWs
can be more frequent and the training function more prominent. The present load
of 18 to 20 AWW per supervisor makes it difficult for a supervisor to make two
visits per month to each AWW, particularly when the AWW are scattered. At least
in some places (dispersed areas, new areas, areas where the pre-school
component has not yet taken hold, for instance), the ratio should be closer to
10 or 12 AWW per supervisor.</ul>
	CDPOs, At present, CDPOs are brought to Delhi for their initial orientation? A
question was raised as to whether their pre-service
as well as in-service
training might be at the state level, with a State Resource Centre taking
responsibility for the training. This was consistent with the idea that
training should be as close to the job as possible.<p>
<p>
	<b>3.  What should be the length, periodicity, and balance of pre-
and in-service training?</b><p>
<p>
	We encountered a range of opinions about the most appropriate length of pre-service
training. These differences were related to different ideas about how much
content a grassroots worker should be provided and could absorb in a first
sitting, to questions of the location of training away from home and the
corresponding need for time of adjustment (implying a longer stay) vs.
homesickness (implying a shorter stay), and to ideas about how in-service
training should occur.<p>
<p>
	Although it is possible to imagine reducing further the current 3-month
pre-service
training could be further reduced, if supported by a strong follow-on
system of in-service
training, the 3-month
period already represents a compromise from the original four months. This
compromise seems to have evolved over time as the result of a long process
involving system participants at all levels. It is necessary, therefore, to
demonstrate clearly that a shorter, or reorganized, pre-service
alternative can produce equivalent or better results. To do so requires
experimentation with a range of alternative training schemes on a scale that
has
not yet been done.<p>
<p>
	<b>"Sandwich" training.</b> The Working Group on Early Childhood Education and
Elementary Education has proposed experimentation with the "sandwich" principle
for pre-service
training of AWWs and supervisors, using various mixes. [For AWWs, for example,
a 1 month "orientation" (basic competencies and understanding) followed by 6
months of field placement accompanied by on-the-job
supervision, followed by 1 month of skills training (which could be at the
circle level using mobile extension training) based on field experience,
followed by another 2 months of field placement, with a final months training
to "sum up." This system would keep the three month period of training, but
distribute it over an 11-month period.]<p>
<p>
	Each state could set its own experimental system, to be tried out as part of
the project. Built into the experimentation should be a system for evaluating
results.<p>
<p>
	<b>In-service training.</b> In some of our conversations we found a tendency to equate
"refresher training" and "in-service
training." While it is true that refresher training occurs while a person is
"in service," such courses are, typically, not "on-the-job"
and they represent only one form of training while in service. Usually, ICDS
refresher courses, like the pre-service
courses, take workers away from their places of work to provide them with a
chance to learn something new and/or to go over old topics in light of their
experience on the job. It is our experience that most refresher training has
relatively little lasting effect, even though it does, in the short term, help
to motivate workers and provide them with something of value.<p>
<p>
	In our opinion, training on-the-job
that occurs through supervision and through periodic meetings at the local
level, and through forms of mobile training should have a much higher priority
than refresher courses away from the job.<p>
<p>
	On several occasions, we were told of the apparent success of mobile training
at the district level. These included experiences in Maharastra, in the USAID-assisted
programme, and in Orissa. This form of training can be equally useful for
helpers and AWW and other local workers such as the ANM. The model seems to
have some cost benefits as well. It can be supportive of training on-the-job
by supervisors.<p>
<p>
	<b>Training at the circle level.</b> We also heard considerable interest, both
inside the ICDS and in the technical institutions, in the idea of using the
monthly circle meetings as training opportunities in which a topic could be
discussed at each session, and time given also for discussion of the AWW's own
situation. These sessions could be backed by "booster" materials --
pamphlets and posters, for example -- or even by radio broadcasts. They could be organized in such a way that a
particular AWW or two took the lead each month in presenting the topic. Topics
might be chosen well in advance or might be selected each time for the
subsequent meeting, according to the needs of the AWWs. The sessions could
provide an opportunity for a trainer from the training institution to
participate. The location of the sessions could be rotated among AWCs.
Certificates could be given after participation in a certain number of circle-level
training meetings, as they are given for participation in a refresher course.<p>
<p>
	To a certain degree, block meetings, as well as circle meetings, could also be
used to provide training, rather than to serve simply as days to compile
statistics. The feasibility of this alternative depends in part on distances
involved and on transportation.<p>

<p>
	<b>4.  What training methods and content should be used?</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Method.</b> The revised Guidelines for Instructors for organising job
training of AWW suggests that, "Instructors must avoid use of the chalk and
talk method. Theory in all sessions must be kept to a bare minimum and should
be mainly in the way of introducing the
topic and giving basic information." (p. 7) Further, "The method of training to
be used has been indicated wherever possible by using words like: discuss with,
elicit from, trainees perception of, role play, conduct meeting, arrange a
display, etc." (p. 8)<p>
<p>
	Both the guidelines and the syllabus for the AWW are filled with suggestions
for specific activities and games. Several sessions are devoted to preparation
of aids and play materials - for physical, cognitive, language, and social-emotional
development. Play is given an important place in the curriculum and time is
alloted in the training programme for field applications.<p>
<p>
	In brief, the officially published training materials suggest a holistic,
active approach, very much in line with the general principle suggested above.
The challenge is to select and train trainers who will in fact follow that
approach. That puts considerable pressure on the importance of the training of
trainers and of breaking the lecture habit. Even more, the challenge is to
link the field work to the particular situation faced by the AWW once she
returns to her village and centre. That can only be done through strong follow-up
of pre-service
activities in training on-the-job.<p>
<p>
	<b>Content.</b> In the last few years, several ideas have been promoted in
India to improve the non-formal
pre-school
curriculum of ICDS and the activities of AWW. Two particularly prominent
approaches have been the "Cognitively Oriented" approach of Indira Swaminathan
and the "Thematic" approach originating in Kerala. These two approaches both
have merit and are complementary to each other. Either one can serve as a
starting point for activities. The current attempts to combine these two should
be encouraged.<p>
<p>
	To the extent possible, the content of the training should be adjusted to
local customs and should incorporate songs, games, stories, riddles, etc. that
are local. Both the syllabus for job
training and the guidelines for trainers make some provision for this. Here,
the most important challenge may be to link the songs and games to principles
of child development<p>
<p>
	(This topic will be picked up again under the discussion of materials.)<p>
<p>
<b>Materials/Resources</b><p>
<p>
	Materials for use in the pre-school.
The following description comes from the NIPCCD study examining social
components of ICDS:<p>
<p>
<ul>	"The investigators observations on availability of teaching aids and play
material at the AW revealed that such a provision was there only in 45 percent
AWs of thesample. However, the material was adeguate only in 33 percent AWs,
i.e., enough for the number of children enrolled or present. Further the aids
and play material were appropriate only in 42 percent AWs, the articles in most
cases were made out of waste/indigenous material  devoid of durability and thus
unable to withstand any handling. As a result, these were kept as show pieces,
either locked in cupboards or far away from the reach  the children. In some
instances, attractive blocks and toys were provided to the AWs, the workers
were hesitant in letting children use these to prevent loss and damage and
avoid problems at the time or stock checking."<p>
<p>
	"Faded charts of birds, animals,...adorned the walls In most cases these were
stuck far above the eye level children, thus failing to even provide any visual
stimulation...The drab, dull and unstimulating surroundings could only be
attributed to the workers limited inability to be imaginative and creative;
possibly  the training provides limited experience in preparation of
appropriate material. The kit items made during the job training get exhausted
and are not substituted." (p. 57)<p>
<p>
	"Interestingly, most of the AWs (78%) had printers, blackboards, charts and
books. Their daily routine included teaching of numbers through rote method.
The AW was thus turned into a primary school, the concept of non-formal
preschool education was obviously not followed..." (p. 58)</ul>
	This assessment conforms with our own observations, with case study materials,
and with repeated comments of others with whom we have talked. It is consistent
with the comments made by AWW trainees from tribal areas in Orissa (see
annexure 2) who identified as problems the absence of toys and child learning
materials, and the inadequate training in the use of existing materials.<p>
<p>
	We see, then, at least three problems: the presence or absence of materials,
their quality and durability (and/or ease of replacement), and attitudes about
their use. Of these three, the
last is probably the most important.<p>
<p>
	With imagination, no pre-school
should lack materials that can be used for play and learning. These may be of
virtually no cost, or of very low cost, and as simple as the use of pebbles or
bottle caps for sorting and counting. Bottle caps can be made into musical
instruments. These materials are durable, and can be replaced. Usually, enough
can be found for all children to use. Or, as in the case of the simple
"cognitive kit" of the COPCC programme, they say include a home-made
doll, a rope, a stethoscope made out of a small piece of rope and a bead, etc.
A home-made
doll can be made from any of many local materials and need not be very fancy.
It too can be replaced with relative ease. (For other ideas about the use of low-cost
materials to make toys, and more importantly, for many play activities that
require no materials at all, see Mina Swaminathan, UNICEF, 1986.)<p>
<p>
	In their training, AWW are asked to make some materials and aids. These are
usually not very durable (e.g., a paper puppet), but they are easy to replace.
However, the idea that these can, and should, be replaced when they wear out or
that there are alternative materials that night be used, does not seem to be
internalized. Rather, there still seems to be an idea that materials should be
provided, not made.<p>
<p>
	The making and use of toys and teaching aids is an area in which the
supervisor could be of great help to AWW, and AWW could be encouraged to share
their ideas with each other. It is a topic that could be discussed regularly at
circle meetings, or to which one or more meetings might be devoted, to
gathering ideas from the group as well as from outside sources. In addition,
the community could be called on to help provide materials.<p>
<p>
	The above comments must be moderated to recognize the intense levels of
poverty that characterize some of the AWW environments, in which there are few
"waste" materials to be appropriated for the school. Both the conditions of
poverty and the prestige attached to colorful, pre-made
toys may justify purchase and supply of some such toys to AWCs.(1.) However,
these cannot be expensive, and it must be made clear that such toys are for
use, not decoration, and that other toys and materials from the environment can
be equally effective.<p>
<p>
	A host of other materials and aids exist. These include the Centre for Media
Learning materials developed by NCERT, among which is a science kit for
children 3 to 6, and the learning kit developed by the Centre for Learning
Resources in Pune. In Orissa, the SCERT has developed and field tested
materials, adapted to the local context (see comments in Annexure 2).<p>
<p>
	If it has not already been done, a useful task would be to review existing
play materials and to put the results of the review in a form that would help
each state to make choices about the
materials to subsidize. Several years ago, the Centre for Media Learning made
such a review for Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Manipur, Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh and
Maharasta, and published manuals for each state giving details of local
availability and suggestions about how to use the materials in a centre. These
publications are now out of stock (and probably out of date in some 
respects). It might be worthwhile to update and revise these publications as a
starting point for a larger effort. The materials reviewed could be brought
together in one place and/or, an attempt could be made tosee that one set was
available in each State Resource Centre.<p>
<p>
	While giving some attention to the production and distribution of pre-made
toys and materials, our own bias would be to put greater effort into promoting
the local construction of play materials by AWWs and community members. With
some supervision and quality
control, this could develop into an income-generating
activity for certain villagers. Accordingly, the first investment would be in
providing trainees with the few basic materials they eight need to
create a "starter set" as part of their own training (see Annexure IV of the
Eighth Plan Working Group for an example of what might be done for Rs.300.)<p>
<p>
	With the exception of the materials reviewed in Orissa, we were not able to
give much attention to printed materials for children during our short visit.
But we would endorse the need, present in the Eight Plan working Group
recommendations, for a review of existing materials, undertaken in
collaboration with publishers, and the need for production of children's
literature at the pre-school
level and in regional languages on a larger scale.<p>
<p>
	<b>Training materials.</b> It Is our impression that a wide variety of printed
and visual aid materials exist to support the training process. These have been
produced by NCERT, NIPCCD, and others. In general, however, these seem to be
directed toward pre-service
training rather than focussing on in-service
training by supervisors and at the circle level. There is also a continuing
need for adaptation to local ideas and circumstances. For instance, we found
that even though the SCERT in Orissa has carried out excellent work in this
regard, adapatation to needs of tribal areas was still required.<p>
<p>
	Consistent with the idea of strengthening in-service,
on-the-job
training, greater attention should be given to developing materials for use by
supervisors in circle meetings. One such set of
pamphlets has already been developed for use in the Mobile Creche programme and
these might be examined for their relevance on a larger scale. However, in-service
materials should, for the most part, be created at the State or District level
in order to facilitate adjustment to local circumstances and to the expressed
needs of particular groups of trainees.<p>
<p>
	An excellent video has been prepared by NIPCCD that includes information about
making and using materials, but as part of a more general presentation of
various kinds of activities that AWW might carry out with children in their
centres. This, and similar training materials, should be distributed to all
training centres and an effort should be made to be sure that all have the
equipment necessary to use such materials.
                             <p>
<p>
	<b>The AWW Guidebook.</b> Although the AWW training Syllabus gives a
proportionate treatment to the non-formal
pre-school
component of ICDS, the Guidebook (1986 version) does not. Nutrition and health
are given 107 pages in the Guidebook and the section on record
keeping and reporting fills 68 pages, while pre-school
is handled in 16 pages.. Although a great deal is packed into the 16 pages, the
pre-school
suggestions and activities do not have the same level of specificity as the
health and nutritional activities. There is nosection, for instance, indicating
how activities might be organizedaround a theme. There is nothing about the use
of children's names. Whereas four pages are given over to pictures of examples
from various food groups, there are no diagrams of how space night be set up to
encourage play and guided activities in a non-formal
pre-school programme. The importance of play is not made as clear in
the Guidebook as in the revised training syllabus.<p>
<p>
	<b>An Activities Guide.</b> In press is an Activities Guide that may be useful
as a supplement to the AWW Guidebook. This resource, which has been produced by
Amita Verma, with funding from UNICEF, sets out activities in five
categories:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 Information (about the natural and physical environment, self and family, and
animals) <p>
<p>
	 <li>Problem solving (related to immediate and long-term
memory, to similarities and differences, and the concept of part-whole
<p>
<p>
	 <li>Language development (Listening, speaking, understanding, creative self-expression,
verbal fluency)<p>
<p>
	 <li>Visual and auditory discrimination<p>
<p>
	 <li>Cognitive development (concepts such as shape, size, sound, colour, number,
weight, texture, direction, time, living and non-living)</ul>
<p>
1. During our visit we were shown part of a particular set of toys made in
Madaya Pradesh by a non-governmental
organization. It was difficult to judge the value of the set because not all
pieces were present and we did not have information about the paint used, and
the cost of different combinations, or about the quality control (we saw part
of one set only). At first glance, the set appeared to be of moderate quality
and reasonably durable. Some pieces seemed more more appropriate for children
below age 3. The cost is relatively high if compared with such alternatives as
the cognitive kit of COPCC, but only a little higher than the set suggested in
the Annexure I of the Eighth Plan working group. (However, the materials in the
Eighth Plan listing are more varied.)<p>
<p>
<b>Time Allocation</b><p>
<p>
	The job responsibilities of the AWW have been classified into 4 main
categories: preparatory work, service delivery (including non-formal
preschool activities and health and nutrition activities), community contact
and education, and management and administration. In carrying out these
responsibilities, the AWW can draw on the assistance of a helper, can cooperate
with other individuals such as the dai and the ANM, and can call upon
organizations such as the Mahila Mandels. We will focus here on the pre-school
component, recognizing the need to balance this time with that required for
other duties and the sharing of those duties with
helpers, ANMs, etc.<p>
<p>
	According to the social monitoring study carried out by NIPCCD, the way in
which AWW divide their time among these responsibilities varies significantly
from place to place. For instance, in one tribal block in Rajasthan, 8 of 15 AWW reported spending only 3 to 5 hours per
week on preschool activities, with the remaining 7 blocks, preschool time was
between 6 and 10 hours per week. By way of contrast, in another Rajasthani
tribal block, 13 of 15 AWWs reported spending between 11 and 15 hours per week
on pre-school
activities. (The distribution of time spent on feeding was virtually the same
for these two blocks, with most spending between 6 and 10 hours per week.)
According to the study, however, spending 11 to 15 hours per week on preschool
activities did not necessarily mean that the activities were being carried out
more effectively. In some cases, then, the challenge is to make effective use
of the time already being devoted to the pre-school
component; in others, the challenge is to increase pre-school
time as well as to use that time effectively.<p>
<p>
	It is difficult to say, with any degree of confidence, that a certain fixed
number of hours each week is the "minimum" that should be spent on non-formal
pre-school
activities. The minimum time allocation will depend on: local goals, the
characteristics of the children involved, the ratio of adults to children in
the preschool, and the effectiveness of time use. In our opinion, however, if
time is well used, approximately eight hours a week spent by the AWW on child
development activities for children ages 3 to 5 in the Anganwadi should be
sufficient to make a significant difference in most children's abilities to
create and cope and master pre-literacy
and numeracy concepts and skills that will be needed for school.<p>
<p>
	Accepting this rough figure of 8 hours as reasonable, implies that an AWW
could devote 2 hours each morning during 4 mornings a week to pre-school
activities. This arrangement would leave the AWW time during two mornings and
during the afternoons for liaison with local officials and health personal, for
home visiting, for group meetings, and for growth monitoring. The AW helper, in
combination with adolescent girls and/or volunteer community members could be
responsible for the two mornings when the AWW is not present at the AWC. with
some training for the helper in organizing play for the children, activities to
complement feeding could be implemented.<p>
<p>
	By asking explicit that the AWW is to spend two mornings a week in the
community, working with families and with children O to 3, the ICDS programme
would provide a needed signal regarding the importance of this younger target
group, would free time for the activities related to the 0-to-3s
as well as pregnant and lactating mothers, and would still allow adequate time
for feeding and the non-formal
pre-school
component.<p>
<p>
	Other observations related to time use follow:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 The radio experiment being carried out in Rajasthan in which programmes for
ICDS children are presented for 15 minutes each morning should help the AWW to
organize her time as well as to provide her with a continuing source of
information and new activities.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Asking the AWW to perform additional responsibilities such as literacy
instruction could place an additional burden on the AWW, affecting negatively
her attention to the pre-school
and nutritional activities.<p>
<p>
	 <li>The inclusion of adolescent girls in the ICDS programme may be a good idea
but should probably not be looked upon as a major time-saving
scheme because these young girls will  require supervision, increasing the
responsibility of the AWW. (Nevertheless, we were told by Orissa AWWs in
training, that the idea of involving adolescent girls was a good one.)</ul>

<b>Motivation</b><p>
<p>
	In the brainstorming session held during our visit (see list of participants
in Annexure 1), an issue of major concern to those present was that of
motivation, or, "the human factor." The quality of the pre-school
(and other) components of ICDS is directly affected by the motivation and self-confidence
of the programme implementers. The desire to work, and to work well, involves
more than acquiring a set of skills. It requires feedback and an occasional pat
on the back, so one knows one is doing well, or, is at least making advances.
It requires listening and guiding by supervisors rather than just informing. It
requires opportunities to participate in a supportive group where one can share
successes and raise questions.<p>
<p>
    It was pointed out that ICDS has instituted a system of snail increments in
pay to recognize time in service -- as one incentive for AWW workers. Fortunately, however, monetary incentives,
although important, are only part of the motivational picture.<p>
<p>
    ICDS also has experimented with a system of prizes. While it has not
functioned regularly, it could be implemented in a more systematic way. Also,
it would be possible to establish various
systems of recognition (with or without a prize). For instance, AWW might be
asked to contribute stories in a contest. The stories judged to be the best
could be published and distributed on a wide
scale. The same might be done for songs.<p>
<p>
	Perhaps the most important way to reward performance is through promotion -- from AWW to supervisor, from supervisor to a master supervisor and/or to become
a CDPO. This provides personal challenge as well as the prospect of higher pay.
This kind of promotion too rarely happens, however. As suggested above,
increasing the amount of promotion from within the system could strengthen the
system considerably, not only by incorporating more practical experience, but
by increasing motivation.<p>
<p>
	Motivation can come also from continuing in-service
training that includes the possibility of group discussion -- at circle meetings for AWWs and at monthly meetings at the block level for
supervisors. As suggested that these meetings could be opportunities for
training; but at least as important is their potential role in providing a
regular source of motivation to grassroots workers. Motivating through on-going
in-service
training and support does not require any major budget increases, but it does
enter into planning, particularly as part of the training of supervisors.
Providing certification for the skills obtained through such in-service
training is also a source of motivation.<p>
<p>
	The suggestion to reduce the AWW/Supervisor ratio can also be justified, in
part, in terms of the additional motivation that can be provided through more
frequent and regular visits with a reduced load.<p>
<p>
<b>Organization</b><p>
<p>
	The need to strengthen state and local levels of ICDS was identified as a
challenge. Some clear moves in that direction have already been taken. In
Orissa, for instance, the SCERT has been active in both training and materials
development, and is looking to establish District Institutes for Education and
Training (DIET) in 13 Districts. It is possible to foresee an Early Childhood
Development Unit at each DIET. These units could function as resource centres
responsible for coordination of training, materials development, research, and
dissemination at the District level. In addition, an AWW could be attached to
each DIET as a kind of "laboratory" which would provide opportunities for AWW
training.<p>
<p>
	Clearly, strengthening of State Resource Centers should be written into the
plans of the states that are to participate in the two projects. An early
education/child development person should be
part of those centres.<p>
<p>
	It was suggested that more should be done to bring the talents of Home
Economics, Education, and Social Welfare faculties of universities into ICDS,
perhaps assigning to participating organizations the responsibility for
overseeing implementation of on-going
programmes as well as for programme monitoring and evaluation.<p>
<p>
	From several sides came the repeated suggestion that sore non-governmental
institutions could be involved in ICDS.<p>
<p>
<b>Monitoring and Evaluation</b><p>
	Health and nutrition components of ICDS have been endlessly monitored, giving
visibility to these components. Now, NIPCCD has demonstrated both the value and
feasibility of monitoring the social components of ICDS, including the pre-school
component. This NIPCCD initiative deserves to be supported and extended to
include periodic evaluation of the impact of the ICDS programme on children and
other participants. This could, and in our opinion, should be written into the
project proposals.<p>
<p>
Additional support could be given to attempts to move monitoring and analysis
functions froa the central level to the state and district levels by
strengthening monitoring cells at these levels. This requires a concerted
training effort, and probably a technical assistance arrangement with NIPCCD
and a local university-based
group.<p>
<p>
    NIPCCD has proposed:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 A half-yearly
Pro-forma
to be completed by AWW dealing with: physical facilities, amenities, and the
worker's background, and<p>
<p>
	 <li>A Quarterly Report that would include information about:<p>
<p>
<ul>beneficiaries (by the AWW)<br>
work performance of functionaries (by Supervisors)<br>
quality of services (by a technical institution), and<br>
observations of 3 women from the community (by a technical
institution).</ul><br>
</ul>
	This proposal deserves serious consideration and action to bring together this
proposal with the nutrition and health monitoring.<p>
<p>
As far as we can tell, there is no system for evaluating the impact of ICDS on
the cognitive and social aspects of child development, as there is for
nutrition and health, using mortality, mobidity, and nutritional indicators.
Instruments exist that could be used to evaluate the effect of ICDS on pre-literacy
and pre-numeracy
skills. It would also be possible to evaluate the effect on school enrollment,
progress, and performance (see, for instance, Chaturvedi, 1987, or, Balaji and
Arya, 1987).<p>
<p>
	In our conversations we have sensed a hesitancy to carry out such impact
evaluations, which we think would show a positive effect in areas where the
programme is being implemented reasonably well, and would provide an argument
for helping to upgrade the pre-school
component in areas where implementation is not as good.<p>

<p>
<center><b>Community Education for Child Care</b></center><p>
<p>
	In the syllabus and guidebook, a section dealing with the education of parents
and other caregivers is called, "Community Education for Child Care." These
words suggest a heavy emphasis on health and on custodial care. We would prefer
to see the section labeled, "Community Education for Child Devel6pment,"
consistent with the ICDS name.<p>
<p>
	Enhancement of early childhood development by working with parents and other
caregivers is important because such support and education:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 Is necessary to reach children in their earliest months and years (ages O to 3).<p>
<p>
	 <li>Builds and reinforces family responsibility for child development.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Adds continuity and support to centre-based
services.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Promotes an integrated approach.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Helps sustain improvements In the long term by empowering parents and other
caregivers.</ul>
<b>Principles</b><p>
<p>
	There is broad agreement that ICDS has not been as successful in reaching
children under age 3 as it has been in reaching children in the 3 to 5 age
group. It may not be surprising, therefore, that whereas the path to improving
the quality of non-formal
pre-school programmes is reasonably clear, there is much less clarity about how
to design the equivalent developmental component for children under three. It
Is clear that community education for child care has to be central, but that
education is presently discussed only in terms of nutrition and health. Indeed,
one whole part of community education for child development --
that relating to the cognitive,
linguistic, social and emotional development of the child under the age of 3 -- seems to be missing. There is little or no attention in the official material
we saw dealing with child care education, to information or activities designed
to develop the senses through stimulation or that help to develop a child's
mind and respond to a child's need for security, interaction, exploration and
love. This part of child development is left until age 3.<p>
<p>
	Further, the idea of child care education seems to revolve around the simple
presentation of basic messages. This rather impersonal approach is not one we
find congenial, nor is it a position shared by all the people with whom we
spoke. Consequently, The principles suggested below for child care education
are not ones that we heard articulated frequently (as was the case for pre-school),
but, rather, represent our own thinking and that of a few individuals with whom
we spoke. (For one treatment, see: Sharma, Infant stimulation, May, l989.)<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 Child care education should be integrated in its content. There is a need to
include information about the mental and social development of children in the
earliest years as well as about their survival and physical growth. As
indicated at the outset, an alert, inquisitive, secure and communicative child
will be healthier, better nourished, and more likely to survive than a passive,
inert, reticent, insecure and uncommunicative child.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Child care education should draw on existing knowledge and experience as well
as provide new information. It is important to recognize that many caregivers,
even in so-called
disadvantaged environments, are competent and effective caregivers who have a
store of traditional wisdom to draw upon. Positive behaviours need to be
supported, even as negative practices are being corrected through the
presentation of new knowledge.<p>
<p>
	<li>Child care education should allow for support through periodic home visits or
through group discussion and action. It is not enough simply to get messages to
people. The purpose of caregiver education is to change attitudes, improve
behaviour and have an impact on the child, not just to transfer knowledge.
Experience suggests that changes in attitudes and practices require a fore of
education that reinforces individual messages with interpersonal forms of
communication on a recurring basis. A one-shot
educational effort does not innoculate, and impersonal media communica tions,
alone, will rarely be sufficient to change behaviour.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Child care education should be set within the context of, and help to
promote, other activities that make fundamental changes in the environment in
which a child develops. From the education should come community organization
for action that helps to change unsanitary conditions, provides income
generating activities, and attacks other general problems in the community
affecting development.</ul>
<b>Issues and Concerns</b><p>
<p>
	<b>The need for integration</b>. Because community child care education is
presently framed in terms of health and nutrition and does not include a psycho-social
dimension, a first task is to integrate that dimension into the general process
of child care education. To do so, it will be necessary to build awareness of
the importance of this dimension, to re-examine
training materials to see that this theme is included, to create materials for
use at the grassroots and in circle meetings, and to experiment with inclusion
of the component in specific child care education programmes.<p>
<p>
	Subsumed under this issue are many details related to training and materials
development which remain to be worked out.<p>
<p>
<b>Time</b><p>
<p>
We have already discussed in relation to the pre-school
component a time reallocation that would give more time to the AWW for child
care education. Incorporating a psycho-social
dimension within this education would not demand much additional time from the
AWW. What is implied is a few minutes during each home visit or in group
meetings to discuss stimulation, interaction, and socialization themes,
supporting positive practices, and suggesting new or different activities. An
occasional group meeting devoted to this theme would also be called for, in
which emphasis would be place on drawing out the positive practices and
activities that some families are using and that could be adopted by others.<p>
<p>
	It would be advisable for the developmental component to be phased in over
time. It could be handled in the main as part of in-service
training, and by providing only a general orientation within the pre-service
training. Phasing in this dimension would avoid overloading the AWW with
additional knowledge during the pre-service
training.<p>
<p>
<b>An Experiment to Watch</b><p>
<p>
	In Orissa, the NCERT has been carrying out an experiment with a home-based
programme of child development for tribal and urban children over the last
several years. (Muralidharan and Mishra, 1989) The experiment involves work
with selected families through home visits and in groups organized by trained
para-professionals
from the community (not, in the first instance AWWs). In the training
programme, these para-professional
workers were given fundamental principles of child development, child care and
desirable child rearing practices through slide showings, songs, and
activities, and were exposed to supporting materials (produced by the CML) and
to examples of stimulating activities for parents and their very young
children. Over the course of a year, weekly home visits were carried out.<p>
<p>
	The appproach taken is an integrated one. Home discussions and small group
meetings deal with immunization, ORT, weaning, etc., as well as with stimulation-related
activities. Immunization camps were held in conjunction with Primary Health
Care and the Women's Welfare Centre as part of the project.<p>
<p>
	To help create the content for the materials and visits, a baseline study was
carried out in 1986 that included, among other things, information about
health, nutrition, sanitation, and stimulation practices. This study was
carried out by THREAD (Team of Human Resource Education and Action for
Development), an NGO based in Orissa.<p>
<p>
	When experimental and control groups in the experiment were compared,
experimental mothers were found to be much more aware of the need for
stimulation than non-experimental
mothers. More importantly, experimental children in the tribal area (but not in
the urban area) performed significantly better on tests of motor, personal-social,
language, and cognitive development, at all developmental levels.<p>
<p>
	Based on this initial success, the project is now being carried out within the
ICDS programme, with hose visiting being done by AWWs. The results of this
extension of the original idea bear
watching closely.<p>
<p>
<b>Some Specific Suggestions:</b><p>
<p>
	1. There is a need for NIPCCD to follow up its meeting earlier this year on
traditional (including tribal) child rearing practices, to extract from the
results of that meeting specific implications for the content of materials to
be used in training and in community child care activities by supervisors and
AWW (NIPCCD, 1989).<p>
<p>
	2. A pamphlet should be developed for use in in-service
training of AWW at the circle level, and with parents, that would help parents
to recognize the highly-developed
condition of a child's senses at birth and the importance of helping a child to
exercise these capacities if they are to develop properly. The pamphlet might
give an important place to such existing (but declining) practices as
massage.<p>
<p>
	3. A pamphlet might be created that links development to the rituals that now
mark various milestones in the early life of a child.<p>
<p>
	4. If it has not already been done, AIR should be encouraged to work with
NCERT or NIPCCD on the development of a set of "spots" or short programmes that
would be directed toward parents of children O to 3 that draw on the
information to be included in the two publications suggested above. The
presentation of these spots might be coordinated with group meetings in
communities, much as the Rajasthan experiment now coordinates its programmes
with programming in the pre-schools.
An example of such a model is available from Southern Chile.<p>
<p>
	5. The NCERT experiment in Orissa, described above, should be followed
closely.<p>
<p>
	6. An elaborate training effort is being tried out in several states where
CARE is providing food, begining with training of CDPOs and ending the
"cascade" with the training of mothers by AWWs. One of the experimental states
is Orissa. This programme has focussed on health and nutrition; it does not
include a component mother-child interaction and education. A repeat round of training is envisioned for
next year to reinforce what have been given. In the repeat, the training should
be broadened to integrate in the additional dimension of child development.<p>
<p>
	7. There are undoubtedly other experimental home-based
projects being carried out in India that take an integrated perspective, that
include stimulation/education/socialization components and that include, or
focuss on, birth to age 3. It may be appropriate to organize a national meeting
to present results from innovative home-visiting
or parental education programmes, similar to the meeting organized in 1983
dealing with cognitive development in early childhood programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>Postscript on Child Development Education</b><p>
<p>
	Because our original charge was to look at the non-formal
pre-school
component of ICDS and because our time was relatively short during this
consultancy, we do not feel we have been able to do justice to the area of
child care education focussing on children O to 3. At the same time we feel
strongly that this is a crucial area and that a concerted effort should be made
now to incorporate the stimulation/interaction/education content into
programmes of health and nutrition education. We hope that it will be possible
for someone, within the context of the project discussions, to examine this
area in greater depth and to incorporate the component into the final project
plan.<p>

<p>In an effort to contribute to the growing body of comparative child
development research, a psycho- biological model useful in the analysis
of early child development was applied to a group of infants in a South
Indian fishing community. The application of this model generated both
quantitative baseline data from which infant behaviour, development and
physiology can be understood as well as an ethnographic exploration of
the knowledge, attitudes, and beliefs which structure caregiving behaviours
and define the wider cultural setting.</p>

<p>The specific aims of this investigation were to: (1) describe and document
the behavioural profile of this group of infants, (2) illustrate the complex
set of relationships between biomedical and social variables, and (3) discover
the mechanisms through which these relationships vary in different cultures.
The data generated led to the analysis of three major perspectives including:
(1) the biological efficacy and adaptability of the infant to overcome
the demands of a stressful environment, (2) the effectiveness of culturally
adapted infant- rearing patterns, and (3) the unique psychological make-
up and identity development of the Indian woman. In addition, the insights
drawn from this research addressed several critical social policy issues
related to the design and implementation of early intervention programmes
for infants at- risk.</p>

<p>The emphasis on culture, as one of the many variables that needs to
be investigated in developmental research, has broadened our perspective
and appreciation for the underlying processes of development. The opportunity
is a challenging one for it forces us to expand our definition of normality
as we witness modes of organization which vary from one culture to another.
The systematic study of infant development across cultures demands the
formulation of multidimensional models to account for the interrelationships
among complex sets of variables. These paradigms must be able to describe
and document the interactions between environmental conditions of the culture,
the effects of these conditions on the mother and fetus, and the nature
of the individual infant.</p>

<p>In response to this challenge, the psychobiological model was designed
by Lester and Brazelton (1982). Upholding the assumptions of a transactional
or holistic model (Sameroff and Chandler, 1975) of development, they suggest
that behavior is only interpretable by viewing the functioning of the organism
in the caregiving environment. The infant is viewed as both a biological
and psychological system which proceeds developmentally from less complex
to increasingly differentiated levels of organization. A second assumption
implicit in the model is that behavior is adaptive. The neonate comes equipped
with a preprogrammed response repertoire which is designed to maximize
the survival of the individual and the species. The form of adaptation
reflects both the evolutionary history of the species and the particular
or ontogenetic history of the individual. Development is influenced by
several classes of variables which include the obstetrical and reproductive
history of the mother, genetic endowment and prenatal environment. In addition
the infant characteristics of gestational age, size, weight, and` sex must
also be considered. These forces act synergistically to produce a behavioral
phenotype; the expression of a genetic endowment within a particular environment.
The infant elicits from the environment the responses necessary for his
survival, and at the same time is affected by environmental forces which
include methods of care and handling, family structure, and physical setting,
as well as the larger goals and expectations of the culture (Lester, Brazelton,
1982).</p>

<p>In an effort to contribute to the growing body of comparative infancy
research, the psychobiological model was applied to a group of 30 full
term infants born in a rural village in South India. The investigation
was carried out with two goals in mind: (1) to describe and document the
behavioral profile of a group of full term Indian infants throughout the
first 3 months of life, and (2) to illustrate the complex relationships
between biomedical and social variables and neonatal behavior, and discover
how these relationships may vary in different cultures. In addressing the
first goal, the Brazelton Neonatal Behavior Assessment Scale (BNBAS) (Brazelton,
1973) was administered to each of the 30 infants on days I, 2, 3, 5, 7,
10, and 30 of life in an effort to document both the change and stability
in neonatal performance within the first month of life. To monitor the
path of early infant growth, the Barley scale of mental and motor development
was administered at 3 months of age. (Barley, 1969). Investigation of the
relationship between the physical and behavioral characteristics of these
infants and the circumstances surrounding their birth was the second goal
of the study. The hypothesis to be tested here was that the potential influence
of biomedical and social factors may vary in different populations such
that some populations may be more resistant to the effects of biological
and social risk factors than others. It was hoped that this set of analyses
would generate a culture- specific profile of relative infant risk as it
relates to and interacts with the caregiving adaptations exhibited by this
community.</p>

<p>DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL CHARACTERISTICS</p>

<p>OF THE RESEARCH SITE</p>

<p>The study took place in Karnataka State, which may be broadly defined
as that region in South India inhabited predominantly by Kannada- speaking
people. The coastland of Karnataka, known as Kanara, is approximately 200
miles long and 8 to 20 miles wide in the North and 30- 40 miles wide in
the South. This lowland region of the Western coast is crossed by several
transverse ridges and spurs of the Western Chats. It is here that the research
took place within the surrounding villages of Udupi in South Kanara District
of Karnataka State. Malpe, a village 1.5 kilometers from Udupi, was the
major site of the study. Covering an area of 9.12 square kilometers, it
has 2,110 occupied households and a population of 17,000 (Census of India,
1971). Although predominately a fishing village, agriculture accounts for
a large portion of its economic activity, The maximum temperature reaches
34.90C and falls to a minimum of 18.60C during December and January. The
months of March, April, and May are the hottest, followed by the heavy
monsoon rains which fall in January, July, and August, yielding an annual
rainfall of 4,187mm. The area has approximately 20km of roads and an open
surface drainage system. The government medical facilities within the village
include a family planning center, a dispensary, and a maternal and child
welfare clinic. The government- run educational facilities include 6 primary
schools, 2 middle schools, and one secondary school. Reflecting the high
literacy rate of South Kanara, Malpe has an overall rate of 52%, Of the
literate population, 57% are males, while 43% are females. Seventy- five
percent of the population are Hindus, 14% practice Christianity, and 11%
are classified Muslims (Census of India, 1971). The predominant language
is Tulu, followed by Kannada, the official state language. Tulu is a highly
developed Dravidian language with a rich vocabulary capable of expressing
the most subtle shades of meaning. It suffers from the absence of a script
and succumbs to Kannada when reduced to writing (Diwakar, 1968). Rice is
the predominant crop in the alluvium patches of the coastland and in the
irrigated areas of the eastern plateau, while coconut is the chief crop
on the sandy coastal soils. Jowar and ragi are grown in the poorer soils
which require moderate rain. Fishing, fish- curing, fruit- canning, salt-
making, wood- cutting, ship- building, and ivory- carving are the chief
industries of the coastland region of Kanara (Hukkkrikar, 1955). The three
most important commodities imported include rice, salt, and clay, while
the three most important exports are fish, fish meal, and coir products.
The goods manufactured within the village include: (1) canned fish and
fish meal, (2) tiles and bricks, and (3) coir products and wicker baskets.
Of the total population, 33% are employed, with women constituting approximately
34.7% of the labor supply (Census of India, 1971).</p>

<p>While there is a wide range of economic levels within the fishing community,
most of India's small scale traditional fishermen are poor. Two major factors
inherent in the economic structure of fishing in India have been cited
as the major cause of their relative poverty. These include: (1) inequality
in assets holdings, and (2) exploitation and malfunction of the market
system (Kurien, 1980). There is a tremendous skewedness in the distribution
of equipment and the distribution of proceeds favors the owner of capital
rather than the laborer. Depending on the type of equipment, the owner
receives about one- fifth to one- half of the total catch in addition to
his shares as a worker (Norr, 1976). A second major factor in the causative
analysis of the fishermen's poverty speaks to the failings of the market
system. The marketing of fish, whether it is (a) small scale disposal over
short distances, (b) bulk disposal over long distances, or (c) export disposal,
is the breeding ground for middlemen. For every middleman on a marketing
chain there is a proportionate decrease in the return to the fisherman
and an increase in the supply to the consumer. Although these problems
still plague Malpe's fishermen, several achievements in the past two decades
have given rise to the unique and remarkable economic growth occurring
in the village, These include (1) the introduction of mechanized fishing,
(2) improved infrastructure and (3) the availability of foreign markets
for export. Until recently, traditional fishing methods, involving dug-
out canoes and plank boats, accounted for approximately 75% of Malpe's
total fish yield. At present, the village has several hundred power boats
which are distributed to small groups of fishermen on a loan subsidy basis,
The traditional methods, with an operational range of only 3 kilometers
from the coast, restricted the available catch to the shoals located near
the shore giving rise to tremendous seasonal and annual variation. With
the advent of advanced fishing techniques, the markets have stabilized
at dramatically higher levels of productivity. Moreover, the introduction
of modern technology to fish handling and preservation led to the development
of foreign markets. Currently, frozen prawns and lobsters reach Japanese
and American markets. The rapid transformation of the traditionally addicted
coastal fishing industry, results in part from the modernization of the
infrastructure required to support the advances in other realms of fish
production. Facilities such as ice and freezing plants, canning and fish
meal plants were installed by 10~ kilometers of approach roads, transport
vehicles, and marketing facilities. In spite of the prevailing economic
difficulties, these advances provide the villagers with a realistic vision
of future economic prosperity.</p>

<p>Members of Malpe's fishing community are all from the same low caste,
known in the village as &quot;Mogaveras.&quot; Their housing consists of
small one- room huts with thatched roofs, mud or bamboo walls, and dirt
floors. The more prosperous fishermen have homes with tiled roofs and brick
walls or mud walls. Few of the homes have electricity and most are no larger
than two rooms. Cooking and food preparation take place either outside
or in a small area of the room reserved for these purposes. With few exceptions,
all members of this community grow up in some form of extended family organization.
The most common form in this village is the joint family with two or more
married brothers living together with their wives and children but without
their parents, and the generational family, which consists of the parents,
and only one of their married children and his spouse and children (Kakar,
1978). The extended family is a cooperative unit whose members are engaged
in the many activities necessary to enable its survival and protect its
members from the uncertainty and threats of the outside world. In determining
an acceptable division of labor, and articulating the relationships between
its members, the family relies essentially upon the hierarchical principal
inherent in all of Indian society. For the Indian family this process is
well- defined and steeped in tradition. The organization of relationships
within the family and the values it generates are constantly reaffirmed
through the celebration of transition points within an individual's life
cycle. Much of an Indian's social activity centers around this ritualistic
punctuation of both minor and major occasions. These traditional ceremonies
celebrate the individual's place and importance within his particular family,
providing him with keen awareness that he belongs and continually reaffirms
his belief that it is the family which is the most reliable, durable, and
moral of all social relations (Kakar, 1978).</p>

<p>Thus the economic realities of village India, coupled with the intense
social consideration of prestige, status, and reputation inherent in the
caste system, powerfully reinforce and strengthen the family bond, An individual's
worth and indeed recognition of his identity are intimately woven within
the reputation of his family. The expressed patterns of behavior and action
are not a product of individual effort, motivation or even conflict, but
emerge out of and reflect his family's circumstances and reputation in
the wider society. Within this environment conformity to bath caste and
family norms is the admired behavior; to embark upon an individually chosen
path is to invite not only ostracism but pity (Kakar, 1978).To the Western
observer, it is rather striking that in spite of the economic uncertainties
confronting the inhabitants of Malpe village, there is a pervasive sense
of joy in the small rewards and accomplishments of the day and hope that
the fruits of their labor will be reaped in the life that is yet to come.
Perhaps this psyche and vision of reality reflect not only the teachings
of the culture but are influenced and conditioned by their dependence on
the power, uncertain rewards, but unyielding constancy of the sea. </p>

<p>Indian Early Childhood. According to the reality of childhood and identity
development of the Indian child, the psyche- social definition of infancy
extends to the 4th or 5th year of life when the capacity for reasoning,
cognition, and judgement are firmly established. Infancy is characterized
by an extended and deep attachment to the maternal figure. Although this
attachment is not an exclusive one, given the nature of the extended family
and the presence of other potential caregivers, the infant's attachment
to his biological mother is by far the most poignant. This Intimacy is
reflected and symbolized by the physical proximity of the mother and child
within the early years of a child's life. During the day infants are carried
astride the mother's hip and actively engaged as she performs most of her
daily chores. Continuously held, cuddled, and talked to the infant's exposure
to the world is characterized by a maternal relationship of a duration
and intensity not usually found in the Western world (Kakar, 1979).</p>

<p>The maternal indulgence in her infant's demands appears to be extended
past the time when the infant is biologically capable of independent functioning.
For example breast feeding is on demand at all times of the day and night,
continues often until the 2nd or 3rd year of life and only gradually comes
to an end. Within this environment, the detachment from the maternal infant
bond takes place only gradually and the development of a strong independent
ego is not a feature of the Hindu model of child rearing. Motor, cognitive
and linguistic development proceed at their own pace according to a course
directed by the child, Developmental accomplishments, independent of the
rate or dexterity with which they occur, are responded to with delight
or affectionate tolerance. It appears moreover, that minimal demands are
placed on the Indian infant to actively explore and master the world independent
of his mother. What is emphasized in the early years of childhood is the
avoidance of frustration and enjoyment in the pleasurable mutuality between
the infant and others within his environment. The young child is relatively
free from external pressures to conform to a rigid structure of behavior.
The parental agenda of early child development in India contrasts sharply
with that valued in the West, where a child's development is channeled,
molded and shaped to fulfill a set of pre- determined goals. The Indian
mother emphasizes the positive aspects of her child's behavior and accedes
to his demands rather than attempting to control and structure them.</p>

<p>Subject Selection. Over a two- month period 30 infants were selected
for study from among the population of normal deliveries at the Kasturba
Medical College Hospital and a rural maternity health center. The center
is one of six maternity centers operated under the direction of the Kasturba
Hospital. Infants were eligible for study if they were healthy full terms
of uncomplicated deliveries whose mothers had an uncomplicated medical
history. The selection criteria for the study of healthy newborns was adapted
from the standards defined by Als, Tronick, Lester, and Brazelton (1979).</p>

<p>Brazelton Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale. Each mother- infant
dyad selected for study was assessed according to the measures outlined
in Table I. As evident in the Table, the areas under study included: Behavioral
Organization, Medical, Psychometric, and socio- cultural factors. The Brazelton
Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale (BNBAS) formed the major part of the
study during the first month of life (Brazelton, 1973), In order to measure
the pattern of adaptation and coping strategies of the neonate, each infant
was examined on the IST, 3rd, 5th, 7th, 1Oth and 30th days of life. The
first 2- 3 exams were performed at the delivery site, while the subsequent
exams were administered at home.</p>

<p>The scale derives its motivation based on the concept of the healthy
newborn as a complex, competent, well- organized being adapted to the environment
and able to interact with it, and elicit from it the stimulation necessary
for species- specific motor, emotional and cognitive development (Als,
et al., 1979). Through the administration of 16 reflexive items and 26
behavioral items, the infant's capacity for social interaction, motoric
organization, physiologic response to stress, and state </p>

<p>control are described and recorded. The reflex items are scored as:
O = absent, 1 e low, 2- medium, 3 P high, With a 2 considered normal for
most of the reflexes, while the 26 behavioral items are rated on a nine-
point scale. The BNBAS uncovers the infant's major capacities to organize
himself when confronted with the intense physiological demands for recovery
from labor, delivery, and exposure to the environment outside of the uterus,
The infant is manipulated in such a fashion that within the half- hour
examination he demonstrates his ability for physical, cognitive, social,
and temperamental function, as well as psycho- physiological intactness.

<br></p>

<p>To analyze the data, the individual items were grouped according to
the behavioral clusters developed by Lester, Ale, and Brazelton (1982).
This system, which seeks to preserve the dynamic Conceptualization of the
infant, combines the 26 behavioral items into six behavioral clusters and
uses the 16 reflexes to generate a seventh cluster (Table II). To derive
the six behavioral clusters, the curvilinear scale items are rescored as
linear. The cluster score is the mean of the rescored items used to define
the cluster, with higher scores indicating &quot;better&quot; performance.
The six behavioral clusters are: Habituation, response decrement to repeated
auditory, visual, and tactile stimulation; Orientation, response to animate
and inanimate stimuli and overall alertness; Motor, integrated motor acts
and overall muscle tonus; Range of State, which assess the rapidity, peak
and lability of state changes; Regulation of State, efforts to modulate
the infant's o~m state control; and Autonomic Regulation, signs of physiological
stress seen as tremors, startles, and changes in skin color. The seventh
or Reflex cluster is the total number of deviant reflex scores so that

<p>scores indicate a greater number of deviant reflexes. Performance on
the BNBAS for each of the 30 Indian infants will be presented and discussed
under two major headings; (1) group analysis of cluster scores and their
pattern of change during the first month of life and, (2) correlational
analysis between selected material infant biomedical factors and BNBAS
performance.</p>

<p>Medical Assessments. Maternal medical information consisted of obstetrical
and reproductive histories and the anthropometric indicators of height,
weight, and arm circumference. For the infant the anthropometric indicators,
length, weight, and head circumference were measured at birth, 1, and 3
months with the additional measurements of chest and arm circumference
at 3 months.</p>

<p>Socio- Cultural Data. Through a series of both formal and informal interviews,
an attempt was made to describe the particular socio- cultural setting
surrounding each mother and infant. Information of the family support system
and kinship structure and educational level of the parents was obtained.
Based on the work of Levinson (1974), an overall index of family wealth
was calculated, which included the following parameters: housing, occupation,
sanitation, and the number of various household possessions.</p>

<p>Psychometric Functioning. The Bayley Scale of Infant Development was
administered to each infant at 3 months (Bayley, 1969). The primary value
of this tool for infant development lies in its ability to determine a
child's current level of functioning and the degree of deviation from normality.
The scale is divided into two complementary areas of developmental functioning,
namely Mental ability and Psychomotor ability. The mental scale is designed
to assess sensory- perceptual activities, discrimination and the ability
to respond to these; the early acquisition of object constancy and memory,
learning, and problem solving, vocalizations and the beginning of verbal
communication; and early evidence of the ability to form generalizations
and classifications which is the basis of abstract thought. The motor scale
assesses both gross and fine motor control, the degree of balance, tone,
and flexibility through the administration of motor tasks.</p>

<p>Norms for the Bayley Scale are based on 1,262 children ranging in age
from 2- 30 months. In standardizing the scale, the mental and motor items
were arranged in approximate order by age placement (the age at which %
of the children passed a given item). The Mental Development Index (MDI)
and the Psychomotor Development Index (PDI) were derived by administration
of the respective scales, The distribution of raw scores at each age level
was converted to a set of normalized standard scores with a mean value
of 100 and a standard deviation of 16. The standard score range of 50 through
150 covers more than three standard deviations on either side of the average
MDI or PDZ for each of the chosen 14 age groups tested In the standardization
design.</p>

<p><b>SAMPLE CHARACTERISTICS</b></p>

<p>Delivery Characteristics and Early Infant Environment. Of the 30 infants,
12 were delivered by a physician at the Kasturba Hospital, while the remaining
births took place at a rural health center with a midwife attending the
delivery. Infants were delivered without medication and placed alongside
the mothers immediately after birth. Mothers at the rural health center
had the option of placing their infant in a cradle located at the foot
of each bed. The average length of hospital stay was 5- 7 days, while mothers
who delivered at the center returned home between the 3rd and 5th days.
The new mother was constantly surrounded by female members of her extended
family throughout the duration of her stay. Breast feeding was initiated
usually within 24- 48 hours of birth. Initial feeds were supplemented on
the first through third days with jaggery water administered by spoon.
The tradition of not giving colostrum, recommended by ancient Indian physicians
and still practiced by 85- 902 of rural mothers (Agarwal b Agarwal, 1981),
was not widely practiced among this population of women. Breastfeeding
is frequent and on demand at all times of the day and night.</p>

<p>The 1Oth day of the infant's life is a memorable one. It is at this
time that the infant is named and a cradle made out of wood or straw hung
from the center of the hut. A silver belt, or piece of string in poorer
families, is placed around the infant's waist and used to measure and monitor
the child's growth. Children are named after their grandparents, the patron
deity of the family, or some object known for its strength and purity.
It is usually selected jointly by the elder members of the family. Until
the IOTA or IST day following delivery, mothers are considered impure.
This state of impurity is remedied by the bath, as running water is considered
the great purification agent. This task was traditionally assigned to the
washerwoman, who in virtue of her functions finds herself living permanently
in a state bordering upon that which others enter temporarily (Dumont,
1970). At present, this task is performed by the maternal grandmother,
Following the purification bath, the new mother is reintegrated into the
family. For the infant as well the bath plays a major role. An elaborate
bath and oil massage is followed by tightly wrapping the infant with an
old piece of sari.</p>

<p>Throughout the first month of life, infant and mother can be found resting
in one corner of the hut. As women in India often return to their native
home for delivery, remaining there from 3 to 5 months, the maternal grandmother
plays a major role in the early life of the infant. In such cases where
the maternal grandmother was absent, she was replaced by a female relative
or, in two cases, an elderly woman from the community, It is a time when
all of the new mother's energies are directed towards the care of her infant
and she is comforted and strengthened by the security of her familial environment.
From the moment of birth, the Indian infant is greeted and surrounded by
unyielding physical ministrations and the Indian mother is inclined towards
a total indulgence of her infant's wishes and demands (Kakar, 1978). Reflecting
the stoicism, endurance and dedication of her culture, the Indian woman
gives to infancy its mystical aura and marked impact on development.</p>

<p>Maternal Characteristics. The characteristics of the Indian mothers
are shown in Table III. The mean height was 155.6 cm (59.0 inches), with
a weight of 47.2 kgs (103.8 pounds) and an arm circumference of 23.0 cm
(8.8 inches). Both mean height and mean weight were below the 5th percentile
of American standards for women aged 25- 34 years (Nation Center for Health
Statistics, 1979a). However, when weight was assessed in terms of height
(weight for height), the mean fell between the IOTA and 25th percentile.
The range of weight for height was from the 3rd to 75th percentiles (National
Center for Health Statistics 1979b). Since the stature of women is influenced
strongly by malnutrition, infection, and other types of stress centered
in infancy and childhood and extending into adulthood, the low values for
height and weight are indicative of suboptimal maternal health and nutrition
and are likely to influence weight gain during pregnancy (Mata &amp; Wyatt,
1971). The diets of these women were typical of a South Indian community
and consisted of rice, ragi, wheat, pulses, vegetables, buttermilk, and
coconut milk, Rice and fish characterized the diets of the nonvegetarian
mothers from the fishing community.</p>

<p>Their ages ranged from 19 to 45, with a mean maternal age of 28.2 years.
The women were distributed across the age ranges as follows: 1 woman 19
or less; 7 women each within the age ranges 20- 24, 25- 29; 9 women 30-
34 years, and 1 woman over 35 years. Gravida and parity were found to be
3,7 and 2.4, respectively, with 17% of the mothers delivering their first
child. in terms of educational status, 18.5% were illiterate, 29.7% were
semi- literate, and 51.8% were literate.</p>

<p>Measurement of selected host and environmental variables permitted computation
of the Family Wealth index useful in separating families into categories
of differing socio- economic status. The observed limits of dispersion
ranged between 51.8 and 294.8, with a mean of 149 and a standard deviation
of 57.7. As indicated by the wide range of scores, the families included
in the study represented the poor, lower middle, and middle socio- economic
classifications.</p>

<p>Several of the maternal characteristics were significantly interrelated
as indicated in Table IV. Weight and height were positively related, as
were weight and arm circumference. Age, parity, and gravida are highly
interrelated and suggest that older mothers have a greater number of children.
The maternal anthropometric characteristics were also examined with respect
to Family Wealth Index and maternal literacy rate, Maternal literacy was
positively related to the Family Wealth Index, but not significantly related
to any of the maternal medical factors. Literacy, on the other hand, was
related to maternal factors of gravida and parity and suggested that multiparous
mothers were more illiterate.</p>

<p>Newborn Characteristics. Infants less than 2500 gms were included in
the study and not considered low birthweight as according to the criteria
laid down by the World Health Organization. As the average birth weight
of full term infants in India is about 500 gms less than that of Western
countries, the international low birthweight (LBW) criterion cannot be
accepted for the Indian infant, Various Indian investigators have suggested
1800- 2500 gms as the criteria for LBW infants with the majority approving
2000 gms as the cut- off point (Ghosh, 1970; Bhargava L Ghosh, 1974; Datta
Banik, 1978).</p>

<p>The newborn characteristics are presented in Table V. All infants were
between 37 and 40 weeks gestation. The birthweights ranged from 2000 gms
to 3550- gms with a mean of 2777 gms. Male infants were slightly heavier
than female infants; 2834 and 2773, respectively. These findings are in
agreement with the mean birthweights reported by various investigators
throughout India (8hargava, Kumari, Coudhury, Lall, 1980). According to
the U.S. birthweight standards for males, 60% of the Indian infants were
at or below the IOth percentile, while 40% were at or below the 50th percentile,
The corresponding figures for females are 41% at or below the lOth percentile
and 59% at or</p>

<p>(ems) of 49.1 is in agreement with that reported by other Indian investigators
(Uklonskaya, Purl,Choudhari, Luthra, Kumar, 1961; Ghaf &amp; Sandhu, 1968).
This figure corresponds to the 50th percentile of U.S. standards (Gairdner
4 Pearson,1971). The mean head circumference was 33.7 (ems), a figure slightly
less than that reported by Ghai et al. (1468) and is below the IOth percentile
for U.S. newborns (Gairdner &amp; Pearson, 1971).</p>

<p>The ponderal index, a ratio of birthweight to body length, can be used
to define the end results of fetal growth and nutrition. It is a rather
unique and useful measure for, unlike birthweight, the ponderal index is
not confounded by race, sex, fetal age, or parity when defining malnutrition.
By taking length into consideration, babies who are long, with a relatively
small amount of soft tissue mass, can be seen as having experienced a late
gestation nutritional insult (Brazelton, Parker, Zuckerman, 1976). Based
on research in the Western world, a ponderal index less than 2.3 has been
used to define fetal malnutrition in term infants. The mean ponderal index
for the Indian infant in the present study was 2.36 with a range from 1.88
to 3.28. Using 2.3 as the cut- off point, 45% of the infants would be defined
as malnourished or alternately termed small for gestational age (SGA).
An important question is to determine whether the behavioral characteristics
typical of a SGA infant are manifested by these Indian infants who, be
means of a low P.I., would be defined as such.</p>

<p>Several of the newborn medical factors were interrelated and the significant
correlations between them are shown in Table VI. As may be expected, the
heavier infants are also longer and have larger head circumferences. Infant
length at birth was also negatively related to the ponderal index, which
suggests that low ponderal index infants have a longer birth length. The
ponderal index, however was not significantly correlated with weight gain
at one month. The anthropometric measures of birth weight, length, and
head circumference were positively correlated with weight at one month.
Thus infants who were larger at birth are also larger at one month, which
supports the notion the growth in the early months is a biological function
of infant status at birth.</p>

<p>The means and standard deviations for the seven BNBAS cluster scores
are presented in Table VII. In order to test the overall equality of means
across time, a- one- way - repeated measure analysis of variance test with
days as the factor was applied (Bruning and Kintz, 1977). The results of
the analysis, presented in Table VIII, indicates that for 5 of the 7 clusters
the overall F ratio is highly significant. Means scores for the Motor,
Regulation of State, Autonomic Stability, and Reflex clusters show significant
variation throughout the first month of life, whereas the variation for
both the Orientation and Range of State clusters was not significant. The
relationship between the mean scores as they change over time was described
by trend analysis. Orthogonal polynomial coefficients designed for unequal
intervals were tested to determine the presence of linear, quadratic, cubic,
quartic, and quintic components (Kirk, 1968; Dickson, 1981).</p>

<p>Habituation. The newborn is equipped at birth with a capacity to shut
out repitious, disturbing, visual, auditory, and tactile stimulation that
might otherwise make excessive demands on his immature physiologic system.
The BNBAS assesses this capacity be measuring the decrement that occurs
in response to a flashlight, bell, rattle, and pinprick. The pinprick,
however, was not administered to the Indian infant. As evident from the
mean scores for the habituation cluster presented in Table VII, this sample
of Indian infants is performing in the optimal range. Their behavior could
be characterized by shutdown of body movements, diminution in blinks and</p>

performance changes significantly throughout the first month, as identified
from the results of the ANOVA on this cluster presented in Table VIII.
The pattern of mean scores indicates that the scores increase over time
but as well as being linear, the quadratic function indicates that the
scores remain the same on days 5, 7, increase on day 10, and remain the
same on day 30. The linear component accounts for 48.9% of the change,
while the quadratic component accounts for 45.82 of the variation in scores.</p>

<p>The Indian infant's capacity to shut out disturbing visual and auditory
stimulation serves him well when confronting the demands of his environment,
From the moment of birth these infants are exposed to a continuous stream
of intense animate and inanimate stimulation, which characterizes their
small, crowded, and open huts. Their optimal performance on this cluster
reflects the adequacy of their habituation center to adapt to the demands
of a stimulation- rich environment. In interpreting these results it is
proposed that the use of swaddling, a technique practiced by this community,
is related to their optimal habituation response. It is generally believed
that swaddling has a calming, restraining influenced on infants which induces
and extends sleep by reducing the number of startles which may lead to
waking (Chisholm, 1978). Perhaps the most significant medical research
on the effects of swaddling with or without the use of the cradleboard
has been conducted by Lipton, Steinschneider, Richmond, (1965). Based on
experimental evidence they reported that infants who were swaddled slept
more, had reduced levels of motor activity in response to stimulation,
fewer startles, and lower heart rate variability than non- swaddled infants.
According to these authors, the motor restraint imposed by swaddling reduces
the overall arousal level by decreasing afferent proprioceptive stimuli
to the central reticular formation of the brain stem. It appears that the
findings from this investigation support the hypothesis that both the effects
of swaddling and the constant stimulation provided by their environment
are related to these infants' exceptional ability to shut out disturbing
and physiologically threatening environmental stimulation.</p>

<p>Orientation. At birth the infant is equipped with a capacity for processing
complex visual information and for demonstrating visual motor movements
which enable him to follow and fixate on an appealing stimulus. The BNBAS
items used to measure this capacity are the visual and auditory orientation
to inanimate objects (bell, ball) and responsivity to the examiner's face
and/or voice. Although a large within group variation was found, their
overall scores fell at the low- to mid- range level of the scale. Their
behavior can be characterized by stilled and quiet alerting to the stimulus
with smooth or jerky visual tracking for at least 300 are, Only a few of
the infants were able to follow the stimulus with eyes and head 60&quot;
horizontally and 30&quot; vertically, which is characteristic of a more
optimal orientation response. As identified in Table XV the items comprising
this cluster show no significant change over the first 30 days of life
(p(.07). There is, however, a slight increase over time with the means
fluctuating between a low of 4.7 on day 1 and a high score of 5.5 on day
10.</p>

<p>In interpreting the low- to mid- range orientation performance of these
infants which does not improve significantly over time, two hypotheses
may be offered. One difficulty in applying the BNBAS in cross cultural
research is the experimenter's lack of control over environmental circumstances
(de Vries &amp; Super, 1978). For example, the administration manual explicitly
states that the exam should be performed in between feedings and within
a quiet and dimly lit environment (Brazelton, 1973). As the Indian infant
is fed on demand and the exams were often performed in small dark huts,
amidst the confusion of daily activities and the enthusiastic support of
as many as 20 observers, the atmosphere was less than ideal. Thus it may
be suggested that the demands of the environment made it more difficult
for the examiner to bring the infant to the quiet alert state needed to
elicit the infant's optimal orientation response. Perhaps with greater
control over the conditions under which the exam is performed, the overall
mean scores would show some improvement. A second hypothesis offered in
explanation of the consistently low orientation scores speaks to the set
of maternal expectations for the social responsivity of her infant. In
the first month of life there was little evidence of &quot;en face&quot;
behaviors between a mother and her infant. Particularly noteworthy was
the absence of maternal vocalizations towards the infant during any of
the caregiving activities. Even during feedings when the mother would observe
her infant, her glances were perfunctory and without any expectation of
response. Moreover, the typical feeding position, the infant seated sideways
against the mother's outstretched legs, exacerbated the lack of visual
en face regard. The maternal energy seemed to be directed towards ministering
to her infant's physiologic needs with little emphasis placed upon his
emerging social capacities, It is suggested that the type of maternal responsivity
observed during the first month coupled with dark huts, did not create
an environment conducive to the intimate verbal or visual conversations
characterizing mother- infant early interaction in the Western world.</p>

<p>Motor. An illuminating source of information about the newborn can be
obtained through the simple observation of motoric behavior. During the
neonatal exam, motor behavior is assessed by the maturity, tone,and vigor
of motoric movements as well as his capacity for head and neck control.
The repeated measure ANOVA for the motor cluster found a significant increase
in motor performance throughout the first month (p(.0001). The linear,
quadratic and cubic components were significant and accounted for 72.162,162
and 4.9% of the variation, respectively. There is an overall increase from
a mean of 4,3 on day 1 to 5.9 on day 30, The variation in scores between
days 3 and 10 accounts for the quadratic and cubic variation, The type
and kind of motor activity exhibited by this group could be qualitatively
described as mature,somewhat hypertonic and resistant with an air of deliberate
intensity. Their movements were not jerky with restricted arcs characteristic
of the immature infant, nor were they the smooth, well- controlled movements
typifying the healthy, full- term infant, Rather, their vigorous, intensely
driving responses were indicative of the strong motoric potential of these
infants.Largely controlled by state behavior, most motor activity was seen
when the infant was roused to an active state 5 or 6. When resting or in
quiet alert states, random, non- purposeful activity was rarely seen, and
a position of flexion for both arms and legs was the preferred position.
These intensely motorically active infants could be easily consoled through
appropriately supportive tactile maneuvers. Once in a high arousal state
they were easily brought back to the resting position of flexion in both
upper and lower extremities through the restraining tactile responses of
the examiner. Thus, through these motor responses the infants would communicate
their preference for the type and kind of handling they needed to stabilize
their physiologic state.</p>

<p>Mothers typically administered to the infants' needs with quick,abrupt,
and vigorous movements. Grandmothers, who provided most of the care during
the first month of life, were especially rough in their handling of these
small but- motorically active infants. This type of motor stimulation was
most noticeable during the bathing of these infants. Described as well
by other investigators (Hopkins, 1976, Le Boyer, 197~), the Indian bath
is an elaborate, formal routine of daily massage which begins in the first
few days of life and continues throughout the first year. (Photo I) It
begins by placing the infant prone on the mother's outstretched legs and
in turn each part of the body is individually stretched and prodded. Using
tepid water and soap, the lower extremities are massaged first, and are
followed by the arms, back, abdomen, neck, and face. Exhausted from the
intensity of this stimulation, the infants are swaddled and enter into
a prolonged sleep. The abrupt handling of the infant was only observed
during caregiving activities; at other times no efforts were made to stimulate
the infant motorically. Infants were not played with, jazzed- up, nor engaged
in en face play behaviors. Moreover, their motor activity was usually interpreted
as a signal of distress to which the mothers responded with feeding and/or
rocking. To console by rocking, the infant was placed upright on the mother's
outstretched legs. Continuous rocking movements were instigated by tapping
the infant's back, and the infants were required to maintain adequate head
and neck control, The effect of early and constant motor stimulation on
the pattern of development is apparent from comparative data from a group
of Caucasian American middle- class infants. (Landers, 1983). On the individual
item pull- to- sit, which measures girdle strength as well as the degree
of balance between flexor and extensor muscles, the U.S. infant performed
significantly better than the Indian infant on day 1. By day 10, however,
this pattern was reversed, with the Indian infants' mean reaching a high
of 7.1 in comparison to a U.S. mean of 6.0 (pt .005). It was suggested
that the superior performance of the Indian infants by day 10 is evidence
for the interval between their given biologic potential for early motor
development and the type and quality of environmental stimulation they
received.(Photo II).</p>

<p>Range of State. The items comprising this cluster assess the difficulty
in rousing certain Infants from sleep states to an alert state with disturbing
stimuli, the rapidity which they go from sleep to crying, and the lability
that certain infants demonstrate as they move rapidly from one stage to
another, The ANOVA for this sample did not show any significant change
in the Range of State cluster. The overall mean score of 3.5 suggests that
these infants are performing on the lower end of the scale on the rapidity,
peak and lability of state changes. Generally speaking, the infants were
somewhat irritable, and hypersensitive to stimulation as they moved rapidly
into an intense cry state where they were unavailable to respond and interact
with the external environment. Particularly disturbing is the lack of improvement
in the mean scores of this cluster over time. However, one must note the
large standard deviation for this cluster, which speaks to the potential
of strong within- group differences which may be operative. An analysis
of the infant and biomedical factors which may account for these differences
will be presented.</p>

<p>Regulation of State. This cluster assesses the neonate's use of state
behavior and the infant is assessed for his capacity to shut out disturbing
stimulation. The ANOVA for this cluster was significant and shows a decreasing
linear trend over time from a mean score of 6.5 on day 1 to a scare of
4.9 on day 30. The decrease in mean score on day 30 may speak to the scale's
upper limit for this cluster which was reached for these infants on day
10. Perhaps at one month the infant requires increasingly complex and demanding
stimulation from the environment In order to maintain an alert and active
state. Throughout the first 10 days of the infants' life, they are performing
in the mid- to upper range of the scale. They reacted almost instantly
to being cuddled by the examiner by leaning forward and moulding on the
examiner's shoulder and nestling their heads in a crook of the examiner's
neck. Less optimal behaviors would have been characterized by active resistance
or passive involvement to being held by the examiner. This warm responsivity
to the examiner is an important source of rewarding feedback and indicative
of his positive contribution to the infant- caregiver relationship. An
additional indicator of state regulation is the infant's capacity to exhibit
self- quieting behaviors. Even during the first or second exam an infant
would spontaneously bring his state under control by hand to mouth movements.</p>

<p>Autonomic Regulation. This cluster assesses how the infant is responding
to the physiological demands of his immaturity and the stresses of labor
and delivery. In this exam autonomic stability is measured by (1)tremulousness,(2)
amount of startle during an exam, (3) lability of skin color. As seen in
Table VIII, the ANOVA for this cluster was significant and the difference
in mean scores accounted for by both the linear and quadratic trends. Scores
were in the optimal range on day 1 and increased throughout the first 7
days.</p>

<p>By day 7 the scores had stabilized and reached a mean of 7.6. In general
these infants showed few startles and tremors and had good healthy skin
color which changed only minimally throughout the exam. As suggested by
the results of the Habituation cluster, the optimal autonomic regulation
exhibited by these infants may be related to the practice of swaddling.
These data support the results of previous investigators (Lipton, et al.,
1975; Brackbill, 1973; Giacoman, 1971) and suggests that the technique
of swaddling is related to a decrease in the number of startles seen in
the newborn period. It is suggested that this occurs because of the decreased
afferent proprioceptive stimuli to the central reticular formation of the
brain stem which reduces the overall arousal level. It is further argued
that the constant tactile proprioceptive stimulation of the swaddling material
may be an important motor restraint.</p>

<p>Reflex. The reflex cluster, which sums the total number of abnormal
reflex scores so that a higher score indicates a greater number of deviant
reflexes, shows a significant linear trend (p(.001). The decrease in mean
scores from a high of 2.2 to a low of .5 shows the pattern of recovery
in reflex activity during the first month of life, Of the 16 elicited reflexes
an increased sucking, rooting response, as well as decreased walking stepping,
and incurvation response, accounted for most of the deviation in the early
days of life. The exaggerated sucking and rooting response can be related
to hunger and rate of milk flow (Brazelton, et al., 1976), and in the early
exams these infants did show signs of hunger. The hypotonic walking and
stepping responses seen early on may also be the result of depleted nutritional
stores as a result of poor intrauterine growth. Incurvation of the trunk
often did not appear until the 5th or 7th day exam. Asymmetry was also
apparent with the response first emerging on one side only. According to
Prechtl Beintema,(1964), this response is often absent in the first few
days and thus this decreased response was not indicative of any abnormality.
In general,the reflex activity of these infants was evidence in favor of
an intact central nervous system.</p>

<p>In summary, the repeated measure analysis of variance provided a description
of the BNBAS performance of a group of 30 healthy South Indian newborns
in the first month of life, The most salient finding is the increase in
performance over time on the Habituation, Motor, Autonomic Stability, and
Reflex clusters. For each of these clusters, optimal performance was seen
on day 30, following a general systematic up and down pattern on days 5,
7, 10. On two of the seven clusters, Habituation and Autonomic Regulation,
the infants performed in the optimal range. Mid- range performance was
seen initially on both the Orientation and Range of State clusters and
showed no significant improvement throughout the first month. This behavioral
profile was interpreted as an interactive effect of environment forces
and cultural practices on early infant behavioral and neurological development.
In particular the analysis focused on the following three aspects of their
environments and included (1) the effects of swaddling on infant development,(2)
the type and quality of motor stimulation, and (3)mother- infant interaction
and its effect on the infant's social responsivity. It was suggested that
the optimal performance on the habituation and Autonomic Regulation clusters
was related to the restraining and calming influences of the swaddling
techniques employed by this community. Specific maternal behaviors were
hypothesized to contribute to the development of infant motor activity,
specifically the combination of vigorous motor, stimulation coupled with
constraining and consoling behaviors. Finally, it was suggested that the
poor orientation responses exhibited by these infants was related to the
lack of maternal expectations for social responsivity and the less than
ideal circumstances under which the exam was performed.</p>

<p><b>MATERNAL FACTORS AND BRAZELTON SCALE PERFORMANCE</b></p>

<p>It has been suggested that BNBAS performance is affected by several
infant and maternal biomedical factors and that these relationships may
vary within different cultural groups (Lester &amp; Brazelton, 1982). In
an effort to determine the extent to which these forces are operative within
this sample of infants their BNBAS performance was correlated with a number
of maternal and infant variables. Maternal factors included in the analysis
were age, parity, height, weight, arm circumference, family wealth, and
literacy. Infant behavior was measured by performance on BNBAS cluster
scores at three time periods throughout the first month. Exams performed
on the 1st and 3rd days characterized an early exam, the middle period
consisted of exams on days 5,7, and 10 with the final or late exam performed
on day 30. Several of these correlations were significant and the results
are presented in Table IX.</p>

<p>Maternal Age and Parity. An increased number of deviant reflex scores
were significantly associated with both increasing maternal age and parity.
These correlations reached significance at the p(.005. The Range of State
cluster was as well negatively associated with parity, which suggests that
the infants of multiparous mothers were more irritable, hypersensitive
to environmental stimulus and rapidly came to an alert state during the
administration of an exam, The Habituation cluster, however, was correlated
with parity in the opposite direction, but reached statistical significance
only during the early examination period (days 1, 3). This association
suggested that infants of multiparous mothers demonstrated greater competency
in shutting out disturbing stimuli when in the sleep state. Thus, in spite
of a behavioral profile characterized by irritability, hyperexcitability
and rapid shifts of state, these infants demonstrated an ability for sleep
state regulation. This relationship between parity and BNBAS performance
was described by Dixon, Tronick, Keefer, and Brazelton (1982), as characteristic
of the type of infants produced by the older multiparous Gusii mother of
Kenya. With the exception of the Range of State cluster these relationships
between parity and maternal age and BNBAS performance were not significant
in the final exam.</p>

<p>Maternal Size. Maternal size as measured by height, weight, and arm
circumference was significantly correlated with several of the BNBAS clusters.
The number of deviant reflexes was found to increase as maternal height
and weight decreased. There was no significant relationship between maternal
arm circumference and the number of deviant reflexes. The two clusters
describing the infant's range and control of state behavior were negatively
associated with maternal weight and arm circumference. This suggests that
lighter mothers were more likely to produce quiet, passive infants who
were easily consoled when brought to higher levels of state activity. Autonomic
regulation, which measures the lability of skin color and the number of
startles and tremors during an exam, was negatively associated with both
maternal height and weight. Thus the lighter mothers delivered infants
who showed little or no signs of physiologic stress during an exam. As
evident in Table IX, none of the correlations between maternal size and
infant behavior reached statistical significance on the final exam. Socio-
Economic Status and Education. Socio- economic status, as measured by the
Family Wealth Index and maternal literacy rate were positively related
to infant behavior during the early and middle examination periods. Increasing
education as well as his or her socio- economic rating with both the autonomic
regulation and motor clusters. Thus the more literate mothers from wealthier
families were more likely to produce motorically mature and active infants
who showed few signs of physiologic stress during an exam. During the middle
examination periods the Family Wealth Index was also positively correlated
with the infant's ability to shut out disturbing stimuli as measured by
the habituation cluster.</p>

<p>In summary, even with this normal sample of infants several interesting
relationships between behavioral outcome and maternal status were demonstrated.
It appears that an increase in the number of deviant reflexes was significantly
related to both increasing age and parity and decreasing maternal size.
As Prechtl and Beintema (1964) have suggested, deviant reflexes do not
immediately imply neurological dysfunction but only identify those infants
who may be suspect for future abnormalities. It is interesting, therefore,
that by the late exam period one of the correlations with the reflex cluster
reached statistical significance, suggesting that whatever abnormalities
had been observed initially had been overcome by the organism. The correlation
between the Range of State cluster and maternal perinatal factors was not
in the direction originally anticipated. It was found that high risk maternal
factors such as increasing age and parity and small maternal stature were
associated with increased performance in the infants' capacity for state
control. This behavior is in contrast to the more intense and demanding
behaviors characterizing the infant whose mother did not exhibit these
characteristics. These infants were more effective in eliciting maternal
responsivity through the use of rapid state swings. By crying, they demanded
to be held, cuddled, or fed while the infants of lower weight mothers were
less likely to utilize their state behaviors to elicit maternal responsivity.
It was interesting to note the positive effects of increasing maternal
education on infant performance in terms of motor, habituation, and autonomic
regulatory capacity. The only cluster not affected by the perinatal factors
investigated was orientation. This is of particular interest and suggests
that the given biological capacity for responsive behaviors is not significantly
affected by the perinatal factors, at least within the range exhibited
by this sample of mothers.</p>

<p>As evident in Table IX, the relationship between maternal factors and
BNBAS performance is strongest in the middle exam period (days 5, 7, 10)
which suggests that the environmental factors are exerting their influence
over the biological influences present at birth. The infant's behavior
immediately after birth is more erratic and perhaps because of the similarity
of settings across all babies the effects of environmental influence are
less likely to be manifested. It is suggested that a more consistent picture
of the infants' behavioral profile as it has been shaped by genetic and
intrauterine experience emerges after an initial reorganization period
following birth (Dixon, et al., 1982). Moreover, by the middle exam period,
the infants are adapting to their home environments and the effects of
maternal and environmental variability are more likely to exert their impact.</p>

<p>Infant Physical Characteristics and Brazelton Scale Performance. As
evident in Table X, only a few of the infants' physical characteristics
were significantly correlated with the BNBAS cluster scores, most of which
occurred during the middle examination period. </p>

<p>Birth weight had the most effect on BNBAS outcome, and an interesting
behavioral profile typifying the smaller infants began to emerge. Negative
associations were found for the Habituation and Range of State clusters.
This suggests more optimal performance by the lower weight infant in the
ability to shut out disturbing stimuli and the capacity to move slowly
from one state to another. Thus the lower weight infants could both maintain
deep sleep states and are somewhat less vulnerable to the manipulations
and ministrations of the examiner. Because of their optimal state regulation
they were less easily excited and came to and maintained an alert state
4 for longer periods of time. An increase in the number of deviant reflexes
was related to low birthweight, an association which was significant on
both middle and late exams.</p>

<p>The association between motor performance and birthweight was positive,
which suggests that the heavier infants had more optimal motor behavior,
as assessed by tone, maturity, pull- to- see behavior, defensive movements,
and activity, An enhanced motor performance was also positively related
to birth length during the middle examination periods. There were no significant
associations between head circumference and infant behavior. Weight at
one month was positively correlated to the Orientation cluster on the final
exam and negatively correlated to the reflex cluster during the middle
examination period. Thus, those infants who weighed the most at one month
exhibited better alerting, orienting, and following responses to both inanimate
and animate stimulation. The relationship to the Reflex cluster implies
that the number of deviant reflexes seen in the middle examination period
was greater for those infants who weighed less at one month. The Ponderal
Index (P.I.), which is a length for weight ration, was computed for each
infant and correlated with BNBAS cluster scores (Brazelton et al., 1976).
The P.T. was used in the assessment of fetal malnutrition such that a Low
score indicates thinness and a high score obesity. The P.I. was associated
in the early exam period with the reflex cluster and with the State Regulation
cluster in the middle exam period. These correlations suggested that a
P.I., indicative of thinness, was associated with an increased number of
deviant reflex scores and a decreased capacity for state regulation. These
infants were somewhat more irritable, hyper responsive to stimulation,
and less able to console themselves when upset.</p>

<p>These data suggest that the low P.I. and lighter weight infants in the
sample are somewhat, although not dramatically, distinct and rather curiously
so, as their associations to INBAS cluster scores were not always in the
direction anticipated. It appears that the low P.I. infants had less capacity
for state regulation and an increased number of deviant reflex scores.
The smaller weight infant had better habituation and range of state performance
with an increased number of deviant reflexes and poorer motor performance
than the heavier infants in this sample.</p>

<p>In order to obtain a more complete understanding of the effects of birthweight
and the ponderal index on infant behavior, a one- way repeated measure
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed to see if either birthweight
or P.I. had any effect BNBAS performance. The sample was divided into 3
groups according to the 75th, 50th and 25th percentile distribution for
birthweight and ponderal index. The percentile distribution for birthweight
defined the following groups: Group I included those infants weighing below
the 25th percentile of 2,525 gms, Group 2 consisted of infants with a birthweight
of or below the 50th percentile, while Group 3 included those infants falling
above or below the 75th percentile, which was calculated at 3,030 gms.
The sample, when divided according to the distribution of P.I. scores,
was classified as follows: Group 1 had an index on or below the 25th percentile
of 2.11, Group 2 consisted of those infants with a P.I. of or below the
50th percentile of 2.24, while Group 3 had a P.I. below or above the 2.50
which was the 75th Percentile Rating, the BNBAS outcome was measured by
the rate of change in performance as estimated by the slope of the best
fitting regression line for each of the clusters.(Landers, 1983) The slope
of the best fitting regression line, computed for each of the 7 BNBAS clusters
was used to indicate the rate of change on that cluster over the first
month of life for each of the 3 birthweight groups as well as each of the
3 P.Z. groups. As a result of these two analyses, it was found that neither
birthweight nor P.I. had any significant effects on the rate of change
in BNBAS cluster scores. It appears that the trends observed from the correlational
analysis between BNBAS performance and infant factors were not apparent
upon further inspection of the data. In light of this information, one
may conclude that the variability in BNBAS performance as measured by the
rate of change in cluster scores exhibited by this sample of infants cannot
be accounted for by the singular effects of either birthweight or ponderal
index.</p>

<p>The simple correlation analysis of maternal, infant, and environmental
factors on infant outcome in the first three months presented in the preceding
discussion, indicated several important relationships which may be operating
within this sample. Such an analysis however was based on the assumption
that there are clear sequences of linear causality between variables of
infant risk status and later developmental outcome, Based on the extensive
reviews of single- factor studies and their inability to explain relations
between risk factors, one is well aware of the limitations inherent in
this approach.(Clarke and Clarke, 1976; McCall et al., 1972; Sameroff and
Chandler, 1975). By contrast, risk scores that are based on multiple factors
produce clearer results (Hobel,'et al., 1973; Prechtl, 1968). It is hypothesized
that the combination of risk variables will account for a greater amount
of the neonatal variability exhibited by this sample. For a more complete
understanding of the interaction between the biologic, cultural and social
factors, the reader is referred to the multiple factor analysis performed
on this data set. (Landers, 1983).</p>

<p>Anthropometric Indicators. In an effort to monitor the path of early
infant growth anthropometric data and Bayley scores were obtained at 3
months. All assessment procedures were performed within the home environment.

<p>The weight at 3 months ranged from 4.0 kg - 8.0 kg with a mean of 5.92
kg. Males were slightly heavier than females with a mean of 6.0 kg and
5.84 respectively. When the weights of the Indian infants were compared
to U.S. standards the following picture emerged. For boys, 12% were above
the 90th percentile, 332 fell between 50th and 90th percentile; 22% fell
between 50th and IOth percentile while 22% fell below the 1Oth percentile.
For girls the weight distribution according to U.S. standards was as follows;
33% fell above the 90th percentile, 33% fell between 50th and 90th percentile,

<p>As the graphs portray, the velocity of growth from birth to 3 months
is quite remarkable. The average gain in weight was 3.16 kg which is compared
to an average gain of 2.5 kg for U.S. infants (Lowery, 1973). According
to Western pediatric standards, birthweight should double by 5 months (Lowery,
1973). For this sample, 65% of the infants had doubled their birth weights
by three months. The two additional measures of infant growth, length and
head circumference, showed similar increases throughout the first 3 months,
The mean crown- heel length was 61.3 cm which corresponds to the 90th percentile
of U.S. standards. Similarly, the mean head circumference for this group
(40.3 cm) corresponded to the 50th percentile. By comparison, it is interesting
to note that at birth, the mean head circumference for this sample fell
below the U.S. 1Oth percentile.</p>

<p>The mean weight for this sample is slightly higher than the weights
reported by various investigators throughout India (Udani, 1963; Currimbhoy,
1963; Swaminathan, Jyothi, Singh, Madhavad, and Gopalan, 1964; Ghai &amp;
Sandhu, 1968; ZCMR, 1972). The All India mean weight for 3 month old infants
is 4.0 kg, while the mean reported for this sample stems in part from the
selection of only healthy full term infants and its longitudinal design.
Moreover the majority of Indian investigations have been cross- sectional
and include infants of all birth weights.</p>

<p>Bayley Performance. The Bayley Scale was administered to each infant
and the Mental Development Index (MDI) and Psychomotor Development Index
(PDI) were calculated (Bayley, 1969). These indices are a normalized standard
score with a mean of 100 and a range from 50- 150 which covers more than
3 standard deviations on either side of the mean. For this sample, the
mean MDT was 108.6 with a range of 72- 131. The motor index yielded a slightly
higher mean score of 129.2 and a range which spanned the entire scale.
It was further noted that 23% of the Indian infants had a motor index of
140 or above, a score achieved by less than 10% of the U.S. infants. While
Indian infants performed similarly to U.S. infants in tasks of cognitive
development, specific items on the motor scale were in advance of the norms.
These included the gross motor abilities such as head balance, sits along
momentarily, and the ability to roll over from back to stomach. More than
50% of the Indian infants at 3 months of age passed these items in comparison
to the mean age of 4.2, 5.3 and 6,4 months for the standardized U.S. sample.
In fine motor performance, partial thumb opposition while holding a cube
was more advanced for the Indian sample. These data add support to the
notion of an enhanced motor development suggested by the analysis of Brazelton
data in the first month of life.</p>

<p>As indicated in the table, the MDI and PDI were highly correlated at
.64 which supports the premise that early motor and cognitive development
are highly correlated. It is argued that motor development, through its
emphasis on and concern with the development of sensory and motor processes
associated with active movement and physical exploration of the external
environment, provides the basic foundation for the development of a higher
ordered information processing system upon which more sophisticated perceptual
and cognitive processes are ultimately built. The evidence suggests that
the feedback provided to the young infant as a result of its active exploration
and interaction with the environment is a stimulation for continued perceptual
and cognitive growth.(Williams, 1983). While there were no significant
correlations between the MID and anthropometric variables, the PDI was
correlated with both the infant's weight(.53) and length (.39) at 3 months
and suggests that the larger infants were more motorically advanced than
the smaller infants. Furthermore, the PDI was significantly correlated
to weight at one month (.50) and positively although not significantly
related to weight at birth.</p>

<p>In summary, the data described the growth of a group of healthy infants
which can be characterized by a dramatic rate of physical growth, advanced
motor performance and patterns of cognitive development similar to the
standards defined by U.S. infants. This pattern of development mirrors
the course of adaption witnessed in the first month of life.</p>

<p><b>DISCUSSION</b></p>

<p>Based on conceptions of high risk perinatal factors in pregnancy developed
in this country (Prechtl, et al. 1968; Hobel, Hyvarinen, and Okada,1973)
many of the mothers in this sample would have been placed in a high risk
category. The factors, such as low weight, small stature, high parity,
poor pregnancy weight gain, non- antiseptic techniques, and unmonitored
deliveries, coupled with the environmental conditions of crowded, poor,
dark huts would have defined them at risk. In spite of these circumstances
the infants produced were small but motorically organized and physically
intact. Those infants with a low P.I. indicative of intrauterine malnutrition
did not exhibit to the same degree the hypersensitive, irritable behaviors
characterizing the full term but undernourished infant from this country.
The pattern of recovery exhibited by this group of infants throughout the
first month of life was even more dramatic by 3 months of age. Their developmental
profile was characterized by an increased velocity of physical growth,
advanced motor development and patterns of cognitive performance which
were similar to standards set by U.S. infants at three months of age. The
data presented here bring to the forefront a number of increasingly complex
and important issues in infancy research. Although exploratory in nature,
these findings challenge a number of widely accepted assumptions concerning
the relationship between pre- and perinatal circumstances and infant growth.
In accepting this challenge one is required to acknowledge a number of
models that may be operative. These data lend themselves to the consideration
of three perspectives which include, (I) the efficacy and adaptability
of the biological organism to overcome the demands of a stressful environment,
(2) the effectiveness of culturally adapted infant rearing patterns, and
(3) the unique psychological make- up and identity development of the Indian
woman. The insights provided by these perspectives will be discussed.</p>

<p>Biological Adaptability. In the first instance it is suggested that
the behavior of this group of infants exemplifies the adaptability of the
human infant when confronted with continued and persistent stress to return
to a predetermined developmental pathway. In this perspective one does
not wish to underemphasize the stressful nutritonal, obstetrical, and social
factors of the maternal pre- and perinatal environment but rather to underscore
the awesome capacity of the species to adjust in accordance with the degree
of stress imposed, The developmental pattern described by this group of
infants emphasizes the preadapted variability in the human infant, especially
as it functions to overcome the obstacles to growth under less than ideal
circumstances. They demonstrated the ability of the human species to over
come deflection and to return to a predetermined developmental pathway
which, as Waddington (1962) has suggested, is in itself a biological goal.
This process was particularly salient in the dramatic catch- up weight
gain exhibited by this sample during the first three months of life. By
three months of age 58% of the infants were above the 50th percentile of
weight based on U.S. standards as compared to the birth weights where only
one infant was above the 50th percentile and 48.22 fell below the 1Oth
percentile.</p>

<p>The pattern of infant feeding displayed by this community was characterized
by constant maternal proximity and availability which enabled breast feeding
on demand. It is argued that the biologic capacity for catch- up growth
is inherent in our species, and the maternal feeding practices described
allowed this preprogrammed adaptability to unfold. For example the antibodies,
lysozomes, lympocytes, macrophanes and other components of colostrum and
transitional breast milk, serve to defend against infection which may have
been the major 'predator' during evolution (Stohiar, Pelley, Kaniecki-
Green, and Klaus, 1976; Jelliffe &amp; Jelliffe, 1971; Gyorgy, 1967; Goldman&amp;
Smith, 1973; Lozoff, Brittenham, Trause, Kennell, and Klaus, 1977). Because
of these properties, a significantly enhanced resistance to enteric infection
has been observed among breast fed babies not only when the environment
is favorable but also when the environmental sanitation was at less than
acceptable levels (Mata, 1978; Mata b Wyatt, 1971). In addition the composition
of breast milk is particularly well suited to the pattern of feeding exhibited
by the mothers of this community, In species which nest or cache their
infants, breast milk is high in protein and fat,mother- infant contact
is intermittent and feedings are spaced from 2 to 15 hours apart (Dumond,
1975). Be receiving their total nutritional requirements in short periods
these infants are adapted for long separations. In contrast, species which
are carried by, hibernate with, or follow their mothers have low fat,low
protein breast milk, constant maternal- infant contact, and essentially
continuous feeding (Ben- Shaw~62). Human milk is low in fat and extremely
low in proteins. Since human infant is immobile at birth, the insights
of comparative physiology have identified the pattern of human care as
that of carrying and continuous feeding (Blurton- Jones, 1972). Thus the
cultural patterns of continuous feeds, made possible through constant maternal
availability, support, reinforce, and enhance the biologic pre- adaptability
of our species. When viewed in this light the ability of these small infants
to exhibit catch- up growth is simply part of the developmental script
of the human species. The more enlightening issue raised by these data
relates to our understanding of developmental deviations. It suggests that
early deviations from expected patterns of growth occur from environmental
forces which constrain and defeat the organism's selfrighting tendencies
and inherent ability to return to the path of normality (Sameroff, 1975).</p>

<p>Child Rearing Patterns. A second conceptual issue raised by the data
relates to the role of the child rearing environment and its ability to
influence the developmental pathway. It is proposed that in this highly
supportive environment even the most vulnerable infants were integrated
into the family in a manner which fostered- their capacity for recovery.
In commenting on this issue LeVine (1977, p. 16) states, &quot;. . . that
cultural evolution within human populations also produces standardized
strategies of survival for infants and children, strategies reflecting
environmental pressures from a more recent past, encoded in customs rather
than genes and transmitted socially rather than biologically.&quot; The
patterns of infant rearing exhibited by this community and their effects
on development address specifically the quality and quantity of tactile-
kinesthetic stimulation and the degree and kind of maternal social responsivity.
A review of the possible effects of these behaviors on early infant development
follows.</p>

<p>As described earlier, the motoric stimulation received by these infants,
reflected in the elaborate daily bath and massage, seemed particularly
well- suited to these motorically precocious infants and paved the way
for increasingly complex motor organization. At three months of age they
were above U.S. standards for motor development as measured on the Bayley,
with certain items involving head control 2- 3 months ahead of U.S. norms.
Active motoric stimulation was complemented by swaddling techniques which
seemed to be related to an increased capacity to habituate to disturbing
stimulation and maintain autonomic regulation as measured by the Brazelton
scale throughout the first month. It was suggested that these tactile-
kinethestic ministrations are directly related to the advanced motor performance
characterizing this group of infants in the early months of life. Rapid
motor development in infancy has been reported by other cross cultural
investigators (Super, 1981a; 1981b). Fundamental to all these cultures
is the increased amount of kinesthet stimulation, maternal proximity, and
rapid response to distress signals.</p>

<p>Experimental studies of the human infant given supplemental kinesthetic
stimulation confirm these findings. Kinesthetic stimulation was found to
exert a reinforcing effect on the smiling response of four to five month
old infants (Brossard &amp; DeCarie, 1968) and to be more effective than
tactile stimulation in soothing the neonate (Korner &amp; Thoman,1972).
In another study, premature in supplementary kinesthetic stimulation by
rocking for 30 minutes each day had significant weight gains when compared
to matched controls (Freedman, cited in Ambrose, 1969). Scarr- Salapatek
and Williams (1973), investigating the effects of early stimulation on
low birth weight infants, found that infants who received increased visual
tactile and kinesthetic stimulation in the first year had better grasp
reflexes, greater alertness, and increased weight gain at 4 weeks of age
and higher Cartel scores at one year. In a study of six month old infants,
Yarrow,Rubenstein, and Pedersen, (1975) found that among all the sensory
modes investigated, kinesthetic vestibular stimulation was of singular
importance.</p>

<p>A second area in which the culture of Indian infancy exhibits an adaptive
pattern of response, focuses on the type and quality of maternal social
responsivity. Mothers, following rather than leading while interacting
with their infants, responded instantly to the slightest indication of
infant distress. In the early months of life distress hunger call and the
infants pacified by feeding, Particularly apparent was the paucity of maternal
vocalizations directed towards the infant in conjunction with caregiving
behaviors. Although their environments exposed them to a constant stream
of human speech, they were rarely the direct recipients of vocal exchange.
The adaptive element of maternal behaviors concealed in patterns of child
rearing is suggested by these observations. One may assume that the Indian
mother's immediate response to her infant's distress is an adaptive reaction
to the pressures of a harsh physical environment and threats of high rates
of infant mortality. At the same time,her behavior conforms to the culture's
emphasis and value for dependency at the expense of behaviors which shape
the infant towards autonomous, creative and individualized functioning.</p>

<p>A number of investigators have been concerned with the specific effects
of contingent responsiveness distress on infant development. Lewin and
Goldberg (1969) suggested that the infant's awareness of a contingent relationship
with his caregiver promotes cognitive development and reported a significant
relationship between maternal contingent behavior and the infant's habituation
to a redundant stimulus, a measure believed to be a primary indicator of
cognitive development. in a study of the maternal responsiveness to an
infant's cry, it was found that a decreased latency of response resulted
in a decreased amount of crying in the first year. Speculating that the
infant's use of the cry as social communication is enhanced by the maternal
contingent response, the authors rejected the notion that a rapid response
to crying may interfere with the child's level of competence (Yarrow et
al.,1975). A study of 6 month old infants reported by Yarrow et al.(1975)
found that a high level of maternal contingent response to distress was
associated with higher scores on the Bayley scale. In addition, three measures
of cognitive motivation were positively associated and included goal directedness,
reaching and grasping, and secondary circular relations. In interpreting
these results the authors speculated that immediate response to an infant's
distr$ss may facilitate the infant's motivation to interact with the environment.
Goal directedness, a measure indexing persistent attempts to secure objects
not immediately available, and secondary circular reactions, behaviors
involving the repetitionof actions to produce feedback, may be early expressions
ofthe infant's~attempt to master the environment. The observations of the
present study support the results of past investigators, and suggest that
the rapid maternal responsivity to an infant's cry reinforces active coping
with his environment and enhances his persistance in eliciting feedback.</p>

<p>In describing the beliefs and practices typifying early infant care
in this South Indian community, the analytical framework of childrearing
as cultural adaptation defined by LeVine (1977) is particularly applicable.
The data presented here support his conclusion that culture no less than
biology contributes to the way in which parents perceive the tasks of childrearing.
Moreover these ways are rational, and contain information about environmental
contingencies previously experienced by the population and assimilated
into its cultural tradition. parents who ridgidly conform to customary
prescriptions may be unaware of their past or present efficacy but may
view them as religiously or ethically ordained. Finally as LeVine states,
if we are to understand the constraints within which cultural values operate
and to assess the prospects of change, the adaptive component concealed
in childrearing customs must be clarified (LeVine, 1977, p. 17).</p>

<p>Maternal Commitment. Finally, the ability of these infants to meet the
demands of their environment warrants the investigation of the powerful
psychosocial commitment of the Indian mother to the survival of her infant
and the confidence with which she ministers to his needs. The maternal
behaviors defined a pattern of responsivity rather striking to the Western
observer. From the moment of birth the infant is greeted and surrounded
by unyielding physical ministrations, and the Indian mother is inclined
towards total indulgence of her infant's wishes and demands. As previously
described, this deference and indulgence in Indian motherhood has psychological
origins in the identity development of the Indian woman (Kakar, 1978).
It is argued that this psyche- social development evolves from the interplay
between universal processes of human development and the set historical
trends,religious ideals and social institutions unique to the Indian culture.
It is further suggested that the maternal response to the demands of her
infant reflect both her deeply rooted emotional stance towards her infant
and the culture's perception of and value for che child. The Indian mothers'
psyche- social commitment to her child emerges out of an extended family
system which instructs, rewards, and supports her in these efforts. According
to Kakar's (1978) analysis, this deference and indulgence in Indian motherhood
has psychological origins in the identity development of the Indian woman.
As a daughter, an Indian girl is but a sojourner in her own family, and
in marriage her status is changed to daughter- in- law rather than wife.
It is only with motherhood that she comes into her own and can establish
her position within the family, community and the life cycle. Her role
from thence forward is a powerful one. According to the teachings of her
culture and reflected in the popular devotional Krishna mythology, the
child has been traditionally perceived as a completely innocent being,
a gift of the gods, towards whom one is expected to shower their deepest
protection, affection and indulgence (Kakar, 1979). According to traditional
Hindu thought, it is the child, in his spontaneity and intense capacity
for sorrow and joy, who comes closest to the divine state. It is the adult
who must learn what it is the child has to teach (Kinsley,1977).</p>

<p>As these data emphasize, the application of universal risk factors in
development muse be viewed with caution for the mechanisms through which
they exert their effect varies both between and within cultures. For a
given factor, the degree of risk imposed is directly related to the culturally
defined structures and institutions which have evolved to buffer its impact.
Thus, we must continue in~our efforts to construct paradigms that allow
for the systematic analysis of the contexts which directly and indirectly
influence the developmental pathway.</p>

<u>MOVING TO SCALE:</u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u>Early Childhood Education Project in Kenya</u>
</h3><p>
<u></u><p>
<u>A note for discussion from the Bernard van Leer Foundation</u><p>
<p>
<p>
For more than a decade the Kenya Institute of Education within the Ministry of
Education has collaborated with the Bernard van Leer Foundation in a project to
enhance the quality of pre-

school
education in Kenya. Starting in 1972, this project launched in Nairobi a small,
intensive man-

power
and curriculum development programme. After gradual changes in strategy, the
project was operating, by 1982, in five districts of Kenya varying from central
urban to coastal and isolated mountain environments. From this evolved
strategies for mutual support between pre-

school
and community, in-

service
training, localized curricula and materials. Based on the experience of the
project, the Ministry of Education is now setting up a national programme for
training and support of pre-

school
teachers and other kinds of child workers. For this a national centre for early
childhood education is being created within the institute of Education with
small satellite centres being set up in various districts.<p>
<p>
This paper attempts to describe the project history to allow for a thorough
understanding of most of the processes underlying its growth, of which many
were planned but many were unforeseen. Thus the Kenyan case provides a vivid
backdrop against which a number of questions pertinent to this conference can
be posed.<p>
<p>
How can a controlled exercise in educational innovation in an area which is not
a top national priority develop both as a technically sound undertaking in
itself and as a mechanism for influencing evolution of policy in directions
favourable to low-

cost
early education for the deprived child?<p>
<p>
What are the criteria used in recruiting project staff, what weight should be
given to formal education as opposed to non-

formal
education, socio-

economic
background and personality features such as creativity and flexibility?<p>
<p>
As chance and unforeseen factors play important roles in evolution of projects
how, then, should projects be designed as to allow for unplanned
developments?<p>
<p>
Under what conditions and for what purposes should projects be assisted by
external or expatriate advisers?<p>
<p>
What sort of relationship should be pursued in working with local authorities
and communities to permit optimal cooperation and sustainability?<p>
<p>
What measures should be taken to successfully include the elusive poorest of
the poor into social intervention programmes ?<p>
<p>
<u>The term pre-

school
education</u> is used in this paper to describe early childhood education
structures for children up to 6 years. In urban areas there are private nursery
schools which charge high fees and also day nurseries run by the Nairobi City
Council which cater for children of parents from all socio-

economic
levels. In rural Kenya the structures are somewhat different. The pre-

school
education system has its origin in the self-

help
movement known as harambee, where the community is responsible for building the
nursery schools and employing the teachers and other workers.<p>
<p>
Construction and maintenance of the physical plant lies almost entirely with
the community. The parents as well as professionals who support these pre-

schools
largely perceive their benefit not only in academic preparation for primary
schooling but also in provision of health and care for their children as many
parents are involved in development activities which leaves them little time to
take care of their children.<p>
<p>
What is significant to observe here is the expansion of the pre-

school
movement in Kenya within the harambee paradigm. In 1968 the number of children
enrolled in self-

help
pre-

school
institutions was nearly 180,000. Now enrolment has risen to roughly 500,000.
However, the proportion of children between 3 and 6 years in early childhood
frameworks still remains<p>
slightly less than 20% of the total age group. This represents only 10% of the
total child population estimated at 4.5 million. Considering that Kenya's
population growth rate is 4%, a major effort is indeed required to provide
adequate services for all children.<p>
<p>
<u>Start-

up
of the project</u><p>
<p>
For the Kenyan educators who would soon be involved in the project supported by
the Bernard van Leer Foundation, the essential challenge was to enhance
dramatically the quality of nursery schools which had been created. They felt
this challenge was closely linked to the staff's lack of training and to the
limited training resources in the country. A number of agencies and ministries
were involved in providing training for pre-

school
teachers. However the output from these efforts was small and training
opportunities by-

passed
the nursery school workers who lacked basic educational qualifications needed
to enter formal training programmes.<p>
<p>
In 1969, first contacts between Kenyan authorities and the Bernard van Leer
Foundation took place they agreed on cooperating on developing a cognitively-

oriented
experimental training programme in early childhood education. The intended
programme was very modest in scope: to train a small cadre of supervisors who
might in turn give training to others. From this point, however, the
Foundation, the Ministry of Education and, in particular, the Kenya Institute
of Education which carried out the project, has taken it through many
metamorphoses.<p>
<p>
The six year project proposal agreed on in 1971 called for the development of a
teacher training programme, a model nursery school curriculum and the training
of personnel to serve as nursery school supervisors.<p>
<p>
<u>Nairobi Project 1972-

1976</u><p>
<p>
At the outset it was decided to place the project within the Kenya Institute of
Education (KIE), a department of the Ministry of Education. This decision meant
that some time and effort would be required initially to build resources-

-
human
and material-

-
in
the early childhood domain as the<p>
Ministry of Education had not previously been involved in this field.<p>
<p>
A second important decision was to mount the project in Nairobi as it was
argued that the necessary infrastructure for early childhood education was
strongest in and around the capital. It turned out however that due to
difficulty in eliciting local cooperation the project did not succeed in
entering the poorer areas of the city.<p>
<p>
Project activities began in 1972 at the Kenya Institute of Education and up to
1975 the project trained 45 teachers and supervisors from the city, education
and public health departments. All participants were trained primary school
teachers drawn from various schools in the city. Although they were qualified
teachers they tended to be rigid and formal in their practices -


a result of their previous experiences. That this added further challenges to
the project trainers is implied in the comment of one participant:<p>
<p>
I still remember some (participants) refusing to make materials, such as papier
mache, since it looked messy. When we were digging the small shamba near the
Institute some refused to hold jembes (hoes) or to carry things to the store or
sweep the classroom.<p>
<p>
These obviously were activities not done in primary schools.<p>
<p>
The two year training programme for Nairobi teachers had two major components:
one year of residential training and one year of internship. The residential
course dealt with child development, educational psychology, play and physical
activities, language skills, number work, and environmental activities, music
and movement, creative abilities, health and safety and the development of
materials. The course unintentionally focused on work with 5 year olds only.
The scope of the course has however widened significantly later on. During the
internship year the teachers worked in day nurseries or pre-

school
units attached to some primary schools.<p>
<p>
The training programme succeeded in bringing about major, positive changes in
the teachers' skills and behaviours. Their placement in pre-

school
units after completion of the training programme helped stimulate the expansion
of pre-

school
units from four in 1974 to forty-

one
in 1984. Over the subsequent five years, many of the teachers remained active
in the field of early childhood education and care, some of them taking up
training or supervisory roles as originally envisaged.<p>
<p>
The period of the Nairobi project provided an excellent opportunity to build
capacities of-

the
project unit not only in training, but also in planning and evaluation. A
dedicated core staff was formed. They have remained with the project for more
than a decade -

-

providing remarkable continuity, technical excellence and field knowledge. This
group participated in all aspects of project development including training,
evaluation, planning and the alteration of plans. This cadre also started
developing new strategies for project implementation. For example, as they
have described it:<p>
<p>
At this stage, the project staff decided to depart from the usual curriculum
development procedures which rarely involve teachers and children. Instead the
project staff drew heavily on the experience of the teachers and involved them
in actually writing the books. The staff considered this an important step
because teachers can communicate with other teachers through examples of what
they themselves have carried out successfully and through their knowledge of
the problems they have encountered.<p>
<p>
<u>Curriculum</u><p>
<p>
The books and manuals produced at this time had an urban bias and were too
sophisticated linguistically for use in rural areas. Nonetheless, the materials
eschewed a "canned" approach to curricula, emphasized the development of
curriculum materials together with the training process, and emphasized the
well rounded development of children presenting approaches that stimulate
children's ideas and interests through manipulation of the local environment.<p>
<p>
The project has conscientiously avoided developing a prescriptive national
curriculum for pre-

school
education in view of the University of cultures, language and environment which
would be the main sources of curriculum. In lieu of this, it has collected,
organized or produced learning and teaching materials. Teachers guides and
resource books have been developed, and so have children's books in three local languages. Proto-

types
of concrete and manipulative materials have also been developed with the
teachers/parents manual on how to make them. Throughout, the project has linked
training and curriculum development processes closely. The training
has aimed to stimulate the teacher to be major source of suitable curriculum in
that she relates the activities to her environment. During the training the
teachers and trainers have to draw heavily on their own experiences and
environment to build up a store of methods and materials.<p>
<p>
In part, this strategy may have derived from making a so-

called
virtue out of a necessity as there is no established system for distribution of
educational materials for pre-

schools
and nurseries around the country. Furthermore, the task of providing curricula
or other printed materials in
major local languages would be formidable.<p>
<p>
<u>Move to Rural Areas 1976-

1978</u><p>
<p>
As pointed out the main aim of the project was the development of pre-school
education manpower. Training was therefore the main component of the total
project. After the two training programmes were completed the need to move to
the rural areas was evident if the project was to come out with a viable
training programme that could be replicated throughout the country.  These
would have facilitated the experimentation of materials and training styles in
the rural setting where a majority of the community nursery schools are to be
found.  Surveys were  conducted in a number of districts and municipalities and
Kiambu and Murang'a were selected as both councils had shown great interest in
pre-

schools
and had employed a large number of teachers from which the project could select
trainees for its training programme. Between them there were, in 1975, about
650 pre-

school
teachers working largely supported by the County Councils or parents'
communities.<p>
<p>
As project staff expected, they found that the rural teachers, without training
and with limited reading skills or experience in using printed materials,
tended to "teach" little children in ways unrelated to their needs. As a staff
member of the project noted:<p>
<p>
Teaching is mainly verbal and little attempt is made to help children develop a
basic understanding of concepts that lay the foundation for future learning. A
lot of time is spent on memorising letters and numerals and on rote counting.
Singing is a major part of the daily programme. Many songs are in English. The
teachers generally have no specific aim in teaching these songs and are not
concerned about whether the songs are meaningful to the children. In language
activities, children memorise English words with their meanings in the mother
tongue. The teacher places great emphasis on training in English, as this is
equated with education. Despite these shortcomings, children who have been to
nursery school settle down quickly when they enter primary school because they
have learned to listen to the teacher, to concentrate for a period of time and
to interact with other children. (A-

p.9-
10)<p>
<p>
Little had been done to analyse the needs of children and teachers. With this
in mind, the team reformulated project objectives to emphasize: the assessment
of existing rural pre-

school
services, the development of ideas which would make maximum use of available
resources; the development of training programmes by providing assistance to
the teachers themselves to acquire skills in devising appropriate materials and
curricula for their children; motivating teachers to cooperate and share their
knowledge with other teachers in their area. This basic restructuring of
project objectives eventually led to the development of a wide range of
strategies for in-

service
training.<p>
<p>
Another new aspect was that the project took considerable pains from the start
to gain the commitment of rural authorities and set up mechanisms for
collaboration with rural County Councils and parent groups. Discussions were
held with the local leaders and Council officials where the project's aims and
intended operations were spelled out while taking into account the Council's
needs and their abilities to participate in this joint venture. The County
Councils, for example, agreed to provide assistance by releasing selected
teachers, providing suitable training sites, providing some materials and
transportation.<p>
<p>
During the same period the induction of district trainers began whereby able
teachers who has been identified as capable of in-

servicing
other teachers were picked from the former Nairobi trainees to join the project
in Murang&#146;a and Kiambu.<p>
<p>
A major change in the project was the dramatic redesigning of the training
programme. The one year residential training course provided in Nairobi was too
costly and impractical for rural teachers, therefore, a six month in-

service
course was designed in which residential training alternated with pre-

school
teaching practice. The Residential sessions were held during the holidays so
that schools would not be without teachers during the term. The organisation of
the six month training programme is shown in the following diagram.<p>
<p>
<i>The inter-

relationship
of the residential and the field components.</i><p>
<center>
<img src=boxes.gif alt="Diagram">
</center>


<p>
<p>
The training methodology has also altered for these rural courses. As the
project staff noted:<p>
<p>
The majority of these teachers did not terminate their education prematurely
because they were incapable of continuing; rather there are many socio-

economic
factors which contributed to their dropping out of school. These teachers are
highly respected in their communities and they have a very warm and friendly
relation with the community. Many of these teachers have a very high degree of
commitment to their job. This is exemplified by the fact that in some cases
they go for long periods without salary and when they get it, it is only a
small amount. These teachers have a wealth of knowledge on how children grow
and develop.<p>
<p>
The programme was practical, taking off from problems identified by the
trainees themselves. A great emphasis was placed on alternative uses for local
materials, on stimulating the development of language skills in the local
language, and on providing more time for health, nutrition and agricultural
subjects.<p>
<p>
A new perspective began to emerge among project staff which was subsequently
reflected in their programming style. In the words of one project staff
member:<p>
<p>
How would you like to train someone who has not acquired basic skills in
literacy and numeracy to become a pre-

school
teacher and hence charged with the difficult task of preparing children for the
skills of literacy and numeracy? Would you imagine training people who can not
do written assignments because they just cannot communicate in the medium of
literacy?<p>
<p>
This is the situation that the project has been attempting to deal with. Using
a participatory approach we formulated an on-

job
training programme whereby the project staff interacted with the teachers in
given contexts within the country. The project staff helped these teachers to
acquire basic pedagogical skills and professional skills which were geared
toward increasing their understanding of how children grow and learn. In the
course of working with these teachers, we found many positive things about them
which made our experiences with them very fascinating.<p>
<p>
The courses for each group of teachers last about six months. An important
paint to lay emphasis on is the fact that the project has categorically adopted
the view that the in-service
course should be organised within the context in which the participants are
working. In other words, courses should take place in the home district of
those attending teachers. This means the project team has to move from the
Headquarters to the project site whenever there is a course taking place. -

-
This
operational model has illuminated a lot of interesting observations
particularly in the areas of centre/peripheral and change agent/client system
relationships.<p>
<p>
<p>
Modifications were made in the programme as a result of the experience gained
in each of the training courses in Murang'a and Kiambu. For example, it soon
became obvious that organised follow-

up
with the trainees was needed after the end of the courses. Secondly, and
importantly, a
system gradually evolved whereby trainers were selected from the group of
trainees in each course. These trainers, after receiving more training
themselves, subsequently came to design and conduct in-

service
courses for other teachers in their areas. Thus, although only 35 teachers
participated in the initial Kiambu course in 1977, a small number of trainers
drawn from this group subsequently provided seminars and six month courses for
300 other teachers. Murang'a likewise started with 20 teachers and by now a
further 282 teachers have been in-serviced
since 1980.<p>
<p>
By 1978 when the first stage of Foundation funding was coming to an end,
flexible strategies had obviously emerged for upgrading pre-school
education. Furthermore, the emphasis had gradually shifted from the provision
of training per se to providing experiences for skills development together
with mutual support among teachers in using new skills. Project evaluation
indicated that, while in terms of the number of teachers thus far trained
(about 100) and the materials produced, this had not been a low-

cost
project, the strategies were apparently effective and could, over the long run,
result in low-

cost
programming. At this time the agreed period of funding came to an end. The
project in the meantime felt that further activities in the rural programme
would result in more effective strategies for developing of pre-school
work drew up a proposal for continued collaboration with the Foundation for
another three years. This constituted phase II of the project.<p>
<p>
Central components of project activities were to be: the preparation of
trainers, provision of district-

level
training programmes, community involvement and expansion of the project to two
rural districts.<p>
<p>
<u>Training of Trainees and District Courses 1979-1982</u><p>
<p>
A further two rural districts were: Keiyo/Marakwet, and Kilifi were involved
during this phase of operations. The proposal had called for preparation of
trainers as a central component of the project activities. It was hoped that
through further training the trainers would develop the skills and competence
in organising and running in-service
courses for teachers in their own districts. These potential trainers were
trained through;<p>
<p>
a.	attachment - this means that the trainers who are attached to the project staff for a period
of time ranging from a few weeks to four years. For some trainers it meant
working with project staff on a full time basis participating in the planning
and executing of all project activities. For others they came in on a more part-

time
training involving working with a member of the project but without resuming
full responsibility for the tasks at hand.<p>
<p>
b.	seminars and workshops -


this was another approach to the preparation of the trainers. Seminars and
workshops were held in the project districts. During these seminars/workshops
the problems encountered by the trainers in the course of their duties were
discussed and solved. Trainers were also given further guidance in planning
their in-service
courses and in making field observations of the teachers at work.<p>
<p>
c.	on-the-job training -


a more informal way of training was through joint participation with the
project staff in the training programme organised for teachers in the
participating districts.<p>
<p>
These trainers in turn organized and provided in-

service
courses for untrained teachers as the diagram below shows.<p>

service
courses. Instead, they developed a system of attachment in which a group of
untrained teachers is attached to a trainer for a period of apprenticeship.
This apprenticeship is augmented by consultations between the trainer and
teachers. Most of the trained teachers in the district have, through this
apprenticeship system, assisted in training others.<p>
<p>
In addition to the flexible training strategies, another aspect of the
programme was the attempt to involve the sponsors of early childhood centres as
<u>partners</u> in the training programme. This was necessary to ensure
sustainability and quality at the end of the project intervention. Thus local
authorities provide support for the training, payment of salaries; or some
teachers and provision of materials. The communities also participated in
provision of physical facilities, feeding programmes in some schools and in the
day to day running of the centres.<p>
<p>
<u>Assessment</u><p>
<p>
Assessments of the project have demonstrated that a shift has occurred in
teaching practices away from rote learning to varied participatory approaches.
Teachers are extraordinarily successful at collecting and using local materials
in imaginative ways. Project evaluation suggested that there may be a need for
some further guidelines for self-

for use by teachers and trainers.<p>
<p>
About half the teachers and trainers had seven years of formal schooling. Those
with more, particularly from Nairobi, tended to be less flexible in adopting
new teaching styles. Specialized training on-

school
perform better in their first year of primary school. Children whose teachers
have been trained by the project, appear to exhibit more exploratory behaviour
and have greater command of their local language.<p>
<p>
Evaluation has shown that the project has elicited continued involvement and
commitment from parents and teachers extending far beyond the period of direct
interaction with project staff. In several cases, the project has freed mothers
for economic/agricultural activities and older siblings to attend school.<p>
<p>
The project evaluation is also demonstrated that certain minimal conditions are
required in order for the educational strategies to be effective. These pre-
                                                                                        
conditions
include basic transportation infrastructure enabling movement of teachers,
trainers and materials.<p>
<p>
<u>Development of a Nationwide Programme</u><p>
<p>
By 1984 the project had trained 800 teachers who work with about 32,000
children in five districts. The experience in programme development had been
extensive. Furthermore a critical core of project staff and trainers had grown
over the years and remained remarkably stable, without the staff transfers and
attrition that affect many programmes. The project had demonstrated that:<p>
<p>
-A narrow vision of early childhood education as the domain of the small group
of expert curriculum planners and training specialists can be replaced by a
more realistic strategy of programme development drawing on the knowledge and
skills of all those involved in the education process;<p>

In terms of policy, in 1980 the Ministry of Basic Education was vested with the
responsibility for the coordination of pre-

within the Ministry headquarters and the Schools Inspectorate. The two
departments cooperate closely with the Kenya Institute of Education.<p>

It is planned that the programme will be developed, as before, in deliberate
stages drawing on the training resources and experience from the current KIE
early childhood programme. Some new elements will be added; while others will
be expanded or modified. Among the latter are strategies which build on early
childhood education as an entry point for community development. The project
has considerable in empowering and mobilising parents and community members.
New actions will be stimulated in relation to health, nutrition, community well-

Another challenge for the programme will be to reach out beyond the 20% of the

collaboration. The Foundation, after receiving the proposal, for example, has held several discussions with UNICEF staff. The Foundation is providing support

the training of trainers and will serve to help support and coordinate
activities among the district centres in the network. Other agencies are (or

The
initiation of the project with the Ministry of Education which had not
previously been involved in early childhood education implied that part of
project resources and time would be devoted to building the capacities and
building on the potential of the Ministry. It also introduced some political
constraints against which the new project had to contend in eliciting the
cooperation of other agencies. The fact that the Ministry of Education was
assigned responsibility for pre-

Selecting
Nairobi as the starting point for the project, as had been suggested by the
Foundation may have caused some delays. Some observers suggest that the donor's
decision may not have been correct and, in part led the project to begin on too
small a scale, possibly below the critical mass needed for an experimental
programme, Others argue that it was essential to start in Nairobi on a small
scale and expand carefully from there.<p>

The success of this project seems to derive in part from its administrative
flexibility and the foresight of its staff in trying out less orthodox
approaches and capitalising on all manner of local resources. A case in point
is the careful selection of potential pre-

The project developed as a process, as a result of planning-

rather than as a blueprint scheme. Thus, in the future it is expected and
indeed planned that there will be variation, innovation and change in the
programme as it enters new districts. The strategy remains flexible.<p>

Another
important factor in project development was serendipity; which permitted a
relatively slow metamorphosis from a small, rather costly urban model to a low-

expatriate technical assistance for programme development. In keeping with the
policy of the Bernard van Leer Foundation, no outside personnel were attached
to the project. Nor does the Foundation have a representative or field office
in Kenya or Africa. Of course, this cuts costs. However, far more important is
the point that the project would probably not have developed as subtly or along
what might be called such 'relevant' lines had outsiders been in or near
decision-

Another
key to the growth of the project was its ability to draw upon the demand for pre-
                                                                                        
school
education, Indeed all project districts were selected on the basis of having
already a high level of demand as implied by their relatively extensive early
childhood centre infrastructure.<p>
<p>
Coupled to this, but somewhat distinct, was the capacity of the project to draw
upon traditional Kenyan experience in self-

It should be noted that in some areas programme development was side-
                                                                                        
tracked
by local elites; however, in general Harambee provided essential contributions
to the programme.<p>

Another
important element in project development is its essentially <u>contractual</u>
basis with local authorities. Local committees and district councils must first
indicate, not only a willingness to collaborate, but must allocate resources
for training and follow-

activities. One obvious<p>
implication is that the project must expand gradually. A second point is that
it would be almost impossible to <u>impose</u> the programme nationally by
fiat. These are features that arguably have enhanced the sustainability and
growth of the programme, avoiding the 'flash-

but a programme which is expanding across the nation.<p>

"Goodness
of fit" has been a key element in the development of this project. Community-

project development. This is not unusual of course. In many situations, both

donations to the project up through 1982 amounted roughly to US$100,000
annually at current prices. In practice most inputs were local, however; and
the tilt toward local input increased as the project developed. The district
councils and parents committees provide teacher<p>
salaries; the communities build and maintain the centres. In some cases they
also provide food. The teachers and trainers, who receive very small salaries,
must be very dedicated indeed to undertake training and carry out their daily
work-

Local
costs and inputs are relative. It appears that when the relative local costs
are too high the project can not and perhaps should not be implemented. In the
face of famine, community disorganisation and the absence of infrastructure,
the strategies collapse. However, it appears to provide greatest benefits to
children as self-

model in rural areas where certain threshold conditions prevail, where there is
a basic transportation infrastructure, and minimal but adequate levels of
nutrition are attainable and where the local community is already seeking ways
of
improvement. Where these conditions are met, within a fairly broad range of
environments, the project seems to have a high potential for diffusion and
sustainability. Thus, for example, local training programmes have continued in
four out of five of the project districts, funded by district
government or parents, after the withdrawal of the project.<p>

	The purpose of this paper is to provide the Secretariat of the Convenio Andres
Bello with suggestions for possible work that would help to improve the
integral development of the 17 to 18 million young children under the age of 6
years<b>[1]</b> who are living in the participating
countries of the Convenio.  Special attention will be given to children living
in conditions that put them "at risk".  In order to arrive at those suggestions
in a systematic and grounded way, it seems appropriate, first, to clarify some
basic concepts, to establish a framework for analysis and to describe, as best
as possible, the situation of children in the region.  Suggestions will also
take into account what is already being done in the region, including
activities that are funded by other international organizations in support of
child development in the region.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>I  KEY CONCEPTS</b><p>
<p>
	Although the focus of this paper is on learning and education during the
pre-school years, the key phrase to be used will be "child care and
development."  This requires some clarification of the terms and of their
relationship.<p>
<p>
	<b>Learning</b> is a process of acquiring knowledge, skills, habits and values
through experience and experimentation, observation, reflection and/or study
and instruction.  <b>Education</b> is the process of fostering learning.
<b>Schooling</b> is one form of education.<p>
   <p>
	<b>Pre-school education</b> is used in common parlance to identify educational
programs occurring outside the home and provided to children <b>during their
immediate preschool years</b>, usually from ages 4 through 6.  This education
focusses typically on cognitive development and the preparation of children for
school.  During the last decade or so, formal preschool programs have been
complemented by experiments in "non-formal" preschool education.  Often, these
non-formal programs share methodologies and contents with formal preschooling
and, as formal preschools, are located in a center outside the home.  They are
characterized as "non-formal", however, because the program workers are not
paid for their work as part of the formal system of education.<p>
<p>
	<b>Initial education</b> is a broader concept than preschool education, as
described above.  The term refers to programs intended to enhance early
learning through some kind of guided educational process directed to children
throughout their pre-school years, i.e., <b>from birth until entrance into
primary school</b>.  Initial education can include programs that focus on
enabling parents to be better educators of their young children as well as on
programs directly involving children.  Therefore programs of initial education
need not be center-based but can occur through, for instance, home-visiting.
This term is not in common use in all countries of the Convenio does not serve
our purposes as well as it might.<p>
<p>
  <b> </b>	<b>Child development</b> is understood as a holistic process of
change in which a child learns to manage ever more complex levels of moving,
thinking, feeling and relating to others.  This definition goes beyond
cognitive or mental development to include physical, social and emotional
development.  These dimensions of a child's development are distinct but are
organically interrelated.  Learning is a crucial part of development.  General
development involves both 1) a gradual unfolding of biologically determined
characteristics and 2) a process of learning that occurs as children interact
with the people and things that make up their environment.<p>
<p>
	A program of <b>integrated child development</b> attends to physical, mental,
social and emotional needs of a child.  In so doing, it incorporates attention
to nutrition and health status as well as to the psycho-social well being of
children.  Often, however, programs labeled as child development programs are
not comprehensive or integrated, concentrating instead on mental development
and leaving aside attention to physical or social developmental needs.  These
narrow programs are very similar to most pre-school programs.<p>
<p>
	<b>Child care</b> consists of the actions necessary to promote survival,
growth and development<b>[2]</b>.  Care includes
attention to health and nutrition as well as to psychological and social needs
of children.  In theory, a child care program should go beyond protection or
custodial care of children to include all elements of an integrated child
development program, including stimulation and attention to mental and social
development.  In fact, many child care programs are purely custodial, providing
shelter, food, protection from accidents and monitoring of health, but little
else.<p>
<p>
<p>
	In brief, the phrase, "child care and development"  (defined in an integral
way) is favored in this discussion of programs over "pre-school education" in
order to promote a broader view of learn-ing and education than is usually
captured when talking about "pre-schools" or even about "initial education".
Moreover, this is the phrase adopted at the World Conference on Education for
All (WCEFA) in its "Framework for Action to Meet Basic Learning Needs".  Among
the goals that countries were urged to pursue, within a broadened concept of
"basic education," was:<p>
<p>
"Expansion of early childhood care and development activities, including family
and community interventions, especially for poor, disadvantaged and disabled
children." (Paragraph 8).   <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>II  A PROGRAM FRAMEWORK</b><b>[3]</b> <p>
<p>
	Because child development and learning occur as children interact with their
environment, it is essential to take into con-sideration in programming both
the changing condition of the child (at birth and along the way), and the
changing condition of the various environments affecting the child's
development.  According-ly, the framework to be presented below has two
dimensions, one referring to changes in the child, the other to complementary
programs that are related to different levels of environment affecting a
child's development.  <p>
<p>
	<b>The changing child.</b>  The condition of the child at birth depends on
genetic endowment, but also on the health and  nutri-tional status and habits
of the mother during pregnancy.  Similar-ly, the developmental status of a
child in the early years depends both on the natural unfolding of abilities as
a child matures physically and on health and nutritional conditions affecting
that maturation.  <p>
<p>
	The changing condition of children during the early years requires changes in
the kinds of programs directed to children as a child matures, in accordance
with their developmental stage.  A newborn child is obviously not the same
child as a child who has just developed the ability to walk and talk or as a
child in the immediate pre-school years.  If a child development strategy is to
be comprehensive, it should respond to changing needs throughout the
development process.  It is not enough to begin programming for child
development when the child reaches age three of four.<p>
<p>
	Because child development follows a general pattern (even though the process
will vary from individual to individual and culture to culture), it is possible
to establish program activities appropriate to general stages or levels of a
child's development.  These stages, which define the first dimension of the
framework, correspond roughly to certain age periods and might be distinguished
as follows:<p>
<p>
    	a prenatal period.<p>
    	infancy (up to about 18 months) that encompasses weaning, learning to walk
and early language development.<p>
    	a toddler and post-toddler period (about 18 to 48 months) during which a
child's coordination, language, ability to think and social skills advance
rapidly.<p>
    	a preschool period (approximately ages 4 and 5) when coordination is
relatively well developed, and when cognitive development and development of
pr-literacy and pre-numeracy skills occurs quickly, along with greater
attention to relationships with peers.<p>
    	a period of accommodation to school and the world at large (roughly ages 6
to 8).<p>
<p>
	Within governments, the organizational responsibility for programs of early
childhood development is usually divided and tends to follow developmental
stages and/or the age of children.  Responsibility for the first three stages
described often falls to the health sector or to organizations concerned with
family welfare.  Form age three or four onward, child development is more
likely to be associated with education and preschools.<p>
<p>
	This division is logical in the sense that survival and the early months of
development are closely tied to the biophysical conditions and maturation of
the child, and, during this time, most children are cared for within the
family.  In the later preschool years, socialization and preparation for
schooling take on greater importance, and the circle of caregivers widens.<p>
<p>
	However, this division of organizational responsibility also hides the need
for continuous attention of a coordinated nature.  It reinforces the
unfortunate tendency to omit psychosocial components prior to age three and to
think of child development programs as essentially educational programs
beginning at age three or four.  In order to counteract the tendency to
restrict programming for school development to one particular age group (for
example, the immediate preschool period) and to provide continuity for the
changing child, a comprehensive program framework must distinguish, but
include, all of the several period described above.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>Environments and related program approaches.</b>  Following Bronfenbrenner
(1979), the environment of the developing child can be examined at several
different levels.  The most immediate en-vironment is that provided by the
child's mother and other family members within the home.  The family or home
environment is set within the community environment.  Communities and families
are affected by a broader social and institutional environment, including
social laws and organizations.  Finally the way in which institutions and
families function is influenced by more general conditions which include
geographic, economic, and demographic circumstances as well as a general
cultural ethos guiding behavior for the society as a whole.  These different
"levels" of environ-ment will all affect the way in which a child is brought up
and learns.  Consequently, an overall strategy for child develop-ment and
learning should include not only programs that provide direct attention to the
child, but also programs directed toward families, communities, social
institutions and broader cultural norms.<p>
<p>
	From the above we can derive <b>five complementary program approaches</b> to
enhancing early childhood care and development.  Although all five approaches
are intended to enhance early childhood development and are therefore directed
in the last analysis toward improvements in the child, each approach is
directed, initially, towards a different audience or program participants.
Table 1 sets out these different participants (or in the unfortunate language
of some programming, "target groups").  The table also summarizes objectives
and suggests variations in the models that might be applied within each of the
general approaches.  <p>

<p>
<p>
	Briefly described, the five complementary approaches are as follows:<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Attending to children in centers.</b>  The immediate goal of this
direct approach, focussing on the <b>CHILD</b> is to enhance child development
by attending to the immediate needs of children in centers organized outside
the home.<p>
<p>
	2.  <b>Educating and enabling caregivers.</b>  This approach focuses on
<b>FAMILY</b> members and is intended to educate and "empower" parents and
other family members in ways that improve their care and interaction with the
child and enrich the immediate environment in which child development is
occurring rather than provide a substitute for it.<p>
<p>
	3.  <b>Promoting child-centered community development.</b>  Here, emphasis is
on working to change <b>COMMUNITY</b> conditions that may ad-versely affect
child development.  This approach stresses community initiative, organization,
and participation in a range of interre-lated activities, to improve the
physical environment, the know-ledge and practices of community members, and
the organizational structure, allowing common action and improving the base for
political and social negotiations.<p>
<p>
	4.  <b>Strengthening institutional resources and capacities.</b>  There are
many <b>INSTITUTIONS</b> involved in setting the climate for programs and in
carrying out the three approaches mentioned above.  These include governmental
and non-governmental institutions.  Included in this category programs that set
national policies and <p>
provide the legal underpinnings for functioning of institutions.  Also included
are programs of training, provision of materials, and experimentation with
innovative techniques and models (improving the available "technology."<p>
<p>
	5.  <b>Increasing awareness and demand.</b>  This program approach
concentrates on the production and distribution of <b>KNOWLEDGE</b>.  It may
function at the level of policymakers and planners, or be directed broadly
towards changing the cultural ethos that affects child development and/or the
participation in programs.<p>
	<p>
	Bringing together the two dimensions of the program framework, gives us
Diagram 1.  In theory, all of categories defined in the diagram should be
attended to.  Rarely, however, will it be possible for any one program to cover
all the categories and multiple efforts will be required for maximum effect.
<b>This framework allows us to locate where present programs are concentrated
and to see where the gaps are in programming.</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Program Guidelines.</b>  A third dimension could be added to the program
framework dealing with program guidelines.  A detailed discussion of guidelines
will not be offered here.  However, in Appendix A of the paper, seven
guidelines are set out which, taken together, could provide a litmus test for
programs found in any of the categories of the framework.<p>

<b>III  COUNTRY CONTEXTS</b><p>
<p>
	At the most general level of environment influencing the early development and
learning of children are a number of cultural,  social, economic and
demographic conditions, some of which are shared among countries of the
Convenio, some of which are very different from country to country.  <p>
	 <p>
<b>Common elements</b><p>
<p>
	The countries of the Convenio Andres Bello are subject to a number of common
influences and changes affecting child development that should be taken into
account when examining existing programs or when looking to the future.  These
common influences include:<p>
<p>
	<b>1.  500 years of cultural hegemony.</b>  Even the most resistant native
cultures of Latin America have been influenced to some degree by the Conquest
and its long aftermath.  In the sierran countries of the Convenio, the tensions
between indigenous and Spanish cultures endure seen, for instance, in the
controversy over using the mother tongue or Spanish for teaching in primary
schools and pre-school programs.  Also enduring is the influence of the Roman
Catholic church which, over the centuries, has helped to establish particular
beliefs and values, including those affecting childrearing (CELAM, 1992).
Against this background and fore-ground, <b>special consideration of indigenous
groups and of their practices and beliefs must be included when formulating
programs.</b> <p>
This holds for all the countries of the Convenio, but in differing degrees.<p>
<p>
	<b>2.  The advance of technology on many fronts</b> -- in transportation,
communication, education as well as in industry and commerce -- has not only
brought new ways of doing things, including raise children; it has also helped
to provoke a general clash of values.  That advance, with origins in "science"
and an occidental culture places competition, individualism and consumerism
against cooperation, solidarity, and spiritualism.  It has helped to dampen the
force of tradition and experience.  It has brought bottle feeding and plastic
toys and television other accoutrements of childrearing that were not available
in the past and which often substitute today for more traditional childrearing
technologies.  In programming, it is imperative not to forget or prejudge
traditional wisdom and experience.<p>
<p>
	At the same time, technological growth is providing opportunities for new
forms of learning.  For instance, the percentages of families that now have
access to television as well as radio is extremely high in most countries of
the region.  <b>The mass media, must be considered as a separate learning
channel, reinforcing or working against learning that occurs in the home, the
school and the community at large.</b><p>
<p>
	<b>3.  Urbanization.</b>  All countries in the Convenio can now be termed
"urban" countries, including Bolivia which, according to the most recent
statistics has just crossed the line to become 50% urban.  This long term trend
toward urbanization has been accelerated by economic declines and civil
disturbances over the last decade or more.  With the move to urban areas, old
ways of doing things do not always apply.  The space and conditions in which
children are reared change markedly requiring shifts in policy and practice.
With this growth and associated changes, <b>much more attention to marginal
groups in urban areas appears to be imperative.  </b><p>
<b></b><p>
	<b>4.  Economic decline during the "lost decade" of the 1980s.</b>  Without
exception, the countries included in the study suffered major economic declines
during the 1980's, affecting employment levels, increasing the number of people
living in poverty (IDB, 1990).  Of the seven countries, only two, Chile and
Colombia, show a positive average rate of growth in per capita income during
the decade.  In Bolivia, Panama, Peru and Venezuela, the average rate of
<b>decline</b> was 2% or greater.  <b>These declines make more urgent the need
for actions benefitting women and children who have been the hardest hit.</b><p>
<p>
	<b>5.  The impact of the neo-liberal economic policies</b> applied in an
attempt to overcome the economic problems of the 1980s.  The so-called
neo-liberal economic policy has been characterized by economic programs
providing incentives to attract local and foreign investment, and favoring
large scale industry and a shift to cash cropping, while increasing economic
inequalities, placing additional burdens on the poor and reducing social
spending.<p>
<p>
	The combination of the economic recession and of the neo-liberal policies has
led to a marked increase in the level of poverty in the region and has forced
more and more families to pursue survival strategies.  Economic pressures not
only lower the level of resources available to meet daily needs, but also
affect livelihood and work patterns, family structures and relationships, and
childrearing practices and patterns.  <b>These realities suggest that some
"compensatory" programs may be necessary even while working to construct new
opportunities together with the most affected groups.</b>   <p>
<p>
	<b>6.  The continuing move of women into the paid labor force and into
non-formal employment</b>.  Associated with economic pressures and changes,
urban growth and shifting values is an increase in the participation by women
in the paid labor force.  The percentage of the paid labor force that are women
varies from 19.3 percent in Ecuador to 28.5 percent in Chile (see Table 1).  In
all countries, however, there has been an appreciable increase in that
participa-tion over the last three decades.<p>
<p>
	Because societies still assign primary responsibility for childrearing to
mothers, this shift, when combined with a decrease in extended families and
with longer periods of children in school has brought with it a demand for
alternative forms of childcare and rearing outside the home.  Or, it has forced
adjustments in practices and patterns of child care which allow women to
combine work and care.  <b>Recognizing this trend makes more urgent the need to
respond to the intersecting needs of women and children in programs of child
care and development.</b><p>
<p>
	<b>7.  An impressive reduction has occurred in the rate of infant mortality
--</b> even in a time of economic difficulties.  With this reduction has come
an increasing shift from a cultural orientation focussed on accepting death and
promoting the survival of children, with its harsh tone based on a high
probability of an early death, to a more optimistic and open cultural
orientation toward growth and development.  This change needs, however, to be
reinforced and <b>the two approaches -- survival and development -- need to be
linked in action as well as in rhetoric.</b><p>
<p>
<b>Differences</b><p>
<p>
	For all these similarities, policy makers and programmers in countries of the
Convenio are confronted by very different constellations of demographic,
cultural, social and economic characteristics (see Table 2).  There are, for
instance, 13 times as many children under the age of 5 in Colombia as there are
in Panama.  Per capita incomes range from US$620 (Bolivia) to US$2560
(Venezuela).  The percentage of people living in rural areas ranges from 50%
(Bolivia) to 10% (Venezuela).   Cultural diversity is extraordinary, within as
well as among countries.  Literacy rates for adult women range from 43%
(Bolivia) to 93% (Chile).<p>
<p>
	There are, as well, major variations in the access to services and in the
distribution of services between urban and rural areas.  Whereas Venezuela and
Chile provide potable water to 90 and 89 percent, respectively of their
populations, Bolivia and Ecuador report serving only 53 and 58 percent
respectively.  In Peru, 61 percent of the population has access to water, but
in rural areas that percentage drops to 10 percent.  This contrasts with
Colombia which reports almost equal percentages for urban (88) and rural (87).
Access to health services runs from 36% in rural Bolivia to virtually 100% in
urban Chile.<p>
<p>
	Obviously, planning to promote the healthy development of young children will
be heavily conditioned by these differences.  If the bulk of children have no
access to health services, the option of linking developmental programming to
the activities of the health sector is not a very good option, at least in the
short run.  <p>
<p>
	In brief, all of the above similarities and differences have had their
influence on child development by affecting the immediate physical and social
environments in which children are reared, by affecting the values toward which
childrearing is directed and some of the beliefs that underpin traditional
practices, and by affecting the technologies available to be applied in the
process of childrearing.  An obvious conclusion is <b>that although there may
some general strategies that are pertinent for the region as a whole, some
options will not be pertinent to particular countries and important differences
will have to be respected as these are operationalized.</b><p>

<p>
<p>
<p>
	From Table 3, it is clear that:<p>
<p>
	1.  With respect to the mortality rates, Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador are well
above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean; Chile, Colombia, and
Panama are well below; and Venezuela is somewhat below the average.<p>
<p>
	2.  Low weight for age (moderate and severe malnutrition) is greatest in
Bolivia, Peru and Ecuador, less so in Colombia and Venezuela, and virtually
eliminated in Chile.<p>
 <p>
	These basic figures reinforce the common sense conclusion that the situation
of children is worse in the poorer Andean countries of Bolivia, Peru and
Ecuador than in other, better-off Convenio countries.  If one were to use the
relative situation of children as a basis for establishing priorities about
where to work, these three countries would seem to be the obvious candidates.<p>
<p>
	Missing from Table 3 is an idea of the psycho-social condition of children in
the various countries.  <b>This is because there is no commonly accepted and
incorporated form of measuring and monitoring psycho-social development at a
national level.</b><p>
<p>
	Only in Chile is there an established system of monitoring psycho-social
development based on a measurement instrument developed in the country.<b>[4]</b>  Continuous monitoring in Chile over more
than 10 years shows that although the nutritional status of children improved
markedly during the period, the psycho-social status did not improve.
Moreover, the psycho-social monitoring shows clearly and consistently a
divergence in development as of approximately 18 months between children of
middle and upper classes and children living in conditions of poverty.<b>[5]</b>  <b>The clear conclusion is that it is not
enough to provide support for health and nutrition; support for psycho-social
development is also needed.</b>  <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>V  PROGRAMS FOR YOUNG CHILDREN</b><p>
<p>
	In this section, we will concentrate on programs that have (or are supposed to
have) a component directed toward improving the learning and/or psycho-social
development of young children.<b></b><p>
<b>	</b><p>
<b>	A.  Center-based programs</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	Formal Preschools.</b>  The best documented of the programs that include a
stimulation or learning component are formal pre-school programs.  Table 4
provides the most recent figures available from the regional office of UNESCO
for enrollments in preschool in the Convenio countries.  The table also shows
trends in these countries over the past few years, disaggregates figures by
gender and shows the percentage enrollment in private institutions.  Appendix B
provides additional tables, on a country basis, disaggregating figures by
age.<p>
<p>
	It is evident from these tables that:<p>
<p>
	1.  A slow but steady growth from 1988 to 1991 has occurred in most countries,
with significant increases registered between 1990 and 1991 for Venezuela and
Colombia.  In the early 1980s, the growth was even greater.   (For the Latin
American region as a whole, it was estimated by UNESCO that from 1980 to 1986,
coverage more than doubled.  Tedesco, 1989.)<p>
<p>
	2.  Comparing the preschool enrollment figures with the estimated population
of children under 6 years of age (making an estimate based on the figures
presented in Table 2 which give figures for children under the age of 5) for
each country, the coverage appears to be relatively low with only Venezuela
reaching more than one-fourth of the children.<p>
<p>
	3.  If enrollment figures for five-year olds are compared with the number of
children estimated to be age five, the percentages are much higher, ranging
from 20 percent to 56 percent.  Coverage for children ages 3 and 4 is less and
has not grown as much over the same period.<p>
<p>
	4.  Coverage for children under the age of 3 remains very low.<p>
<p>
	5.  Girls are only slightly under-represented in the enrollment figures,
constituting about 49% of the total.<p>
<p>
	6.  Private pre-schools account for about 50% of the enrollments in Chile and
Colombia, with lower, but significant representation of the private sector in
Peru and Bolivia.<p>
<p>
	7.  There is a relatively high concentration of pre-schools in urban areas --
over two-thirds.<p>
<p>
	Points 6 and 7, taken together, suggest that the formal pre-school system is
heavily biased toward the wealthier and toward urban children.  Poorer and
rural children, if in any system at all, are in non-formal education or day
care arrangements.  <b>This raises questions of quality and equity.  It also
suggests that if the Convenio wishes to direct its support toward children most
in need, it would not do so through the formal pre-school system.  Or, it would
do so in selected portions of that system that are directed toward children in
rural and urban marginal areas.</b><p>
  <p>
<p>
	<b>Non-formal Pre-schools and Programs of Child Care and Development.  </b>The
preschool figures that have been presented in Table 4 provided by UNESCO do not
reflect accurately the partici-pation of children in programs of care and
development that contain an education component.  It seems reasonably clear
from the figures that both non-formal preschool programs and programs of child
care (which have an educational component) have been left out.  That may
because these programs lie outside the responsibility of ministries of
education or are not considered within the standard definition of
"pre-school."<p>
<p>
	Although no systematic information seems to be available across countries
about non-formal preschool systems or about center-based child care programs,
it is clear that these programs are a significant force in several of the
countries, particularly in Venezuela, Colombia, Peru and Chile.  In Venezuela,
for instance, a major program of home day care is being mounted through the
Ministry of Education, in conjunction with non-governmental organizations.
Coverage is estimated at somewhere in the neighborhood of 200,000, with
projections to much higher levels.  <p>
<p>
	In Colombia, the Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar extends to
approximately 800,000 children (as of January, 1992), ages 2 to 7 years of age
and another program covers approximately 800,000 children.  At least 250,000
additional children are enrolled in Pre-school Child Care Centers.  If these
figures were included, the coverage for programs of early childhood would be
about four times higher than that reported in Table 4.  Moreover, the age
distribution would change; more younger children would be included.  A bias
toward urban areas would remain.  The private sector's share in providing care
and development for young children would be reduced from more than one-half
(when only formal pre-schools are considered) to about one-ninth. <p>
<p>
	The non-formal education system in Peru (PRONOEI)  at one point reached almost
250,000 children.  (Current figures were not available at the time of this
writing.)  Plans are now being discussed to extend the non-formal system to
600,000 or more children.<p>
<p>
	In Chile in 1990, approximately 110,000 children, ages 2 to 6, were estimated
to be in programs run by the Junta Nacional de Jardines Infantiles (55,000),
the Fundaci&oacute;n de Jardines Infantiles (41,000) the Fundaci&oacute;n de
Jardines Infantiles y Navidad (4,000) and assorted non-governmental
organization (10,000) (Comisi&oacute;n de Educaci&oacute;n Parvularia, 1990).<p>
<p>
	In addition to the above, a major program of home day care has been funded for
Bolivia which is projected to include more children than the current preschool
program.  Ecuador is in transition to a new early childhood program in which it
is to place much greater responsibility on non-governmental organizations.<p>
 <p>
	<b>The above suggests that the decision to take "child care and development"
as the focus of discussion rather than "pre-school education" is not a trivial
decision.</b><p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>B.  Programs of Parental Education and Enablement.</b><p>
<p>
	Even less information is available for programs that approach early childhood
care and development through work with parents or other family members.  In
general, the education sector does not register programs of adult education
that include a parental education component; nor do they register specific
programs of parental education.  We have little idea, therefore, to what extent
parents are being reached with educational programs that will enable them to
improve their parenting.  Colombia has carried out a significant experiment in
a program called PEFADI.  In Chile,<p>
the Padres e Hijos Project has shown excellent results and a broader program of
parental education is being mounted, but with less attention to a community
dimension.<p>
<p>
	Various health and nutrition programs in the region include adult education
components, but at the time of writing no inventory of such programs was
discovered. <p>
<p>
	Although the statistics are not solid, the following conclusions are ventured
on the basis of informal discussions:<p>
<p>
	1.  Parental education has not been pursued vigorously.<p>
<p>
	2.  Most program efforts are relatively small scale.  <p>
<p>
	3.  Exceptions are the occasional programs of mass communication directed to
parents, through newspapers or television or special publications such as
"Facts for Life" created by UNICEF.  What these open programs lack is a link to
group discussions that will make the information come alive, that will allow it
to be internalized, and will provide the kind of social support needed for the
information to be acted upon.  For these reasons, such programs might more
logically be classified under the final strategy -- increasing public
awareness.<p>
<p>
	4.  There has been very little done to evaluate systematically the effects of
parental education programs.  Nevertheless, <b>this approach seems to hold
promise for the important task of improving the care and development of
children in their earliest years (0-3) at a reasonable cost and with integrated
content.</b><p>
<p>
 <p>
	<b>C.  Child-centered Community-Based Programs.</b>  Community-based programs
may include within them both attention to children in centers and programs of
parental education and empowerment, but should go beyond them to change
conditions at the community level that affect the development of children.
This includes changes in both the physical environment of the community and in
the ability of communities to organize for action and for negotiation with the
rest of the society of which they are a part.<p>
<p>
	As with the parental education approach, comments on child-centered
community-based programs, as carried out in the Convenio region must be
impressionistic.  A systematic inventory is not at hand.  My impressions are as
follows:<p>
<p>
	1.  Many child-centered community-based programs have been carried out on an
experimental, pilot or demonstration basis.  For the most part, these have been
projects of non-governmental organizations, often funded by foundations or by
international NGOs.  Many of these projects have been "successful" but are
difficult to duplicate on a large scale because they require continuing
dedication, a long term view, tolerance of local differences, and a willingness
to allow local participation in planning and implementation -- all of which is
difficult to obtain as programs grow large.<p>
<p>
	2.  Most governmental programs that are classified as community-based are so
in name only.  Community participation is often defined in terms of one-time
contributions such as the construction of a building and does not include
on-going participation in planning and implementation.  Or, community
committees are controlled politically from the center and do not include
representation of that part of local communities who are most in need.<p>
<p>
	If these impressions are correct, then adopting a truly community-based
strategy that empowers communities, taking the child as a starting point.<p>
<p>
	<b>D.  Institutional Strengthening Programs.</b>  With few exceptions,
institutional support for programs of early childhood care, development and
education are weak.  Training is often provided for program staff, but in short
term courses at the outset of a program, with an occasional "refresher" course,
seldom linked to work on the job.  Or, training is in formal institutions that
are long on theory and short on practice, more oriented to middle-class and
formal pre-schools than to community-based programs or to reaching those most
in need.  Little attention has been given to the training of planners or
program evaluators.  Supervision is probably the weakest link in most programs,
receiving very little support if it exists at all.<p>
<p>
	Materials are continually being created but are often produced in small
numbers and are not accompanied by the training needed to be able to do them
well.  And, adjustments are seldom made for cultural differences.   <p>
<p>
	<b>E.  Increasing Awareness and Demand.</b>  In Ecuador and Chile and
elsewhere, inserts in national newspapers have apparently been effective means
for communicating to the public.  A great deal more could be done through the
training of journalists to exploit this resource.  To create program demand,
popular theater has been used in Bolivia.  A best seller titled "Early
Stimulation" was published in Chile. <p>
<p>
	In brief, there seems to be no lack of "targets of opportunity" to improve the
quality of early childhood care and development programs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>VI - SOURCES OF PROGRAM SUPPORT</b><p>
<p>
	Just as in the discussion of programs in the previous section, we will
concentrate in this section on support directed to programs that are education
programs (integrated or not) or are integrated child care and development
programs.  No attempt will be made to try and characterize sources of support
for sectoral programs in health and nutrition programs, although these will
have important potential effects on early childhood development and on rare
occasions may include a psycho-social component.<p>
<p>
	Even with this limit placed, the discussion must continue to be
impressionistic and will be incomplete.  To do a complete job would involve
detailed analyses of government laws and budgets and a more complete knowledge
of non-governmental, inter-governmental, bi-lateral and multi-lateral
organizations activities and budgets than we could possibly do in writing this
paper.  Nevertheless, the effort to characterize what is being done by others
is crucial to the desire of the Convenio to, on one hand, avoid repeating what
others are doing and, on the other hand, to look for possible partnerships.<p>
<p>
	The discussion will deal separately with national and international sources of
support.  Appendix C provides considerably more detail about support being
provided within the region by particular organizations: The World Bank, UNICEF,
the Bernard van Leer Foundation and international NGOs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>National Sources</b><p>
<p>
	A proper analysis remains to be done of national sources of support for
programs of early childhood care, development and learning.  A better
understanding of national programs and of support, particularly by governments,
should be forthcoming from the scheduled meeting in September under the
auspices of the Organization of American States. <p>
<p>
	<b>Governments.</b>  Governments appear to be the main source of support for
programs of early childhood care and development.  They provide legal and
regulatory support as well as financial support.  <p>
	In some cases, the legal and regulatory support surpasses the ability of
governments, or of the institutions outside the government that it is hoped
will be affected, to live up to the law.  In other cases, laws are outdated.
Or, the ability and willingness to enforce laws is lacking.  <b>A systematic
analysis of laws and regulations remains to be done in various countries.</b><p>
	Some of the financial support provided by governments comes from the regular
budgets of Ministries of Education, usually under the category of pre-school or
initial education.  However, within education budgets, support for pre-school
education is, to take an educated guess, typically less than one percent of the
total education budget.  If this is so, it suggests that <b>education
bureaucracies and planning offices remain to be convinced that early childhood
education is a good educational investment.</b><p>
<p>
	Other government funding is found in family welfare budgets, usually for day
care and/or non-formal programs.  As suggested by the discussion of statistics,
these programs often have a greater coverage than pre-school programs.  In the
cases of Venezuela and Colombia  and Chile (and in the future, in Bolivia),
these contributions are significant.  In the case of Colombia, the family
welfare contribution from the government is linked to a payroll tax so that, in
a sense, the funds are contributed by the private sector.  Still, that same tax
money could presumably appropriated by government for another purpose.<p>
<p>
	Occasionally, government contributions occur in less obvious places, such as
the Central Bank in Ecuador or as part of the general system of social
security.<p>
<p>
	But appearances may be deceiving.  The contributions of governments are often
more visible than those of the civil society.  We do not know how large the
total support for early childhood programs would be if we added together all
the support from the civil institutions, including such diverse organizations
as: non-profit NGOs operating in the social sector, grass-roots organizations,
communities, churches, universities and labor unions. <p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>Non-governmental Organizations and other organizations of the civil
society.</b>  An inventory of involvement in the field of early childhood care
and development by non-governmental organizations remains to be carried out.
However, it appears that it is increasingly common for a wide range of civil
organizations to establish pre-schools or child care programs for young
children.  For instance, many church groups set up child care centers.  In
several Convenio countries, a national "Pastoral de la Infancia" has been
established by the Roman Catholic Church which should increase attention to
young children, often through programs of family education.<p>
<p>
	In the Human Development Report for 1993, issued by the United Nations
Development Fund, a case is made for greater non-govern-mental organizations
because they are often better able that governments to reach the poorest and to
empower marginal groups (UNDP, 1993).<p>
<p>
	<b>A careful examination would be valuable of efforts by governments to work
with and through non-governmental organiza-tions, as is beginning to occur in
Venezuela and Bolivia in the home day care program and as is being vigorously
discussed in Ecuador under the new government.</b>  <p>
<p>
<b>	Private Enterprise.</b>  In general, corporate enterprise has shirked its
duty with respect to provision of child care and development.  In Colombia,
that responsibility is shouldered through a payroll tax rather than by
provision of child care at work sites.  In other countries of the Convenio,
with laws requiring enterprises employing over a certain number of women to
provide child care for employees, little is done to enforce the laws.  And
there is a strong suggestion that such laws work to the detriment of the
employment of women.  Companies either stay under the legislated number or
employ women on a part time basis or for short periods only.<p>
<p>
	But even if private enterprise took its responsibility seriously, there would
be little effect on the welfare of children most in need whose parents are
likely to be unemployed, or working in the non-formal sector or in rural,
non-industrialized settings.<p>
<p>
	Another form of private enterprise that is not well documented or regulated is
that of setting up private venture pre-schools or day care programs.  Some of
these programs are outstanding models but can only be afforded by wealthy
families.  Others are local responses to day care needs that result in
custodial programs of such poor quality that they may be of more harm than good
to the children in them.  The home day care movement seeks to build on this
local solution, extending and upgrading care.  Whether or not this solution is
viable in the long term remains to be seen, but sufficient experimentation has
occurred and is occurring in the Convenio countries (in Venezuela, Colombia,
Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia) to make it a natural focus of attention.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>International Assistance in the Convenio Countries</b><p>
<p>
	There is no centralized source of information about the current international
support being provided to countries of the Convenio Andres Bello for activities
and programs in the area of early childhood care and development.  Moreover,
many organizations are not set up to be able to provide that information.
Early childhood is not only a relatively new area that has not yet found its
way into the standard statistical and accounting channels, but it is also a
field that cuts across the areas of health, nutrition, education and social
welfare, at a minimum, making tabulations of participation and support
difficult.<p>
<p>
	In order to get some idea of current support being provided, it was necessary
to make inquiries with individual agencies.  Results of these inquiries are
presented in Appendix C.  In most cases, it was difficult to put a dollar
figure on the activities so no attempt will be made to aggregate funds being
provided for early childhood care and development in the Convenio countries.<p>
<p>
	Additional information about international support for early childhood
programs should be forthcoming from both the OAS meeting in Chile mentioned
above and from an inter-agency, inter-sectoral meeting to be held in Colombia
in late August, bringing together representatives from a range of regional
networks, each approaching problems of early childhood from different
perspectives.<p>
<p>
	Several general comments seem appropriate in light of the preliminary
exploration of international financing.<p>
<p>
	1.  Although the level of international funding, given outside the health
sector for child survival, has not been high, international attention to this
area is increasing.  This is particularly notable within multi-lateral
agencies, and even more concretely, within the World Bank which has provided
loans containing a pre-school or early childhood component to five of the seven
Convenio countries within the last four years.  However, international NGOs and
the Catholic Church are also rediscovering the young child and are providing
new support.  Bi-lateral organizations are reconsidering their policy within
the context of support for "basic education."<p>
<p>
	2.  Support enters through many windows -- through education, nutrition, rural
or community development, women's programs.<p>
<p>
	3.  European bi-lateral funds and funds provided through international NGOs or
foundations are more likely to be directed toward community-based, grass roots
programs than are funds provided through multilateral agencies.<p>
<p>
	4.  Relatively few funds are being provided for systematic research, program
analysis and evaluation.  More funds are put into the buildings, equipment,
training and provision of materials (by multi-laterals) or into action programs
(by international NGOs and European bi-laterals) than into research or
evaluation.<p>
<p>
	5.  Multi-lateral and bi-lateral organizations must work mainly with
governments while foundations and international NGOs can work more easily with
non-governmental organizations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>VII  OPENINGS FOR WORK BY SECAB</b><p>
<p>
	From the above it is clear that there are many possible ways to strengthen
support within the region for programs aimed at improving early childhood care
and development, without tripping over other organizations.  The challenge is
to look for manageable projects that can hope for more than an immediate and
possibly fleeting effect.<p>
<p>
	The suggestions that follow are based in part on the previous analysis.  They
also try to take into account the general lines of action that have been
emphasized by SECAB in its programming in other areas.  It is my understanding
that these are:<p>
<p>
   	training of human resources,<p>
   	strengthening information and exchange,<p>
   	organizing activities in selected areas (such as the development and
production of materials),<p>
   	carrying out research in support of the three main lines of activity just
mentioned.<p>
<p>
	It is also my understanding that SECAB has shown special interest in:<p>
<p>
   	promoting national appropriation of responsibility,<p>
   	facilitating inter-sectorial concertation, and <p>
   	articulating international cooperation.<p>
<p>
<b>Suggestions</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	1.  A project dealing with the education and enablement of parents.</b><p>
<p>
	As suggested in the analysis of the situation of children and programs, few
children in the 0 to 3 age group are involved in organized programs of day care
or early education and the main responsibility for care continues to fall to
families.  Efforts to "empower" parents with knowledge and social organization
that would help them to improve the care they provide to their young children
have generally been limited in scope, sporadic and uncoordinated or have looked
at empowerment as an individual matter to be achieved through the simple
dissemination of knowledge.<p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, considerable experience with programs intended to sensitize,
educate, and even empower parents is accumulating in the region.  These include
such experiences as the Venezuelan Proyecto Familia and the recent work being
supported by the Bernard van Leer Foundation, Colombia's PEFADI, Peru's work
through women's programs, Ecuador's program "El Ecuador Estudia," Chile's
Padres e Hijos, etc.  A recent project to derive "lessons learned" from
programs of parental education and support in Mexico might be drawn upon
(Linares, 1992).  This growing experience needs to be evaluated, systematized,
and repackaged or disseminated.  It needs to be brought together with lessons
learned from health and nutrition education.<p>
<p>
	Focussing on parental education provides an excellent opportunity to work
across areas of education, health, nutrition, and family welfare, seeking the
kind of inter-sectoral concertation that is of interest to SECAB.  It would
allow pulling together of efforts by various other organizations.<p>
<p>
	A parental education project might be framed to focus on particular groups
that have not been properly brought into such education efforts such as
indigenous groups who have, in the main, been treated to outside "truths" about
childrearing and whose traditional wisdom has often been prejudged negatively.
Or, a project might be focussed on urban marginal parenting, on single parent
families, on the role of fathers, or on teenage parents, all areas that have
been neglected.<p>
<p>
<b>2.  A Children's Literature project.</b><p>
<p>
	Pursuing the SECAB process of sensitizing leaders and others to the idea that
educational materials are (or can be) strategic in the promotion of learning,
attention could be given to strengthening the production and use of literature
for children in the early years.  The project could build on the current
"concurso" for educators of children, ages 3 to 9 -- of experiences that relate
specifically to literature.  It could involve a broad process of bringing
together various groups (pre-school teachers, lower primary school teachers,
parents, publishers, writers and illustrators) to examine and discuss how
children's literature is produced in particular countries.  Is it left to
commercial publishers?  What are the human resources dedicated to illustration?
Do children's books show cultural sensitivity?  Where are the collections of
traditional stories and how widely are they available?  How much is imported
literature?  How are children involved in the process of producing stories and
socialized to reading, writing and appreciation of literature in the process?
How are story books used in homes, pre-schools and schools and how can they
help articulate these learning environments?<p>
<p>
	Training workshops could be held for budding writers and illustrators.
Technical expertise from such publishers as Norma might be drawn upon.<p>
<p>
	The project could be linked to the idea of a "canasta de aprendizaje" (rather
than a "canasta escolar").<p>
<p>
<b>3.  Mobilizing the health sector in support of early childhood care and
development.</b><p>
<p>
	At present, the health sector has focussed its attention on survival and
growth.  It has not turned its attention to development.  It continues, for the
most part to take a "disease" approach to health.  Materials for training
medical doctors have little to do with the social and mental health of young
children.  the psycho-social dimension of early development is not present in
programs of primary health care or in the training of midwives (from whom we
may have more to learn on this subject that to teach).<p>
<p>
	Such a project would involve intersectoral collaboration.  It could be linked
to parental education by demonstrating ways in which psychosocial content can
be integrated into health and nutrition education projects.<p>
<p>
	The project might be done in collaboration with the Pan American Health
Organization or professional organizations of pediatricians in particular
countries of the region.<p>
<p>
  <p>
<b>4.  Developing a Child Status Profile.</b><p>
<p>
	Missing from the descriptions of the status of children in most countries of
the region is a description of the psycho-social developmental status prior to
entering school.  Policy makers and planners must confront and try to improve
indicators of infant mortality and malnutrition, but need not deal with
problems of delayed or debilitated social and mental development.  School
policies do not have adequate data on the current and changing condition of the
children they receive to be able to do an adequate job of adjusting programs to
that reality.<p>
<p>
	A move is developing to try describe, as a profile, the health, nutritional
and psychosocial status of children in Colombia and Bolivia.  This would serve
both as a check on the effectiveness of programs designed to affect different
parts of the profile (or all of it).  SECAB might consider promoting the
development and institutionalizing of such indicators in other Convenio
countries.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>5.  Examining the Government-NGO connection.</b><p>
<p>
	As the move toward greater collaboration between governments and NGOs
develops, there will be a need to monitor the ways in which that process might
undercut the effectiveness of NGOs rather than increase their effectiveness.
SECAB could monitor the Venezuelan, Bolivian and Ecuadorian experiences and
bring together the interested parties to discuss results of the findings.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A Closing Note</b><p>
<p>
	This paper will be considerably strengthened if it is put together with the
results that will be forthcoming from the regional meeting of networks to be
held in Colombia at the end of August and with the OAS seminar to be held in
Chile at the end of September.  From these meetings will come more recent (and
perhaps more accurate) data about the situation of children in the Convenio
countries as well as about new program efforts to improve that situation.
Undoubtedly, new suggestions will be made to fill in important program gaps.
It is suggested therefore, that SECAB take into consideration results of those
meetings in its deliberations.<p>
<p>
<a name="fn0">[1]</a>This approximate total was arrived
at by extrapolating the figure of 14 million young children under the age of of
5 years, as reported in UNICEF, <b>The State of the World's Children: 1993</b>,
New York: Published for UNICEF by the Oxford University Press, 1993,  Table 5,
p. 76.<p>
<a name="fn1">[2]</a>In this paper, the emphasis is taken off the key concepts
of "survival" and "growth" in order to concentrate on "care and development."
Child survival is often defined negatively as not dying before a certain age.
However, survival might more aptly be defined along a continuum running from
death to healthy development.  The further one is toward the healthy end of the
continuum, the greater the chances for survival.  "Growth" refers simply to
increasing in size.  That contrasts with "development" which involves ever
increasing levels of complexity.  For a more complete discussion of the
concepts of child survival, growth, development and care, see: Robert Myers,
<b>The Twelve Who Survive</b>, London: Routledge, 1992, Chapter 3.<p>
<sup>3</sup>This section draws heavily on: Robert Myers, <b>The Twelve Who
Survive</b>. London: Routledge, 1992, Chapter 5.<p>
<a name="fn2">[4]</a>In Colombia, a nationally normed scale now exists and an
attempt is being made to introduce use of the scale into the procedures used by
the health sector in monitoring health and nutrition.  This is, however, a very
recent development.  In other countries of the region various instruments for
measuring the psycho-social condition of children have been created locally or
appropriated from abroad and adjusted, but these have not been validated or
normed or accepted for use at a national level.  See: Atkin, L., "Analysis of
Instruments Used in Latin America to Measure Psychosocial Development and
Environmental Risk in Children from 0 to 6 Years of Age," A paper prepared for

<b>APPENDIX A</b><p>
<b>PROGRAM GUIDELINES</b><p>
<p>
	The following is one set of principles and guidelines that might be followed
when developing and evaluating early childhood programs.<p>
<p>
	<b>1.  Priority should be given to families and communities living in
conditions that put their children "at risk" of delayed or debilitated
development.</b><p>
<p>
	If programming is to be guided by a principle of social justice, then emphasis
must be given to those most in need or "at risk."  Selecting those deemed to be
most in need or at risk will involve some combination of information about:<p>
<p>
   -	the condition of children (birth weight, nutritional and health status);<p>
   -	the condition of women (educational levels, health and nutritional status,
age at first pregnancy, work demands and earnings);<p>
   -	family and support systems (size and composition, employment and income,
the availability of adequate alternative child care);<p>
   -	childrearing beliefs and practices (feeding, health habits, nurturing,
communication); and <p>
   -	more general socioeconomic conditions (earnings and income distribution,
literacy rates, availability of potable water, access to health and other
services,m conditions of rapid social or economic change).<p>
	<p>
<p>
	<b>2.  Programs should form part of a comprehensive, multifaceted
strategy.</b><p>
<p>
	A programming strategy must begin with a set of objectives.  Often mentioned
as a starting point for child developments programs is the right of each child
to realize his or her potential.  What it means to realize one's potential is
defined somewhat differently in different cultures so the specific objectives
flowing from this goal will be different for different societies.  For this
reason it seems appropriate to take as the main goal for child development, and
hence of child development programs, the competence of children in adjusting
to, performing in, and transforming their own surroundings.  In some cultures
that will mean greater emphasis on independence; in others greater emphasis on
group solidarity.  In some cases, physical coordination will be central; in
others abstract reasoning.  In all, however, there will be physical,
intellectual and social dimension s of development.<p>
<p>
	<b>3.  Programs should be participatory and community-based.</b><p>
<p>
	Community participation is sometimes encouraged for its own sake, as a basis
for developing solidarity and greater control over one's own life.  More often,
however, participation is viewed instrumentally -- as a means of making
programs more effective by engaging potential recipients actively so that usage
will increase and so that the program will respond appropriately to local
needs.  A growing body of experience shows that community participation
increases the effectiveness of most programs.  And, community participation
allows extension of services beyond what would be possible using only the
budgets and resources of the public sector.<p>
<p>
	Community participation, to be authentic, should go beyond use or donation of
materials and time to include direct involvement in all phases of programming
activity -- in design, implementation and evaluation.  This implies the
existence and growth of organizational mechanisms through which participation
can be expressed.  It means involving the community at large, not just a
selected few individuals, in a process of discussion and action on a continuing
basis.<p>
<p>
	<b>4.  Programs should be flexible and adjusted to different sociocultural
contexts.</b><p>
<p>
	Nations, communities and cultures differ widely in the particular needs of
their children.  Unless programs can identify varying needs of diverse
communities and respond accordingly, programs run the risk of being irrelevant
to the prevailing conditions and needs.  Moreover, achieving real participation
will be difficult.  Arriving with a standard package of solutions to
preconceived problems does not favor participation or achieving the desired
outcomes.  If, however, community participation is to include consultation at
all stages, programs must be flexible enough to incorporate the results of that
consultation.  Nevertheless, there is a natural tendency for programmers to
seek standard solutions that can be spread widely (see also Guideline 7).<p>
<p>
	<b>5.  Programs should support and build upon local ways that have been
devised to cope effectively with problems of child care and development.</b><p>
<p>
	This guideline is based on the assumption that programs are more likely to
work if they begin with solutions devised and tried out locally rather than
with solutions imposed from outside.  It places an important value on coping
skills and on innovative measures born of necessity.  The position contrasts
with one in which knowledge is assumed to reside in the heads of outside
"experts" without, however, denying the potential role of outsiders in helping
communities see and experiment with new ways to enhance early childhood
development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>6.  Programs should be financially feasible and cost-effective.</b><p>
<p>
	Clearly, programs must be possible to implement within recognized resource
constraints, and they should be economically feasible beyond an initial period
when costs may be borne by an outside source.  The economic "feasibility" of a
program, however, is only partly a matter of available funds -- it is also a
matter of priorities and of how funds are divided up.  If a program has been
assigned a high priority, it can be afforded and made feasible by giving up
something of lower priority.<p>
<p>
	This guideline is not couched in terms of "los-cost" programs.  The objective
is not to seek the lowest possible cost for a program.  Some cost-cutting
measures will also lead to a cut in effectiveness.  A low-cost project that has
little or no effect is a waste, more so than a program with higher costs that
is an effective program.<p>
<p>
	<b>7.  Programs should try to reach the largest possible number of children
living in conditions that put them at risk.</b><p>
<p>
	Because the need is so great in most countries, programmers should give
priority to those programs that offer the best prospect of reaching the most
children who are at risk, with an effective solution.  That means looking
beyond demonstration and pilot projects to the possibility of implementation on
a large scale.<p>
<p>
	The "scale" of each approach may be pictured simplistically as running from
very low coverage to a figure of 100%.  However, that is simplistic.  Not all
children may need to be reached, for instance.<p>
<p>
	"Scale" is often pictured as extending one model of coverage to all children.
Another way of viewing scale, however, is by adding together the results of
several different actions, each based on a different model, and each reaching a
different segment of the population.  Scale emerges as the puzzle pieces are
brought together.  This view allows high coverage to be increased by
encouraging a series of smaller initiatives as well as by launching national
programs.  Adopting this approach to scale is crucial in order to reconcile the
desire for community participation with the desire for broad coverage.<p>

<b>APPENDIX C:  INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</b><p>
<b>FOR PROGRAMS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<b>IN COUNTRIES OF THE CONVENIO ANDRES BELLO</b><p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	</b>International assistance for programs of early childhood care and
development in the Convenio countries should be seen against a more general
backdrop of trends in technical assistance related to early childhood.<p>
<p>
	<b>A dormant period.</b>  Prior to the 1980s, very little international
assistance was provided for early childhood programs.  The support that was
provided was, for the most part, directed toward small pilot or demonstration
projects.  Within education, emphasis was still being placed on assistance for
secondary (often technical) and university programs with, however, the
beginnings of a shift toward support for primary school education.  Health
programs were still oriented in the main toward hospitals and larger health
campaigns, with increasing attention to primary health care.  Food assistance
was about the only large scale assistance provided for children.  That
assistance was almost exclusively assistance in kind -- providing surplus food
in programs of food supplementation, some of which were targeted on pre-school
children and/or on pregnant and lactating mothers.  In these programs, an
integrated view of child development was lacking. <p>
<p>
	UNICEF provided some assistance for pre-school education, mostly for
facilities or for the training of pre-school teachers.  For the earlier ages,
attention was given also by UNICEF to early stimulation.  The development of
manuals and booklets for the education of parents and other caregivers was
funded, with a concentration of efforts in the Central American region.<p>
<p>
	Bi-lateral organizations provided few funds.  Here and there an isolated
project was supported as, for instance, in the case of Peru where USAID
provided assistance for experimentation with a home visiting program directed
toward improving the ability of families to provide their young children (ages
0 to 3) with a healthier and more adequate learning environment.<p>
<p>
	The support of major Foundations was focussed on research that included some
important research linking nutrition to cognitive development, but little
attention was given to practical applications of the research results or to
action projects in early childhood development.  An exception was that the
Bernard van Leer Foundation which, even during the 1970s, concentrated its
assistance on experimental community-based programs of early childhood care and
education.<p>
<p>
	The rather dramatic growth of international non-governmental organizations,
such as Christian Childrens' Fund and the Alliance of Save the Children, had
not yet occurred and the support provided through such programs was largely
directed toward children who had already passed beyond their pre-school
years.<p>
<p>
	Loan agencies, including the World Bank and the Inter-American Development
Bank had not begun to include attention to the early years in programming,
although some attention to health issues was beginning to grow prior to 1980.<p>
<p>
	<b>A small awakening.</b>  In 1978, the Alma Ata Conference gave an enormous
push to primary health care.  However, mental and social health was not among
the main lines of action emerging form Alma Ata.  With the International Year
of the Child in 1979, an up-swing occurred in the support for integrated
programs of early childhood care and development that included health and
nutrition as well as attention to the psycho-social development of young
children.   This support was, however, still in the main for small-scale
exper-imental programs.  Rather than gain momentum, early childhood programs
containing a psycho-social component were relegated to the background and
attention to child survival took center stage, promoted by UNICEF and the World
Health Organization working together.  The abundant funding for the health and
nutrition programs aimed at reducing infant mortality may have had an effect on
child development as well, but the main effect was on physical development.
Work in Chile, for instance, showed that although a dramatic drop in
malnutrition occurred from 1978 to 1990, measures of child development remained
constant over the period.<p>
<p>
	While international organizations were not putting much money into the early
childhood years during the 1980s, governments did begin to expand significantly
their pre-school programs, as indi-cated above in Table 3.  This was occurring
in spite of economic pressures in the region that began to mount with the
passing of the "lost decade" of the 1980s.<p>
<p>
	<b>Changing times.</b>  With the arrival of the 1990s, the climate for support
of early childhood programs began to change.  Three international events helped
to produce this change in climate.  The first was the approval of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child which led to approval by the United
Nations Assembly at the end of 1989.  The Convention, now approved by more than
150 countries, urged signatories to "...insure to the maximum extent possible
child survival and development (Article 6)  It also indicated that, while
placing primary responsibility for a child's upbringing with parents and
families, states must "insure the development of institutions, facilities and
services for the care of children (Article 18.2). <p>
<p>
	The second international event of importance was the World Conference on
Education for All which was held in Thailand in March of 1990, organized by
UNICEF, UNESCO, the World Bank, and UNDP.  The Declaration approved at the
Conference included the following statement:  "Learning begins at birth.  This
calls for early childhood care and initial education.  These can be provided
through arrangements involving families, communities or institutional programs,
as appropriate." (Article 5)  As indicated at the outset, The Framework for
Action also set expansion of early childhood care and development activities as
one of the targets to be considered in plans for the 1990's.<p>
<p>
	A World Summit for Children occurred in September 1990 that brought together
seventy heads of state to discuss the plight of children and to commit
themselves to improvements.  The Summit endorsed the conclusions of the World
Conference on Education for All and promoted the signing of the Convention on
the Rights of the Child.<p>
<p>
	It is not clear whether the subsequent increases in assistance to early
childhood care, development and education during these first years of the 1990s
can be attributed to a new visibility for children or to pressures from
national governments or to the natural evolution of events or to all of these
causes.  But some increases have occurred and, most importantly, some funds are
now available to help support larger scale programs.<p>
The World Bank <p>
<p>
	World Bank loans are negotiated with governments and most funds are provided
for government ministries, agencies and programs.  On occasion, however, the
funds are used by governments to help support efforts of NGOs as, for instance,
in the case of the Venezuelan loan listed below.<p>
<p>
	Prior to 1990, the World Bank had made no loans in Convenio countries that
could be considered in part or in whole as, "child care and development" loans.
Since 1990, however, the World Bank has made five loans that are either
focussed on, or include, early childhood care and development activities.
These are:<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Colombia</b>.  In 1990, a loan of 24 million dollars was approved for
use over six years in the "Community Child Care and Nutrition Project."  Funds
are being used by the Colombian Institute of Family Welfare to strengthen the
on-going program of home-based child care which caters to the nutrition, health
and psycho-social development needs of children aged two through six in
low-income urban communities.  Included in the loan were funds for: equipment
and materials to introduce a regular system of training for community as well
as ICBF staff, credits to be used for up-grading the day care homes, the
development of a Management Information System, an impact evaluation, policy
development and program coordination.  (This loan represented less than 2% of
the total expenditures projected for the home day care program over the 6-year
period.)<p>
<p>
 	2.  <b>Venezuela</b>.  Also in 1990, a loan of 100 million dollars was
approved for use over seven years in a "Social Development Project."  The loan
represented 31% of the overall expenses of 320.9 million dollars projected for
the project over the seven years.  The loan was intended to help the GOV to
develop a social sector strategy, target its spending, cushion effects of
economic adjustment and promote institutional development in the Ministries of
Health, Education, and Family.  More specifically, the project supports:  (a)
rehabilitation and development of the primary health care network, including
provision of basic health and nutrition services for pregnant and nursing women
and children under six years of age ($60,500,000); (b) development and
expansion of pre-school education, focussed on the lower-income urban and rural
areas ($10,900,000); (c) information, education and communications services for
health, nutrition and education promotion ($8,200,000); and (d) improvement of
the GOV's capacity to design, plan and implement social programs and to monitor
the effect of such programs ($1,600,000).  When "contingency" funds and
anticipated national expenditures are added together, the total cost of the
childcare/pre-school component of the social development program was estimated
at 57.6 million dollars.<p>
<p>
	The pre-school component of the project anticipates expansion of the
community-based child day care program from 3,000 homes to 42,000 homes so as
to reach about half a million children from poor families, expansion of
pre-school enrollments by 96,000 children in conventional pre-schools and by
16,000 in non-conventional pre-schools, and introduction of a feeding program
in pre-schools.  The main support provided to pre-schools under the loan is for
construction of pre-schools, provision of furniture and materials, teacher and
staff training and supervision.  Some administrative costs of project
management units are also included.  The communications component of the loan
also includes elements directed toward improved child development, including
cognitive development.  For instance, funds are provided to the Ministry of the
Family to negotiate the rights to relevant television programs for pre-school
aged children.<p>
<p>
	Although it is clear that the health component of the loan also supports child
care and development, it is not possible to sort out what part of that
component assists development as well as survival.  Moreover, no provision was
made in the health part of the loan for specific attention to early stimulation
or to the psycho-social development of children in the earliest ages.  Impact,
therefore is most likely to be on physical development.<p>
 <p>
	3.  <b>Chile</b>.  In late 1991, a loan of 170 million dollars was approved,
for use over seven years, for a "Primary Education Improvement Project."  The
loan covers 74% of the projected 243 million dollar cost of the project.
Included in this project is an amount of 32.4 million dollars to expand
coverage and improve the quality of both formal and non-formal pre-school
programs.  When contingencies and local contributions to the project are
included, the estimated cost of this pre-school component is 39.3 million
dollars.<p>
<p>
	The loan specifies funding in the pre-school component to hire supervisors,
teachers and para-professionals, construct or refurbish facilities, provide
food rations design, produce and distribute materials, promote parent
involvement in the stimulation of their children, mount a mass media campaign
and carry out an evaluation.  Funds are targeted for 46,000 children (mostly
5-year olds) in areas of urban and rural poverty.<p>
<p>
	4.  <b>Ecuador</b>.  Also in late 1991, a loan of 89 million dollars was
approved, for use over 8 years, for a Social Development Project directed
specifically toward Education and Training.  The loan represents 75% of the
total project cost of 118.7 million dollars.  Included within the "urban basic
education" component of the project is support for a pilot pre-school component
to construct 60 pre-school classrooms attached to central primary schools in a
nuclear school system.  A high-quality formal pre-school model is indicated
which is to serve as an example for other pre-schools.  Short training courses
and materials are to be provided under the project.  Personnel from all types
of pre-schools have access to the training and materials.  Funds are also
provided for evaluation of this pre-school alternative, as compared with less
formal models.<p>
<p>
	5.  <b>Bolivia</b>.  In June 1993, a loan for 50 million dollars was approved,
for use over 5 years, for an "Integrated Child Develop-ment Program."  The loan
will support the extension of a home day care system to 9 major cities,
expecting to reach 130,000 children who are living in sections of those cities
where they are most at risk of delayed or debilitated development.  Funds will
help to strengthen the ability of the responsible government organization, the
National Organization for Minors, Women and Families (ONAMFA), to design and
manage the program, provide initial operational support (on a declining basis),
assist evaluation, look toward the expansion of programming to rural areas in
another phase of the project.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>UNICEF</b><p>
<p>
	In order to get an idea of UNICEF activities, annual reports for 1992 were
obtained for all of the Convenio countries.  These reports do not put dollar
figures on particular projects but do give a general idea of the kinds of
activities supported with UNICEF funds (or with the funds of others channeled
through UNICEF).  UNICEF has an office in each one of the Convenio countries.
<p>
<p>
	The bulk of UNICEF program funds are directed toward activities related to
child survival and growth.  In each country, attention is given to assisting
governments with plans and actions that help to meet commitments to the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, in light of the Declaration made at the
Summit for Children.  Child care and development activities are found in all
countries.  These activities vary considerably from place to place and include
support for experimental field projects, training, materials, advocacy,
diagnoses, and evaluation and research.  A unifying theme for much of the
UNICEF work in this area is attention to children through "informal" models.<p>
<p>
	Although most UNICEF funds are provided to governmental institutions for
governmental programs, a small portion of the available monies go to NGOs and
to universities or to individual researchers.<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Bolivia.</b>  Support is provided to establish and run community-based
child care centers as part of a broader rural community development project in
selected villages in Norther Potos&iacute; and Southern Cochabamba.  The model
being tried out is unusual in that the centers are family enterprises (not run
only by mothers).  This project is funded through PROANDES, a regional project
which is financed by Italian government funds.<p>
<p>
	A bi-lingual education project carried out with Guarani- speaking children
includes a pre-school component and a follow-up evaluation of children in
primary schools.<p>
<p>
	UNICEF also provides materials and some training for educators in rural
non-formal pre-schools.<p>
<p>
	2.  <b>Colombia.</b>  Some funds were provided for the recently-completed
evaluation of the home day-care system.  UNICEF helped the Colombian government
formulate its national plan of action for children for the period 1991-94 and
supports social mobilization efforts in line with the plan.  Special projects
have been contracted out dealing with social indicators, identifying children
of high risk, and evaluating the "Year O" pilot project.<p>
<p>
<p>
	3.  <b>Chile.</b>  Direct support is provided to assist the implementation of
non-conventional low-cost forms of extending attention to pre-school children
through family day care centers, rural mini-centers and family creches.  A
series of evaluations have been supported as has work on child rearing
practices and patterns.<p>
<p>
	4.  <b>Ecuador.</b>  UNICEF support in Ecuador has assisted the National
Family Institute to evaluate and restructure its programs.  A study of
childrearing practices in rural and urban marginal areas was financed.<p>
<p>
	5.  <b>Panama.</b>  With UNICEF support an
inter-institutional/inter-disciplinary group has been formed to set up a
National Plan for Human Development.  Studies have been financed to: identify
oppor-tunities for technical support to the Panamanian Institute for Special
Training in the area of early childhood development, sexist practices in
pre-school centers, and child-rearing practices.  The last of these studies is
to be used in creating training materials for the Ministry of Education.<p>
<p>
	6.  <b>Peru.</b>  Studies have been supported of: the situation of day care
services in Metropolitan Lima, the effects of a national evaluation system on
learning achievement, the links between pre-schooling and primary education,
and the impact of a regulation authorizing enrollment of 5-year olds in the
first year of primary school.<p>
<p>
	7.  <b>Venezuela.</b>  Funding is provided for an evaluation of training
financed under the World Bank Loan to agents in programs of pre-school
education.<p>
<p>
	Other more general activities of UNICEF within the region provide assistance
that is available to Convenio countries.  For instance, a publication called
Facts for Life has been published that provides basic messages to be used for
education of parents and the public.  Most countries have made local adaptions
of this basic documents.  UNICEF carries out "Situation Analyses" as a part of
its general programming process.  Together with other institutions, UNICEF has
taken an active role in establishing a monitoring commitments made as a result
of signing the Convention on the Rights of the Child and made at the Summit for
Children.  Often this involves working with governments to develop National
Plans for Children incorporating the goals of the Summit and attending to the
provisions of the Convention. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>The Bernard van Leer Foundation (BvLF)</b><p>
<p>
	According to its 1993 annual report, The BvLF has provided a total of 7.2
million dollars for projects in 4 Convenio countries in the three-year period
from 1989 to 1991.<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Colombia (1.6 million).</b>  For almost a decade, the Foundation has
provided support to the Universidad del Norte to develop, implement and
evaluate a child-centered community development program in several villages
along the Northern coast.  Its 1989-91 support also included assistance to
CINDE to strengthen its resource and documentation center.  A third project,
with funding to the Department of Social Welfare in Cuidad Bolivar, supports a
community day care program.<p>
<p>
	2.  <b>Chile (2.9 million).</b>  Five projects were supported during the
period, four of which were NGO projects focusing, respectively on: an
experimental alternative early education model involving parents directly in
that education, operational research on the transition in early education,
community day-care centers for rural families in Southern Chile, and the
dissemination of innovative practices.  The national Foundation for the
Integrated Development of the Child has also received support to upgrade its
day care centers in urban and rural areas, concentrating on curriculum
development, parental involvement, a feeding program and staff training.  More
recently, the Foundation has also provided support to the Pastoral Social of
the Vicaria de Solidaridad within the Catholic Church, to the Junta Nacional of
Jardines Infantiles for a radio project in the South, to the Quakers to work
with a community organization in the improvement of peri-natal care and to an
organization called Opci&oacute;n to experiment with a program of home-based
care. <p>
<p>
	3.  <b>Peru (1.5 million).</b>   Within Peru, support has been focussed on the
governmental institution, INIDE, for the training of early education
"animators," using a system that the BvLF helped to develop through its support
to an experimental project carried out in conjunction with the Ministry of
Education over many years.<p>
<p>
	4.  <b>Venezuela (1.2 million).</b>  Here, support has gone to 1) the Ministry
of Education for child development workshops, 2) an NGO for a community
development project to meet the developmental and health needs of young
children and their families in a large town in the Paraguan&aacute; Peninsula
through parental education and training of community "promotores," and 3) an
NGO for a series of workshops for 120 community workers from 60 organizations
around the country on matters related directly to early childhood development
and for the production of child development materials aimed at parents,
community organizations and "animadores."<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>The Christian Childrens Fund (CCF)</b><p>
<p>
	The CCF works in only three Convenio countries: Bolivia, Colombia and Ecuador.
The CCF support has been focussed more on general community development
projects in rural areas and on activities affecting children older than age
five than on child development per se or on younger children.  Nevertheless, in
Bolivia, of 64 projects, five are for child development centers, and 10 are for
"social service centers.  In Colombia, the 54 projects include 10 child
development centers, 4 day care centers and 10 social service centers.  Work is
in both rural and urban areas.  Some attention is given to parental counseling
which includes sensitizing parents to developmental needs of their children and
to cultural preservation programs with indigenous peoples.  In Ecuador, only
one of 36 projects is specifically a child development project, but elements of
child survival and development are evident in support for immunization,
promotion of health education, food production programs, nutritional monitoring
and pre-and post natal care and education.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>The Interamerican Institute of the Child (IIN).</b><p>
<p>
	A great deal of the support provided by the IIN is directed toward provision
of information to institutions in the region.  A child information system is
being set up.  In addition to acting as a documentation center serving the
region as a whole, the IIN seeks to make its information systems live through
the participation in and organization of regional meetings and by involving
local institutions in a general process of collecting and disseminating
information.  In Colombia, the IIN works closely with the Rafael Pombo
Foundation, in Ecuador with the National Institute of the Family.  A
cooperative agreement is being developed with a center in Chile.<p>
<b>The United States Agency for International Development (USAID).</b><p>
<p>
	In the recent past, USAID has provided as great deal of support within the
region to programs directed to child survival but has done very little to
support child development or early education programs.  Recently, a sum of
$250,000 was provided to bolster the communications component within the
budding child development program in Bolivia.  In 1989, funds were provided for
a pilot evaluation of the home day care program in Colombia.<p>

<center><b>MALAYSIAN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT STUDY</b></center><p>
  <p>
<p>
Malaysia, a country rich in culture and resources, is projected to have a
population of nearly 20 million people by 1995.  It consists of two land
masses, separated by the South China Sea.  Peninsular (or Western) Malaysia,
which holds 82.3% of the population has  40% of the land.  Sabah and Sarawak,
on the other hand, with 60% of the land, are the home to 17.7% of the
population.<p>
<p>
The population of Malaysia is relatively young.  According to population
projections, at the present time the 0-15 age groups constitutes approximately
39% of the population (18% are in the birth through 6 age group), and 57% in
the 16-64 working-age group. Nearly 4% of the population is 65 or older (EPU,
1991). The population growth rate was 2.3% in 1990. (Yusof &amp; Zulkifil,
1992)<p>
<p>
In terms of health indicators, Malaysia has an infant mortality rate of 11/1000
live births, with a maternal mortality rate of 2/1000 live births.  The child
immunization rates are high: more than 90% of all children have been immunized
against BCG, DPT and Polio, with nearly 80% of all children immunized against
measles.  In terms of nutritional status, 75.5% of all children are in the
normal range; only .5% are severely malnourished.<p>
<p>
In the 1970s, Malaysia implemented the First Outline Perspective Plan (OPP1),
which embodied the New Economic Policy (NEP).  The NEP focused on eradicating
poverty and the restructuring of society. The Second Outline Perspective Plan
(OPP2), covers the years 1991 - 2000 and embodies the National Development
Policy (NDP)  It aims at balanced and sustainable development.  It also aims at
promoting human resource development and gives priority to the role of the
private sector as the engine of growth. <p>
<p>
The Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995 has as its <i>main thrust</i>, "to sustain
the growth and momentum and manage it successfully so as to achieve a more
balanced development of the economy".  One of the specific strategies
undertaken to achieve balanced development is to "enhance human resource
development".  <p>
<p>
The goals of balanced development are based on the following: <p>
<p>
<ul>Firstly, the principle of growth with equity is fundamental to ensure the
realization of a fair and equitable distribution of national wealth.  Secondly,
a balanced societal development is conducive to the maintenance of social and
political stability. Thirdly, the nurturing and moulding of a Malaysian society
with high moral values and ethics as well as positive attitudes are fundamental
towards the creation of a responsible, resilient, progressive and caring
society...The balanced development of the economy is essential to ensure stable
growth, minimize social conflicts, promote racial harmony and enhance national
unity.  (Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995, pg. 5)</ul><p>
<p>
With the above as some of the parameters of national development, Malaysia has
in the last twenty years experienced rapid changes economically and socially.
There have been increasing education and employment opportunities for women.
For example, the proportion of women classified as unpaid family workers fell
from 39.7% in 1970 to 21.6% in 1990.  This was largely due to the absorption of
women into the modern sector.  The proportion of women classified as 'employee'
rose from 38.9% in 1970 to 62.9% in 1990. (Sixth Malaysia Plan: 991-1995, pg.
415.  Women's participation in the labour force has increased significantly
since the Sixth Plan began.  Between 1970 and 1990 women's participation rate
increased slowly, from 31% in 1970 to 32.7% in 1980, 34.6% in 1985 and 35% in
1990.  In 1993 it was 47%.  (Mid-Term Review of the Sixth Malaysia Plan:
1991-1995, pg. 239)   Thus, increasingly women are entering the labour force.
This has impacted on their role within the family.<p>
<p>
There have been other changes which have influenced family life.  Over the past
twenty years there has been a significant rural-urban migration and
resettlement programmes of rural communities in land development and
rehabilitation schemes.  These have disrupted the traditional extended family
structure; many families now live as nuclear families.  This means that women
lack the traditional supports in terms of child care, thus creating an increase
in the  demand for alternative care of young children. <p>
<p>
Since the 1970s, and due to the emphasis given to the importance of education,
there has also been an increased awareness among parents, government and
non-governmental agencies (NGOs) of the importance of pre-school education for
five and six year old children. Given parental demand, there is a rapidly
increasing involvement of the private sector in providing pre-school
programmes, particularly in terms of bringing in "imported" models and
materials.  In addition, there is a tendency for many in the private sector to
provide `commercialised' programs which are appealing to parents, pre-school
teachers and caregivers, but which may not be sound in terms of child
development principles.<p>
<p>
Besides the increasing demand for programmes for children from 0 to six years
old, there is now a demand for after school care for children of working
parents.<p>
<p>
It is in relation to this changing situation in Malaysia that this study was
undertaken.<p>
<p>
<b><center>AIMS AND OBJECTIVES:</b></center><p>
<p>
Specifically, the purpose of this review was to assist the Government of
Malaysia in formulating a comprehensive and cost-effective ECD policy and
strategy linked to overall national development priorities.  Thus the
recommendations from the review focus on arrangements for effective
implementation, monitoring, management and coordination of ECD activities, and
the identification of broad policy and strategy options for strengthening ECD's
contribution to national development.<p>
<p>
What follows is a listing of the aims and specific objectives of the review and
a summary of how they were accomplished.  Further detail in relation to each of
the aims is provided in the main text of the document. <p>
<p>
AIMS<p>
<p>
<ol>	(1)	<b>to examine current ECD programme coordination mechanisms, including
existing legal provisions;</b><p>
<p>
	All agreed that this is an area of primary concern.  Thus considerable effort
was put into recommendations regarding coordination of ECD activities, and the
legislation required to support the recommendations.<p>
<p>
	(2)	<b>to inform key ECD managers of relevant experiences from other countries
in the formulation and implementation of ECD policy;</b><p>
<p>
As data on ECD provision were gathered in Malaysia, the situation of young
children and ECD programming was compared with other countries.  As part of
discussions during the Phase 1 workshop, and in the Phase 3 Workshop,
experiences from elsewhere were highlighted to provide examples of
alternatives.  Thus as the recommendations were formulated, this was done with
an understanding of how other countries have addressed similar concerns. <p>
<p>
	(3)	<b>to propose arrangements for the effective implementation, monitoring,
management and coordination of ECD programmes;</b><p>
  <p>
	The recommendations include proposed arrangements for the effective
implementation, monitoring, management and coordination of ECD programmes.
These were derived from the studies and the various workshop experiences.  <p>
<p>
	(4)	<b>to identify broad policy and strategy options for strengthening ECD's
contribution to national development; </b><p>
  <p>
Through the workshops and sub-studies the broad policy issues and strategy
options were described and discussed. These have been included in the
conclusions, the policy and recommendation sections.<p>
<p>
	(5)	<b>to review the nature and extent of current linkages between ECD
programmes, parents and the community and suggest ways in which such linkages
might be extended. </b><p>
  <p>
The study revealed that parent and community involvement is seriously lacking
in relation to ECD provision.  With the Government expectation that the
community will take increasing responsibility for ECD provision, it is critical
that parent and community involvement be defined in terms of empowerment. It is
important in continue to educate ECD managers regarding the experience of other
countries in mobilizing parents and the community in relation to ECD.</ol><p>
<p>
<p>
SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES<p>
<p>
<ol>	(1)	<b>to prepare a profile of existing ECD programmes in relation to
needs;</b><p>
  <p>
A mapping was done of those currently providing ECD services, in relation to
different populations in Malaysia. (See Part II)  The mapping includes basic
data on institutional based pre-school and child care centres provided by
government, non-governmental agencies and the private sector.<p>
<p>
	(2)	<b>to undertake selected case-studies of the non-institutional
home/family-based and after school care services;</b><p>
  <p>
As a part of the three sub-studies (on curriculum, parent/community involvement
and training), the various models of ECD provision in Malaysia were included.
This provides a picture of the strengths and weaknesses of the various
approaches - institutional and well as non-institutional.  <p>
<p>
	(3)	<b>to establish a comprehensive ECD data base;</b><p>
  <p>
	We are interpreting `data base' to mean gaining an understanding of the needs
for ECD services (i.e. how the population of children 0-9 is distributed
(geographically and by socio-economic grouping), what populations are currently
being served, where are the gaps in services, etc.), along with a comprehensive
understanding of the resources available to support the development and
promotion of ECD in Malaysia. In terms of the former, more work needs to be
done, particularly in terms of the identification of groups most in need of
services.  In terms of the latter, that has been accomplished within the study.
<p>
<p>
	(4)	<b>to analyze overall ECD programme costs;</b><p>
<p>
This aspect of the study is the least well developed. While we were able to get
some cost data regarding the actual operation of a given ECD programme, we were
unable to get data related to administrative costs from the various Ministries
involved in ECD programming.  Within the text of this report we suggest a
strategy that could be used to obtain more accurate cost information.<p>
<p>
	(5)	<b>to review existing research findings;	</b><p>
	<p>
The studies which have been undertaken in Malaysia in relation to ECD were
reviewed.  The primary focus of these studies has been on either child
development in Malaysia or pre-school education.  Very little has been done in
terms of research in relation to programmes for children under the age of 4,
and there have been little research on the impact of various ECD programme
models on children's later development. In order to understand whether or not
ECD programmes are having a positive impact, and if so, in what ways, funds
should be allocated to this kind of research. <p>
<p>
	(6)	<b>to review the status of ECD curriculum, teaching and learning methods,
materials production and training as related to the delivery of programmes of
satisfactory quality;</b><p>
  <p>
	Because programme quality is so important in terms of determining whether or
not there are positive outcomes for children in ECD programmes, three
sub-studies (one on curriculum, one on parent/community involvement, and one on
training) were conducted.  The results are reported on in this study.</ol><p>
<p>
<center><b> A NATIONAL ECD POLICY</b></center><p>
<p>
It is known that:<p>
<p>
<ul>the foundation for children's growth and development is established within the
first few years of life and that learning begins at birth;</ul><p>
<p>
Further, it has been demonstrated that:<p>
<p>
<ul>conducive and stimulating environments that enhance young children's physical,
mental, social, emotional and spiritual development lead to holistic and
balanced individuals; and that <p>
<p>
investments in early childhood development modify social and economic
inequalities, addressing the issues of accessibility, equity and equality; and
that <p>
<p>
quality early childhood programmes provide an environment which supports the
transmission of cultural, moral and religious values that are the underpinnings
of a fully moral and ethical society.</ul><p>
<p>
Thus, with a focus on Vision 2020 and the nine central strategic challenges,
the Government of Malaysia has made a commitment to the promotion of the
importance of early childhood years, from conception through the early primary
grades.  Further, in accordance with government policy, close collaboration
will be sought with the private sector in the implementation of appropriate
early childhood programmes.  <p>
<p>
<center><b>RECOMMENDATIONS</b></center><p>
<p>
The study undertaken provided an understanding of the strengths of ECD
provision within Malaysia.  It also indicated issues to be addressed to enhance
the capacity of Government, non-governmental agencies, the private sector and
the public to promote the well-being of all young children.  Within this
section of the report there is a delineation of the overall findings, with
specific recommendations for action.<p>
<p>
<ol>1.	At the present time Malaysia lacks a comprehensive policy to support the
overall development of young children as they make the transition from home to
care outside the home, to preschool and then into the primary school.  Current
services are fragmented  and there is a lack of interface among the agencies
currently serving young children and their families.<p>
<p>
<b>Therefore it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>a comprehensive and integrated ECD policy for Malaysia be adopted to meet
the needs of children from conception through the early primary school years.
The policy should:</b><p>
  <p>
<ol><b>	1)	be related to Vision 2020, and the National Development Policy </b><br>
<b>	2)	address important national issues, for example:</b><br>
<b>-  challenges associated with the quality of life desired for Malaysians,
including the strengthening of the family and moral, ethical and spiritual
values.</b><br>
<b>-  the support and enhancement of the National Plan of Action related to the
World Summit on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children.</b><br>
<b>-  challenges associated with increasing the labour force participation
among women for the industrialization programme, and the implications for the
family.</b><br>
<b>Thereby, ECD contributes to Human Resources Development.</b></ol></ul><p>
  <p>
2.  	Currently ECD services are fragmented, addessing only selected ECD needs<p>
<p>
<b>Therefore, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>a review of current legislation affecting young children and their families
be undertaken. </b></ul><p>
  <p>
3.	There is a lack of data about what happens to children who are not in
registered child care and preschool programmes, and what happens for children
when they are not attending child care, preschool or lower primary school.
There is also a lack of data on children who are not attending lower primary
school and also children with special needs<p>
<p>
<b>Therefore, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
  <ul>a study be undertaken to more completely document the situation and
needs of young children.</ul><p>
<p>
4.	There are well-developed Preschool Curriculum Guidelines for children 4-6
years of age.  There is no equivalent curriculum guideline for children under
the age of four.  <p>
<p>
<b>Therefore it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>comprehensive, integrated Curriculum Guidelines be developed for children
from birth to six years of age that interface with the Primary School
Curriculum. </b></ul><p>
   <p>
<p>
5.	ECD planning and practice must rest on a comprehensive and integrated data
base.  At the present time there is no comprehensive data bank on ECD needs and
provision.  It is important to have a better understanding of needs as related
to provision.<p>
<p>
<b>Therefore, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>the Ministry of Health, through additions to their Home-based Child Health
Card, collect relevant data on children (0-6 years) and through the school
health records data on children (6-9 years).  There is also a need to compile
Malaysian-based child development indicators. </b></ul><p>
  <p>
<b>Further, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>the Ministry of Education maintain responsibility for the data base for
children aged 4-9.  Agencies providing services to this age group should
channel their data to this Ministry.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
<b>Further, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>data for target groups like immigrant children should be collected by the
Ministry of Home Affairs and channelled to the Ministry of Health or the
Ministry of Education for the respective age group.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
  <p>
6.	A cornerstone of effective early childhood programmes internationally is
parent and community involvement in all aspects of the programme.  The study
revealed that this in lacking in most programmes.  <p>
<p>
<b>Therefore it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>the concept of parent involvement be broadened to a concept of parent
participation which respects and strengthens the parent's role in the child's
development and establishes linkages between the home, early childhood
programmes and children's transition into the primary school.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
<b>Further, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>parent and community support and involvement be mobilized in creating
awareness, planning, implementing, and sharing the cost of ECD
programmes.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
<b>Further, it is also recommended that:</b><p>
  <ul>media be involved in promoting a greater understanding of child
development, and the responsibility and role of the private sector in ECD
provision.</ul><p>
  <p>
  7.	Training is a key component in the successful implementation of any
curriculum.  The study revealed that current training, for the most part is
inadequate.<p>
<p>
<b>Therefore it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>a national ECD Training System be established which provides a framework for
the development of training packages, certification for trainees, accreditation
of trainers and training centres, decentralized resource centres, and
mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating training programmes.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
  
8.	Research and evaluation provide data important in the planning process.
Across ECD programmes there is a lack of evaluation of programme effectiveness
and impact.  Further, there is a gap between academic research and its
application in terms of programming. <p>
<p>
<b>Therefore it is recommended that the following research be pursued:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>-  the impact of available models (e.g. home and community based as well as
centre-based) on children's later growth and development.</b><br>
 
<b>-  the cost-effectiveness of different programme approaches.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
9.	At the present time government provision of ECD is heavily subsidized.  <p>
<p>
<b>Therefore, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>in line with government policy to increase the private sector participation
in all public services, strategies be developed which will shift the financing
of ECD from Government to the private sector, the community and parents.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
<b>Further, it is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>alternative models of financing ECD be explored, including taxation, the
development of Trusts, and philanthropic initiatives.  The 1994 Budget includes
a tax benefit for businesses offering ECD services.  The effectiveness of the
approach needs to be evaluated.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
To address the issues identified and the recommendations made thus far,<p>
<p>
<b>It is recommended that:</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>as an interim measure, a National Early Childhood Development Council be
created within the Prime Minister's Department for the purpose of formulating,
conceptualizing and overseeing ECD programmes in the various sectors
(government, non-governmental and private).  The Council should be supported by
a strong Secretariat with technical skills related to ECD.  In the long term
the Council should be institutionalised within a major Ministry. </b></ul></ol><p>

<center><b>PART I:  MAIN STUDY</b></center><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SCOPE OF THE STUDY</b><p>
<p>
This study consisted of three phases.  The first phase was a workshop, held in
Kuala Lumpur, July, 1994.  All government agencies currently providing some
type of ECD programme were in attendance.  At the workshop, Phase 2 was
developed.  Phase 2 involved the mapping of what exists in terms of current
service provision and the supports for such provision (e.g. curriculum,
materials, and training); the legislation/ policies in place related to ECD
programmes; and coordination of services. While the focus of the Phase 2 review
was primarily on what is being offered by various government departments, where
there is a significant contribution to ECD by non-governmental agencies (NGOs),
the private sector and those involved in ECD provision for commercial reasons,
these were also included in the study.  Phase 3 consisted of another workshop.
At that workshop, held November 21-22 in Kuala Lumpur, the results of Phase 2
were presented and the recommendations were formulated. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DEFINITION OF TERMS:</b><p>
<p>
Early Childhood Development (ECD)<p>
<p>
Early on in the study it was realized that we needed to have a common
understanding of what is meant by the term Early Childhood Development (ECD).
There are two parts to the phrase, <i>early childhood</i> and
<i>development</i>.  As it is currently used internationally, <i>early
childhood</i> is defined as the period of a child's life from conception to age
9. <p>
<p>
The inclusion of children from conception through age 8 in a definition of
early childhood development is consistent with the way developmental
psychologists view the continuum of children's development. Children below the
age of 9 learn best when they have objects they can manipulate; when they have
chances to explore the world around them; when they can experiment and learn
from trial-and-error within a safe and stimulating environment.  At about the
age of nine they begin to view the world differently.  They can manipulate
ideas and learn concepts mentally and are less dependent on objects.  Thus in
terms of learning theory, the birth through age 8 time period presents a
developmental continuum.<p>
 <p>
Another reason for including children in the early primary grades in a
definition of early childhood development is that there is often a difficult
transition for children either from home or from a preschool programme into the
primary school, due to the radical differences in expectations.  Thus, if
programmes for children before they enter the primary school are to be
effective, there needs to be interface between what happens in the preschool
and lower primary school.  This does not mean that early childhood programmes
for the children under the age of 6 have to accommodate to the requirements of
the primary school.  It means that the primary school also needs to be examined
in terms of its readiness to receive children.<p>
<p>
In the definition of ECD <i>development</i> is being defined as a process of
change in which the child comes to master more and more complex levels of
moving, thinking, feeling and interacting with people and objects in the
environment.  Development involves both a gradual unfolding of biologically
determined characteristics and the learning process. <p>
<p>
<i>Learning</i> is the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, habits and
values through experience and experimentation, observation, reflection, and/or
study and instruction.  Both the child's physical growth (the child's health
and nutrition history and current health and nutritional status) are crucial in
the child's overall development.  Where the child is developmentally either
facilitates or inhibits future learning.  Thus learning is part of the
development process. And, learning begins at birth; it is not something that
happens once the child is exposed to the 3Rs or enters primary school. <p>
<p>
To further clarify the relationship between development and learning, it is
important to define the basic principles of child development and learning that
were brought to this study. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CHILD DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES</b><p>
<p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Development begins pre-natally and learning is occurring at birth.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Attention to the developmental and learning needs of children
should begin with pre- and post-natal interventions and be continued
thereafter.<p>
<p>
   	<li><b>Development and learning occur continuously as a result of the child
interacting with the environment.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions can focus on changing the child and/or on changing
the environment (which includes the immediate family, the community, social and
political institutions).  <p>
<p>
   	<li><b>Development has several inter-related dimensions within which learning
occurs. </b> These include physical, cognitive, social, spiritual and emotional
dimensions (each of which affects the other and all of which are developing
simultaneously).<p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Development and learning must be seen holistically and
interventions should provide integrated attention to the child, including
attention to needs for protection, food, health care, affection, interaction
and stimulation, security provided through consistency and predictability, and
play allowing exploration. All of these elements should be present to support
the child' development.<p>
<p>
   	<li><b>Development proceeds in predictable steps and learning occurs in
recognized sequences.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions should follow an appropriate sequence. Activities
should provide the child with a developmentally appropriate challenge.  There
is no value in presenting them before a child is developmentally ready for
them.<p>
<p>
   	<li><b>There is a great deal of individual and social variability in children's
rates and styles of development and of learning.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions should be able to identify and adjust to varying
individual and social needs of children.<p>
<p>
   	<li><b>Children are active participants in their own development and
learning.</b> Learning and related development involves the child's
construction of knowledge, not an adult's imposition of information.  The
skills which are the basis for constructing knowledge improve with practice.<p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions should include opportunities for children to learn
by doing, to be engaged in problem-solving, and the develop language and
communication skills. They should not put undue emphasis on cognitive/mental
development.<p>
<p>
   	<li><b>Children learn in many ways:</b> by playing and exploring, by using all
their senses, by imagining, by imitating, by interacting socially with
others.<p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Integrated interventions promoting social, emotional and spiritual
development as well as cognitive learning can take advantage of varied forms of
learning, consistent with cultural ways even while taking into account that
there are recognized sequences and activities that facilitate learning. <p>

<p>
	Therefore: Interventions should include ways to address the needs of children
within the context of the family and community.  Attention should be given to

<p>
<p>
In addition to some principles about child development, it is useful to also
outline some of the programming principles which have provided the framework
for the analysis of current ECD programming in Malaysia.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES</b><p>
  <p>
  	Some of the following operational principles are directly related to
the principles of development and learning set out previously.  Others are
general principles of programming that apply to ECD programmes as well as to
other kinds of programmes. Behind all of the principles is the desire to mount
effective and sustainable programmes.<p>
<p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Seek programme integration in conceptualizing, planning, delivering
services, establishing content and promoting use.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	This principle derives in part from the holistic nature of child development
in which physical, mental, social and emotional and spiritual dimensions of
development interact with and affect each other.  Hence, effectiveness requires
integrated attention to children.  In addition, there is a maximization of
resources when programmes are multi-dimensional, combining health, nutrition,
educational and social actions.   <p>
  <p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Foster participation by individuals, families and communities who are to
be the primary beneficiaries.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	A principle of active participation is consistent with the basic principles of
learning and development described above.  Sustained human and social
development and the sustainability of programmes all depend on enhancing
people's capacities to improve their own lives and to take greater control over
their own destinies.<p>
<p>
<p>
   	<ul><li><b>Build child-focused partnerships by expanding existing collaboration and
bringing together new partners supportive of development.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	Neither governments nor communities nor a wide range of non-governmental
organizations can easily maintain an effective programme without help.  The
principle of developing partnerships between government, non-governmental
agencies, the private sector and the community arises from social as well as
financial needs.<p>
<p>
   	<ul><li><b>Build on inherent strengths and local childrearing practices that are
beneficial to child and social development.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	Knowledge about solutions to child development problems can be found in
experience and traditional wisdom as well as in academic wisdom or new
technologies. Childrearing practices that are supportive of children's growth
and development should be encouraged and built upon in programming.<p>
<p>
   <ul><li>	<b>Take an inter-generational view; seek ways of involving children, youth
and adults.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	Programmes of early childhood development can and should benefit parents,
other caregivers and community members as well as children.  Child care, for
instance, is generally the responsibility of various family members (older
siblings and extended family members in addition to fathers and mother).
Programmes should take into account the needs of families as well as the needs
of children. <p>
<p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Be open to diversity and to complementary approaches.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	This principle derives in part from the social and individual variation in
children' needs.  It is also derived from a recognition of the cultural
diversity which exists within and across nations. Programmes which respect this
diversity will necessarily differ. <p>
<p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Be aware of the total environment and its impact on the child's
life.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	A child does not exist on his/her own.  The child's development in affected by
the environment with which the child interacts.  This includes the home, the
community, social institutions and legal frameworks, and a cultural ethos.  A
comprehensive programme to improve child development should function
simultaneously at these different levels, focusing respectively on the child,
caregivers, national institutions and policies, and the knowledge base of the
society. <p>
<p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Seek quality.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	Low quality programmes are ineffective, depriving children of benefits, and
represent a waste of resources.  In seeking quality, recognize that it is
affected by the motivation and training of programme personnel, the physical
environment, the materials used, and the form of the curriculum.  A quality
programme is appropriate to the stage of development and addresses the needs of
the child involved while respecting individual differences in development.
Quality cannot be legislated.  Setting norms and standards does not guarantee
quality.  Neither is quality defined by expenditure level.<p>
<p>
   	<ul><li><b>Aim at universal attention to children, but with special recognition of
children living in conditions that put them at increased risk of delayed or
debilitated development.</b></ul><p>
	<p>
	This principle recognizes the need for all children to be supported as they
grow and develop, while stressing the urgency of attending to children living
in poverty or those who are discriminated against as a result of ethnic
diversity.  <p>
 <p>
<ul><li><b>Coverage is best achieved by combining a variety of approaches rather
than developing a single national model meant to apply to all.</b></ul><p>
  <p>
	Attention to all the children can be sought through a series of different
programmes responding to distinct needs.  There need not be one national
programme that is extended to all children, parents or communities.<p>
<p>
<ul><li>   	<b>Seek cost-effectiveness.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	This principle recognizes the importance of using scarce resources efficiently
and effectively.  This does not mean that "low-cost" programmes are necessarily
the best. If they are not effective they represent a waste of resources. In
general, strategies that stress prevention are more cost-effective than
compensatory strategies.<p>
<p>
   <ul><li>	<b>Incorporate monitoring and evaluation into programmes from the
outset.</b></ul><p>
<p>
	This principle recognizes that many programmes are not effective or are not
sustained because they do not include the capacity to analyze strengths and
weaknesses and to adjust accordingly.  It is with these principles and
guidelines in mind that the review of early childhood development programmes in
Malaysia was undertaken. Before reviewing the findings of the study, however,
it is important to clarify how ECD terminology is used in Malaysia.<p>
<p>
  <p>
<b>ECD TERMS IN MALAYSIA </b><p>
<p>
What is important in the Malaysian context is to realise that the pre-school
years (in this instance ages 5 and 6) are only a part of the early childhood
continuum.  Thus pre-school and ECD are not interchangeable terms.<p>
<p>
In Malaysia, the term <i>kindergarten</i> has been used to refer to a half-day
programme for children 5 &amp; 6 years of age.  However, there has been a
recent shift in terminology.  These are now called <i>preschools</i>.  Children
below the age of 4 are provided for in <i>child care</i> centres.  Children are
also taken care of in homes by childminders.  This is known as <i>home-based
child care</i>.  <i>Community-based</i> generally refers to parent education
programmes.<p>
<p>

<center><b>PART II: FINDINGS</b></center><p>
<p>
<b>RESEARCH ON ECD</b><p>
<p>
The research on ECD in Malaysia has been focused primarily on various aspects
of pre-school education.  A major study was undertaken in November 1980 when
the Educational Planning Committee commissioned the educational Planning and
Research Division (EPRD) of the Ministry of Education to undertake a study of
preschool education in Malaysia.  The study was designed to provide data that
could be used in the formulation of policy.  The study received support from
the Economic Planning Unit as well, as they were seeking a comprehensive
understanding of preschool education in Malaysia.  Financial support for the
study was received from UNICEF.  <p>
<p>
In relation to the study a series of seminars was held in different parts of
Malaysia.  The first occurred in December 1981. Within this seminar the areas
to be covered in the study were outlined.  The second seminar, held in
September 1983, focused specifically on preschool curriculum.  The third and
final seminar was held in December 1984. At that seminar the findings from the
study were presented and discussed. (UNICEF, undated - circa 1985, pg.3)<p>
<p>
Within the December 1984 Seminar, there were a series of papers presented that
focused on the impact of preschool education on primary school performance. One
paper in particular, "Major Findings of the Correlational Study" (Zainal,
1984), looked at children's performance in primary school at Standard I and II
in relation to their preschool experience.  The results indicated that there is
a "head start" advantage for those who have had preschool.  However, the amount
of advantage gained by attending preschool depends on the type of preschool
centres attended and the type of primary schools attended, as well as the
location of both.  <p>
<p>
There was also a relationship between socio-economic status and the extent to
which children benefitted from preschool.  Those children from more
disadvantaged areas gained more than children from higher socio-economic
groups. (UNICEF, circa 1985, pg. 20-21)  Thus the argument can be made that any
government provision of ECD services should be targeted to the more
disadvantaged strata of society.  And, by and large, ECD programmes supported
by the government of Malaysia have focused on reaching children in rural and
low-income urban areas who could benefit most from an ECD programme. <p>
<p>
An important aspect of the Zainal study was that it focused on the nature of
the primary school that children entered as well as the type of preschool
experience children had.  Too often studies focus only on the impact of the
preschool experience on children's later achievement, not taking into account
the fact that primary schools are very different and that what the child brings
to the primary school in terms of knowledge, skills and competencies is only
part of the equation for success.  The other critical feature is the school's
capacity and readiness to build on what the child brings. <p>
A research project reported on in the preschool study focused on dropouts
(1973).  At the time of the study there was an `express' class within the
primary school.  In essence this amounted to a double promotion.  It was
discovered that 90% of the children who were put into the express class were
those who had a preschool experience. (UNICEF, circa 1984, pg.3) In other
words, those with preschool were better prepared for school than their peers
and this was immediately evident when they reached the primary school. <p>
<p>
Within the Third National Seminar there was also a paper on the impact of care
being provided outside the home during the early years on children's later
achievement. (Yusof, 1984)  The study indicated that some children who are left
in childcare centres and preschools because their mothers work full-time may
face developmental problems.  He noted that the reason for this was that most
childcare centres do not provide `adequate facilities both physical and human
to nurture the child at such  tender age.'  (UNICEF, circa 1985, pg. 21)
Frequently custodial care facilities, while keeping the child safe, do not
provide children with the stimulation they need to develop fully.  <p>
<p>
The relationship between poor quality programmes and children's later
development are echoed in other countries.  When children do not have a
stimulating environment within the centre-based programme, their development
suffers.  Thus, when we are promoting the importance of early childhood
programmes to foster the growth and development of children, we must be clear
that we are advocating for QUALITY programmes, not simply any programme. <p>
<p>
The preschool study undertaken by EPRD focused primarily on the structure of
the pre-school programme -- how many children were being reached, and where.
In addition it looked at the teaching force involved in preschool programmes
and the administrative and organisational structure in place to support the
programme. It also looked at the issue of costs (fees charged, staff salaries
and sources of income).  The results of the study were compiled and
recommendations for action were put forward. <p>
<p>
Beyond the specific research related to pre-school, Malaysia is rich in studies
on child development, particularly from across-cultural perspective (Chiam,
1991).  However, the results of this kind of academic research has seldom been
applied programmatically. There are a few studies available on the health,
hygiene and nutritional status of young children which highlight useful data
for health programming and education. <p>
<p>
Other than the attempt by the Department of Welfare to compile traditional
parenting practices among the different ethnic groups, none of the other
government agencies involved in ECD provision has seriously undertaken
empirical/applied research relating to ECD issues beyond studies of the
preschool. Further, few of the ECD programmes have incorporated action-research
as an integral component of its data-based planning and programming.  An
exception is a recent study commissioned by KEMAS to assess parent involvement
in the KEMAS preschool programme. The results of the study showed that KEMAS
parents who send their children to the preschool (TBK) have little knowledge
about the TBK objectives, children's daily  activities and curriculum.  In
addition, both parents and community members stated that their involvement in
the programme was important (85% and 76% respectively), yet they report that
their input is very low. (Putri, Bahaman and Ariffin, 1994) <p>
<p>
Evaluation of programme impact and effectiveness are almost negligible. If at
all available, these are mostly done in-house in the form of summative and
status reports and therefore lack independent and objective assessment. No
longitudinal studies have been carried out on any current ECD model.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>REVIEW OF CURRENT ECD ACTIVITIES</b><p>
<p>
To understand the position of ECD activities in Malaysia today it is important
to get some sense of trends over the last 20 years.  For example, in Table 1 it
is possible to see the growth in the number of preschools during that time
period.  As can be seen, there has been tremendous growth in terms of preschool
provision.<p>

There has also been an interesting change in the number of children in
preschool centres.  The average number of children in a centre has decreased
over the years, from 71 children in 1970,  to 44 children in 1994. <p>
<p>
Another way to look at the increase is in terms of the percentage of the age
cohort that is served in an ECD programme.  In Table 2 there is a presentation
of the number of preschool centres, the number of children served in these
centres and the percentage of the age cohort that is in preschool from 1986 to
1994.<p>
<p>
What Table 2 indicates is that for nearly 10 years the percentage of the age
cohort being served by kindergartens has remained more or less the same -
between 34 and 41%.  At the same time, there has been a 59% increase in the
number of preschool centres, and a 33% increase in the number of children
served. This finding reinforces the fact that the number of children per centre
is decreasing.  It also suggests that the creation of preschools is only
marginally ahead of the population growth rate (20% between 1986 and 1994).

primary school (Entrance into primary school is based on the year in which you

The data in terms of ECD services for children under the age of four are
significant in that there are little data. (See Table 3.)  The earliest there
is recorded data on child care centres is 1992, primarily because child care
centres were not required to register before then. Even now if we look only at
registered centres it does not provide an accurate picture of provision.  There
are a known 600 centres that are on the waiting list to be registered, and it
is estimated that for every known centre there are at least 3 others.  Using
that rough calculation, it can be estimated that roughly 5% of the under five
population is being served in a child care centre.  This does not take into
account the large amount of non-formal care that happens within families and
neighbourhoods. The only way to get accurate numbers on this kind of care is
through a census or door-to-door survey.  <p>

Note:  It is estimated that there are at least 3 unregistered child care
centres for every known centre.  This would mean there are closer to 2547 child
care centres, serving 127,350 children under the age of five.  These numbers do
not include the children on plantations.<p>

In sum, based on the above data, it is apparent that about 40% of the preschool
aged children are in preschool centres, while only about 5% of those from birth
through 4 years of age are in some form of formal child care.  In both
instances, the centres are distributed throughout the country. <p>
<p>
The next question is, who is providing the ECD programmes?  Table 6 shows the
number of preschool centres that are supported by governmental, statutory,
private and social/religious institutions.  Clearly the predominant provider is
the government, with the private sector serving about 20% of those in
preschool.  These percentages have remained fairly constant over the time
period covered.<p>

<p>
<b>1.   The Ministry of Education</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>     The SIXTH MALAYSIA PLAN 1991-1995 : EDUCATION</b></ul><p>
<p>
5.06   Pre-school education which was aimed at preparing the child for primary
school, was provided by both the public and private sectors.  The role of the
Ministry of Education (MOE) was limited to the preparation of the curriculum
and the registration of pre-school centres.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PROSPECTS, 1991-1995</b><p>
<p>
<b>Pre-school Education</b><p>
  <p>
<b>5.37 	During the Sixth Plan period, pre-school education will be expanded
gradually to those areas not served by pre-school facilities.  The Government
aims to supplement existing pre-school facilities by having classes for
children aged five as part of the Government primary schools through a
pre-school annex system.  This is necessary as participation in well-organized
pre-school facilities will give the opportunity for children from low-income
families to have the same head start as others.</b><p>
  <p>
<b>5.38 	The implementation of this new programme by MOE will be undertaken in
three phases.  The first two phases will be implemented in areas where
pre-school facilities are non-existent, while the third phase will be in areas
where facilities are available but benefit only certain sections of the
population.  It is expected that by the end of 1995, the combined efforts of
MOE, other Government agencies and the private sector will ensure that all
children entering standard one in the primary schools would have had at least
one year of pre-school education.  To ensure the success of this programme,
more specialist teachers for pre-school education will be trained. (pgs
170-171)</b><p>
  <p>
<b>Role of the Private Sector in Education and training</b><p>
  <p>
<b>5.83 	The demand for education has resulted in the proliferation of private
institutions offering pre-school to tertiary level education.  The expansion of
private sector education will be encouraged as this will supplement public
sector efforts... A more effective monitoring of these institutions will be
undertaken in order to ensure acceptable standards and quality. (pg 181)</b><p>
  <p>
  <p>
<b>MID-TERM REVIEW OF THE SIXTH MALAYSIAN PLAN: 1991-1995</b><p>
  <p>
<b>8.05    With the increasing number of preschool centres and the need to
ensure safety of children and quality of services provided by these schools, a
coordinating mechanism was established.  In this regard, the Ministry of
Education was responsibility for coordinating the implementation of preschool
programmes which included the registration of centres, development of
curriculum guidelines, and the training of trainers.   (pg. 204)</b><p>
  <p>
<b>Preschool Education</b><p>
  <p>
<b>8.40		As preschool education is important in giving children a head start
and preparing them for formal schooling, facilities in preschools will be
expanded.  While the participation of the private sector and community
organisations is encouraged,the Government will continue to provide these
facilities,particularly to children from low-income families and rural areas,
so that they have equal educational opportunities. (pg.216)</b><p>
  <p>
<p>
<b>The REALITY</b>: <b> A Review of What exists</b><p>
<p>
The Ministry of Education is an important actor when it comes to preschool
education.  They have developed the basic preschool curriculum, and they have
trained the trainers who train teachers in other government-operated preschool
programmes (e.g. KEMAS and National Unity).<p>
<p>
Even so, it was not until 1992 that the Ministry of education became involved
in implementation of preschool programmes.  The Educational Planning and
Research Division within the Ministry, conceptualized and promoted what has
been called the "Annex" preschool program, begun in 1992.  The Annex programme
was designed to help make poor children more `school-ready'.  In the Annex
programme a preschool for 6-year-olds <b>[1]</b> is
implemented on the grounds of the primary school grounds.  The Ministry issued
clear guidelines to the State Department of Education in terms of the criteria
that should be used to admit children into these classes  Responsibility for
applying the criteria is delegated to the state. <p>
<p>
At present, the Annex programme is being implemented in 1131 classes in 1043
schools and 26 teacher training colleges, and currently serves 26,090 children.
It was planned that an addition 870 annex pre-schools would be added to the
programme each year.  However, after only one year of operation, the proposed
expansion of the programme was withheld and the present number of 1131 classes
was mantained. So, while the MOE continues to provide support to the original
Preschool Annex, no additional schools have been added to the system.<p>
<p>
The great majority of the teachers for the Annex schools were recruited from
among the current teaching force.  Teachers were selected by their Heads; they
did not necessarily have an interest in becoming a kindergarten teacher.  These
teachers were then provided with a one-month training.  Some teachers were
drawn from a group provided with a one-year specialised training course on
pre-school education. <p>
<p>
In addition to the teacher, there is an assistant in each class. The assistant
receives no training and is paid on a daily basis for her work ($10/day).  In
instances where the lead teacher is good, the assistant has learned quite a bit
from the modelling done by the teacher, but these teachers need to be given
training and, at a minimum, they need to be under contract rather than on daily
wages.<p>
<p>
Discussion: <p>
<p>
<ol>1.	The Education Act of 1961 does not include adequate provisions for preschool
education, so the Ministry of Education does not currently have a mandate to be
involved in preschool education.  While a new Act has been drafted that would
make the Ministry of Education responsible for preschool education, the Act has
not yet been legislated into law.<p>
<p>
2.	Conceptually the preschool programme should come under the Ministry of
Education, given the age of the children and the linkages that should be
established between preschool and the primary school.  However, in reality,
those within the Ministry of Education who are interested in promoting
preschool education do not have enough internal or external support to develop
and coordinate the implementation of a solid programme.<p>
<p>
3. 	The Annex schools were developed by the Educational Planning and Research
Division (EPRD).  However, they are not an implementing branch of the Ministry
of Education.  In fact, the School Division is responsible for implementation.
As the program has been transferred from EPRD to the School Division, the
commitment to and belief in the efficacy of the preschool programme has not
been conveyed.  There were also difficulties in the design of the programme
which have made it difficult to implement. This has led to problems in relation
to acceptance of the programme at the primary school level.</ol>  <p>
<p>
Conclusion:<p>
<p>
Although there has been no formal evaluation of the Preschool Annex programme,
a generally expressed concern is that the educational approach is too close to
formal primary schooling.  This is probably the result of the fact that many
Annex teachers were formerly primary school teachers.  Also, the location of
the preschool on the primary school compound reinforces a more formal approach
to preschool.<p>
<p>
Several considerations appear to argue against an increased preschool
implementation role for the Ministry of Education.  First, the Ministry is not
currently in a position to expand the Annex programme.  Second, with its
traditional pedagogical approach, the Ministry of Education has no particular
comparative advantage in the development of a broader concept of integrated ECD
services for young children from conception up to school entry. <p>
<p>
2.	<b>Ministry of Community Development - KEMAS</b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>The SIXTH MALAYSIA PLAN:  Community Development</b></ul><p>
  <p>
<b>14.33   The main objective of the community development programme is to
inculcate positive values oriented towards development and self-reliance
amongst the rural and sub-urban population. Various agencies such as the
Community Development Division of the Ministry of Rural Development (KEMAS),
Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA), Rubber Industry Smallholder
Development Authority (RISDA) and Farmers Organization Authority (FOA) carried
out community development activities.  The activities of KEMAS included family
development, nutrition, family health, hygiene, home economics as well as
provision of services, such as the establishment of rural libraries and
pre-school centres.  (pg. 373-374)</b><p>
  <p>
<p>
<b>PROSPECTS 1991-1995</b><p>
  <p>
<b>14.69  KEMAS will continue to undertake programmes to develop values
oriented towards the development of self-reliance.  The focus of activities
will be on the rural population whose activities will be supported and guided
by KEMAS social workers.</b><p>
  <p>
<b>14.70 	During the Plan period, the construction of three family development
training centres and various community service centres will be continued.
KEMAS will also expand its programme for the rural population by providing more
rural libraries and pre-school centres.  The training and manpower development
capabilities of KEMAS will be upgraded through the improvement and renovation
of existing training centres.  (pg.383)</b><p>
  <p>
<p>
<b>The REALITY:  KEMAS - A review of what exists</b><p>
<p>
KEMAS began in 1957 with an adult literacy program.  In 1960 Community
Education was added to their portfolio.  By 1963 it was felt that basic
literacy had been obtained, so they shifted to more general home economics
activities to sustain literacy and they added religious education.  In 1970
they created the Community Development Division.  Within this, pre-school was
added as a component of Family Life education.  It was reasoned that the
Ministry of Health works with children pre-natally through the age of 4 (see
comments on the Ministry of Health), and that the Ministry of Education took up
children at age 7, leaving the 4-6 year olds without services.  Thus KEMAS
decided to focus their services on this age group. Now the pre-school program
is a major part of what KEMAS offers.<p>
<p>
Before 1992, any community could request a KEMAS preschool. At that point KEMAS
realized that preschools were mushrooming in urban areas, particularly among
private providers.  They felt that these preschools were further widening the
gap between urban and rural children.  Thus KEMAS decided to operate in the
rural areas.  However, where KEMAS had opened preschools in urban areas before
1992 they maintain the centre. <p>
<p>
The KEMAS preschool is a joint venture between of the community and the
government.  A local committee is formed, with the president being a community
member, the teacher is the Secretary and the Assistant teacher is the
Treasurer. The committee chooses the candidate for training.  Thus whenever
possible the teacher is someone from the community itself who is already known
to the parents.<p>
<p>
The committee is responsible for identifying an appropriate building to house
the preschool.  In housing estates this is not difficult. When housing
complexes are built the architect is required to provide a space for a
community hall.  This is generally able to accommodate the preschool.  In
instances where there is no suitable building, government will provide the
funds for the program. The community is then responsible for the maintenance of
the facility.<p>
<p>
The basic curriculum for the KEMAS preschools is the one developed by the
Ministry of Education, but with heavier emphasis on the 3Rs.  With regards the
spiritual education, in addition to religion in the Preschool Curriculum
Guidelines, KEMAS has added more content to religious education.  Recently
KEMAS has also added Islamic Education and the teaching of English to the
preschool curriculum.  Children are taught the English alphabet and learn to
recognize a set of English words and their Bahasa Malaysia equivalent. <p>
<p>
Conclusions:<p>
<p>
In terms of having responsibility for actually implementing preschool
programmes, KEMAS is the largest government provider. Today KEMAS operates
nearly 7,000 centres (6819 in 1993).  They calculate that 10,000 are required
to provide full coverage.  The mandate states that the teacher/child ratio
should be 1:25.  They try to hold to this, but in some cases they go to 30+
children in one class.<p>
<p>
In terms of positioning KEMAS in relation to the other Ministries and agencies
involved in ECD, it is important to understand that because of the structure
and mandate of KEMAS, it stands outside the rules and regulations that govern
other Government programs. While they have the best developed infrastructure to
support ECD provision, they need to develop an integrated curriculum that is
more developmentally appropriate for preschool-aged children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>3.</b>	<b>Ministry of Health </b><p>
<p>
The Ministry of Health has taken a broad definition of health.  Health is "a
state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the
absence of infirmity."  Thus the Ministry of Health emphasises both preventive
and curative medicine.<p>
<p>
Organizationally, policy is developed at the national level.  Implementation of
policy is coordinated at the state level.  Services are delivered at the
district level through a two-tiered system.  The primary contact point for the
community is the Community Clinic, which ultimately will be staffed by 2
Community Nurses.  These clinics are served by a team from a Main health
centre, where a doctor is based.  Referrals from a Community Clinic go to the
Main Clinic and then if necessary, a referral is made to the District Hospital.
<p>
<p>
The health infrastructure in Malaysia provides coverage throughout the country.
In Table 8 is a listing of the types and numbers of health care facilities that
can be found in the various parts of Malaysia.<p>
<p>
What is more important, however, than simply the kinds and numbers of health
care facilities that are available, is the type of coverage these facilities
provide for the population.  Table 9 presents the numbers and percentage of the
age population that is covered, with a focus on infants and young children.
The data are impressive.  Clearly health is seen as a priority in Malaysia.<p>

<p>
The health infrastructure that has been developed means that nearly all
children are seen on a fairly regular basis during the first two years of life.
This presents an opportunity to provide the mother with child development as
well as health information.<p>
<p>
The programme within the Ministry of Health that can be seen as an integral
part of early childhood development programming is the Primary Care and Family
Development Programme, which includes:<p>
<p>
1.	 Antenatal care of pregnant women.  Approximately 600,000 are pregnant at
any one time.  At this point 80% of these women receive pre-natal care.
However, there are regional differences in coverage. In the Peninsula coverage
is closer to 96%.  In Sabah/Sarawak it is closer to 75%  To improve antenatal
care in Sabah/Sarawak, two programmes have been undertaken: High Risk Approach
and Safe Motherhood.<p>
<p>
2.	 Intranatal services (birth).  35% of births occur at home.  This is
encouraged in situations where it is anticipated that there is no risk to the
mother or infant.  The birth is assisted by mid-wives or staff nurses.  A new
category of provider is being trained.  This is a Community Nurse.  This is a
person who has more training than a mid-wife, but less than a staff nurse.  Two
years of training is required for this position (6 months for those currently
serving as mid-wives).<p>
<p>
Traditional Birth nurses still exist in some areas.  While they are not
encouraged to assist in deliveries, they are given training in case they are
the ones responsible.  They are also given training in how to identify high
risk births.<p>
<p>
3. 	 Postnatal care.  There is follow-up for both the mother and the child.
For home births a visit is made on days 1,2,3,4,6,10, and 20. For children born
in the hospital the follow-up is slightly less intensive. <p>
<p>
4.	 Care of newborns and infants - The components of health provided at this
time are nutrition (coupled with growth monitoring), immunizations
(poliomyelitis, tuberculosis, diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, measles and
Hepatitis B), and developmental monitoring.<p>
<p>
There is a strong emphasis on breastfeeding. Infant formula is not provided in
the hospital, nor is it for sale at a reduced rate<p>
<p>
5.  	Child (1-6).  Services for children in this age group focus on nutrition,
physical and developmental growth monitoring.  A growth card has been created,
launched nationally November, 1994, that is to be used by and with mothers.
Children are routinely given health check-ups only once a year between the ages
of 2 and 5. <p>
<p>
6.	 School Health programme. This includes screening in Std. I, VI and Form
III, school dental services, school feeding and nutrition and a healthy school
environment. These services are undertaken by the Ministry of Health, but
delivered through the school.  Health education is the responsibility of the
Ministry of Education.  <p>
<p>
The Ministry of Health also works with children with special needs, children in
poor families through the distribution of a food basket to families containing
specialized foods for undernourished children, and some work with abused
children. The latter are served predominantly by NGOs and the Ministry of
National Unity and Social Development.<p>
<p>
Plantations have their own curative services, but they lack prevention
services.  Legally the  Ministry of Health cannot provide preventative or
curative services to plantations.  In situation where there are 20+ children
who should be immunized, the health services is allowed to do that on the
plantation.  Otherwise parents must bring their children to local clinics.
Where there is a recognized need, clinics have been established  near
plantations and they have adjusted their hours to accommodate those who work on
plantations.<p>
<p>
<p>
Conclusions:<p>
<p>
While the Ministry of Health does not see itself as providing early childhood
development services, in fact they are.  Health services are a critical part of
an overall early childhood effort. The Home-based Child Health Card that was
introduced to the country in November, 1994 (for implementation in January
1995) is an extremely useful way to help parents better understand children's
growth and development.  By using the card as an entry point, other information
can be introduced to parents as well, information that they can use as they
support the child's development. Thus the Ministry of Health, through their
Primary Care and Family Development Programme, is clearly a partner in the
overall approach to early childhood development <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>4.	Ministry of National Unity and Social Development </b><p>
  <p>
<ul><b>	A. National Unity</b></ul><p>
  <p>
The Department of National Unity was created in 1969. The specific purpose of
the Department is to strengthen and promote integration and national unity.
Today one of the activities of the Department is to provide opportunities for
positive inter-racial contact.  One of the primary vehicles that the Department
has chosen for this is preschools in the urban and suburban areas. Thus the
Department provides multi-cultural preschools for children aged 5 &amp; 6 (with
some four-year-olds in attendance), living in low-income housing areas.<p>
<p>
The Department of National Unity has Organizers who work within a housing area.
These operate under District officers who are under State Unity officers, with
final responsibility for the activities being at the national level.  The local
organizers promote the creation of what is known as a Self-reliance Committee
within a housing area, whether that be a housing block, or a squatter
settlement, or a Kampung (village).  The Rukun Tetangga (Neighbourhood
Committee) is formed along guidelines provided by the Department.  When a
neighbourhood group is ready to form a committee they make application to the
Department.  When approved, the Committee can undertake activities with
financial support from the national government. <p>
<p>
The preschools created within the Self-Reliance activities have their own
committee, known as the Unity Kindergarten Welfare Committee. (Other Committees
include the Women's Wing and the Youth Wing, each of which is geared to develop
appropriate activities for their constituent group.) The Kindergarten Committee
is chaired by a parent, and the teacher serves as the Secretary while the
Assistant Teacher is the Treasurer.  The committee is responsible for
organizing activities related to the preschool -- sports days, field trips,
contests, graduations, etc. However, it does not take on any real
decision-making in terms of the preschool.<p>
<p>
The teachers are on contract with the Department of National Unity.  And while
it is desirable that they come from the community where they work, this is not
the usual case. Generally teachers have completed Secondary School, with the
Assistant teachers having completed Form III.  The Trainers have been trained
by the Ministry of Education. Once trained, these trainers then train the
teachers.  After being trained, teachers are visited regularly (as often as
once a month) by a Supervisor hired by the Department.  However, in most
instances the Supervisor has not been trained to provide substantive feedback
to the teachers in terms of their work with children.  More often than not, her
feedback focuses on administrative and/or infrastructure concerns.  When the
Supervisor has been a teacher herself, then she is able to facilitate the
teaching/learning process within the preschool.<p>
<p>
The preschool programme consumes 40% of the Department of National Unity's
annual budget, with the majority of the costs being teacher salaries.  At the
present time there are 485 centres, serving 17,523 children. The department
hopes to add another 100 classes in 1995.  The ultimate goal is to have a
preschool associated with every Self-reliance Committee. At the present time
this would mean 2300 preschools. <p>
<p>
The population distribution in most pre-school centres has one dominant racial
group due to the reality of housing and population distribution. <p>
The preschool is taught in Bahasa Malaysia, and the curriculum developed by the
Ministry of Education is being implemented.  When Malays are in the majority
Islamic Education is included within the preschool curriculum  Children are
introduced to Arabic letters and basic words, as well as Islamic practices in
terms of prayers, manners, etc.<p>
<p>
Preschools run for 3 hours a day.  The preferable timings are in the morning
(8:30-11:30).  However, in some areas there is so much demand that an afternoon
class is also provided (1:30-4:30). In some instances the Kindergarten
Committee has created its own classes to meet the need, but the Department does
not encourage this as the same standards may not be met.  So, to the extent
possible, the Department covers the costs of the preschool and it is brought
under their umbrella.<p>
Other activities undertaken by the Department include socio-ethnic research on
inter-ethnic relations and issues related to it. This is in line with the
Department's objective of inculcating, promoting and strengthening national
unity and national integration.  Accordingly the functions of the Department
are as follow: <p>
<p>
<ul>o	To promote national unity and national integration.<p>
<p>
o	To prevent conflicts amongst the various races, communities and states.<p>
<p>
o	To instill good citizenship values towards the creation of a united<br>
	 Malaysian nation.<p>
<p>
o	To monitor and evaluate racial and community relations.<p>
<p>
o	To co-ordinate national unity programmes and activities with government and<br>
	 non-governmental organisations.</ul><p>
<p>
Conclusions:<p>
<p>
While the current structures within the National Unity Programme provide
considerable administrative support to teachers, mechanisms are lacking to
provide substantive support in terms of the teaching/learning process.<p>
<p>
The Department has expressed an interest in:  conducting basic research on the
impact of the preschools (the programme has been in operation for 18 years and
there has never been an evaluation of the effort to know whether or not it is
working); developing training for the supervisors so that they are able to give
more substantive feedback to teachers; and developing programs that would
increase parental involvement. <p>
<p>
  <p>
<b>	B. Department of  Social Welfare</b><p>
<p>
While the role of the Department of Social Welfare in ECD programmes is not
addressed directly in the Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995, there are references
to the importance of the family.  Since these were elaborated on in the
Mid-Term Review, the relevant sections from that document are quoted.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Family Development and Welfare</b><p>
  <p>
<b>9.33	 ... Recognising that the family is the core institution which can
effectively nurture and instill more and ethical values in the young as well as
provide care and support for the sick, disabled and the aged, focus was thus
given to the strengthening of the family as the basic unit of society.  Towards
this end, the family development programme emphasized the improvement of health
and welfare of the family through family life education, parenting courses and
marriage/family counselling, and inculcation of positive values in the
individuals, family and society... (pg 239)</b><p>
  <p>
<b>9.34	In view of the increased labour force participation rate of women at
47% in 1993, various programmes were implemented to help women cope with the
challenging responsibilities they face at home and at the workplace...  (pg
239)</b><p>
  <p>
<b>9.35	Programmes and projects to ensure the optimum development of children
continued to be undertaken during the period.  This commitment was further
recognized when Malaysia became one of the signatories of the World Declaration
for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children on 18 July 1991.  This
Declaration arose from the World Summit for Children in October 1990 which
called for the achievement of specific goals for children in the fields of
health, education, welfare and environment. (pg 240)</b><p>
  <p>
<b>9.36	To provide better legal protection for the well-being of children, the
Child Protection Act was enacted in 1991... In addition, the Child Care Centre
Act, 1984 which provides for proper child care practices was further
enforced.... (pg. 240)</b><p>
  <p>
<b>9.78	Child development programmes will be guided by the National Plan of
Action for the Survival, Protection and Development of Children.  This Plan
will enable a more comprehensive approach towards optimizing the potential of
children through the implementation of various programmes such as child health,
nutrition and basic education and literacy. (pg. 248)</b><p>
  <p>
<p>
The Mid-Term Review clearly endorses the creation of child care alternatives,
both for the benefit of working women and for the direct benefit of the
child.<p>
<p>
Historically the Department of Social Welfare has developed its services in
response to social needs, and to some extent that continues to be true.
However, like the other Departments they are also developing preventive
services.  While their function is to monitor and enforce standards, they are
also aware of the kinds of programmes that might be developed.  For example,
the department is aware of the child care demands of working women and have
seen the need to develop full-day child care for children from soon after birth
through the early primary grades. <p>
<p>
In the early 1980s a survey of provision was conducted with support from
UNICEF.  A total of 537 centres were surveyed.  These included the formal
centres and home-based child care.  The study looked at issues related to
physical safety, the programme for children, materials available, the
qualifications of the providers, and parent involvement.  The results showed
that plantations had the poorest facilities and overall programme.  In the
urban areas the problem was the promotion of `accelerated learning'.  The study
led to a drafting of the first legislation to govern the operation of child
care centres. This resulted in the Child Care Centre Act of 1984. This was
enforced in 1985.  The Act was amended in 1993 to allow the Department of
Social Welfare to accredit training centres.  <p>
Within the Act child care facilities with less than 4 children do not need to
register.  Those taking care of 4-9 children are registered as home-based
programmes and those with more than 10 children are classified as
`institutional' programmes.  The teacher child ratio should be 1:5 for children
under 3, 1:10 for 3-4 year olds.  Other requirements include basic teacher
qualifications, a programme of daily activities, and the need for parents to
have a clear understanding of what the centres provide.  <p>
<p>
The Department of Social Welfare is responsible for registering all child care
centres.  To develop a comprehensive set of guidelines, they have collaborated
with the Local Authorities, the Fire Department, and Health.  When the others
have approved the application, based on their criteria, Social Welfare issues
the registration.  It costs $50 for a license, which needs to be renewed every
year.<p>
<p>
The Bernard van Leer Foundation has funded several projects within the
Department of Social Welfare. This Foundation has been a very important partner
in supporting the development of early childhood programmes in Malaysia.  They
funded the Alternative Child Care project which led to the development of the
curriculum for ECD programmes and the creation of materials to support teachers
in implementing programmes.  In addition, training packages have been created
at three levels:  Preliminary (primarily for those with low levels of
education); Basic Child Care Course; and the Supervisors Course.  These courses
are offered by staff of the Department.<p>
<p>
In addition to creating curriculum and training packages, one of the objectives
of the van Leer project was to create a Division within the Department of
Social welfare that would support early childhood initiatives.  This did not
come about, so child care training has been incorporated into the Training
Division.  This puts great demand on the Training Division.  As a result, the
quality of the training has been affected, and the Basic Training has been
shortened from 4 to 2 weeks. <p>
<p>
The way the Department of Social Welfare is responding to the demand is through
identifying potential trainers and upgrading their skills so that they can
become trainers. They were co-opted as co-trainers and were paid for their
services. However, with the moral support of the Department of Social Welfare,
this group of trainers and other care-providers formed the Association of Child
Care Providers (PPBM), which has become a registered body. Now Kuala Lumpur,
Selangor, Sabah and Sarawak have their own set of trainers, and the PPBM has a
much wider scope and coverage. (See section on NGOs.)<p>
<p>
Conclusions:<p>
<p>
The Department of Social Welfare operates from an integrated approach and has
an infrastructure in place, that with appropriate training and support, can be
used to explore alternative approaches to ECD.<p>
<p>
<b>5.	Ministry of Human Resources</b><p>
<p>
	<ul>	<b>Department of Labour</b></ul><p>
<p>
The Department of Labour is within the Ministry of Human Resources. When the
Department of Labour began, the focus was on protecting the needs of the
workers.  Thus they served as an enforcement agency.  Within the last five
years they have taken a more proactive role in the promotion of workers'
welfare.   They come into a discussion of ECD because they are responsible for
the services provided for young children on the estates and plantations, and
more recently in factories and industries. There are more than 1 million people
living on estates and plantations (the majority are Indians and Malays).<p>
<p>
Within the Workers Minimum Standards Housing and Amenities Act (1966) it is
stated that employers must provide nurseries for the children of their workers.
When these began they were seen only as a safe place to keep children and
provide them with some nutritional food.  They are free to the workers (as is
everything on the estates) and they are staffed by "ayahs" who, because of
their title, are seen as housemaids.<p>
<p>
In 1990 the Labour Department amended the 1966 Act to be in line with the Child
Care Centre Act 1984, issued by the Welfare Department.  The new Act states
that those centres that are classified as 'nurseries' (i.e. they serve more
than 10 children between the ages of 0-4) must employ qualified (i.e. trained)
workers. Since the implementation of the amended Act, the Department of Labour
has been seeking ways to train those working in estate child care centres. More
than 800 of these centres exist within the 1500+ estates that have housing for
their employees.  (There may be home-based centres on some estates since the
management has to provide and to register the centre only if they have 10 or
more children between the ages of 0 and 4).<p>
<p>
In 1994, the Department of Labour was given an allocation of $1 million that
was to be used to provide some toys to the child care centres.  However, the
Department decided this was not the best use of the funds since teachers do not
know how to use the materials they are given.  So, they are using some of this
money for training since they feel this would be a better investment of the $1
million.<p>
<p>
A newer venture for the Department of Labour is working with industry and
factories to establish child care centres.  Three projects have already begun
and 40 different factories have made application to create child care centres.
An integrated model centre has been created by INTEL.<p>
<p>
There is both an <i>incentive</i> and a <i>motivation</i> for employers to
create child care facilities, whether it be on the plantations and estates or
in industry.  The <i>incentive</i> comes from the fact that industries are
given a tax break if they provide child care for the children of their workers.
This is an important policy decision in terms of strategies to meet the
intersecting needs of women and children.<p>
<p>
The <i>motivation</i> comes from the fact that they want to make their workers
happy.  There is a shortage of labour in Malaysia.  At the present time labour
for the factories and estates is being brought in from Indonesia and Bangladesh
primarily, although there are workers for other countries as well.  These
workers are costly to the country in that they send all their earnings home.
Thus employers want to hire Malaysians and because they are in high demand, the
employers need to find ways to attract and keep their work force.  Child care
is seen as a benefit that is attractive to women workers. <p>
<p>
At the national level an umbrella committee was created to develop guidelines
for the establishment of child care centres.  (These have been developed but
not yet printed)  The committee consists of members from Treasury, Income Tax,
Welfare, Education, Local government, Housing, and Labour.  The Department of
Labour coordinates this committee.<p>
<p>
<p>
Conclusions:<p>
<p>
In terms of the mandate of the Department of Labour it is possible to see why
they would be concerned about child care issues.  And, it is important to have
people other than those traditionally involved with children's issues promoting
ECD service. However, given that the Department lacks experience and expertise
in ECD provision, a question can legitimately be raised about the
appropriateness of the Department providing training and supervision.  <p>
<p>
An alternative would be to train the Community Services Officer (CSO), who is
hired by the management to oversee the services provided to families on the
estate. She is a key person in terms of overseeing the child care centres.  If
trained appropriately, she can offer training and support to women working in
plantation child care centres.   <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (NGOs)</b><p>
<p>
The mandate of the study is to map out government provision of ECD services and
make recommendations as to the government's role in that provision.  However,
government will never be able to (nor should it) provide 100% of the needed
provision.  Other partners need to be found.  Within most countries there is a
partnership between government, non-governmental agencies (NGOs) and the
private sector in the provision of ECD services.  This is already true in
Malaysia as well.  Thus in making recommendations that build on what already
exists, it is important to know what the NGO community is currently providing
and how that might interface with what the government can provide.  Therefore
in the study design, the major  NGOs with an ECD focus were surveyed.<p>
<p>
At the present time there are two NGOs that are providing considerable support
to the government in terms of ECD, in that they are providing training to those
working in government-sponsored ECD programmes.  The two NGOs are the Malaysian
Kindergarten Association (PTM) and the Association of Child Care Providers
(PPBM).<p>
<p>
<b>Malaysian Kindergarten Association (PTM)   </b><p>
	<p>
The Kindergarten Association (PTM) has been in existence since 1975/76.  There
are currently 3000 members (paying annual dues of $10), all of whom are trained
kindergarten teachers.  Over the years they have provided training to some
10,000 teachers. (They provide training for the Ministry of Education as well
as the private sector.) There are more than 100 people attending each of the
various training courses.  Training is set up in Steps.  There are 6 steps to
complete to get a certificate. Two steps are taught in a ten-day period.  The
courses are offered during school holidays, twice a year.  Thus it would take
someone a year and a half to complete the 6 steps.  <p>
<p>
<b>The Association of Child Care Providers (PPBM)</b><p>
<p>
The PPBM is a group equivalent to the PTM, but with a focus on child care
rather than preschool. This NGO provides training across the age spectrum
included in ECD programmes -- for child care providers and government preschool
teachers, as well as providing training for the private sector.  However,
instead of being linked with the Ministry of Education, they have provided
support to the Department of Social Welfare.  In 1986 a group of 20 providers
were identified to be trained as Trainers.  This was done in two-weeks and
since then 10-12 of these women have both worked with Social Welfare Trainers
in the training of child care workers, and they have offered training on their
own. These trainers have received no additional training and they are now
asking to have their own skills and knowledge upgraded.<p>
<p>
There are some individuals who belong to both PTM and PPBM. There is some
consideration being given to combining the two groups under an umbrella
organisation, in order to provide continuity of curriculum and training for
those working with children from birth up until the child enters the formal
school.   <p>
<p>
There are two other NGOs that are involved in training: Education Welfare
Research Foundation (ERWF) which began with an interest in training preschool
teachers, but now they are interested in services for children under 4,
particularly on estates.  They work closely with the Department of Social
Welfare.  <p>
<p>
The other group is CHILD, which originally focused more on health issues, but
today it has a broader development mandate.  CHILD is working on capacity
building within NGOs, and have taken an interest in ECD issues. <p>
<p>

<center><b>PART III: SUB-STUDIES</b></center><p>
<p>
<p>
Within the larger study, three sub-studies were conducted.  The first was on
curriculum across the 0-6 age range. The second focused on parent and community
involvement, and the third looked at current training systems in place.  The
curriculum and parent involvement sub-studies included the same basic sample.
Sixteen different settings were selected, ranging from government preschools,
to child care centres, to programmes operated by non-governmental agencies and
the private sector. There were both urban and rural programmes included in the
sample.  Specifically the 16 types of programmes selected included the
following:<p>
<p>

<b>CURRICULUM</b><p>
<p>
For each of the agencies/organizations included in the study, the curriculum
was reviewed in terms of its quality, as evaluated against the principles of
child development listed above.  In addition, the support materials available
to the teachers and children were evaluated. The basic review allowed for the
identification of both strengths and gaps in the curriculum and materials
available to teachers and children.<p>
<p>
The subjects of the Review included teachers and principals of the respective
preschools and child care centres, as well as supervisors of home-based
centres. A total of 32 individuals (including teachers, principals and
supervisors), were interviewed. They were selected because they were considered
key figures in the teaching-learning environment and thus they are the best
informants for the purposes of the Review. <p>
<p>
Specifically, the focus was on the:<p>
<p>
<ul>o	objectives of the curriculum<br>
o	type of curriculum used<br>
o	modifications that had been made in the curriculum<br>
o	teaching-learning aids used by teachers<br>
o	type of teacher preparation<br>
o	activities implemented<br>
o	physical quality of the centres<br>
o	child-teacher interactions<br>
o	teaching-learning climate.<br>
o	parental support for curriculum development and implementation<br>
o	child evaluation or assessment supported by the curriculum</ul><p>
<p>
Classroom observations were conducted to gauge implementation of the
curriculum, to assess the teaching - learning processes in the setting, and to
obtain data on the educational setting. <p>
<p>
The findings indicate that generally, regardless of the type of preschool or
child care programme, the majority of programmes have as a major objective the
<i>total development of the child</i>. This may be because the primary
curriculum source for the majority of the programmes are the <i>Garis Panduan
Pra Sekolah Malaysia,</i> or Preschool Curriculum Guidelines, developed by the
Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) within the Ministry of Education. The
guidelines emphasize the total and well balanced development of the
preschool-aged (4-6 year old) child. <p>
<p>
The Preschool Curriculum Guidelines emphasize the total development of the
child: physical, social, emotional, mental, spiritual, civic responsibility,
language development, aesthetics and creative skills.  In 1993 the curriculum
was revised to include a greater emphasis on Islam, the introduction of English
and the introduction of objectives in relation to Vision 2020.  <p>
<p>
The Preschool Curriculum Guidelines include modules and activity books to
assist teachers in implementing the curriculum.  The Curriculum package
consists of a Teacher Resource Manual, activity books, learning materials for
preschoolers, and pictures.  The package also describes and prescribes the
preschool teacher's role, and includes an evaluation guideline for assessing
children's performance and development. <p>
<p>
The private preschools and the religious programmes, such as ABIM, are aware of
the CDC's guidelines, but they have developed their own curriculum.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Summary of the Findings</b><p>
<p>
The Preschool Curriculum Guidelines are very comprehensive and well-grounded in
child development theory.  They provide an excellent framework for the
development of programmes for children 4-6 years of age.  In sum, there is a
solid Malaysian preschool curriculum available.<p>
<p>
In terms of curriculum for children under the age of four, a package has been
developed by the Department of Social Welfare.  This includes a set of 28
modules and support materials - activity sheets, a manual on child development
and parental involvement, training manuals, cassettes containing children's
songs, posters, etc.  However, the conceptual/theoretical framework that has
guided the development of these materials has not been elaborated. The
activities and materials are generic.  There is little attempt to utilise
culturally-relevant materials and experiences from the environment.<p>
<p>
In general, the issue is not the quality of the curriculum available;
difficulties are encountered in curriculum implementation.  Difficulties in
implementation are mainly the result of inadequate training and supervision.
These difficulties are compounded where there have been additions made to the
Preschool Curriculum Guidelines, making it difficult to adequately implement
the curriculum within the current 3 or 3 1/2 hour preschool programme.<p>

<p>
<b>PARENT/COMMUNITY INVOLVEMENT</b><p>
<p>
An important principle of effective child development programmes is that they
include significant community and parent involvement.  Thus each of the
programmes visited in the review, an assessment was made of the current level
of parent and community involvement.  <p>
<p>
As in the curriculum sub-study, a sample of sixteen settings provided the basic
data on parental involvement.  Data were gathered through a parent interview.
The programme was informed when the interviewers would be visiting, and parents
were invited to meet with the interviewers.  What this meant was that parents
self-selected to be included in the study.  It can be surmised that this is a
biased sample.  Parents who came to be interviewed i) were not involved in
full-time employment outside the home, and ii) were likely to be the parents
who were the most involved in the programme since they were comfortable coming
for the interview; and iii) were probably the parents most satisfied with the
programme.  Those whose time did not allow them to come, or who were not
regularly involved in the programme or those, who, for whatever reason, were
unhappy with the programme, were not included in the sample.<p>
<p>
Where it was not possible to interview parents, a questionnaire was sent home.
The rate of return of these questionnaires differed by setting.<p>
<p>
The interview and questionnaires focused on <p>
<p>
<ul>o	why parents sent their children to the programme,<br>
o	what parents perceived that the child received as a result of the
programme,<br>
o	the parent's understanding of what actually happened in the programme<br>
o	the extent of the parent's involvement in class activities,<br>
o	the extent to which parents were actively involved in implementing programme
activities with their children at home,<br>
o	parent's involvement in special activities,<br>
o	the kind of interaction parents have with teachers,<br>
o	how the programme fits into the child's day,<br>
o	fees - what the parents paid and what they are willing to pay</ul><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Findings</b><p>
<p>
What was interesting about the results of this study is that within the
settings included, there was a very narrow definition of parent involvement.
Essentially the nature and extent of a parent's involvement in the programme
was determined by those implementing the programme.  (This was true even in the
parent education programme.)  While it was considered important for parents to
participate in the extra-curricular activities (sports day, festivals, etc),
parents were not expected to be actively involved in the daily programme.  In
some instances parents were given instruction in terms of the kinds of
activities they should be doing with their children at home.  The assumption
being that parents need to be told what to do with their children.  <p>
<p>
In essence there is a uni-directional, top-down approach to parent involvement.
No information is sought from the parents regarding the child's growth and
development.  There is no exchange of information between teacher and parent
that would either help the teacher provide appropriate support for the child in
the programme, nor prepare the parent to understand his/her role in supporting
the child's development.  In summary, there is no linkage or continuity between
the centre and the home.<p>
<p>
If one were to draw a continuum of parent involvement that went from parent
initiated to teacher initiated, the programme included in this sample would
fall toward the programme-initiated end of the continuum (represented by the
X).<p>
<p>
<p>
<center>parent initiated  &lt;---------------------------XXXXX--&gt; programme
initiated</center><p>
<p>
Even those programmes which have an infrastructure in place that would allow
for considerable community and parent involvement in the ECD programme, dictate
the nature of that involvement. <p>
<p>
There are some important implications of this finding.  First, the expectation
-- on both the part of programme implementers and parents -- is that parents
need to be educated about what to do.  The parents' perceptions and values
about children and cultural practices are not respected. Their knowledge about
the child's growth and development is not considered valuable.  Second, the
expectation is that ECD programmes are alternatives to child care and
parenting.  Parents have to take no responsibility, other than allowing their
children to attend the programme, for the development and implementation of the
programme.  What this means is that if the government expectation is for
parents and the community to take greater responsibility for ECD provision, a
different approach is going to have to be taken to parent involvement.  A much
more participatory approach is required.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>TRAINING </b>     <p>
<p>
The objective of this study was to examine the status of existing early
childhood development (ECD) training as provided by government,
non-governmental agencies and the private sector.  Specifically, the study
provided a review of the type of training available, the number of
teachers/caregivers trained, aspects of the training such as content,
methodology, structure, resources, personnel, evaluation, certification, costs,
inter-agency cooperation and linkages and identification of future training
needs. The study was also to assess whether the training had generated adequate
awareness, skills and interest among teachers and caregivers to implement the
Malaysian Preschool Curriculum Guidelines. Finally, it tried to assess to what
extent the skills related to initiating parent involvement and education had
been incorporated in the training programmes.<p>
<p>
  <p>
<b>Sample</b><p>
<p>
Fourteen training programmes were selected for review in this study. For each
programme, one to three trained teachers/caregivers were interviewed to get
their views on the training they had undergone. Trainers, consisting of
managerial/supervisory staff who were involved in the training programme, and
teachers and caregivers who had been selected and trained as trainers, were
also interviewed. <p>
<p>
The sample included six training programmes offered by government and four from
non-government agencies, all of whom were providing training mainly for
institution-based teachers and caregivers. One private sector training was
included. One community and one home-based model were also included in order to
gain some understanding of the kind of training the teachers and caregivers had
undergone.<p>
<p>
Data were collected by using the following instruments:<p>
<p>
<ul>o	observation checklist used for observing trainer-trainee interactions and the
training materials used during the training sessions;<p>
<p>
o	interview questionnaire for programme managers, trainers, and trained
teachers;<p>
<p>
o	a discussion guideline for the focus group discussion.</ul> <p>
<p>
In order to understand some of the issues related to training, it important to
know the status of the current teaching force.  In Table 11 is a summary of the
number of trained and untrained teachers and the number of assistant teachers,
by agency providing ECD services.    <p>
  <p>
  While Table 11 would suggest that less than half of those classified as
teachers are trained, this study revealed that even to be <i>trained</i> may
have little significance in terms of the teacher's knowledge skills and
competencies in working with young children.<p>

Source: <b>Education Statistics</b>, January 1992, Ministry of Education<p>
<p>
The findings of the study can be summarised as follows:<p>
<p>
<b>1.	The Training Programme</b><p>
<p>
<ul>o	all government agencies that deliver ECD programmes are involved in providing
training to their own ECD personnel. Thus, the opportunity to link between
training and programme implementation experiences was available and could be
maximized.<p>
<p>
o	Except for the Ministry of Education and KEMAS, which was undertaking the
one-year, and five and half months training, respectively, the main concern
among government and NGO programmes was primarily to train as many teachers and
caregivers as possible through short training courses of about one to two-week
duration.  Expediency rather than an understanding of what teachers require is
the driving force.<p>
<p>
o	Except for the community-based parent education project in Kelantan, agencies
are focusing on either the training of institution-based preschool teachers and
personnel or child care centre caregivers and personnel. Only EWRF was
conducting both types of training, but as separate programmes.<p>
<p>
o	Except for the Department of Welfare and PPBM, and more recently EWRF, there
is no coordination, nor much collaboration and mutual support among and between
government and NGO training agencies.  Nonetheless, coordination and
collaboration is considered by most NGOs and trained teachers as very
important.<p>
<p>
o	Except for minimal efforts by the child care training programmes and PPBM,
the pre-school training programmes are not much concerned with reinforcing and
integrating parent/home/culture-based learning opportunities for the child. A
few programmes, all targeting one ethnic group, were imparting ways of getting
parents to teach the 3Rs to children, mainly through flash cards.  <p>
<p>
o	There is no coordination in terms of certification of training programmes
among government and NGOs.<p>
<p>
o	Training in the NGO and private sectors has not been monitored and certified
by any government agency. Misconceptions prevail among trained teachers/
caregivers in as far as certification and recognition of the training is
concerned. Most teachers and caregivers tended and wanted to believe that their
training was being recognised by the government.   <p>
<p>
o	There is no systematic way to train and certify trainers. Thus there is a
need to develop and provide a certified training of trainers system.<p>
<p>
o	There is no long-term and comprehensive ECD training system that can be
applied nation-wide.</ul><p>
<p>
<b>2.	Training content</b><p>
<p>
<ul>o	The training content and process are not based on an assessment of what
trainees already know and the knowledge, skills and abilities they need to
develop. An assumption is made that they know very little.<p>
<p>
o	Most of the training courses were found to be theoretical in approach. The
training lacks balance as well as linkage between theory and practice. The
emphasis tends to be more on content rather than the process of learning/
training.<p>
<p>
o	Teachers/caregivers self-motivation and attitudes, and parent/community
empowerment are not included in all the training courses.</ul> <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>3.	Training strategy</b><p>
<p>
<ul>o	One strategy for integrating theory and practice/experiences (i.e. by
involving trained caregivers and teachers), was used by the child care training
programmes and a few preschool training programmes. However, the
teacher/caregiver-cum-trainers need training in facilitative skills. <p>
<p>
o	The accreditation of decentralised training centres could be used as a
strategy by many agencies to implement massive and rapid training for large
numbers of teachers/caregivers.</ul><p>
 <p>
<p>
<b>4.	The Training methodology</b><p>
<p>
<ul>o	Locally relevant and culture-based learning/training methodologies both for
children and teachers/caregivers were not drawn into the training programmes.
FELCRA had tried to identify and use some of these. This was found to be well
received by the communities and an effective training technique.<p>
<p>
o	Most of the practicum components emphasise teacher-initiated activities
rather than child-initiated activities.      <p>
<p>
o	Almost none of the training programmes use highly interactive, learning by
doing, and experiential training/learning methodologies and processes.</ul><p>
<p>

<b>5.	Training materials</b><p>
<p>
<ul>o	The Preschool Curriculum Guidelines tend to be taught as a subject rather
than as a training/learning guide which should be used and referred to during
the training. The package is considered expensive (RM450). Most teachers and
trainers feel it is not presented in an interesting and facilitative way. In
fact it is seen as too structured. <p>
<p>
o	There are no curriculum guidelines for children under four years of age. <p>
<p>
o	Most training programmes lack audio-visuals, such as videos, taped songs and
stories, and materials such as posters and case-studies.<p>
<p>
o	Most materials made and demonstrated during the training were teacher
initiated. Practice in using these materials was too short and did not lead to
much process learning. It was also common to see sessions on material
production which focused more on the making of handicrafts than play materials.
<p>
 <p>
o	Almost all teachers felt there were not enough materials and examples drawn
from the local culture and home environments of the child.</ul> <p>
<p>

<b>6.	Evaluation of Training</b><p>
<p>
<ul>o	Process evaluation was not emphasized in most training, and many teachers and
caregivers thought that it would be equally if not more useful for them to be
able to examine the process aspects of the training, if they were to acquire
skills and attitudes that were positive in relation to child development and
parenting practices.<p>
<p>
o	While trainers had trainees evaluate the training at the end of the session
or course, no evaluations have been conducted on the impact of training on
teacher/caregiver knowledge, skills and practice.</ul><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations</b><p>
<p>
In view of the above, the recommendations of this study in relation to training
are as follows:<p>
<p>
<ul>o	Training strategies which incorporate and integrate ECD content and practice,
relevant to various socio-economic contexts, encompass both institutional and
home-based models, and which are cost-effective, should be adopted.          <p>
<p>
o	Resource networking among all agencies in the government and NGOs should be
fostered.  The network should include both institutional and home-based
programmes in all sectors.<p>
<p>
o	In the NGO sector, there should be an umbrella body to coordinate NGO ECD
training and resource networking, empirical and applied research and evaluation
of ECD programmes in all sectors.         <p>
<p>
o	Existing ECD training programmes by local universities, such as Universiti
Pertanian's Diploma training course, should be reinforced and become part of
the ECD comprehensive training system.<p>
<p>
o	The need for capacity-building for programming personnel in the respective
government agencies dealing with ECD should be reviewed. <p>
<p>
o 	Local universities should undertake longitudinal studies of ECD programme
models, and disseminate the data to all agencies dealing with ECD programmes.<p>
<p>
o	Innovative ECD projects relating to curriculum for children below four years
of age, participatory training packages and methodologies, and strategies for
parent empowerment should be identified and developed.<p>
<p>
o	Monitoring and evaluation of ECD programmes should be integrated into all
aspects of the programme.</ul> <p>
<p>

<center><b>PART IV: COSTS AND FINANCING</center></b><p>
<p>

In order to make recommendations in terms of the Government's future
involvement in ECD, it is necessary to have some understanding of the costs of
such programmes, and the Government's current level of investment in ECD.
Data on costs were collected in relation to programme implementation and in
terms of training costs. It was not possible to obtain information on the
infrastructure and administrative costs of the various Ministries that have
resources devoted to ECD activities.  To some extent this is due to the fact
that each of the Ministries concerned is involved in a range of activities and
thus it is difficult to determine precisely what resources are allocated to
ECD.  However, it is important to note that because there are six Government
bodies involved in one way or another with ECD provision, the administrative
and supervisory costs, as compared to the costs of on-the-ground programmes, is
disproportionately high.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PROGRAMME IMPLEMENTATION COSTS</b><p>
<p>
In collecting data on programme costs we were able to obtain information from
the three main Government providers of preschool programmes.  Specifically data
were provided on the costs of <p>
<p>
<ul><ul>	- facilities<br>
	- materials<br>
	- teacher salaries/benefits<br>
	- support staff (cooks,cleaners)	<br>
	- food<br>
	- maintenance</ul></ul><p>
	<p>
These data are presented in Table 12.<p>
<p>
In essence the three agencies estimate the costs of a preschool centre somewhat
differently, ranging from $16,000 to $40,000.  While the Ministry of Education
uses existing classrooms for the Preschool Annex classrooms, neither KEMAS nor
National Unity do so.  The community is to identify a building that is
suitable.  All three agencies provide a grant to cover the initial costs of
equipping the preschool.<p>
<p>
All three programmes also provide food for the children at the rate of .50
cents/child/day.  Kemas and National Unity provide $10/month for materials
and/or training expenses for the teacher. (1 Semester is equivalent to 5
months.) All agencies provide per capita grants of $50/child/year.<p>
<p>
TABLE 12 is unavailable.
  <p>

<b>TRAINING COSTS</b><p>
<p>
One of the costs not included in the set-up costs presented, is the cost of
teacher training.  However, this is a very real cost and needs to be taken into
consideration in a discussion of expansion of ECD provision.  <p>
<p>
As a part of the Training sub-study, one of the questions asked was in relation
to the costs of training.  It was difficult to sort out equivalencies since
each of the agencies offers its own training, and each agency has its own way
of calculating costs.  Nonetheless what we attempted was to estimate the number
of days for the various training courses and divide that into the costs of the
course to get a per/day cost for training.  These data are presented in Table
13.<p>
<p>
As can be seen, training costs are varied, and ranged from low to high cost
programmes. The private sector training was the most expensive, due to costs of
its own prescribed books, play materials and equipment.   Nonetheless, there
are some trends.  First, decentralised training appears to be lower in cost
mainly because of its non-residential nature. While not a part of the figures
presented, decentralised training is also cheaper for the trainees since they
have lower transportation costs. <p>
<p>
Second, there are some economies of scale: the longer the programme, the
cheaper the per day costs.  Thus, the most expensive kind of training are the
2-3 day workshops offered in a centralized setting. <p>
<p>
A significant problem in trying to estimate a per day cost for training is that
the amount spent does not necessarily correlate with the quality of the
training.  Nor is there an ideal training package among the current training
efforts.  Thus we cannot estimate the total costs of adequately training an
individual. <p>

FINANCING<p>
<p>
After determining the costs associated with establishing and operating a
preschool programme, the next question is, who pays for what?  <p>
<p>
One source of funds is parent fees/contributions to the programme.  As a part
of the sub-study on parent involvement, parents were asked what they paid
currently in terms of fees.  They were also asked if they were willing to pay
more, and if so, how much more.  Table 14 presents a summary of the
responses.<p>

<p>
It is interesting to note that, for the most part, parents are willing to pay
double what they are currently paying.  Currently they are paying approximately
20% of the running costs of the preschool  (see Table 15).  If they were to
double their payment, it would increase their contribution to nearly 40% of the
on-going costs.<p>
<p>
Who pays the other costs?  The answer is, the Government.  Table 15 summarizes
the way in which the various components of the programme are financed.  <p>
<p>
While the table would suggest that the parents and community pay a substantial
amount of the set-up costs, this figure is misleading.  While the initial
building costs are not paid by KEMAS and National Unity, for the most part the
building used to house the preschool is a Government building, in that it is
frequently part of a community centre which the Government has built.  Thus the
community has not had to put its own money into building a preschool. However,
the community is responsible for maintaining the building.<p>

The last column in Table 15 is important.  It presents the cost/child/year in a
Government supported preschool.  In order to evaluate these costs, it is
important to know how they compare with costs in other parts of the system.  In
Table 15 are the costs of children in the primary and secondary schools.  As
can be noted, the costs of a half-day preschool are not significantly less.
They are 62%-68% of the costs of primary school.<p>

As was noted earlier in the report, currently about 41% of the children 4-6
years of age are enroled in a preschool programme.  If 100% coverage is to be
achieved, it would be very costly for the Government.  There are several ways
that Government expenditure could be decreased.  One would be for the preschool
programme to be consolidated within only one Ministry so that rather than
duplicating administrative and bureaucratic staff, there would be one set of
infrastructure costs.  This would allow current resources allocated to
preschool programmes to be extended to more children.<p>
<p>
Another option is for lower-costs models of ECD provision to be explored.  One
such option is home-based programmes.  These could be established as satellites
of current preschool centres.  While the Government would be responsible for
providing training and supervision to the home-based programmes, the government
would not pay teacher salaries.  They would be paid by parent fees.  In
instances where parents are not able to pay the fees, the Government could pay
a per child subsidy to the teacher/caregiver.  This way teachers do not become
a part of the Government payroll. This model has been quite successful in Latin
America, in particular in Colombia and Venezuela.<p>
<p>
In terms of Government funding for ECD programmes, it is only from the Ministry
of Education that we have any data on what has been allocated to preschool.
Table 17 presents a summary of the allocation for preschool education within
the original Sixth Malaysian Plan and the Mid-Term Review.  While 140 million
was allocated as the Plan was formulated, this was revised downward, as noted
in the Mid-Term Review.  It is important to note that even in the original
allocation, the monies for preschool education amounted to only 1.8% of the
total Education Budget.  It is now less than 1% of the Education Budget.<p>

<p>
It is interesting to compare the Ministry of Education expenditure figure with
what the Ministry of Education in Kenya allocates to preschool education.  In
their budget only .13% (one-tenth of one percent) is for preschool education.
(Myers, 1992, pg. 25)  Yet with this amount they are able to serve
approximately 800,000 children, (i.e. almost 30% of the estimated 2.8 million
children ages 3-5 in the country).  That is because of the high level of parent
and community participation. The community is responsible for constructing the
preschool and, in many communities, they are responsible for paying the
teacher's salary.  Government funds pay for teacher training and on-going
Supervision.<p>
<p>
We are not arguing that the Ministry of Education's budget for preschool remain
at less than 1% of the Education budget, particularly since the Ministry of
Education is not currently a major provider of ECD services.  We are suggesting
that there are more cost-effective ways of investing in preschool education
than is currently being done.<p>
<p>
An important variable in a discussion of financing of ECD in Malaysia is
current Government policy which promotes privatization.  In all sectors the
Government is seeking to reduce its subsidisation of services.  Services are
being taken over by the private sector.  While it can well be imagined that the
private sector can provide ECD services, particularly in the form of preschools
and child care centres, for those who are able to pay, there is a strata within
society that will be unable to pay the full costs of the services.  Thus
alternative funding will have to be sought for these programmes.<p>
<p>
There are a variety of alternatives.  In Colombia, for example, a payroll tax
levied on all Colombian businesses provides the funding for the Colombian
Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF), a quasi-governmental body responsible for
ECD provision.  This helps subsidise ECD programmes in areas where families are
unable to pay.  In Mauritius, a Trust has been established, the income from
which is used to fund ECD programmes.<p>
<p>
Another partner in the effort is business.  At the present time there is a
policy in effect in Malaysia which provides businesses with a tax break if they
provide child care for the children of their workers.  At this point the policy
has not been in effect long enough to know if it is effective.  Clearly the
impact of this policy should be monitored in terms of its cost-effectiveness as
a strategy for financing ECD.<p>
<p>
<center><b>PART V:  CONCLUSIONS</b></center><p>
  <p>
<p>
<b>Defining Roles and relationships</b><p>
<p>
A key question is, what is the role of government in early childhood
development, particularly in relation to preschool education and child care,
the areas that require significant capital investment and recurrent
expenditure. In principle, government investment in preschool and child care
centres which require dedicated buildings and staff, is justified if it meets
four tests:<p>
<p>
<ol>1.	The private market is failing to provide services in adequate quantity or
quality.<p>
<p>
2.	The private market does not operate in locations where children are in
greatest needs of services.<p>
<p>
3.	The intervention is cost-effective. <p>
<p>
4.	The intervention is more cost-effective than other interventions that
government might make to achieve similar goals.</ol> <p>
<p>
With regard to the second test, the Dropout Study (1973) demonstrated that
preschooling has a more significant impact on reducing the dropouts among
children of poor families than among rich families.  Thus a theoretical case
can be made for government financing of ECD programmes for the poor, provided
that ECD approaches are appropriately designed and that they are used as
convergence points for an integrated set of ECD services, so as to maximise
their benefits.<p>
<p>
With regard to the third and fourth tests, the research available in  Malaysia
on the impact of preschool of primary performance did not: 1) calculate the
cost of the approach; 2) look at the cost-effectiveness of alternative
approaches; or 3) look at the cost of preschool compared to other investments
that might be made to improve educational outcomes.  A longitudinal
cost-effectiveness study of different approaches to ECD (i.e. centre-based and
home-based, full-day and a half-day, parent education) should be undertaken to
determine whether there is a case for universal provision and the extent to
which government should be involved. <p>
<p>
Internationally, the biggest drain on Government financed ECD programmes is the
recurrent costs of staff.  Over time these costs absorb an increasing
percentage of the budget, giving government less flexibility to develop
innovative projects and to increase coverage. Thus, as the Government of
Malaysia is developing its own ECD policy, it is wise to define its role in
terms of policy and the development of curriculum and training systems,
coordination and monitoring -- setting the standard for what should be provided
-- rather than being engaged in large-scale provision.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Coverage, access and equity.  </b><p>
<p>
Coverage and equity concerns can be raised at two levels -- within a given
village/community and nationally.  The UNICEF study (circa 1984) looked at the
relationship between family variables and attendance in preschool centres. The
study indicated that parent income influences the type of preschool the
children attend.  Parents who can afford to do so, send their children to
private preschools.  <p>
<p>
If the public sector is going to provide ECD services, these must reach the
poor and the hard core poverty groups.  While it is recommended that additional
effort be put into reaching the poorest, it is not being recommended that
preschool centres be established in hard core poverty areas.  Rather,
appropriate cost-effective approaches should be developed to reach this
population. For example, satellite home-based centres linked to current
preschool programmes, community-based child care, parent education, and/or home
visiting programmes.<p>
<p>
Further, there should be exploration of the ways in which current Government
programmes can be enhanced to meet the broader ECD objectives.  For example,
parent education can readily be combined, at minimal additional costs, with the
health and nutrition outreach services, such as the Home-Based Child Health
Card.   <p>
<p>
<b>Impact and Quality Issues</b><p>
<p>
In the absence of a thorough evaluation of ECD programmes in Malaysia, it is
impossible to assess the impact of the various programmes. However, there is
general agreement, which was supported by this study, that quality is low.  <p>
<p>
Several factors contribute to low quality.  First, the length and focus of
training does not prepare teachers to appropriately support children's
development. Teachers and caregivers lack appropriate child stimulation and
teaching skills. There is a tendency to over-emphasise the teaching of the 3Rs,
rather than organising the child's environment in a way that would support
exploration, problem-solving, curiosity and the foundations for the 3Rs -- all
features of appropriate child development programmes. <p>
<p>
Second, the current supervision system does not provide substantive and regular
support to teacher/caregivers in the field.<p>
<p>
Bringing the preschool programme to an acceptable quality would require:<p>
<p>
<ol>1.  An expansion of the concept of quality to include the dimensions of
teacher/child, child/child, and teacher/parent interactions, rather than
focusing only on quantifiable dimensions that may or may not be related to the
quality of the experience for children in the ECD programme.<p>
<p>
2.  The creation of a training package that provides trainees
(teachers/caregivers and supervisors) with a curriculum framework that allows
them to make appropriate curricular decision, an adequate balance between
theory and practical experience to understand how theoretical principles can be
applied, and incorporating culturally-relevant teaching and learning
strategies.</ol><p>
<p>
<b>The Intersecting Needs of Women and Children.</b><p>
<p>
It is hypothesized that the current child care and preschool programmes do not
actually address the child care needs of working women, primarily because of
the limited hours of operations. (The exception to this is the plantation child
care centres.)  However, there are increasing numbers of women in the work
force, most of whom are in occupations where it would be inappropriate to bring
the child to the workplace.  In addition, many of these women now live in
nuclear families and lack the full-time support provided by extended family
members.  The demand for care, which combines attending to children's health
and safety with appropriate education and stimulation, is rising.<p>
<p>
The Department of Labour has been mandated to respond to this issue.  In
addition to the child care centres which are established on plantations, the
Ministry most recently has been working to establish industry-based childcare
in urban areas. <p>
<p>
However, most poor women do not work in factories and cannot afford the costs
of institutionalised child care.  At the present time there are no commercially
based systems of child care that are affordable to poor women.  There seems to
be a case on equity grounds for government to take a lead role in creating
alternative systems of child care supported by government, the community and
parents. <p>
<p>
Internationally there is considerable experience in the development and
implementation of home-based child care, particularly in Latin America.  This
experience might well be brought to Malaysia.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Programmatically</b><p>
<p>
ECD programmes should not focus only on children.  There is a need to focus on
the family in order to increase the family's capacity to provide for the
development of their own children. While it is important to focus primarily on
mothers, both because the mother's health and nutrition during pregnancy
determine the child's health and nutrition at birth, and because mothers are
the primary providers of care to young children, it is also important to look
at the family as a unit.  A  child's advantages or disadvantages stem from the
situation of the family as a whole.  Further, not just mothers but fathers, and
members of the extended family are important caregivers.<p>
<p>
Just as it is important to empower the family to provide for the child's full
developmental needs, it is also important to empower the community, as far as
possible, to provide for the welfare of all its children.  Well designed ECD
programmes, like well designed development programmes in general, foster
community participation in the assessment of needs, and the monitoring,
planning or implementation of interventions.  As with other development
programmes, participation is often best fostered through strengthening and
drawing on the resources of community organisations and NGOs.<p>

The KEMAS mandate and structure<i> allow for </i>greater parent involvement and
greater community participation at various levels than the other
pre-school/kindergarten programmes.  However, this has not been maximized.  <p>
<p>
<b>Organizationally:</b><p>
<p>
Currently there is a lack of coordination across and between the various ECD
programmes.  There is clearly a need for a mechanism to bring together those
serving children under 4, those serving children over 4, and those serving
children over 6 years of age.  The break and shift in programming that happens
at age 4 and at age 6 causes problems of continuity for the child and family.
Further, in some places this has led to the building of separate facilities in
areas which can barely afford one facility. <p>
<p>
In sum, continued government investment in preschool appears to be justified,
provided that its beneficiaries include the children of the poorest families
who do not have the resources to pay for private sector preschools even when
they are available.  Within Malaysia there is not sufficient research evidence
to suggest that current ECD programmes offer the most cost-effective approach
to early childhood provision.  However, the data do suggest that, from an
equity perspective, the already established programme narrows the differential
between rich and poor.  Thus these programmes should not be discontinued until
there is hard evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of alternatives.  Given
the resources already allocated by government in various programmes mandated by
law, there will be high returns to investment at the margin to improve the
quality of current programmes.  A key in increasing effectiveness will be the
coordination of activities, both within the government and in establishing
appropriate linkages between government, non-governmental agencies and the
private sector.<p>

<b></b><p>
<b>SURVEY OF ECD PROVISION IN MALAYSIA</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
Aims and Objectives:<p>
<p>
The review aims to assist the Government of Malaysia in formulating a
comprehensive and cost-effective ECD policy and strategy linked to overall
national development priorities.  Thus the review will lead to proposals
regarding arrangements for effective implementation, monitoring, management and
coordination of the programme, and subsequent identification of broad policy
and strategy options for strengthening ECD's contribution to national
development.<p>
<p>
More specifically, the objectives of the review are:<p>
<p>
	(1)	to prepare a profile of existing ECD programmes in relation to needs;<p>
<p>
	(2)	to undertake selected case-studies of the non-institutional
home/family-based and after school care services;<p>
<p>
	(3)	to establish a comprehensive ECD data base;<p>
<p>
	(4)	to analyze overall ECD programme costs;<p>
<p>
	(5)	to examine current ECD programme coordination mechanisms, including
existing legal provisions;<p>
<p>
	(6)	to review existing research findings;<p>
<p>
	(7)	to review the status of ECD curriculum, teaching and learning methods,
materials production and training as related to the delivery of programmes of
satisfactory quality;<p>
<p>
	(8)	to inform key ECD managers of relevant experiences from other countries in
the formulation and implementation of ECD policy;<p>
<p>
	(9)	to propose arrangements for the effective implementation, monitoring,
management and coordination of ECD programmes;<p>
<p>
	(10)	to identify broad policy and strategy options for strengthening ECD's
contribution to national development; and<p>
<p>
	(11)	to review the nature and extent of current linkages between ECD
programmes, parents and the community and suggest ways in which such linkages
might be extended. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>DEFINITION OF TERMS:</b><p>
<p>
Early Childhood Development (ECD)<p>
<p>
There are two parts to the phrase, 'early childhood' and 'development'.  Early
childhood is the period of a child's life from conception through the age 8.
'<b>Development'</b> is a process of change in which the child comes to master
more and more complex levels of moving, thinking, feeling and interacting with
people and objects in the environment.  Development, which involves changes in
complexity and function, is different from growth, which refers to changes in
size. (Myers, 1992)<p>
<p>
<b>Learning</b>, on the other hand, is a process of acquiring knowledge,
skills, habits and values through experience and experimentation, observation,
reflection, and/or study and instruction. Learning is a crucial part of
development.  General development involves both a gradual unfolding of
biologically determined characteristics and the learning process.
Developmental progress facilitates or inhibits learning which, in turn, helps
to define the progress of future development. Thus learning is part of the
development process. <p>
<p>
Beyond simply defining development and learning, it is important to define the
basic principles of child development and learning that underlay the review and
the operational principles that should be respected when establishing early
childhood programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>CHILD DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES</b><p>
<p>
   	<b>Development begins pre-natally and learning is occurring at birth.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Attention to the developmental and learning needs of children
should begin with pre- and post-natal interventions and be continued
thereafter.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Development and learning occur continuously as a result of the child
interacting with the environment.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions can focus on changing the child and/or on changing
the environment (which includes the immediate family, the community, social and
political institutions).  <p>
<p>
   	<b>Development has several inter-related dimensions within which learning
occurs. </b> These include physical, cognitive, social, spiritual and emotional
dimensions (each of which affects the other and all of which are developing
simultaneously).<p>
	Therefore:  Development and learning must be seen holistically and
interventions should provide integrated attention to the child, including
attention to needs for protection, food, health care, affection, interaction
and stimulation, security provided through consistency and predictability, and
play allowing exploration. All of these elements should be present to support
the child' development.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Development proceeds in predictable steps and learning occurs in
recognized sequences.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions should follow an appropriate sequence. Activities
should provide the child with a developmentally appropriate challenge.  There
is no value in presenting them before a child is developmentally ready for
them.<p>
<p>
   	<b>There is a great deal of individual and social variability in children's
rates and styles of development and of learning.</b><p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions should be able to identify and adjust to varying
individual and social needs of children.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Children are active participants in their own development and
learning.</b> Learning and related development involves the child's
construction of knowledge, not an adult's imposition of information.  The
skills which are the basis for constructing knowledge improve with practice.<p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Interventions should include opportunities for children to learn
by doing, to be engaged in problem-solving, and the develop language and
communication skills. They should not put undue emphasis on cognitive/mental
development.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Children learn in many ways:</b> by playing and exploring, by using all
their senses, by imagining, by imitating, by interacting socially with
others.<p>
<p>
	Therefore:  Integrated interventions promoting social, emotional and spiritual
development as well as cognitive learning can take advantage of varied forms of
learning, consistent with cultural ways even while taking into account that
there are recognized sequences and activities that facilitate learning. <p>
<p>
   	<b>It helps a child to develop and learn when adults (parents, teachers and
community members</b>:<p>
<p>
	  -	are emotionally responsive and involved<p>
	  -	talk to children<p>
	  -	provide appropriate and varied play materials<p>
	  -	are supportive of the child's learning<p>
<p>
	Therefore: Interventions should include ways to address the needs of children
within the context of the family and community.  Attention should be given to
adults as well as to children in programme planning and implementation.<p>
<p>
<b>PROGRAMMING PRINCIPLES</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Some of the following operational principles are directly related to
the principles of development and learning set out previously.  Others are
general principles of programming that apply to programmes of early childhood
development as well as to other kinds of programmes. Behind all of the
principles is the desire to mount effective and sustainable programmes.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Seek programme integration in conceptualizing, planning, delivering
services, establishing content and promoting use.</b><p>
<p>
	This principle derives in part from the holistic nature of child development
in which physical, mental, social and emotional and spiritual dimensions of
development interact with and affect each other.  Hence, effectiveness requires
integrated attention to children.  In addition, there is a maximization of
resources when programmes are multi-dimensional, combining health, nutrition,
educational and social actions.   <p>
  <p>
   	<b>Foster participation by individuals, families and communities who are to
be the primary beneficiaries.</b><p>
<p>
	A principle of active participation is consistent with the basic principles of
learning and development described above.  Sustained human and social
development and the sustainability of programmes all depend on enhancing
people's capacities to improve their own lives and to take greater control over
their own destinies.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Build child-focused partnerships by expanding existing collaboration and
bringing together new partners supportive of development.</b><p>
<p>
	Neither governments nor communities nor a wide range of non-governmental
organizations can easily maintain an effective programme without help.  The
principle of developing partnerships between government, non-governmental
agencies, the private sector and the community arises from social as well as
financial needs.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Build on inherent strengths and local childrearing practices that are
beneficial to child and social development.</b><p>
<p>
	Knowledge about solutions to child development problems can be found in
experience and traditional wisdom as well as in academic wisdom or new
technologies. Childrearing practices that are supportive of children's growth
and development should be encouraged and built upon in programming.<p>
   	<b>Take an inter-generational view; seek ways of involving children, youth
and adults.</b><p>
<p>
	Programmes of early childhood development can and should benefit parents,
other caregivers and community members as well as children.  Child care, for
instance, is generally the responsibility of various family members (older
siblings and extended family members in addition to fathers and mother).
Programmes should take into account the needs of families as well as the needs
of children. <p>
<p>
     <b>Be open to diversity and to complementary approaches.</b><p>
<p>
	This principle derives in part from the social and individual variation in
children' needs.  It is also derived from a recognition of the cultural
diversity which exists within and across nations. Programmes which respect this
diversity will necessarily differ. <p>
<p>
   	<b>Be aware of the total environment and its impact on the child's
life.</b><p>
<p>
	A child does not exist on his/her own.  The child's development in affected by
the environment with which the child interacts.  This includes the home, the
community, social institutions and legal frameworks, and a cultural ethos.  A
comprehensive programme to improve child development should function
simultaneously at these different levels, focusing respectively on the child,
caregivers, national institutions and policies, and the knowledge base of the
society. <p>
<p>
   	<b>Seek quality.</b><p>
<p>
	Low quality programmes are ineffective, depriving children of benefits, and
represent a waste of resources.  In seeking quality, recognize that it is
affected by the motivation and training of programme personnel, the physical
environment, the materials used, and the form of the curriculum.  A quality
programme is appropriate to the stage of development and addresses the needs of
the child involved while respecting individual differences in development.
Quality cannot be legislated.  Setting norms and standards does not guarantee
quality.  Neither is quality defined by expenditure level.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Aim at universal attention to children, but with special recognition of
children living in conditions that put them at increased risk of delayed or
debilitated development.</b><p>
	<p>
	This principle recognizes the need for all children to be supported as they
grow and develop, while stressing the urgency of attending to children living
in poverty or those who are discriminated against as a result of ethnic
diversity.  <p>
 <p>
   	Coverage is best achieved by combining a variety of approaches rather than
developing a single national model meant to apply to all.<p>
<p>
	Attention to all the children can be sought through a series of different
programmes responding to distinct needs.  There need not be one national
programme that is extended to all children, parents or communities.<p>
   	<b>Seek cost-effectiveness.</b><p>
<p>
	This principle recognizes the importance of using scarce resources efficiently
and effectively.  This does not mean that "low-cost" programmes are necessarily
the best. If they are not effective they represent a waste of resources. In
general, strategies that stress prevention are more cost-effective than
compensatory strategies.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Incorporate monitoring and evaluation into programmes from the
outset.</b><p>
<p>
	This principle recognizes that many programmes are not effective or are not
sustained because they do not include the capacity to analyze strengths and
weaknesses and to adjust accordingly.<p>
<p>
It is with these principles and guidelines in mind that the review of early
childhood development programmes in Malaysia was undertaken. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ECD IN MALAYSIA - A REVIEW</b><p>
<p>
In Malaysia a number of terms have been used to refer to the care of children
of different age groups in various settings.  For example, the term
'kindergarten' has been used to refer to a half-day programme for children 5
&amp; 6 years of age. (There has been a recent shift in terminology.  These are
now called 'pre-schools'.) Children below the age of 4 are provided for in
'nurseries' or 'child care' centres.  Children are also taken care of in homes
by childminders.  This is known as 'home-based child care'.  For the purposes
of this review, Early Childhood Development programmes includes all these
programmes and more.  It includes the full range of programmes, services and
experiences that have been developed to support young children and their
families. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SCOPE OF THE REVIEW</b><p>
<p>
1.   The review will begin with a mapping of what exists in terms of current
service provision and the supports for such provision (e.g. curriculum,
materials, and training); the legislation/ policies in place related to ECD
programmes; and coordination of services. While the focus of the review is
primarily on what is being offered by various government departments, where
they is a significant contribution to ECD by non-governmental agencies (NGOs),
the private sector and those involved in ECD provision for commercial reasons,
these are also described.<p>
<p>
The review will begin by looking specifically at the activities of the
following agencies and organizations:<p>
<p>
	The Ministry of National Unity and Social development<p>
		The National Unity pre-schools <p>
		The Department of Social Welfare's nurseries and  child care programmes<p>
	The Ministry of Education's Annex Pre-school Programme<p>
	The Ministry of Land Development<p>
		Community Development Division - KEMAS <p>
	Ministry of Health <p>
 	Non-governmental agencies (NGOs) <p>
	Religious sponsors <p>
	Home-based programmes<p>
	Commercial ECD programmes<p>
<p>
<p>
For each agency/organization data will be gathered on:<p>
<p>
	Legislation/policies and objectives that guide the<p>
	   programme<p>
Location of the programme (distribution by state,  urban/rural)<p>
	Number of children attending, by age group (0-4,5-6)<p>
Profile of the children (age, ethnicity, family income level)<p>
Profile of teachers in programme (age, ethnicity, qualifications, number of
trained and untrained)<p>
	Programme costs - to the sponsoring agency, to the community  and to parents<p>
	Problems they face<p>
	Future plans<p>
<p>
<p>
From this mapping it will be possible to determine where there are gaps in
service - for age groups, for income groups, for ethnic groups, and by
geographic location. <p>
<p>
<p>
2.  Once the basic models have been defined in terms of their coverage, then it
will be possible to focus on CURRICULUM issues.  For the purposes of this
review, curriculum is defined as <i>the set of experiences planned for the
children, family and community.  </i><p>
<p>
<p>
SAMPLE:<p>
<p>
There will be 16 types of programmes surveyed. This includes:<p>
<p>
	The Ministry of National Unity and Social development<p>
		The National Unity pre-schools (urban)<p>
		The Department of Social Welfare's nurseries and<p>
		 child care programmes (urban, rural)<p>
	The Ministry of Education's Annex Pre-school Programme<p>
		(urban, rural)<p>
	The Ministry of Land Development<p>
		Community Development Division KEMAS (urban squatters and rural)<p>
	Ministry of Health (urban, rural)<p>
	Non-governmental agencies (NGOs) (PTM - urban:  ERWF - plantation)<p>
	Religious sponsors (ABIM)  (urban, rural)<p>
	Home-based programmes (urban, rural)<p>
	Commercial ECD programmes (urban)<p>
<p>
<p>
For each of the agencies/organizations included in the study, the curriculum
will be reviewed in terms of its quality (as evaluated against the principles
of child development listed above).  In addition the support materials
available to the teachers and children will be described and evaluated.<p>
<p>
Once again, the basic review should allow for the identification of both
strengths and gaps in the curriculum and materials available to teachers and
children.<p>
<p>

		curriculum? <p>
	5. 	Do you have any plans for the future in terms of curriculum development?<p>
<p>
3.  The next issue to be addressed is how well is the curriculum being
implemented?  In other words, what is happening on-the-ground?  What is the
experience like in the setting for both the child and the teacher?<p>
<p>

above will be asked of those training trainers. <p>
<p>
5.  An important principle of effective child development programmes is that
they include significant community and parent involvement.  Within each of the
16 centres to be visited in the review an assessment will be made of the
current level of parent and community involvement.  <p>
<p>
SAMPLE<p>
<p>

		(e.g.  financial, in-kind, maintenance of facilities)<p>
<p>
Get list of the things parents do within the programme from the teacher. <p>
	<p>
<p>
6. Costs/financing<p>
<p>
Before any government can invest in ECD programmes it has to have a clear
understanding of the costs involved.  Thus a cost analysis needs to be done in
relation to each of the models being reviewed.<p>
<p>
<p>
METHODOLOGY<p>
<p>
Collect information from government departments in terms of the costs of
operating their programme.  Costs include:<p>
<p>
	- facilities<p>
	- materials<p>
	- teacher salaries/benefits<p>
	- support staff (cooks,cleaners)	<p>
	- food<p>
	- maintenance<p>
	<p>
Infrastructure costs<p>
<p>
	- training<p>
	- supervision<p>
	- management<p>
<p>
	2.  How are the costs covered?  <p>
<p>
	- government expenditure<p>
	- parental fees<p>
	- community contribution (in-kind services)<p>

<b>I   INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
	The main purpose of this paper is to stimulate informed discussion and debate
about preschool policy and programming in Mexico with the intention of
improving the care and development and preparation for school of children
during their immediate pre-school years.<b>[1]</b>
The paper will take as its base for looking ahead Mexican program experience
since approximately 1970, with special attention to the most recent years and
to 1993/4.  It will take a broad view of "pre-schools" (institutionalized
settings that provide and facilitate learning in the years prior to entering
school) that goes beyond the formal pre-school system, incorporating
information about complementary initiatives lying outside public preschool
education.<p>
<p>
	Information for the paper was gathered in several ways:<p>
<p>
 Descriptive information was sought from official governmental sources<p>
<p>
 Within the restrictive time limits set for the review, relevant literature was
located and consulted.<p>
<p>
 Interviews were obtained with people involved directly in planning or
implementing preschool programs.<p>
<p>
 A reanalysis was carried out of preschool information obtained during an
evaluation of the Programa de Abatir el Rezago Educativo.<p>
<p>
 Two case studies of preschools were carried out in the Alta Mixteca of Oaxaca
and several other preschools were visited in order to get a qualitative flavor
of preschooling in operation.<p>
<p>
	After setting the stage with a brief description of the context within which
the analysis must proceed, the recent evolution, present status, and costs of
preschool programs will be presented, followed by a section identifying and
discussion key issues for policy and programming.  In a final section,
conclusions will be drawn and recommendations made.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Changing Context</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Demographic changes</b>.  Mexico was and is a predominantly young country
in spite of a  reduction in its fertility rate (from 3.2% in 1970 to 2.6% in
1990).  Approximately one-quarter of the more than 90 million inhabitants of
Mexico are under age 10, with about 13% under age 6, a percentage that is now
declining slightly.  The Mexican population is mobile as well as young.
Rural-urban migration has increased markedly during the last 15 years.  In
addition, there has been a relatively high level of temporary migration from
Mexico to the United States and to selected agricultural areas within Mexico in
search of employment.  Ironically, while urbanization has increased, the number
of small communities with less than 500 inhabitants has risen from 82,705
communities in 1970 to 140,551 in 1990.  These simple demographics affect
pre-school policy and programming in several ways:  1) although falling
fertility rates mean that less energy must be put into expansion in order to
simply keep pace with population growth, the sheer size still places
considerable pressure on social services;  2) rural-urban migration has created
new needs in urban areas even while major gaps in coverage of programs continue
to appear in rural areas, including in small communities; 3)  temporary
migration for work has often disrupted or split families and has prejudiced
many children left behind while creating a challenge with respect to care and
development of those young children who accompany their migrating parents.<p>
<p>
	<b>Economic changes.</b>  A combination of worldwide recession and of debts
accumulated by Mexico led to a major policy of economic adjustment during the
1980's.  Economic hardships, inflation and the adjustment policy reduced
purchasing power, increased unemployment and had particularly severe short term
economic effects, increasing the number of people living in poverty and in
extreme poverty.   The economic adjustment policy was accompanied by a drop in
social and educational investment, relative to Gross National Product.<b>[2]</b>  Following a renegotiation of the debt, a
major shift to privatization, the negotiation of an internal agreement among
government, labor and industry, and an opening to world markets, the economy of
Mexico began to recover during the 1990 to 1994 period.  Inflation was
controlled and the purchasing power of workers began to rise, falling well
short, however, of their 1980 levels.  Moreover, immense economic disparities
continued to characterize with an unacceptably high proportion of the
population living in conditions of extreme poverty.  Unfortunately, the
recovery proved short-lived as Mexico suffered a major economic setback at the
end of 1994.  A serious commercial deficit and capital flight forced
devaluation which, in turn, has again adversely affected employment and
purchasing power, particularly among the poor.  Whether or not the prodigious
efforts by the present government to bail out the economy with massive
international help will be successful, and at what level, remains to be seen.
An inflation rate of 42% and a negative growth rate of approximately 5% are
projected for 1995.  In the meantime, the recovery policy implies, again, a
worsening income distribution.<p>
<p>
	The present discussion of pre-school policy must take into account both
current pressures to decrease government expenditures and the continuing
pressures on the poor sectors of society that are a product of difficult
economic times.  Although an effort is being made to preserve the education
budget, it is not realistic to expect new or increased funding.  The high level
of poverty makes it difficult to expect poor families to increase their
contributions to support the education of their children.  The high poverty
level also magnifies the effects of out-of-school variables (malnutrition, the
need for young children to work, migration) on pre-school as well as on school
progress and performance.<p>
<p>
	<b>Social and political changes</b>.  After almost 7 decades of one-party
government, the political situation was modified at the end of the 1980 decade
as other political parties and the civil society have emerged as important
political forces.  Opposition included armed opposition in Chiapas,
representing at once an unsettling eruption of pent-up social and economic
frustrations and a challenge for a government anxious to both maintain
stability and build a new image.  The case of Chiapas, the poorest state in
Mexico on almost any indicator chosen, highlights the importance of taking into
account vast differences among (and within) states as well as the importance of
issues related to ethnic origin.  The recognition of and respect for cultural
differences continues to be a central issue within a social and political
policy agenda that seeks justice and democracy.  And, the political turmoil
that frames the current study seems to give a different tone to the phrase
"participation."  It accelerates the search for democratic structures and
solutions allowing civic organizations as well as the government to play
important roles in the political and social life of the country.<p>
<p>
	<b>Educational changes.</b>   A process of decentralization, begun in 1978,
was given new life in 1992 with the transfer to the states of administrative
responsibility for educational programs.  This complex and prolonged process
has had to contend with existing economic and educational inequalities among
states, educational zones, municipalities and localities.  For the time being
at least, financing of education and influence over the norms and content of
education have continued to function in a centralized way.  Several
"compensatory" programs, including those educational programs administered by
the National Council for Educational Promotion (CONAFE) and those that appear
under Solidaridad, continue to be controlled directly from the center.   A
discussion of pre-school education must take into account the tension between
the decentralized administration and centralized control over the collection of
finances as well as over norms.  The discussion must recognize at the same time
the growing pressure for popular participation in education and the barriers to
such participation that are a product of continuing economic and political
inequalities.  Accordingly, it will be important to try and look outside as
well as inside the present educational options and structures for new solutions
and forms of participation if, as proposed in the National Agreement for
Educational Modernization (1992) and in the National Plan for 1995-2000, there
is to be greater participation by parents and the community in general in
educational activities, including their participation in decision-making and
implementation.<p>
<p>
	<b>The National Plan of Development , 1995-2000.</b>  Against this background,
the present government has prepared a 5-year development plan organized around
five basic objectives.  These are: 1) strengthening national sovereignty; 2)
consolidating citizens rights and rule by law; 3) constructing a complete
democracy with social participation; 4) extending and sustaining social
development, and 5) fostering economic growth.<p>
<p>
	In the National Plan, a social strategy is proposed that is to be "national,
integral, federal and participatory, inclusive and effective" (National Plan,
p. xii).  Combatting inequality is central to the Plan and a mutual
relationship is recognized among social, political and economic inequality.
Accordingly, the social development program is focussed on "eradication of
poverty, giving privileged attention to groups, communities and geographic
zones that are at the greatest social and economic disadvantages" (ibid., p.
xiii) and on "...families in conditions of extreme poverty, on marginal
populations, on indigenous communities and on groups at a disadvantage in
integrating themselves into the process of development" (ibid., p. 74).
Moreover, the social policy proposed in the plan anticipates a new national
effort that would not only promote concurrent efforts by municipal, state and
federal entities, but would also seek the participation of non-governmental
organizations, public assistance institutions and organizations of
beneficiaries as "co-responsibles" in the developmental process.<p>
<p>
	The five general strategies that organize the social policy presented in the
Plan are: 1) increase coverage and improve the quality of basic services; 2) an
integrated approach to population growth and distribution; 3) promote equality
in development among regions; 4) give privileged attention to populations with
the greatest economic and social disadvantages; and 5) approach social
development in an integrated manner implying co-responsibility of the State and
the society.  As part of an effort to guarantee all children and youth a basic
education that is free, secular, democratic, nationalistic and based on
scientific knowledge, the Plan proposes "...to design and apply programs and
actions that guarantee access at the preschool, primary school and secondary
school levels, increasing substantially the "terminal efficiency" in all of
basic education, and reducing disparities in coverage and quality within public
education" (ibid., p. 85).  Increased attention is to be given to acquisition
of the basic capacities of reading, oral and written expression and
mathematics.  The Plan proposes improvements in the contents, methods and
materials of basic education, the development of initiatives and projects
originating in schools, the revaluating of supervision and school
administration, continued attention to improving the infrastructure, timely
evaluations of the educational system, integration of educational activities
with other social sector programs, the consolidation of federal and local
participation in education, and the establishment of a national system of
training and professional improvements for teachers.   <p>
<p>
	The social policy makes special mention of the need for programs that can
reach the poor in rural areas where the population is dispersed population (p.
114) and that are directed toward indigenous communities (pp. 117-18).  With
respect to indigenous communities, the Plan seeks:  "...to achieve full
integration of ethnic groups into the process of national development without
having to renounce their rich cultural history, their language or their
traditions (p. 117)." <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>	The Condition of Pre-School Children</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Any discussion of preschool education must take into account the
condition of the children to be served.  That condition is reported in Table 1,
based on the State of the World's Children published by UNICEF and on official
statistics taken from the October 1994 "Fourth Evaluation" of the National
Program of Action set out by Mexico in relation to its signing of the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and its participation in the Children's
Summit  (Secretar&iacute;a de Salud 1994).  The table does not try to describe
differences among the various federal entities which, in some cases are very
significant.  For example, in Chiapas, "terminal efficiency" for primary school
is estimated at 34% vs. a national figure of 61% and the failure rate in
primary school is reported at 13% in Chiapas vs. 8% nationally. <p>

<p>
<b>II -- PRESCHOOL EDUCATION IN MEXICO, 1995</b><p>
<p>
	<p>
<b>The Legal Basis for Pre-School Education in Mexico</b>  <p>
<p>
	Article 3 of the Mexican Constitution provides the right to an education and
indicates that the State has the responsibility for providing basic education.
Basic education includes pre-schooling as well as primary  and secondary
schooling.  The Constitution also mentions (Apartado "A", Fracci&oacute;n XXIX)
that child care centers are a benefit of great public utility and their
provision corresponds to the Social Security system.  <p>
<p>
	The most recent interpretation of the right to education is contained in the
General Law of Education promulgated in 1993  Although the General Law
recognizes the importance of preschooling for children by indicating that
parents have a right to enroll their children in preschool (Part I of Article
59),  Article 37 of the law states explicitly that "Preschool education is not
a pre-requisite for primary school."  (Programa para la Modernizaci&oacute;n
Educativa, 1989-1994).   Moreover, legislation pertaining explicitly to the
preschool level is almost absent from the General Law which, rather,
incorporates preschool into basic education.  It is assumed, therefore, that
legal provisions set for Basic Education will apply to preschooling.  For
instance, Articles 38 and 42 of the General Law state, respectively:<p>
<p>
Article 38. Basic Education, in its three levels, should include the
adaptations required in order to respond to the cultural and linguistic
characteristics of each of the diverse indigenous groups in the country as well
as to dispersed populations and migratory groups.<p>
<p>
Article 42.  In imparting education for minors, methods will be used to assure
that the protection and necessary care needed to preserve physical,
psychological and social integrity based on dignity and the application of
discipline will be compatible with a student's age.<p>
<p>
Article 59 is somewhat more specific, stating that those institutions that
impart preschool education should contract accredited personnel with an
adequate preparation.  Moreover, the article says the "...installations should
satisfy hygienic, pedagogic and security conditions that the educational
authorities determine..."  One assumes that these conditions are meant to apply
to public as well as private preschools.<p>
<p>
	Also relevant to preschooling in its broad sense is the legal base for the
support of Child Development Centers (CENDIs) that is found in Article 123 of
the Constitution.  This care, which includes care and education for children
ages 4 and 5, is mandated as a right for working mothers and is applied, in the
main, to workers in the governmental sector.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Preschool Programs :  Present Variations on the Theme</b><p>
<p>
	There are several ways in which preschools can be classified, including: by
the population served, by their organization and pedagogical methods, by their
administrative jurisdiction, or be combinations of these.  The discussion that
follows will be divided into two parts according to whether the preschool forms
are supported and administered through the public sector or whether the
preschools are private or social initiatives that do not depend financially or
administratively on the government..<p>
<p>
	<b>Preschools in the Public Sector</b><p>
<p>
	In its presentation of educational statistics, the SEP recognizes three main
forms of preschooling managed within the education sector: 1) General
preschools (previously referred to as Jardines de Ni&ntilde;os), 2) Bi-lingual,
or Indigenous preschools, and 3) Community preschools.  As shown in Table 2
(with further information provided in Appendix A), these preschool programs are
different in terms of the populations they serve, their coverage, their locus
of administrative control, the their hours of operation and norms governing
such matters as the number of students required to establish a preschool and
the qualifications required to be a teacher.   These three general categories
are commonly used for programming purposes within the education sector (see,
for instance, SEP, July 1994, "Strategies for generalizing basic education").<p>
<p>
	There are variations within the three general categories of public education.
For instance, General preschools are administered nationally in the case of the
Federal District but  in other cases are administered at the State level.  In
addition, two "alternative" programs are hidden within the general preschool
statistics, one of which is similar to the community preschools of CONAFE
programs (because it relies on secondary school graduates or community women
trained as "promotoras" and takes a non-formal approach).  The other
alternative program is an urban program called the "Mixed" preschool that
extends the operation of general preschools to a full day, involving community
mothers as well as regular preschool teachers.  <p>
<p>
	Community preschools run by CONAFE include four main variants.  In addition to
the most prominent program, which is labeled the Community Preschool, CONAFE
also runs a small program in which community mothers become the teachers
(Centros Infantiles Comunitarias) and with childcare linked to productive
projects for women, an experimental preschool program for migrant children, and
a program attending to indigenous children.<p>
 .<p>
<p>
	The educational statistics of the SEP also include information about Centers
for Integrated Development (CENDI), a preschool/child care option that is
intended to provide attention to children between the ages of 42 days and 5
years, 11 months, of working mothers.  This child care modality is subject to
educational norms set by the SEP.  CENDIs may be run at a national (now only
those in the D.F.) or state level.   In addition, some CENDIs are run on a
private basis.<p>
<p>
	Not falling into any of these categories, nor reported in the preschool
statistics is another small public childcare program called "Day Care Homes."
This program, which also includes attention to children ages 3 to 5, was run by
the a national system of volunteers, headed by the President's wife, but has
now being taken over by the Family Institute (DIF):<p>

	Although public preschool programs are administered by different entities
within the government and are run by people with different levels of training
and experience, the specific objectives of the different preschool modalities
are more or less similar.  In addition, the fact that programs are supposed to
follow norms set by the Ministry of Education, means that the curricula overlap
a great deal, and even the methods applied show similarities.  In 1992/3, a new
preschool program was put in place involving a major reorganization of content.
This program has been adapted by Indigenous preshool education for work in
indigenous communities.<p>
<p>
	In general, preschool education is described as child centered, active
(children are expected to take an active part in the process, constructing
their ow knowledge), integral (in the sense of including attention to
cognitive, social, emotional and physical development) and directed toward
building personal and social autonomy, a critical capacity, creativity,
language skills, identification with both nation and local cultures, and a
healthier relationship with the environment.  The methodology is built around
the experience of the child, usually organized around a "project" or "theme"
which children are expected to help choose and which is used to organize and
link activities.  Preschool teachers are expected to act as coordinators and
promotors of learning situations, assisting the child to construct his or her
own knowledge.  Explicitly teaching children to read and write and cipher in
preschool falls outside the norms, but children are expected to acquire basic
concepts and skills that will help them with these tasks when they enter
primary school.<p>
<p>
	In the case of indigenous preschools, the expectation is that children will be
taught in their mother tongue and that the activities will be closely related
to the particular indigenous culture (SEP, Programa de Educaci&oacute;n
Preescolar para zonas Ind&iacute;genas, 1994).  Experience and observation
suggests that these stipulations are frequently disregarded in practice so that
it may be difficult to distinguish a "general" from an "indigenous" classroom
(see case study 2 in Appendix E).  The PAEPI program, run by CONAFE, seeks to
develop bilingualism and recommends the use of Spanish and the indigenous
language according to the degree to which both languages are used in the
community.<p>
<p>
	The obvious differences among the different public sector programs tend to be
more organizational or structural than methodological or in content.  Norms
differ with respect to the minimum number of children required for a preschool
to be set up (a minimum of 5 in the case of CONAFE's community preschools  vs.
18 for indigenous preschools vs. 25 for general preschools).  Thus, community
preschools or the alternative preschool program must serve very small
communities and general preschool education is reserved for larger ones.  Hours
differ.  In <p>

the case of the CENDIs and the "mixed preschool service," children are present
during a full day rather than during a 3 or 4-hour period in the morning which
characterizes most programs.  Programs also differ in the extent to which
health and nutrition are directly incorporated in the programs.  Only the CENDI
programs provide health attention on the premises.  The full-day CENDIs and the
Mixta programs provide food whereas other programs depend on the children to
bring their own snacks.<p>
<p>
	The backgrounds and training of teachers also differ considerably among the
programs:  <p>
<p>
   -  General preschool teachers are supposed to be at least normal school
graduates with training in preschool education.  Presumably they arrive on the
job as trained teachers.<p>
<p>
   -  Indigenous preschool teachers are also supposed to enter service with a
minimum qualification of a secondary schooling certificate, but with the
understanding that they will upgrade themselves in the coming years by taking
courses provided by the National Pedagogical University or a normal school.
Bi-lingual teachers must also speak an indigenous language.  The initial
training for bi-lingual teachers has varied from 2 months to 6 months,
depending in part on the budget available for such training.  The official
supervision they receive during the year is minimal.<p>
<p>
   -  Community Instructors in the CONAFE program, on the other hand, are young
people between the ages of 15 and 21 who have completed secondary school (9
years of schooling).  These youth are provided with a 2-month initial training
program and are assisted during the year by a supervisor who also meets monthly
with the group to continue the training and to handle problems that may have
been encountered.<p>
<p>
   -  The Alternative Preschool Program for Rural Areas operates on principles
similar to that of CONAFE and has two variants.  In one variant, the education
agents are community members, usually with a secondary school degree, who have
successfully completed an initial training of two months.  The second variant
takes youth who have completed a bachillerato who must also pass through a
2-month training.  The initial training is backed by a relatively intensive
system of continued orientation in which trainer/supervisors are responsible
for preschools in a limited number of communities (in Oaxaca, for instance the
number was between 7 and 12 communities, depending on the time necessary to
reach the communities).<p>
 <p>
	It is not clear what the effect of these differences is on the development of
children because we do not have studies that make the comparison, for instance,
between normalistas with three years of preschool training and secondary school
graduates with a minimum of training.  Further, we do not know what differences
may be attributed to the fact that the CONAFE program, by recruiting young
people, incorporates more young men as teachers than do other programs.<p>
<p>
	The level of financial and other support for teachers in the different
programs also varies.<p>
   -  General preschool teachers enter the regular pay scale and receive social
security and retirement benefits.  Pay hovers around three or four minimum
salaries.<p>
<p>
   -  The bilingual teachers also enter the preschool pay scale and receive
benefits as well as a salary.  In general, the pay they receive is only
somewhat lower than general preschool teachers, reflecting the difference in
academic qualifications..<p>
<p>
   -  CONAFE Community Instructors  are provided with a very low maintenance
stipend (less than a minimum salary) during the year they teach and are paid
also to return for training one day of each month.  They are provided with
lodging and food by the community in which they work.  They are also assured
support to study for three years afterward to complete their preparatory school
studies. <p>
<p>
   -  The promoters or bachilleres in the Rural Alternative programs receive
stipends similar to those of the CONAFE Instructors and are provided with
access to study at the next level of education.  They are also provided with
food and lodging by the communities in which they work.<p>
<p>
From this brief description, it is clear that the per child costs to the State
of formal (general and indigenous) preschooling will be much higher than the
costs of non-formal (Cursos comunitarios and the alternative rural modalities)
preschooling.  Again, we do not know how these differences relate to effects on
the preschool child.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>Private and Social Sector Preschool Initiatives</b><p>
<p>
	To obtain a fuller picture of the preschool scene in Mexico, preschool
initiatives should be included which lie outside the Public Sector.  This
includes private sector initiatives in which preschools are run by industries
or are set up as "for profit" private preschools or as CENDIs.  They include
social sector initiatives in which preschools are set up and run by NGOs, by
church groups or by community organizations.  And finally, they include
experiments associated with universities or other research settings.  Examples
of programs within each of these categories are described in Appendix A.<p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, very little information is available about preschool programs
that are operated outside the public sector.  The official statistics tell us
that in 1993/4  some 251,958 children were enrolled in private preschools,
accounting for 8.4% of the total preschool enrollment.  Of these, 10,441
children were in privately run CENDIs and the rest were in general preschools.
This number for the private sector is probably an underestimate; an unknown
number of unregistered private preschools exist.<b>[3]</b>  Because pre-school is not a requirement for
entrance into primary school at this point in time, there has not been much
attention paid to assuring that private preschools are registered, provide
statistics to the SEP or operate in an adequate manner.  Should preschooling
for 5-year olds become mandatory, this situation will have to change.  The lack
of information about these programs extends to the training of the educational
agents and the quality of their offerings.<p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, some general comments about preschooling outside the public
sector can be made, based on general conversations.  For instance:<p>
<p>
   -   It seems that only rarely are preschools set up in relation to a
business enterprise; rather, preschool needs of  workers children are seen as
being satisfied through the CENDIs.<p>
<p>
   -   Rarely are private preschools found in a rural setting.<p>
<p>
   -   Usually preschools are set up to respond to one of two demands that it
is felt are not being met by public programs: quality or the need for
flexibility associated with alternative child care.   Private preschools often
advertise themselves as providing quality attention to children based on the
academic qualifications of their teachers, the available of an excellent
facility and materials, and/ or their link to a particular curriculum that is
not the same as that of the SEP, such as, for instance, the Montessori method
or the High/Scope Cognitive curriculum.  In most cases, these private schools
charge substantial fees that restrict attention to children of the middle and
upper classes.  There are, however, many examples of popular and
community-based preschools that are of good quality  but cater to families with
few resources and do not (cannot) charge large sums (see examples of Cerro de
Judio and Nezahuapilli in Appendix A).  In these cases it is not unusual for
the popular preschool program to count, at least initially, on the outside help
of a non-governmental organization providing training, technical advice and
even some financial support.  As a result, a cadre of trained (but uncertified)
preschool teachers has grown up outside the official system.  These teachers
usually receive less than a minimum wage and do not receive benefits.
Sometimes they are forced to leave their positions in order to earn a living
wage elsewhere.  As the government looks ahead, it might ask how, at relatively
little cost, it might provide support to help sustain and expand such community
programs, in line with its desire to extend coverage to marginal groups at a
time of extreme budget pressures. <p>
<p>
	A second reason private preschools open is to provide <b>flexibility</b> and
convenience associated with the need for <b>alternative child care</b>.  The
half-day schedule of general preschools is not intended to meet child care
needs of families in which both parents must work or where a single mother
works outside the home, where hiring help in the home is not an option.  It
does not serve well many parents employed in the informal sector (which now
accounts for about 40% of the labor force) who cannot count on extended family
for care, and who are not eligible to put their children in a CENDI (where in
any event the number of places is very limited in relation to the demand).
General preschools were not designed taking into account the increasing
participation of women in remunerated activities, now estimated at 34% or
higher.<b>[4]</b>  The Jardines Mixta program of the
SEP which begins to respond to this need by  extending normal preschool hours
into the afternoon, combining child care and preschool education, began only
recently, requires at least 60 children to organize a program, and is still
limited in coverage.  The government faces a challenge as the need to combine
preschooling and childcare grows apace.<p>
<p>
	<b>Because so little information is available about non-public preschools, a
logical procedure would be to create a systematic profile of the complementary
efforts being carried out by the private and social sectors.</b>  This seems
particularly important given the call in the National Plan for a national
alliance and for "co-responsibility" in programming to meet social needs.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>III  AN EVOLVING PROFILE OF PRESCHOOLING, 1970-71 TO 1993/94</b><p>
<p>
<p>
	Defining and tracking a profile of preschool education is Mexico is not easy
for several reasons.  First the models and administrative forms of providing
preschool education change from time to time.  Changes of  government,
decentralization, and a special program of educational modernization in recent
years have been accompanied by shifts in attention that influence statistical
series.  Second, a complete picture of preschool education involves collecting
information about programs that are handled by the Secretar&iacute;a de
Educaci&oacute;n P&uacute;blica (SEP), other governmental entities and the
private sector.  Some information about programs other than those run by the
SEP are included in the presentation of information by the SEP, but not all
extra-SEP programs are included and most of the analyses that have been made
refer to programs of the SEP.  The omissions are particularly clear with
respect to private educational initiatives, but also occur with respect to
lesser government-associated  programs as well.<b>[5]</b>  Third, the basis for categorizing preschool
programs in the statistics is based on administrative responsibility and not on
the model of preschool education being used.  Therefore, "non-formal" models
may be hidden within the statistics, requiring a special effort to pull them
out.  The official statistics, for instance, do not include information about
the rural or urban alternative preschool programs which fall under the general
preschool education department.  Nor do they include information about the
newer initiatives within the Consejo Nacional de Fomento Educativo (CONAFE).
Fourth, descriptions vary somewhat depending on whether one uses enrollment
figures at the beginning of the year vs. end-of-year figures.  Fifth, the
statistics themselves are sometimes inconsistent or difficult to interpret (in
appendix A more specific comments are provided on sources and problems
encountered in working with existing statistics).<p>
<p>
	In lieu of these problems it is well for the reader to take the following
descriptions and analyses as reasonable approximations of the preschool
situation in Mexico rather than as definitive descriptions.  It is our
impression that general orders of magnitude and the trends identified would
hold up even if greater precision were introduced into the statistics.  The
following analysis of enrollment, groups, teachers and schools is based on a
historical series provided by the Direcci&oacute;n de An&aacute;lisis y
Sistemas de Informaci&oacute;n within the Planning and Programming Department
of the SEP.  The figures reflect enrollments at the beginning of the school
year.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Enrolment/children</b><p>
<p>
	Table 3 presents information about enrollments (as counted at the beginning of
the school year) for the period from the school year 1970/71 to 1993/94.  From
the table we see that:<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Total Enrolment in preschools has increased steadily,</b> with growth
registered in every year from 1970/1 to 1993/4, except 1989/90 when for all
intents and purposes there was no growth.   It would not be an exaggeration to
say that preschool education has grown dramatically over the last 25 years
during which time the total enrolment increased more than seven-fold.  However,
most of this growth occurred during the 10 years from 1975 to 1985 when
enrolment increased five-fold.<p>
<p>
	2.  <b>There are marked variations by year and sexenio.</b>  The rate of
growth in enrolment has varied markedly from sexenio to sexenio and sometimes
from year to year.  At one extreme is the minor drop of 0.2% that occurred
between 1989 and 1990; at the other, total enrolment increased at a rate of
28.4% between 1979 and 1980.   The differences by sexenio are:<p>
<pre>
			      Average	    Highest growth		Total growth
   Sexenio		growth per year	    rate in one year		 each sexenio


1970/1 - 1975/6	         7%		      7.8% (75-76)		        34%
1976/7 - 1981/2	        21%		     28.4% (80-81)		       126%
1982/3 - 1987/8	         9%		     13.0% (83-84)		         55%
1988/9 - 1993/4	         2%		      4.2% (92-93)		         12%
</pre>
<b>Table 3</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	<b>From the above it is clear that the increase in enrolment leveled out
during the most recent sexenio. </b>  This is particularly so for the growth in
enrollments for children in the third level (usually children age 5) where
almost no growth occurred during the sexenio.  When we take into account that,
until 1993/4 the number of children entering preschool age was continuing to
increase slightly (but since 1993/4 is declining), the growth rate during the
previous sexenio barely covers that growth.<p>
	<p>
	3.  <b>There are variations by preschool level.</b>  Enrolment growth spurts
have occurred at a different pace for the different levels within preschooling.
Enrollments for the first level (mostly children age 3) lag well behind
children in the third level (mostly age 5).  Enrollment in the first level has
grown only about a third as fast as enrollment in the third level over the 1970
- 1993 period.  Accordingly, during 1993/4, only 17% of all preschool children
were in the first level or 
grade whereas 53% were in the third grade.<p>
<p>
	<b>1979-81.</b>  As shown in Table 3, enrollments in the first level of
preschool decreased markedly in the period from 1979 to 1981.  This decrease
was caused by a decision to emphasize attention to children aged four and five
at that time.  As a result of this policy, enrolment in the first level of
preschool increased by only .6% during the 1976-82 sexenio at the same time
that enrollment in the second and third levels increased by 97% and 217%,
respectively.   <p>
<p>
	4.  <b>Variations by state.</b>   An enormous variation in growth rates at the
state level appears in the rates of growth in enrollment at the state level.
Table 4 consolidates state-level information by sexenio.  From Table 4 we see,
for instance, that whereas enrolment in the Federal District grew by 146% over
the entire period and enrollments actually decreased by 2.5% from 1990 to
1993), Chiapas enrollment grew 2075% and enrollments grew by 28% in the 1990-93
period.<p>
<p>
	Perhaps the most significant conclusion to be drawn from an examination of the
state-level data is that <b>poorer states, for the most part, have grown faster
than richer states during the period.  This suggests that some redistribution
of public funds is occurring and that important efforts have been made to help
lagging states to catch up.</b><p>
<p>
<p>
  <b>Groups, Teachers and Schools</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Groups</b>.  As is evident from a comparison of Tables 5 and 3, the
creation of new groups of children has occurred at a greater rate than the rate
of increase in enrolment.  This has allowed the average number of children per
group to drop from 37.5 in 1970 to 19.5 in 1993.  The average figure hides
considerable variation from group to group but indicates that for many, the
size of the group has been reduced significantly over time.<p>
<p>
	<b>Teachers.</b>  The rate of growth in the number of teachers has also been
greater than that of enrolment, beginning in 1976, so that, from 1976 to the
1993, the average number of students per preschool teacher has dropped from
38.1 to 24.5.  <p>

	<b>Schools.</b>   The number of preschools has increased 16-fold over the
period since 1970 and the average size of schools has dropped from 130 children
to 58 children.  This reflects the increasing reach of preschool into rural
areas.<p>
<p>
 Growth Rates, by Sexenio:	Enrolment, Groups, Teachers and Schools<p>

	      Sexenio			Enrolment	  Groups	Teachers	Schools

</pre>
	Looking at the rates of growth for groups, teachers and schools by year and
sexenio, similar variations and patterns to those described for enrolment are
found.  Growth is concentra-ted in the ten-year period from 1975 to 1985.
However, during the most recent sexenio, the average number of students per
group, teacher and school has continued to decrease in spite of the fact that
enrollments have leveled out.<p>
<p>
	 <b>In theory, the trends described in Table 5 should signal an important
improvement in the quality of preschools.  However, the following should be
kept in  mind:</b><p>
<p>
	1.  An average number of 25 children per teacher for the preschool years is
still high and may not yet permit major qualitative effects to appear.<p>
<p>
	2.  The reductions represent continued efforts to establish schools in rural
areas where the concentration of children is not as great.   We do not know
whether these rural schools have achieved a reasonable level of quality or not,
given the additional difficulties associated with serving a rural population.<p>
<p>
	3.  The continued growth of teachers and the change in numbers represent in
part a response to union pressures for better working conditions that may or
may not translate into changed performance in the preschool.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>An Analysis of Enrollments and Operational indicators, 1993/94</b><p>
<p>
	In order to obtain a picture of the current state of preschool education and
of its more recent development, an analysis is presented of the figures for
1993/94.  Tables supporting this analysis are found in Appendix C.  To make the
analysis more manageable, data are presented for the Federal Republic, for the
five states with the highest enrolment and the five states with the lowest
enrolment.  From these tables we can see the following:<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Enrollment, by grade level</b> (Appendix C, Table 1).  At the national
level, 52.3% of all preschool children are enrolled in grade 3, with 31.6%
found in grade 2 and 16.1% in grade 1.  This pattern holds for most of the
states, with a major exception found in Veracruz where 53.5% are found in the
first level.<p>
<p>
	2.  <b>Enrollment, by "type" of preschool</b> (Appendix C, Table 2).  General
preschools account for 88.2% of all preschool enrollment and indigenous
preschools for 8.3%  Cursos Comunitarios and CENDIs account for 1.9% and 1.6%,
respectively.  This distribution of programs changed very little during the
previous sexenio (Appendix C, Table 3).  There are variations in the
distribution by type of preschool among states.  For instance, in Oaxaca,
indigenous preschools account for 44.1% of all enrollment (as contrasted with
the 8.2% national figure).  In no state do cursos comunitarios account for more
than 4% of total enrollment.  The distribution among programs in the Distrito
Federal is different from other states because it has a much higher percentage
of private enrollment (28.3%) and of CENDI enrollment (5.6%).  In general, the
percentage of enrollment accounted for by the CENDIs is below 2%.<p>
<p>
	3.  <b>Enrollment by Federal/State/Private.</b>  In 1991, the Federal
government was responsible for administering programs enrolling 72% of all
children in preschools (Appendix C, Table 3).  States administered 19% and the
private sector was responsible for 9%.  Following the decentralization in 1992,
all of the general preschools and the CENDIS located outside the Federal
District were transferred to the states.  Responsibility for all indigenous
preschools was also placed in the states.  Thus, in 1993/4, we see a dramatic
shift in the distribution so that the Federal government was now only
responsible directly for 9% (General preschools and CENDIs in the DF, and
Cursos Comunitarios, classified as compensatory programs and therefore kept at
the national level) whereas states administered 83% and the private sector 8%.
 <p>
	<p>
	4.  <b>Enrollment by formal/non-formal.  </b>Only about 4% of the enrollment
classified under General Preschooling is actually enrollment in "Alternative"
preschool programs (see Table 2) which follow a non-formal model but which are
administered by the general preschool department.  If the alternative programs
are put together with the non-formal programs administered by CONAFE, the
percentage of the total is 5.2% from which we can conclude that <b>non-formal
preschool programs account for a very small part of the total preschool
enrollment.</b><p>
<p>
	5.  <b>Correspondence between age and preschool level (grade).</b>  Although
there is some variation, children are more or less in the grade level
corresponding to age.  The data show (Appendix C, Table 4) that 98.1% of the
children age 3 are in the first level; 75% of the children aged 4 are in the
second level, and 89 % of the children aged 5 are in the 3rd level.  An
exception to this pattern appears in Veracruz were only 5% of the children aged
5 are in the third level.  The rest are distributed between the first (25%) and
the second (70%) levels.<p>
<p>
	6.  <b>Rate of "retention."  </b>This rate is calculated by comparing the year
end enrollments with inscription numbers.  This is a very rough comparison at
best because some children leave and others arrive during the year and because
there is migration across states.  With these cautions in mind, the figures
suggest (Appendix C, Table 5), that the rate of completion during the year is
relatively high, according to the statistics, but varies from state to state
with the lowest rates in the D.F.  <p>
.  <p>
	7.  <b>Coverage.</b>   In order to estimate coverage of the preschool system
it is necessary not only  to have a reasonable estimate of enrollment, but also
an estimate of the relevant age group (representing "potential social demand")
that is being served by preschools.   In a number of publications, the relevant
age group for which coverage figures are calculated has been defined as
children age five, and coverage has been calculated by relating the enrollment
of children in the third year of preschool to the estimate of the total
population of children aged 5.   Using this definition of coverage, it is
estimated that coverage grew from 13% in 1977 to 72% in 1990.<b>[6]</b><p>
<p>
	More recently, however, coverage figures have been reported as indicating
coverage for children ages 4 and 5 in the population.  An example is the Fourth
Evaluation of the National Plan in support of children presented in October
1994.  Here, a coverage figure of 75% is reported using figures for 1993/4.
It is not clear how this calculation was made but the figure seems to continue
to represent a comparison of the third level enrollment with estimates of the
children aged 5 in the Mexican population.  According to the population
projections provided by the census bureau, the estimated number of children
aged 5 in 1993 was 2,131,539 and the number aged 4 was 2,256,916.  If the third
level preschool enrollment for 1993 of 1,558,031 is compared with the estimate
for children aged 5, the coverage figure is 73%.  If we compare the total
enrollment in preschools for 1993 (2,980,024) with the sum of the projected
population figures for children aged 4 and 5 (4,388,455), then the coverage
figure would be 68%.  However, the total enrollment includes children ages 3,
as well as ages 6 and 7.  If we take only the enrollments of children in the
second and third levels of preschool (on the assumption that first level
children are mostly aged 3) and compare these enrollment figures (2,499,123)
with the sum of the population projections for children aged 4 and 5
(4,388,455) the coverage figure for children aged 4 and 5 turns out to be 57%,
considerably lower than the 75% reported.  If we compare total preschool
enrollment with the population projections for children ages 3 to 5, the
percentage is even lower: 45%.  <b>In brief, it would seem that the coverage
figures are considerably inflated unless they refer only to children age
5</b>.<p>

paper are roughly as follows:  a) describe preschool education programs; b)
identify and discuss the major issues pertaining to programs; c) describe the
Government's and NGO/Private sector's preschool education strategies and d)
make recommendations for improvements in the quality, efficiency and access to
preschool education.<p>
<a name="fn1">[2]</a>Later on in the paper we will see that relative reductions
in educational spending did not lead to decreases in the expansion of
pre-school education which ran counter to this general trend.<p>
<a name="fn2">[3]</a>When the topic of private preschools was brought up in
Oaxaca, we were told that only 18 schools were registered for all of Oaxaca and
that only 10 of these had provided statistical information about their
programs.<p>
<a name="fn3">[4]</a>This figure is a 1988 figure and probably understates the
actual participation.  The figure, as well as that for the level of the
informal economic, was taken from: Patricia Hernandez, et al., "Child Care in
Female Street Vendors in Mexico City: Needs and Policy Recommendations,"
Instituto Nacional de Salud P'ublica, Cuernavaca, Mexico, 1994.<p>
<a name="fn4">[5]</a>For instance, the official statistics do not include
children ages 3 to 5 who are participating in the small program of Day Care
Homes (Casas de Cuidado Diario) that was carried out under the auspices of the
El Patronato Nacional de Promotores Voluntarios and is now administered by
DIF.<p>

I.  Background<p>
<p>
<b>A.	Namibia</b><p>
<p>
	There is great diversity within Namibia -- in rainfall, in climatic
conditions, in income, and in the quality of life for its people.  Angola
borders Namibia to the North, Zimbabwe and Zambia in the North East, Botswana
in the East, South Africa in the South, and the Atlantic Ocean on the West.
Namibia covers more than 822 000 sq. kilometres, and its populations is
estimated at close to 1.5 million.  Namibia has a population growth rate of 3%
per annum.  Only 30% of the population lives in urban areas.  The majority is
dispersed throughout the remainder of the country.<p>
<p>
	The per capita income is US$ 1.520. ($540 is the average for Sub-Saharan
Africa.)  As a result, Namibia ranks 84 out of 173 countries in terms of per
capita GNP.  However, Namibia's ranking slips to 127 out of 173 when the Human
Development Index (HDI) is calculated. (Social Sciences Division, 1995, pg. 17)
The per capita figure is deceptive; it masks the wide disparity in income
within the country which is reflected more accurately by the HDI. Further,
almost half (47%) of Namibian households are living in poverty:  34% are ranked
as <i>poor</i> while an additional 13% are classified as <i>very poor.</i>  In
general, however, those in urban areas fare better than those living in rural
areas.  In urban areas 22% of households are poor. In rural areas closer to 60%
are poor. (Social Sciences Division, 1995, pg. 18)  While there is an affluent
population and a growing middle class there are people living in rural areas
who are not even part of the cash economy.   71% of the Gross Domestic Product
is in the hands of 5% of the population; 55% of the population control only 3%
of the nation's wealth. (Nghiitwikwa &amp; Nowaseb, 1994, pg. 8)<p>
<p>
	Prior to Independence basic services, including health and education, were
fragmented among racial lines.  This has led to great inequities in provision
and partially explains the low HDI.  Since Independence in 1990, the Government
has made a commitment to access, equity, quality and democracy in order to
improve the life of all its citizens. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	The Situation of Young Children</b><p>
<p>
	Children in Namibia have been victims of war, poverty, overcrowded housing,
inadequate food supply, polluted water, lack of sanitary facilities and
isolation.  They suffer from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea, acute
respiratory infections and measles, all diseases that could be prevented.
Although it is one of the wealthiest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa the
malnutrition level in Namibia (29%) is only slightly lower than average for the
region (31%).  In fact, Namibia has the highest malnutrition level for any
country in the world among the 83 countries whose GNP per capita income is
higher than $1 000. (Social Science Division, 1995, pg. 29)  A Household Health
and Nutrition Survey conducted by UNICEF in the North West Region and Katutura
found a <i>high to moderate malnutrition</i> rate of 30% and a <i>severe
malnutrition</i> rate of 6.8% (Ministry of Health and Social Services (1992, pg
2)  <p>
<p>
	The dislocation of the population brought about by war and economic necessity
has impacted the social structure of families.  Geographic relocation due to
wars and urban migration has separated families, leaving many without the
traditional supports found within the extended family system.  There is an
increase in the number of female-headed households.  The UNICEF Household
Survey found that in the two areas surveyed 41% of the households were
female-headed. (MOHSS, 1992, pg. 2)  In another survey it was found that 52.3%
of women between the ages of 15 and 49 never marry.  Teenage pregnancy is also
common: 29% become pregnant before age 15; 40% of Namibian women become
pregnant before they are 20 years of age. (Nghiitwikwa &amp; Nowaseb, 1994, pg.
20)<p>
<p>
	When women work outside the home or are unemployed, and when young women want
to continue their education children are given to relatives (grandparents,
aunts and uncles), friends and others, to be raised.  This is not necessarily
beneficial for the child.  For example, grandparents may also have very limited
resources, financial and physical, limiting their ability to care adequately
for the child.  (Nghiitwikwa &amp; Nowaseb, 1994, pg. 12) Thus there is a
growing need for a system of child care that provides children with a safe,
healthy and emotionally secure environment which promotes their optimal growth.
<p>
<p>
	Historically Christian missionaries took the initiative in terms of the
provision of programmes for young children.  The primary form of early
childhood provision has been kindergartens (pre-schools) -- formal programmes
for children 3-6 years of age, providing them with an educational experience
within the context of a centre-based programme that also addresses health and
nutrition needs.  The first kindergartens were affiliated with Churches, as are
the great majority today.  The Lutherans were among the first to provide such
programmes and they have an extensive network of kindergartens throughout the
country.  The Catholic and Anglican Churches have also provided programmes for
young children.  Other non-governmental organisations, such as the Red Cross
and S.O.S. Children's Village, have also established programmes for young
children, and there are a growing number of other NGOs and private providers
creating programmes for young children.<p>

	The setting for and quality of early childhood provision runs the full
spectrum of programmes found anywhere in the world.  Some are located in
purpose-built structures with good equipment, a multitude of play materials and
well-trained teachers, ever responsive to and supportive of children.  At the
other end of the spectrum are programmes where groups of children are huddled
together in dilapidated huts, with nothing to play with, being overseen by an
adult who has little understanding of children's needs or her role in
supporting children's growth and development.  Thus there are great inequities
in terms of children's experiences in early childhood programmes. In a report
on pre-schools in Namibia, Repp (1990) notes:  "It is doubtful whether some of
the inferior Pre-Schools provide a better environment than would be experienced
if the children were left on their own."  (pg. 5)  This does not speak well for
the status of early childhood programmes in Namibia. <p>
<p>
<b>C.	The Purpose of the Document </b><p>
<p>
	There is a recognition by the government that the future of the country
belongs in the hands of today's children.  If those children lack appropriate
experiences during the early years there is a cost to society as a whole.  Thus
there is a need to create a policy which addresses directly the needs of young
children and their families. The purpose of this document is to delineate a
<i>National Early Childhood Development (ECD) Policy for Namibia</i>.  The
document will:<p>
<p><ul>
	Define the parameters of early childhood development;<p>

Establish the position of early childhood programmes in relation to national
development priorities;<p>

	Define the National Early Childhood Development Policy framework;<p>
Define the respective roles of Government, Churches, non-governmental
organisations, the private sector and parents in provision of ECD.<p></ul>
<p>
<p>
II. The Parameters of Early Childhood Development<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A.  	Definition of Early Childhood Development (ECD) </b><p>
<p>
	There is a need to have a common understanding of what is meant by the term
Early Childhood Development (ECD).  There are two parts to the phrase, <i>early
childhood</i> and <i>development</i>.  As it is currently used internationally,
<i>early childhood</i> is defined as the period of a child's life from
conception to age eight. There are two reasons for including this age range
within a definition of ECD.<p>
<p>
	First, this timeframe is consistent with developmental psychology's view of
the continuum of children's development. Children below the age of eight learn
best when they have objects they can manipulate; when they have chances to
explore the world around them; when they can experiment and learn from
trial-and-error within a safe and stimulating environment.  At about the age of
nine they begin to view the world differently.  They can manipulate ideas and
learn concepts mentally and are less dependent on objects.  Thus in terms of
learning theory, the birth through age eight time period presents a
developmental continuum.<p>
 <p>
	Second, the international definition of early childhood includes the early
primary years (ages six-eight) because of the importance of the transition for
children either from home or from a pre-school programme into the primary
school.  If pre-school programmes for children are to be effective, there needs
to be interface between what happens in the pre-school and lower primary
school.  This does not mean that early childhood programmes should become
formal experiences for young children.  Rather, there is a need for early
primary teachers to become more aware of the experiences, skills and knowledge
that children bring with them into the primary school if they have had an early
childhood programme experience.  <p>
<p>
	Within Namibia, the Ministry of Regional and Local Government and Housing has
responsibility for children from birth to age 6 when children enter the primary
school.  Children then become the responsibility of the Ministry of Basic
Education.<p>
<p>
	In the definition of ECD being used in this document, <i>development</i> is
defined as the process of change in which the child comes to master more and
more complex levels of moving, thinking, feeling and interacting with people
and objects in the environment.  Development involves both a gradual unfolding
of biologically determined characteristics and the learning process.
<i>Learning</i> is the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, habits and
values through experience and experimentation, observation, reflection, and/or
study and instruction.  Both the child's physical growth (the child's health
and nutrition history and current health and nutritional status) are crucial in
the child's overall development.  The child's current developmental status
either facilitates or inhibits future learning.  Thus learning is part of the
development process. (Myers, 1992)<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	The Importance of The Early Years</b><p>
<p>
	Scientific findings from a variety of fields have demonstrated that support of
early development yields rich benefits not only in immediate ways for the child
and its parents, but also over time in terms of the child's ability to
contribute to the community.  Interventions in the early years of childhood
offer an extraordinary opportunity to avoid or moderate learning problems, and
to bring lasting benefits to individuals and society.  As summarised by Myers
(1993) the benefits of early childhood interventions include:<p>
<p>
	1.  <b>Increased economic productivity.</b>  A person who is well developed
physically, socially and emotionally will be in a better position to be
employed and to contribute economically to the family, community and country
than a person who does not have these characteristics.  Interventions that
support young children's physical and mental capacities lead to increased
enrolment and improved progress and performance in school.  This is important
since school performance is linked to increased economic productivity. <p>
<p>
	2.  <b>Cost savings.</b>  Of particular importance within the Namibian
context, <b>early childhood investments can reduce costs and improve the
efficiency of primary schooling</b>.  Children who are better prepared
physically, mentally and socially for school have an easier transition from
home to school.  Therefore, drop-out and repetition rates are lower and the
need for remedial programmes is reduced, cutting costs. Effective early
childhood programmes can bring <i>cost savings in areas other than
education</i>: health care costs can be cut through preventive measures in
programmes which help reduce disease and accidents (Evans &amp; Shah, 1994);
the social costs of delinquency and related problems are cut as children stay
in school longer (Schweinhart et al., 1992); and absenteeism is reduced when
parents, assured of proper care for their children, can devote their time to
the job (Galinsky, 1986).<p>
<p>
	3.  <b>Reductions in social and economic inequalities.</b>  Poverty and/or
discrimination can inhibit development in the early years. By failing to
intervene to support positive growth and development, governments tacitly
endorse inequalities.  This is certainly true if no special effort is made to
assist those who have been discriminated against and if early childhood
programmes are available only to those who can afford to pay for them.
Investments in early childhood development have been shown to modify
inequalities rooted in poverty and social discrimination by giving children
from <i>disadvantaged</i> backgrounds a <i>fair start</i> in school and in
life.  Studies suggest that these children benefit more from early intervention
programmes than their more-privileged peers.<p>
<p>
	4.  <b>Reductions in gender inequalities.</b>  All children have a right to
develop to their full potential.  Attention to young girls often lags behind
attention to boys, beginning and reinforcing a long cycle of discrimination.
Gender-linked disparities in attitudes and expectations and in patterns and
practices of early care and development need to be examined. There is evidence
that early attention to gender can produce changes in the development of the
girl child and in the way families perceive the abilities and future of that
child.  Further early childhood programmes can also benefit women and older
sibling by freeing them from constant child care responsibility so they can
learn and seek better employment and earnings.<p>
<p>
	5.  <b>Strengthened values.</b>  Transmission of the social and moral values
that will guide all of us in the future begins in the earliest months of life.
In societies where there is a concern that crucial values are being eroded, a
strong incentive exists to find ways in which those values can be strengthened.
Early childhood programmes can assist in that effort by strengthening parenting
skills and by providing environments within which children can play and give
attention to culturally desirable values.<p>
<p>
	6.  <b>Social mobilisation.</b>  In many locations, lack of experience in the
political process make it extremely difficult to mobilise people for actions
that will be to their own benefit.  In such circumstances, focusing a programme
on young children as a point of common interest can be an effective rallying
strategy and serve as an entry point for broader community development. <p>
<p>
	7.  <b>Community and family benefits.</b>  Community improvements in health,
sanitation and nutrition that benefit children are also likely to benefit
parents, families and the community at large.  These community and family
benefits are evidenced by parents' improved self-confidence, the emergence of
leaders, and by increased organisation and social action in communities.  <p>
<p>
	<b>In sum, the benefits of investing in early childhood care and development
can be extraordinarily high</b>.  	<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C.  	Child Development Principles</b><p>
<p>
	The term used by the ECD community to describe children's development is
<i>holistic</i>.  What this means is that the child's development cannot be
compartmentalised into health, nutrition, education, social and emotional
variables.  All are interwoven in a child's life. <p>
<p>
	Those within the ECD field hold firmly to a belief that early childhood
experiences for children, at whatever age, should be holistic, developed around
the child's developmental abilities.  Support for this position comes from
international literature on how children develop and learn.  Specifically:<p>
<p>
<p><ul>
 <b>Development begins pre-natally and learning is occurring at birth.</b> Too
often the assumption is made that learning begins when children enter the
formal school system.  In fact, significant learning takes place before the
child enters school. Therefore, attention to the developmental and learning
needs of children should begin with pre- and post-natal interventions and be
continued thereafter.<p>
<p>
 <b>Development has several inter-related dimensions. </b> These include
physical, cognitive, social, spiritual and emotional development, each of which
influence the other and all of which are developing simultaneously.  Progress
in one area affects progress in others.  Likewise when something goes wrong in
any one of those areas it impacts all the other areas. For example, children
who are malnourished are not able to learn, children with learning problems
frequently have low self-esteem, etc.  Developing a programme based on an
understanding of holistic development means taking the whole child into
consideration, providing attention to the child's health, nutrition, cognitive,
and socio-emotional needs.  Therefore development and learning must be seen
holistically and interventions should provide integrated attention to the
child, including attention to needs for protection, food, health care,
affection, interaction and stimulation, security provided through consistency
and predictability, and play allowing exploration. All of these elements should
be present to support the child's development.<p>
<p>
 <b>Development proceeds in predictable steps and learning occurs in recognized
sequences, within which there is a great deal of individual and social
variability in children's rates of development and styles of learning. </b> It
is important for adults to use methods that fit with the child's growth
pattern, not only in the cognitive area, but also in the affective, perceptual
and motor areas. Activities should provide the child with a developmentally
appropriate challenge. There is no value in presenting concepts and tasks
before a child is developmentally ready to understand them. Integrated
interventions promoting social, emotional and spiritual development as well as
cognitive learning can take advantage of varied forms of learning, consistent
with the culture, even while taking into account that there are recognized
sequences and activities that facilitate learning.   <p>
<p>
 <b>Development and learning occur continuously as a result of the child
interacting with people and objects in their environment.</b>  The role of
adults (at home and in other settings) in supporting children's learning is to
provide children with opportunities to work with concrete objects, to make
choices, explore things and ideas, experiment and discover.  Children also need
opportunities to interact with peers and adults in a safe environment that
provides the child with security and acceptance. <p>
<p>
Given the importance of the environment in promoting children's learning, it is
also possible to focus interventions on changing the child's environment.  For
example, increasing family income, upgrading health and sanitation in the
community, and enhancing the social and political milieu will affect children's
growth and development.<p>
<p>
 <b>Children are active participants in their own development and learning.</b>
Learning and related development involves the child's construction of
knowledge, not an adult's imposition of information.  The skills which are the
basis for constructing knowledge improve with practice. It is important for
children to have opportunities to construct their own knowledge through
exploration, interaction with materials and imitation of role models. Therefore
interventions should include opportunities for children to learn by doing, to
be engaged in problem-solving, and to develop language and communication
skills. ECD programmes should not put undue emphasis on rote memorisation and
learning the <i>3 Rs</i>. Opportunities for active involvement should abound,
whether at home in everyday chores or in more organised settings outside the
home.<p></ul>
	<p>
	In sum, ECD programmes building on a holistic understanding of children's
growth and development, suggest a broad conceptualisation of the concept of
early childhood development in terms of the whole child within the context of
the family and community.  The early childhood years are perceived as the basis
for learning life-long skills and attitudes.  Activities and programmes planned
for parents and young children should not focus solely on providing children
with school survival skills, but should emphasise the development of the
child's sense of intellectual, motor and moral autonomy, initiative and self
esteem.  Emphasis should be on <b>how to learn</b> (i.e. positive attitudes to
learning and thinking skills) rather than <b>what to learn.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>D.	Early Childhood Development Programmes in Namibia</b><p>
<p>
	<b>1.  A definition of terms</b><p>
<p>
	There are a variety of terms that are used to describe ECD programmes for
children prior to the entry to school.  Within Namibia the term <i>creche</i>
generally refers to programmes providing full-day care for children from
infancy to three years of age.  These provide custodial care, with partially
trained staff.  <i>Day care</i> generally refers to full day programmes for
children 3-6 years of age where custodial care is provided. These programmes
seldom have an educational component. <p>
<p>
	The most common form of ECD provision in Namibia is <i>Kindergarten. </i>This
term refers to non-formal centre-based programmes for children 3-6 years of
age. These programmes are also known as <i>pre-schools</i>.  While these
programmes may have educational inputs, the staff may not have formal training.
<i>Pre-primary</i> refers to programmes for children ages 5 &amp; 6 prior to
their entry into the primary school. Up until the end of 1994 pre-primary
classes were operated by the Ministry of Education and Culture. In some cases
they were attached to primary schools and in other instances they were
free-standing.  In both instances they were staffed by professionally trained
teachers.  <p>
<p>
	In sum, programmes for young children can take a variety of forms.  They can
include parent education programmes, offered individually through home visits
and/or in the form of parent groups. They also include provision for groups of
children in centres (offered in purpose-built buildings, churches or community
facilities) or homes (operated on the premises of the early childhood provider
in informal back-yard structures or garages).  <p>
<p>
	Since the National ECD Policy addresses the needs of children from birth to
eight years of age, the term <i>Early Childhood Development Programmes</i> will
be used to refer to all interventions with young children and their families.
<p>
<p>
<b>	2.  Current early childhood provision in Namibia</b><p>
<p>
	There is a lack of data on current ECD provision in the country.  Several
surveys of centre-based programmes have been conducted since independence, but
none of these have been comprehensive. In addition, no attempt has been made to
collect data on the number of people being served through parent involvement
programmes and/or children being attended in non-formal settings.  What follows
is a discussion of the data that do exist.<p>
<p>
	In the National Programme of Action for the Children of Namibia (1991) there
are some data on the provision of pre-primary classes for children aged 5.
Table 1 presents a summary of the number of children catered for in these
classes, by sponsoring agency. <p>

	In preparation for the National Conference on Early Childhood Protection and
Development held in 1992, Verhoef (1992) conducted a survey of 236 early
childhood programmes that catered for children from birth through age 5.  While
not all ECD programmes in the country were included in the survey, his data
yield some understanding of what is being provided, for and by whom.  Data from
the survey are presented in Tables 2 and 3.  Table 2 indicates who is providing
services for young children, by region.  Table 3 presents a summary of the age

</pre>
There some other interesting findings from the survey.  For example, in terms
of the characteristics of children attending ECD programmes:<p>
<p><ul>
-	There are an equal number of boys and girls attending ECD programmes.<p>
-	Of those attending, 6% come from high income families, 31% from middle income
and 63% from poor families.<p>
<p>
<p>
-	Within these programmes <p>
	<ul>	 1% of the children were under 1 year of age<br>

		14% were 3<br>
		24% were 4<br>
		34% were 5<br>
		19% were 6<br>
		 2% were 7<p>
				<p></ul></ul>
In terms of infrastructure:<p>
<p><ul>
-	Only 26% of the programmes were registered with the MEC; 74% were not
registered;<p>
-	60% of the programmes had no curriculum or scheme of work;<p>
-	24% of the programmes were being offered in the primary school; 8% were
offered in community halls; 28% were provided in churches; and 36% were being
offered in homes;<p>
-	32% of the programmes had no toilets; 6% had buckets; and 62% had flush
toilets. <p></ul>
<p>
In terms of staffing:<p>
<p><ul>
-	9% of the staff had less than a Standard 6 education; 36% had completed
Standard 6 or 7;  27% completed Standard 8; and 28% had completed Standard
10;<p>
-	24% of the staff received salaries from the Ministry of Education; 19% from
Churches; parents and school funds provided 31% of the salaries; 12% were
provided by NGOs; and 14% of the ECD workers received no salaries.<p>
<p></ul>
In terms of health care:<p>
<p><ul>
-	67% of the children were fully immunised; in 22% of the cases providers did
not know if children were immunised; 11% of the centres had children who were
not immunised;<p>
-	31% of the ECD programmes were being visited regularly by a health visitor.<p>
<p></ul>
In terms of Management:<p>
<p><ul>
-	60% of the programmes were run by parent committees. Within these, 96% of the
members were elected by the parents.  Thus there is considerable parent
participation in the operation of ECD programmes.<p>
<p></ul>
In terms of collaboration:<p>
<p><ul>
-	Collaboration among those offering ECD programmes is already taking place.
There are instances where supervision of programmes comes from agencies other
than the sponsoring agency.<p></ul>
<p>
<p>
	As noted, these data present a picture of what was happening within 236
programmes in the early 1990s.  Since then there has been a tremendous growth
in ECD programmes. In 1993/4 another survey was conducted.  This was undertaken
by the MRLGH.  Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers provided
information on the ECD programmes that they worked with. (Community Development
Directorate, 1994)  A summary of the findings is presented in Table 4.<p>

<p>
	*  It should be noted that in the data collection process there 
was an overlap and mix of regions and areas. Further, the survey was 
not exhaustive.  <p>
<p>
</pre>
	Comparing Table 1 and 3 raises questions.  According to the 1992 survey of 236
ECD programmes, 12 482 children were being served.  Yet Table 4 suggests that
in 377 ECD programmes only 6 374 children are being served.  The reason for the
discrepancy is that in the 1993/4 survey information regarding the number of
children being served were not collected from all centres.  Thus the enrolment
column is very incomplete. In addition,  the survey did not include government
provision.<p>
<p>
	Clearly not enough is known about ECD provision at the present time.
Nonetheless, the comment in the report of the 1992 workshop still represents
the state of ECD provision in Namibia today.<p>
<p><ul>
"Since Independence there has been a 30% growth in the number of child care and
pre-school programmes, although the disparity between facilities, types of
programmes and teacher or caregiver qualifications is great.  Despite this
growth, only 5% of Namibian children from birth to 7 years old attend any kind
of programme." (MLGH, October 1992, pg. 12)<p></ul>
<p>
	One area where there has been no growth is in terms of Government provision.
Historically the Ministry of Education and Culture provided a one-year
pre-primary experience for some children.  Recognising the need to provide a
quality pre-school experience for all children, and also recognising that the
government could not afford to do this, the MEC decided to suspend its support
of pre-primary classes.  In explaining this action, the Ministry of Education
noted:<p>
<p><ul>
"In 1994 only 3013 children and 161 personnel were involved in the pre-primary
programmes [operated by MEC] which are primarily inherited from the previous
advantaged ethnic administrations of the past dispensations.  Comparing with
the potential figure of approximately 80 000 five year olds the present
enrolment is insignificant and catering merely for people who can afford to
take their children to private pre-primary and kindergarten programmes." (MEC,
1995, pg. 2-3)<p></ul>
<p>
	Nonetheless the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture is making a commitment
to early childhood development programming in collaboration with the Ministry
of Regional and Local Government and Housing, the Ministry of Health and Social
Services and other partners to support community-based initiatives in ECD.
These groups have come together in an Inter-Ministerial Task Force established
by the Ministry of Regional and Local Government and Housing (MRLGH) and the
Ministry of Basic Education and Culture (MBEC) to create a National ECD Policy
that will support a broad spectrum of ECD programmes designed to reach young
children and their families throughout Namibia.  <p>
<p>
<p>
III.  The Position of Early Childhood Programmes in Relation to National
Development Priorities:  The Need for an ECD Policy<p>
<p>
<p>
	An indication of the Government's commitment to children is the fact that
Namibia was one of the early signatories to <i>The Convention on the Rights of
the Child</i>.  Further, upon his return from the World Summit for Children in
1990, the President initiated the <i>National Programme of Action for the
Children of Namibia</i> (1991). <p>
<p>
	Within the National Programme of Action for the Children of Namibia (NPA)
there is a section on Early Childhood Protection and Development (ECPD) within
which there is a strong statement in support of ECD activities.  It reads, <p>
	<p><ul>
"Early childhood development is of such importance for the growth of children
to their full potential, and for the advancement of women, that it must be the
subject of a national programme involving Government, Churches,
non-governmental agencies and the general public.  Such a programme must be
mounted despite the limited financial resources available to Government." (NPA,
pg. 95)<p></ul>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	The NPA document stated clearly that there was a need for an ECD
policy.  A first step in the creation of the ECD Policy was a National
Conference on Early Childhood Protection and Development, held in May 1992.
The purpose of the Conference was to define Namibia's national policy on ECD
and outline guidelines and standards for the operation of Namibia's early
childhood programmes.  The Conference resulted in a series of recommendations
to be taken into consideration in the development of an ECD policy. In 1994 an
ECD Inter-Ministerial Task Force was created for the specific purpose of
creating a National Early Childhood Development Policy.  What follows is the
<i>National Early Childhood Development Policy.</i><p>
<p>
IV. The National Early Childhood Development Policy Framework<p>
<p>
<b>A.  Objectives</b><p>
<p><ul>
1.  To speak directly to the issue of young child development and to make the
public more aware of the situation of young children and the importance of ECD
provision. (The assumption is made that children will benefit from general
improvements in agriculture, health, employment, education, etc. This is not
necessarily the case.) <p>
<p>
2. To clarify the role of government in the provision of and support for ECD
services and indicate its commitment to the welfare of children and the future
they represent.  <p>
3.  To consolidate and systematise existing laws, programmes and activities
related to ECD for the maximum benefit of all children, particularly those in
rural areas and those living in difficult circumstances.<p>
<p>
4.  To bring together the sectors involved in early childhood programming,
providing them with a framework within which to take action, and allowing for
the coordination of efforts.<p>
<p>
5.  To clarify the roles, responsibilities and relationships between
government, non-governmental agencies, Churches, NGOs, the private sector,
communities and families for the betterment of children's lives.  <p>
<p>
6.  To mobilize and allocate resources for ECD programmes, within the
government and from others. <p>
<p>
7.  To provide guidelines and standards for those wishing to develop quality
ECD programmes.  <p></ul>
	<p>
<p>
<b>B.	The Approach</b><p>
<p>
	Through a National Early Childhood Development Committee, appointed by the
Government, the efforts of government, non-governmental agencies, Churches and
the private sector shall be coordinated to work with communities as they
develop programmes for young children. Community Activators, Community Liaison
Officers and NGOs working with communities will promote the development of
appropriate ECD programmes -- with parents, in the home, in the community and
in centre-based programmes -- with the end goal being community-based
sustainable early childhood programmes accessible to all young children and
their families, with particular emphasis being given to supporting the
development of ECD programmes in rural areas and for children living in
difficult circumstances. <p>
<p>
<b>C.	Principles Underlying This Approach</b><p>
<p>
<i>Assumptions about the role of the family and state:</i><p>
<p><ul>
1. 	<b>The primary responsibility for the support of a child's healthy growth
and development lies with the family</b>. The family is the child's first and
primary learning environment. The family provides children with critical early
experiences that are the base for later learning and functioning. Parents are
motivated to provide the best experiences possible for their children, and have
knowledge, skills and experiences that need to be built upon when creating an
early childhood programme.  <p>
2. 	<b>The state shall ensure to the maximum extent possible the survival and
development of the child.</b>  To do this the State shall provide families with
the support they need so that they can carry out their responsibilities during
the child's earliest years.  This can be accomplished through a variety of ECD
approaches, including the education of parents and/or caregivers and/or direct
care and education to the child in formal and non-formal centres, in the
neighbourhood and in the home.  It can also include enabling programmes such as
maternity and paternity leave,<p></ul>
<p>
<i>Assumptions about the role of government, non-governmental agencies, the
private sector and communities.</i><p>
<i></i><p><ul>
3.	<b>ECD provision shall be expanded through the creation of partnerships.
</b>  Neither government nor communities, nor a wide range of non-governmental
organisations, can easily maintain an effective programme without help.  The
principle of developing partnerships between government, non-governmental
agencies, the private sector and the community arises from social as well as
financial needs.   The development, management and funding of early childhood
provision is the joint responsibility of the state, regional and local
governments, the private sector, the community and parents. Collaboration is
consistent with a holistic view of the child and it will: decrease duplication
of services in some areas with other areas; assure more equitable access to ECD
programmes; and maximise the use of human and fiscal resources.<p>
<p>
4.	<b>Early Childhood Development programmes shall be developed in
collaboration with the community.  </b>Within the Government there is
increasing focus on the development of community-based programmes and the
strengthening of communities to define their own needs and develop their own
resources, thus decreasing their dependency on the State.  Specifically,
community-based programmes: build local capacity to identify needs and seek
solutions; create ownership and accountability; encourage unity and strength
within the community; enhance the probability that decisions will be
implemented and that programmes will be maintained once initial outside support
is withdrawn; and empower people to make decisions in relation to all aspects
of their lives.<p>
<p>
5.	<b>Non-governmental organisation (NGOs) have made significant contributions
to ECD programmes. Their experiences, skills and knowledge shall be maintained
and built upon. </b> The NGO community, which includes Churches and other NGOs,
has developed both appropriate delivery systems and training.  Capitalising on
the experience of these agencies will enhance the provision of ECD programmes
throughout the country. <p></ul>
		<p>
<b>D.  	Strategies</b><p>
	<p>
	Some of the following strategies relate directly to the principles of
development and learning set out previously.  Others are general programming
strategies that apply to ECD programmes as well as to other efforts.  At the
core of the strategies is the desire to mount effective and sustainable
programmes.<p>
<p><ul>
   	<b>Programmes shall be integrated in conceptualization, planning, service
delivery, evaluation and promotion.</b><p>
<p>
This strategy derives in part from the holistic nature of child development in
which physical, mental, social, emotional and spiritual dimensions of
development interact with and affect each other.  Hence, effectiveness requires
integrated attention to children.  In addition, there is a maximization of
resources when programmes are multi-dimensional, combining health, nutrition,
education and social actions.   <p>
<p>
   	<b>ECD programme models shall build on the strengths of communities.</b>
These include: traditional family units and social structure that can be
mobilised; rich traditional practices that are supportive of children's growth
and development;  parents' strong desire to provide the best for their
children; people's desire for education and knowledge; and the networks that
have been created as a result of the fact that many people belong to churches
and religious organisations.<p>
<p>
   	<b>ECD programmes shall be developed to provide equity in access.</b> While
the aim is to provide universal attention to young children, there is special
recognition of children living in conditions that put them at increased risk of
delayed or debilitated development.  This strategy recognizes the need for all
children to be supported as they grow and develop, while stressing the urgency
of attending to children living in poverty or those who are discriminated
against as a result of ethnicity.  <p>
 <p>
   	<b>Coverage shall be achieved by combining a variety of approaches rather
than developing a single national model meant to apply to all.</b>  Attention
to all the children shall be sought through a series of different programmes
responding to distinct needs.  There will not be one national programme that is
extended to all children, parents or communities.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Complementary strategies shall be developed and implemented to meet ECD
goals.</b>  ECD programmes cannot be implemented in isolation.  They shall be
part of a broader conceptual effort that addresses the needs of children from
birth through the early primary years.  Since the child's development is
affected by the environment. (the home, the community, social institutions,
legal frameworks, and a cultural ethos, a comprehensive programme to improve
child development shall function simultaneously at different levels, focusing
respectively on the child, caregivers and national institutions and policies.
Programme approaches include work with caregivers (parents, older children),
direct services to children in centres, programmes for groups of children in
homes, home visiting, changes in laws and regulations, and advocacy. (Table 5
presents a summary of eight complementary strategies that can be implemented to
achieve ECD goals.)<p>
<p>
   	<b>ECD programmes shall reflect diversity.</b>  It is not necessary for all
children to receive the same kind of early childhood services.  The actual form
the programme takes will vary depending on local and regional needs and
resources.   This strategy derives in part from the social and individual
variation in children's needs.  It is also derived from a recognition of the
cultural diversity which exists within Namibia. Programmes which respect this
diversity will necessarily differ. <p>
<p>
   	<b>An inter-generational view shall be taken and ways shall be sought to
involve children, youth and adults in ECD programmes.</b>  Programmes of early
childhood development can and should benefit parents, other caregivers and
community members as well as children.  Child care, for instance, is generally
the responsibility of various family members (older siblings and extended
family members in addition to fathers and mother). Thus ECD programmes can
focus on supporting these individuals in their caregiving task.  Further,
programmes shall take into account the needs of families as well as the needs
of children. <p>
<p>
  	<b>Systems shall be put into place to ensure quality.</b>  It is essential
that quality not be lost as a result of increasing coverage.  The argument that
efforts should be aimed at increasing supply before endeavouring to improve
quality misses the essential point that without quality costs will be incurred
later on, in schooling and by society.  <p>
<p>
Low quality programmes are ineffective, deprive children of benefits, and
represent a waste of resources.  A quality programme is appropriate to the
child's stage of development and addresses the needs of the child, while
respecting individual differences.   In seeking quality, it shall be recognized
that quality is affected by the motivation and training of programme personnel,
the physical environment, the materials used, the curriculum, and the supports
available to providers.  <p>
<p>
Quality cannot be legislated.  Setting norms and standards does not guarantee
quality.  Neither is quality defined by expenditure level. Nonetheless a
process for establishing standards (in relation to facilities, staffing,
curriculum and programme quality) and for effective monitoring shall be
established.  This shall include a clear definition of responsibility for
standards at the central, the regional and community levels. Standards shall be
complementary and consistent across the health, welfare and education sectors.
What is important is that quality be defined within the Namibian context, and
that it not identified only with high-cost pre-primary school models.<p></ul>

<p>
   	<b>Cost-effective ECD programmes shall be promoted.</b> Increasing access
is an overriding issue for ECD.  Thus there shall be an emphasis on affordable
models. The sustainability of programmes, and in particular those in remote and
isolated areas, shall be a critical factor in determining a strategy that will
increase access.  It is imperative to promote adoption of low cost programmes
to ensure maximum coverage.  This strategy recognizes the importance of using
scarce resources efficiently and effectively.  This does not mean that low-cost
programmes are necessarily the best.  If they are not effective they represent
a waste of resources. In general, strategies that stress prevention are more
cost-effective than compensatory strategies.<p>
<p>
   	<b>A Children's Trust Fund shall be established to provide funding for ECD
programmes.</b>  There is strong government support for the development and
implementation of ECD programmes.  However, philosophically and practically the
full responsibility for funding these programmes should not fall on the
Government.  To encourage multi-sector involvement in ECD a <i>National
Children's Trust Fund</i> shall be created for the purposes of supporting ECD
activities. The Trust Fund will be established in such a way that contributions
to the Trust Fund can be made by Government, national foundations/businesses,
international donors and individuals.<p>
<p>
   	<b>Monitoring, assessment and evaluation shall be incorporated into
programmes from the outset.</b>  This strategy recognizes that programmes are
only effective and sustainable when they include the capacity to analyze
strengths and weaknesses and to adjust programmes accordingly.
Assessment/evaluation processes need to be an integral part of all programmes.
This shall occur at several levels.  There shall be an assessment of the
child's developmental progress.  There shall be an evaluation of the impact of
the provision on the child's progress through school and in relation to
life-long learning.  As well as focusing on the child, there shall be an
evaluation of the ECD programme being provided and the primary system the child
is entering.  An assessment of the teacher training and support process is
critical.  And there shall be an assessment of the effectiveness of linking
parents, the community, NGOs and government for the purposes of supporting
children's development. <p>
<p>
In addition to monitoring individual programmes, it shall be necessary to
evaluate the extent to which national goals have been achieved.  The following
dimensions shall be included in a national evaluation:<p>
<p><ul>
	Number of children being served by type of ECD programme<br>
		The percentage of the 0-6 year old population that this represents<br>
	Geographic location of ECD provision<br>
	The distribution of ECD provision by socio-economic status<br>
		The impact of the programme on children, families and communities<br>
	Costs of the programme <br>
	Funding provided by: the community, parents, Churches/NGOs, government and the
private sector<br>
	Types of in-kind support provided by: the community, parents, Churches/NGOs,
government and the private sector<br>
	Qualitative assessment of programme<p></ul>
At the present time there are inadequate baseline data.  Therefore as the ECD
Policy is implemented baseline data shall be collected so that there is a
referent for on-going programme assessment.<p>
	<p>
<p>
V.  The Role and Responsibilities of Parents, the Community, the Government,
Non-governmental Organisations, and the Private Sector in ECD <p>
<p>
<b>A.	The Parents and the Community</b><p>
<p>
	In order to have a clear understanding of roles and relationships it is best
to describe how the process of developing and sustaining ECD programmes will
evolve. What follows is a brief description of the steps that shall be taken to
develop ECD programmes. <p>
<p>
1.	The creation of ECD programmes begins with parents and the community. The
community determines its needs in relation to ECD programmes.  This needs
assessment process can be facilitated by a Community Activator, Community
Liaison Officer and/or NGOs involved in the community.<p>
<p>
2.	Once the need is defined then alternative solutions to the issue will be
explored. In all cases, new initiatives shall be built on the strengths of what
already exists--whether that be traditional childrearing practices or other
programmes that are already in place. It is important to note that centre-based
programmes are not the only alternatives.<p>
<p>
	ECD programmes include efforts directed toward parents.  Parent programmes can
include such strategies as home visiting where an Early Childhood Worker (ECW)
works on a one-to-one basis with a family.  They can also include the creation
of play groups where mothers come together with their children.  While the
children are playing, discussions with the mothers can focus on child
development and all the things that parents can do to support that development,
building on the kinds of activities that mothers do with their children during
the course of the day.  Another alternative is to offer parent education
courses where parents come together on a regular basis over a period of weeks.
Each meeting focuses on a given topic.  These can either be generated by the
parents themselves or be modules from a parent education course.  In addition,
resources can be made available to parents through a toy lending library or
mobile van that moves from community to community.  In remote areas where
families are isolated, the possibility of using radio as a way of providing
parents with appropriate messages is another viable ECD alternative.<p>
<p>
	Home-based programmes are also part of ECD provision. For example, there may
only be a small number of children in the community who should be served.  This
would suggest that the best approach would be to create a home-based programme.
This might mean giving training and support to a woman in the community who is
already taking care of neighbours' children on an informal basis.   <p>
<p>
3.	Once an approach is agreed-upon a Parent Committee will be formed.  They
will determine what they as a community are able to provide. (i.e. a place for
the programme, funds gathered through reasonable parent fees, some equipment
and materials that can be constructed and/or provided by parents, contribution
to the ECW's salary, donation of food, taking care of the designated space,
etc.)  The committee will also be responsible for recruiting an Early Childhood
Worker (ECW).  The specific role of the ECW will depend on the type of ECD
provision that the community is seeking to implement.  The ECW may work only
with parents, or she may have responsibility for working with groups of
children: she may be required to work both with parents and children.  (Note:
Within the Health field there is a model that could be applied.  The ECW's role
could be structured like the Community Health Worker's (CHW) role, but with a
focus on child development and parenting.  Another alternative would be to
train the CHW to work with parents in relation to ECD concerns.) <p>
<p>
4.	Once the ECW is identified a request will be made to the Regional ECD
Committee for the ECW to receive training. Trainers within the TRC, and
Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers will be able to provide the
ECW with appropriate training, depending on how her role is defined by the
community.  ECD Officers from the Ministry of Basic Education would provide
most of the training if the ECW is working with groups of children--in any
setting.  Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers would be more
involved in the training if the ECW focuses more on parent education.<p>
<p>
5.	Upon completion of training the ECW will receive on-going supervision and
in-service training from the ECD Officers based at Teacher Resource Centres
(TRC), and from Community Activators, Community Liaison Officers and NGOs.<p>
<p>
6.	The Parent Committee might request assistance to support the on-going costs
of the programme.  With the advice of the Community Activator, Community
Liaison Officer or NGO, they can also apply for funds from the Children's Trust
Fund, or a local business, or they can apply for a 'matching grant' (i.e. the
contribution from a business, individuals and/or NGOs and government in
response to evidence of the community's commitment to the ECD programme).<p>
<p>
	In other words, the responsibility for initiating ECD programmes lies with the
community and with those who are working with communities.  The next level of
support for these groups is at the Regional level.  And at the national level
structures shall be put in place to provide guidance in the creation and
implementation of the ECD Policy.  What follows is a description of the roles
and responsibilities of government and other significant partners in this
process. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>B.  	The Role of Government</b><p>
<p>
	The Administrative Structure within Government presented in Figure 1 will be
operationalised to support implementation of the ECD Policy.<p>

<p>
	The Ministry of Home Affairs, the Ministry of the Environment and Tourism, and
the Ministry of Information will act in an Advisory Capacity to the National
ECD Committee. <p>
  <p>
	The National ECD Committee shall meet quarterly.  Sub-committees shall be
formed as required.  These will meet more often.  Over time, as the programme
becomes well established, it is anticipated that there will be less demand on
the time and energy of Committee members.  At some point in the future the
Committee will consist of only a small number of people who will play an
oversight function.  <p>
<p>
	The specific role and responsibility of the National ECD Committee shall be
to:<p>
<p><ul>
		<li>Set policy in relation to ECD provision<br>
		<li>Monitor implementation of the National ECD Policy<br>
		<li>Evaluate effectiveness and relevance of the ECD Policy<br>
		<li>Propose amendments to/changes in the ECD Policy<br>
		<li>Establish responsibility of each Ministry in policy implementation<br>
		<li>Ensure coordination of efforts among those providing ECD services<br>
		   (Government, NGOs, private providers)<br>
<li>Examine current Labour laws and legal structures in relation to 
		   support for ECD and make recommendations for changes where necessary<br>
		<li>Advocate for greater attention to the needs of young children<br>
		<li>Educate the Public in regards to the importance of ECD<p></ul>
		<p>
	The Committee will be Chaired by the Ministry of Regional and Local Government
and Housing.  The lead Ministry in the implementation of the National ECD
Policy shall be the Ministry of Regional and Local Government and Housing.  The
primary partner shall be the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture.  While
recognizing that a variety of Ministries and other organisations are key
collaborators in ECD provision, what follows is a more detailed description of
the responsibilities of the Ministry of Basic Education and Culture and the
Ministry of Regional and Local Government and Housing, as these are two key
Ministries in ECD provision.  The responsibilities of other collaborating
agencies and other sectors are presented briefly.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	2.   Ministry of Regional and Local Government and Housing (MRLGH) </b><p>
<p>
	As the lead Ministry, MRLGH shall be responsible for overseeing the
development of and be responsible for the management of programs for children
and their families from birth through age 5, or until the time a child enters
primary school.  An ECD Coordinator will be appointed and housed within the
Directorate of Community Development.  This person shall have primary
responsibility for the development of the ECD activities within MRLGH.  S/he
shall also be responsible for liaising with the ECD Coordinator within the
Ministry of Basic Education and Culture (MBEC) and with the NGO ECD
Coordinator, to assure coordination among those providing ECD services.<p>
<p>
	<i>At the national level</i>, MRLGH shall be responsible for the development
of:<p>
<p><ul>
	<li>Guidelines for the establishment of ECD programmes - the process<br>
	<li>Standards and Regulations and a procedure for monitoring compliance<br>
Process and procedures to be utilised in the registration of ECD Programmes <br>
	<li>Training of the Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers<br>
	<li>Curriculum for the Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers to use
in training community and parents<br>
	<li>Collaboration with the MBEC ECD Coordinator<br>
	<li>Collaboration with the NGO ECD Coordinator<p></ul>
<p>
	<i>At the regional level,</i> the MRLGH shall have responsibility for working
with the Regional Councils to establish and develop the capacity of a Regional
Early Childhood Committee.  This work will be done primarily through the Chief
Community Liaison Officer (CCLO).   The Chair of the Regional ECD Committee
will be elected by members of the Committee.  (One recommendation is that the
ECD Committee be chaired by the Governor.)<p>
  <p>
	Specific responsibilities of the MRLGH at the regional level include:<p>
<p><ul>
<li>Assuring that mechanisms are in place to implement National ECD policy at
regional    level<br>
	<li>Responding to requests from communities for technical and financial
assistance<br>
	<li>Raising funds for ECD programmes<br>
	<li>Application to the Children's Trust Fund on behalf of ECD programmes<br>
	<li>Action on/disbursement of funds in response to community proposals<br>
	<li>Registration of programmes/issuing licences<br>
	<li>Monitoring of ECD Programmes in terms of compliance with standards<br>
	<li>Training of Community Liaison Officers and Community Activators <br>
	<li>Maintenance of regional data-base on young children<br>
	<li>The referral of appropriate issues to the National ECD Committee<p></ul>
<p>
	<i>At the community level,</i> MRLGH will be actively involved in ECD
programmes.  Given the infrastructure currently in place and the direct work
MRLGH is doing through Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers,
they are in the best position to help stimulate and provide support to
communities interested in developing ECD programmes.  Thus they will be
actively involved in ECD activities at the local level.  Specifically they
will:<p><ul>
	<li>Conduct parent education programmes<br>
	<li>Train Parent Committees in the management of ECD programmes<br>
	<li>Work with Parent Committees to acquire resources required for the ECD
programmes<p></ul>
<p>
	Parent Committees: Roles and responsibilities. As noted, the responsibility of
the community is to define their needs and determine an appropriate course of
action in relation to those needs. Specifically they will:<p>
	<p><ul>
	<li>Define the ECD services required by the community<br>
	<li>Select an Early Childhood Worker (ECW) to provide services within the
programme<br>
	<li>Manage the programme once it is under way	<br>
	<li>Assure sustainability of the programme by seeking a broad base of support<br>
	   <ul>Alternative sources of funds include: <p>
		<li>Parent fees<br>
		<li>Identification of local supporters (small business, individuals)<br>
		<li>Support from income-generating projects<br>
		<li>In-kind support<br>
	<li>Subsidisation from government when serving populations most in need of ECD
services<br>
		<li>Application to Children's Trust Fund<p></ul></ul>
<p>
  <p>
<b>	3.  Ministry of Basic Education and Culture (MBEC)</b><p>
	<p>
	The Ministry of Basic Education and Culture shall serve children from age 6
onwards.  To facilitate the entrance of children into the primary school the
MBEC has developed a 10-week transition curriculum which will be implemented
when children enter Primary 1. The curriculum is meant to provide six-year-olds
with a pre-primary experience before they begin the Primary 1 Curriculum.  This
approach will be carefully evaluated since the implementation of this kind of
'bridging' programme has not been demonstrated as effective in other countries.
<p>
<p>
	Within the National Institute of Educational Development there shall be close
collaboration between those designing the early childhood and early primary
curricula to assure that there is a smooth transition for children as they move
from ECD programmes into the formal education system.<p>
	<p>
	<i>At the National level.</i>  An ECD Coordinator shall be appointed within
the MBEC who will have responsibility for implementation of the MBEC's
contribution to the National ECD Policy. Specifically at the national level,
the MBEC will:<p>
<p><ul>
<li>Develop curriculum guidelines for a variety of ECD programmes -- parent
education, 	home-based, centre-based -- for children 0-6 years of age<br>
<li>Create a mechanism for the certification of non-governmental training
organisations/institutes involved in early childhood training<br>
<li>Develop ECD capacity within current Teacher Resource Centres to provide
training 	in response to requests from communities<br>
	<li>Develop training guidelines<br>
	<li>Develop a Plan of Action for the provision of training<br>
	<li>Develop training materials<br>
<li>Create an accreditation system for recognition of different levels of training/
competence within the ECD field<br>
	<li>Develop criteria to be utilised by the Inspectorate in monitoring ECD
programmes<p></ul>
<p>
<p>
	<i>At the Regional level.</i> The Regional Early Childhood Development
Officers shall have primary responsibility for implementation of MBEC's
contribution to ECD at the regional level.  Housed at the Teacher Resource
Centres, the Regional ECD Officers will be responsible for: <p>
<p><ul>
	<li>Operationalising national curriculum guidelines based on regional needs<br>
	<li>Creating a mechanism for the certification of teachers based on national
			   		guidelines<br>
	<li>Monitoring/Supervising ECD programmes for quality control<br>
<li>Organising, setting up and conducting regular pre- and in-service early
childhood 	training workshops through the TRCs in their region, following the
Ministry's 	Plan of Action for in-service training<br>
<li>Conducting evaluations of each training workshop and keeping records of ECWs
attending workshops<br>
<li>Conducting regular field visits to ECWs to ensure effective quality
programmes<br>
<li>Monitoring training progress and impact, and identifying areas for
improvement<br>
<li>Setting up and maintaining the early childhood corners at the TRC<br>
	<li>Assisting the Early Childhood Workers during their visits to the TRC<br>
<li>Producing appropriate early childhood training and awareness materials in
consultation with Head Office<br>
<li>Submitting regular reports on activities/tasks carried out<br>
<li>Conducting an annual evaluation of the programme<p></ul>
<p>
	<i>At the local level.</i>  There will be no MBEC staff operating on a daily
basis at the local or community level.  However, as noted, the Regional ECD
Officer will make periodic visits to ECD programmes for the purpose of
providing supervision, on-going training and monitoring of programme
implementation.  The visits of the Regional ECD Officer will be coordinated
with the activities of the Community Activators, Community Liaison Officers and
NGOs working in the community. <p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>4.  Ministry of Health and Social Services (MOHSS)</b><p>
<p>
	The Ministry of Health and Social Services shall be responsible for all health
inputs into ECD programmes.  At the level of the National ECD Committee, the
health services that can be provided to young children and their families
through ECD programmes will be defined. An appropriate structure will be
created to assure input from MOHSS at the national, regional and local levels
in programme implementation. <p>
	<i>At the National level.</i>  The Ministry of Health and Social Services
shall be responsible for developing the guidelines used in the delivery of
health components through ECD programmes.<p>
<p>
	<i>At the Regional level.</i>  The MOHSS shall work with the Regional ECD
Officers to assure that appropriate health promotion activities are built into
the ECD curriculum.  They will also assist in training ECWs in terms of
appropriate health monitoring activities that can be undertaken within the ECD
programme.<p>
<p>
	<i>At the Local level.</i>  MOHSS shall provide periodic screening of children
in ECD programmes.  They will also work with ECWs to assure that all children
are immunised.  The Health Visitor will make periodic visits to the ECD
programmes to monitor children's health and respond to the specific needs of
the ECWs.  <p>
<p>
<b>	5.  Ministry of Finance</b><p>
<p>
	The Ministry of Finance shall play a lead role in creating a structure for the
allocation of funds to ECD programmes.  Within the Ministry of Regional and
Local Government and Housing, and within the Ministry of Basic Education and
Culture resources will be allocated to the ECD Programme.  In addition the
Ministry of Finance will provide guidance in the creation of alternative
funding strategies.  (See Section VI for a description of possible
alternatives.)   <p>
<p>
<b>	6.  Ministry of Home Affairs</b><p>
<p>
	The Ministry of Home Affairs will serve in an advisory capacity to the
National ECD Committee. They shall ensure the safety, security and protection
of young children by providing guidelines that can be used by Early Childhood
providers in their work with children and families.  <p>
<p>
<b>	7.  Ministry of the Environment and Tourism</b><p>
<p>
	The Ministry of Environment and Tourism shall serve in an advisory capacity to
the National ECD Committee.  Their role will be to ensure that young children
are made aware of environmental issues and that the environment is a safe place
for young children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. 	Non-governmental Organizations</b><p>
<p>
	Historically NGOs (churches and others) have played a significant role in the
development of ECD programmes.  They established the first kindergartens and
remain a significant provider of ECD services.  Many of the programmes they
have established have been created to meet the needs of children most in need
of early childhood provision.  The NGOs have developed alternative models of
care, most notably home-based provision and parent education programmes, thus
allowing early childhood programmes to reach a population not served by the
pre-primary classes offered by Government.  <p>
<p>
	In addition to having created a variety of ECD models, the NGOs have developed
training systems.  Initially these were created to meet their needs to staff
their own programmes.  However, as ECD programmes have been created by
communities and less well established NGOs, the NGOs with more experience have
provided training outside their own programme framework. <p>
<p>
	NGOs represent an invaluable resource in the development of policy related to
young children and in terms of implementation of quality programmes.  The NGO
community can provide appropriate training, curriculum and material development
activities, and support local early childhood programmes.  Thus they will be
active partners in the development and implementation of the National ECD
Policy.<p>
<p>
<i>	At the national level.</i>  A representative of the NGO community shall be
a member of the National ECD Committee, working with governmental agencies to
create and oversee the implementation of the ECD Policy.  An ECD Coordinator
shall be appointed who represents the NGOs supporting ECD programmes.  This
person shall work closely with the ECD Coordinators within the Ministry of
Regional and Local Government and Housing and the Ministry of Basic Education
and Culture to create national guidelines for the implementation of ECD
programmes.<p>
<p>
<i>	At the regional level.</i>  The NGOs shall link with the TRC in the
provision of training and on-going support to ECD programmes in the region.  As
noted, each TRC will be staffed with one person from MBEC responsible for ECD
coordination within the region (the ECD Officer).  Given the magnitude of
training needs within the regions, this individual will be unable to provide
the necessary pre-and in-service training that is required.  Therefore, NGOs
will be drawn upon to support the training effort. <p>
 <p>
<i>	At the local level.</i>  One of the strengths of NGOs is that they have
considerable experience working at the grassroots level.  They have developed
processes for working with communities to both define community needs and to
develop community-based solutions to problems. Thus they are an important
partner in establishing ECD programmes within communities.<p>
		<p>
	 Note: At the present time there is no national ECD Association, although some
attempts have been made to create such a body.  The creation of a National
Association should be encouraged. The association should have the
responsibility for appointing someone to the position of ECD Coordinator, to
work with the ECD Coordinator positions in MRLGH and MBEC.  In addition, the
association can play an important role in terms of advocacy and the
'professionalisation' of the field of ECD.  Good models for this exist in the
Republic of South Africa and in the USA.  Further, the <i>Early Childhood
Development Network for Africa</i> (ECDNA) has recently been formed.  Its
purpose is to share information and expertise among African ECD practitioners,
to promote ECD concerns, to share experiences, to provide a source of technical
assistance within the region, etc.  This might be a valuable resource at some
time in the future.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>D.   	Other Partners</b>	<p>
<p>
<b>	1.  The private sector</b><p>
<p>
	There are others within the country that play a significant role in supporting
ECD programmes.  This includes the private sector, foundations and
philanthropic organisations.  The private sector can contribute through
creating ECD programmes for the children of their employees.  These can either
be on-site, depending on where the business is located and the feasibility of
allocating appropriate space to the ECD programme, or they can provide vouchers
to employees who can then 'purchase' appropriate child care at a facility of
their choice.<p>
<p>
	The private sector can also contribute by 'adopting' a community and providing
finances to sustain their ECD programme(s).  They can also donate equipment to
ECD programmes, or provide food and/or materials.  Business people should be
asked to sit on the Boards of ECD programmes.  This will bring management
expertise to the enterprise and it helps raise the awareness of the public to
ECD issues.  Business people can become strong advocates for ECD provision.<p>
<p>
	Contributions will be sought from the private sector for the Children's Trust
Fund described in Section VI.<p>
<p>
<b>	2.  National Foundations</b><p>
<p>
	Historically the Rossing Foundation has been a significant contributor to ECD.
Other national foundations shall be educated as to the importance of ECD and to
the role they can play in supporting programmes for young children.
Specifically foundation support will be sought to fund innovative pilot
projects, evaluations of current ECD programmes, needs assessments within
communities, and basic research on child growth and development within Namibia,
particularly in relation to childrearing practices and how these can be built
upon in ECD programming.  Foundations will also be encouraged to contribute to
the Children's Trust Fund.<p>
<p>
<b>	3. International donors/bilateral agencies</b><p>
<p>
	There are several international organisations that have made a significant
contribution to the development of ECD programmes in Namibia.  Most noticeably
these include the Bernard van Leer Foundation and UNICEF.  These organisations
and others can continue to contribute through supporting the development of
model programmes; providing international training opportunities; providing
financial support for positions in government; supporting the development of
degree-level in-country training; enhancing the capacity of Teacher Resource
Centres, providing vehicles to facilitate transportation, and contributing to
the Children's Trust Fund.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>E.	ECD Programme Components</b><p>
<p>
	In the discussion of the administrative structure that shall be put into place
to implement the ECD policy a number of ECD programme components were noted in
terms of who would take responsibility for that component.  This has been
summarised in Table 6.  The table presents various ECD programmes components,
the Ministry or agency that will take the lead in the development of that
component, supporting agencies, related areas, and the status of the activity.
What follows is a general description of key components of ECD provision.<p>
<p>
<b>	1.  ECD Programme Infrastructure</b><p>
<p>
	As has been noted, ECD programmes can be provided in a variety of contexts--in
the home, in community centres, in church halls,  and even under trees.
Regardless of the actual location of the programme, there are a variety of
guiding principles that facilitate the setting up and management of ECD
programmes.  These <i>guidelines for the establishment of ECD programmes</i>
shall be provided to Parent Committees (in the local language) to facilitate
their task and provide them with an understanding of their responsibilities.<p>
<p>
	Another important part of the infrastructure is the establishment of
<i>standards and regulations.</i>  ECD programmes will need to meet specified
standards in order to <i>register</i>. All ECD programmes serving young
children in groups shall be required to register with the Government and
receive a licence.  While standards shall be established to assure a safe,
healthy, and secure environment for children, these shall be flexible in order
for them to be adapted to reflect regional differences.  <p>
<p>
	The development of sustainable funding for the ECD programme is an essential
part of programme infrastructure.  It will be discussed in Section VI.<p>
<p>
<b>	2.  Curriculum Guidelines</b> <p>
<p>
	ECD curriculum guidelines are required at several different levels.  At the
core of the ECD programme is the curriculum to be used with the beneficiaries
of the programme--whether that be parents or the children.  To meet the
specific needs of young children, curriculum guidelines shall be appropriate to
the developmental and learning needs of children in the various age groups
being served.  The curriculum shall take into consideration children's needs in
health, nutrition, education and psycho-social development and prepare children
both for school and lifelong learning. Further, the curriculum shall be
culturally sensitive, and prepare children for a society based on access,
equity, equality and democracy.  The curriculum shall be provided to those
working with young children and their families in the form of <i>Curriculum
Guideline for ECWs.</i>  While a more theoretical set of curriculum guidelines
has been developed for those providing training (<u>Manual for Early Child Care
and Development</u> (MBEC &amp; UNICEF, 1995)), a simplified version of these
guidelines shall be developed for practitioners.<p>
<p>
	There is also a need for <i>Curriculum Guidelines for Trainers</i>.  This
describes the subject areas that shall be included in the training of teachers
and the specification of training techniques to facilitate the training
process.  An important document already available is <u>Workshop Ideas for
Early Childhood Trainers: A Handbook</u> (MBEC, MRLGH and UNICEF, 1995).<p>
	<p>
<b>	3.  Training</b><p>
	<p>
	Training occurs at many levels.  There is the training of the individual who
actually works with children and/or parents.  It is also necessary to provide
training to the Parent Committee that has responsibility for overseeing the
operation of the ECD programme.  At the next level, there is a need to train
the Community Activators and Community Liaison Officers in how to provide
support to ECD programmes in the communities.  Those operating at the regional
level, the Chief Community Liaison Officer and the ECD Officers, need training,
and those within the national structure who take on the role of ECD Coordinator
within their respective organisations need appropriate training.  Thus an
assessment of needs in relation to job description shall be conducted and
appropriate training systems and opportunities designed to provide individuals
with the necessary skills, knowledge and competencies.<p>
<p>
	Among ECWs there is a wide variety of skills and basic levels of education.
One training package does not cater to the range of needs.  A tiered or step
training system shall be developed which caters for the needs of early
childhood workers with little or no basic education, to a mid-level training,
through to tertiary level training.  (Such a tiered training system is
described in <u>Curriculum for Pre-School Teachers Education (Early Childhood
Worker)</u>. (MEC/NIED, June 1994))<p>
<p>
	Training of Early Childhood Workers will be offered by Early Childhood
Development Officers located at Regional Teacher Resource Centres (TRC).  At
the present time 10 TRCs are operational.  ECD Officers will be available to
provide training and support to communities developing ECD programmes.  <p>
<p>
	Through a National Training of Trainers system begun in 1995, three
individuals attended a Training of Trainers Workshop in Johannesburg.  Upon
returning to the country they trained others, resulting in a cadre of trainers
within the country.  These include Early Childhood Development Officers within
MBEC and Community Liaison Officers from MRLGH.  The ECD Officers shall provide
training and support to Early Childhood Workers.  The Community Liaison
Officers provide training for Community Activators who are responsible for
training parents and mobilising communities.<p>
	<p>
	It shall also be necessary to prepare Regional Councils and the Regional ECD
Committee to carry out their responsibilities in relation to the ECD Policy.
Training shall provide them with a basic understanding of the importance of ECD
and what it means to provide programmes for children in this age group.  They
shall also be trained in programme management, providing them with the skills
necessary to be responsive to the needs of communities. <p>
<p>
	Another aspect of training is the credentialling of non-governmental
organisations providing ECD training, if they want their trainees to receive
national credentials. Thus a process for credentialling training institutions
shall be developed. Guidelines for accreditation for different levels of
training shall be developed nationally. The guidelines shall include an
analysis of the training courses being offered, staff qualifications
(experiential as well as academic), agency experience in providing the services
for which they are seeking accreditation, the adequacy of the training
facilities and the resources available to trainees.  The ECD Certificates
offered by credentialed training institutions shall be recognised nationally.
<p>
<p>
<b>	4.   Quality Assurance</b><p>
	One of the key issues within ECD provision currently is the quality of the
services being provided.  At the present time ECD programmes are so
under-resourced that they may, in fact, be unhealthy for young children.  Thus
there is a need to be assured that ECD programmes are promoting rather than
stifling or retarding children's growth and development.<p>
<p>
	The most common way to address the issue of quality is to focus on the
adequacy of the physical environment (availability of water, toilets, space,
ventilation, etc.).  These are the <i>static</i> dimensions of quality.  And
while these are important dimensions of an ECD programme, the standards set are
often unrealistic, so people are unable to register their programmes.  This
means that many ECD programmes do not have access to the training and support
that will be provided through TRCs and the work of Community Liaison Officers.
Thus, as noted above, standards shall be set that are realistic within the
prevailing context.<p>
<p>
	Quality consists of more than the static dimensions.  Also of importance are
the <i>dynamic</i> dimensions of quality. The dynamic dimensions are, in most
instances, more important than the static dimensions.  The dynamic dimensions
address the types of interaction that occur within an ECD programme--the type
of interaction that occurs between the ECW and the children; the kind of
interaction that occurs between ECWs and parents; child-to-child interaction,
etc.  If the ECW has an understanding of child development and her role in
promoting children's growth and development then the way she interacts with the
child will be significantly different from the interaction that occurs when the
ECW plays a 'teacher' role.  Quality programmes are those where the ECW creates
an environment within which children are able to become self-confident
learners. <p>
<p>
	To determine quality and whether or not the ECD programme is achieving its
goals it is necessary to institute an assessment, monitoring and evaluation
process when the programme begins.  This process should take into consideration
the conditions and needs of parents and children when the programme begins, and
create systems that provide for the collection of data over time so that
periodic reviews of progress can be made to determine programme impact. <p>

VI.   Costs/Financing<p>
<p>
<b>A. 	Costs</b><p>
<p>
	This document does not contain data on costs. This is a priority issue for the
Task Force.  A primary difficulty is that cost data are not generally
available.  These need to be generated.  A necessary next in the process is to
calculate the following costs (both in terms of cash and in-kind contributions)
at three levels: in the provision of services (ECD programme costs);
infrastructure costs at the regional level; infrastructure costs at the
national level.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	1.   Local ECD Programme Costs</b><p>
	    <p>
	Costing shall be done by type of programme (centre-based, home-based, home
visiting, parent education) and by type of supporting agency (government,
Church, NGO, private providers).  These shall also be done by region as there
are significant regional differences.  This will yield data on how much is
spent on children and/or parents in the various settings.  For each programme
the following costs shall be collected:<p>
<p><ul>
	Start-up  <br>
	<ul>	facilities (if a centre-based programmes), equipment, supplies<br>
		Staff training<br></ul>
	On-going costs<br>
	<ul>	Maintenance of the facilities<br>
		Renewable materials<br>
		Periodic replacement of equipment<br>
		Staffing costs<br>
		On-going training and supervision<br>
		Transportation<p></ul></ul>
<p>
	Given the data generated regarding the costs of ECD programmes in the various
settings, a per child/parent cost will be calculated.  In determining per
child/parents costs issues of quality shall be taken into consideration.  This
shall be balanced against what can feasibly be provided within a given context.
In other words, neither the most expensive nor the lowest cost examples of
provision will be used as the frame of reference.  <p>
<p>
	By extrapolating from the per child/parent costs, the costs of providing ECD
services to all children 0-6 will be calculated. It is neither feasible nor
desirable to provide ECD services for all children.  Instead government shall
review needs and allocate resources to ECD programmes accordingly.  Progressive
targets shall be established in relation to the percentage of the age group to
be served.  An example of such a progression is in Table 7.  However, before
setting targets data will be collected on the extent of current provision to be
used as a referent. <p>

  1-2         5%       10%       15%       20%       25%      
  2-3         6%       12%       18%       24%       30%      
  3-4        12%       24%       36%       48%       60%

 It should be noted that provision can be home- or centre- based, it can be in
non-formal as well as formal settings, and it includes parent education. <p>
<p>
<b>	2.  Regional Infrastructure Costs</b><p>
<p>
	ECD programmes require technical support.  This shall be provided through
infrastructures within the MBEC and MRLGH which are already in place.  Thus for
some tasks, current funding is sufficient.  However, there are some additional
inputs that are required to create a structure for the development of
sustainable ECD programmes.  <p>
<p>
	<i>Staff (Trainers/Supervisors)</i><p>
<p>
	    <i>MBEC - Regional ECD Education Officers (11)</i>  These are new
positions but they will be filled by people currently under contract with the
MBEC.  Thus there are no new costs associated with these positions.<p>
<p>
	    <i>MRLGH - Community Activators (60) and Community Liaison Officers
(20).</i>  These individuals are currently in government employment.  They will
receive additional training to function as key actors in the development and
support of ECD programmes.<p>
<p><ul>
<i>	Training - Pre-service</i><br>
	    <ul>Facilities<br>
	    Trainees costs (transport/per diem)	<br>
	    Materials<p></ul>
<p>
	<i>Training - In-service</i><br>
	    <ul>Facilities	<br>

<p>
<i>	Facilities</i>  Regional TRCs (ECD corner)<br>
	   <ul> Materials<br>
	    Support staff<p></ul></ul>
<p>
<b>	3.  National Infrastructure Costs</b><p>
<p>
	The responsibility at the national level is to provide the policy framework
and guidelines for ECD programmes.  There is also the responsibility of
overseeing coordination and collaboration across Ministries and with NGOs and
the private sector to assure equity and the provision of quality services.
Thus there needs to be infrastructure support at the national level.  This
includes staff who have specific responsibility for ECD, and support for
them.<p>
<p><ul>
	<i>Support costs for the Secretariat for the ECD Committee</i> <br>
	       <ul> Secretarial<br>
		Supplies<p></ul>
<p>
	<i>Staff within MBEC and MRLGH responsible for ECD</i><br>
	<ul>	<i>MRLGH - ECD Coordinator</i>, within Community Development Directorate<br>
	          This person will also serve as Secretary to the National ECD
Committee<br>
		<i>MBEC - ECD Coordinator</i><p></ul>
<p>
	    <i>Support staff	</i><br>
	    <ul>	Secretarial<br>
		Transportation<p></ul>
<p>
	<i>Training costs</i><br>
	   <ul> Staff (training of national staff in their new roles)<p></ul></ul>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	Financing</b><p>
<p>
	At the local level, the community shall be responsible for funding the ECD
programme to the extent that they are able.  This can be done through parent
fees, contributions from the organising agencies/organisation, in-kind
contributions, and seeking support from local businesses.  The MRLGH shall
provide communities with an <i>Activating Fund</i> that provides an ECD
programme with some basic equipment ( e.g. blankets, mats, utensils for the
children, chairs, etc.)  The contents of this Activating Fund will differ
depending on the needs of the ECD Programme.  In addition, the Regional ECD
Committee can apply for funds from the Children's Trust Fund.<p>
<p>
	At the National level a <i>Children's Trust Fund</i> shall be established.
Government will contribute to the fund through a special tax created for the
purpose of supporting ECD efforts.  Donor agencies will be encouraged to
contribute to the fund as well.  The National ECD Committee shall appoint the
Board of Trustees who shall be responsible for overseeing and managing the
Trust Fund.  Trustees will include members of Government, a lawyer and an
accountant.  The Board of Trustees will be responsible for developing the
criteria to be used in disbursement of the Fund and the mechanisms whereby the
funds are disbursed.  The Trustees will also monitor use of funds.  Annually
the Board will provide an audited report to the National ECD Committee on the
status of the Fund. Branches of the Children's Trust Fund shall be established
at the regional level.<p>
<p>
	Another alternative way of funding ECD is through the creation of a
quasi-governmental body whose mandate is implementation of programmes for young
children and their families.  Funds to support this body can be generated
through a national Tax on businesses/individuals.<p>
<p>
	As the idea of a Children's Trust Fund and/or taxation are explored, technical
assistance will be sought from countries who have undertaken these innovative
ways of funding ECD programmes.  (Models for the development of Trust Funds can
be found in Mauritius, and the taxation approach has been implemented in
Colombia.) <p>

<b><u>EXECUTIVE SUMMARY</u></b><p>
<p>
A three week mission was undertaken in September 1992 to assess the current
standard of early childhood provision in Nepal.  This involved meeting with
governmental and non-governmental agencies to ascertain their interest in and
commitment to implementation of programs for young children.  As a result of
the visit a set of recommendations has been made on how UNICEF might be
involved in upgrading the standard of current provision and enter into
partnership with government, donors and agencies to develop models of early
childhood provision.  <p>
<p>
Conclusions and recommendations in this report were based on discussions with
key individuals in the government.  Meetings were held with key individuals in
the Ministry of Education, Culture and Social Welfare (MOEC), including the
Curriculum, Textbooks, Supervisory Development Centre (CTSDC), and the Basic
Primary Education Project (BPEP).  Other government interviews included
discussions with the Women's Development Division (WDD) in the Ministry of
Local Development (MLD), and the Women's Training Center (WTC).  Discussions
were also held with people working in the Small Farmers Development Programme
(SFDP), and the Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) programme.  Both
international and local non-governmental agencies were also included in the
survey.  <p>
<p>
One week was spent in the field visiting a variety of programmes, from
home-based day care to child care centers, to pre-primary and primary education
classes.  Discussions were also held with personnel in UNICEF to gain a further
understanding of the history of the programmes and the parameters within which
new programmes might be developed.<p>
<p>
The findings suggest that Nepal has a rich and varied experience in early
childhood provision. These have been developed by governmental agencies and
international and local non-governmental agencies and organisations.  Models of
both home-based and centre-based programmes have been implemented, with varying
degrees of community support.  Some of these have been in place for as long as
10 years.  Some of them have already been terminated. <p>
<p>
There is an infrastructure in place which can provide support from the central
to the district to the local levels.  This is impressive.  The difficulty is
that at the present time there is a lacuna nationally in terms of intellectual
and technical support that could be provided to those who are attempting new
programmes and to those who are trying to sustain their current efforts.  If
Nepal is to maintain its current programming for young children and further
expand coverage, then aggressive action must be taken to develop appropriate
expertise within the country.   One way to do that would be for UNICEF to
implement the following recommendations:<p>
<p>
1.	Rather than contribute to individual efforts in early childhood provision,
UNICEF should support the development of human resources at the national level
that can provide technical assistance to governmental and non-governmental
agencies in the areas of curriculum development, training and related research
and evaluation.  The model developed for the training of Master Trainers in the
field of Adult Education might well be followed.<p>
<p>
2.	Current infrastructures should be supported to provide training and on-going
support to those currently providing early childhood care and education (e.g.
WDOs, WDAs, RP's)<p>
<p>
3.	Models of home-based care should be evaluated more closely in terms of
content and the quality of provision.  This is a very important model
internationally for the provision of care and education to children in isolated
rural areas.  Further experimentation with this model would be useful
nationally and internationally.<p>
<p>
4.	Non-governmental agencies (international and local) should be provided with
support in the development of community-based models of early childhood care
and development which are developed from the perspective of
self-sustainability. Organisations open for collaboration on such an effort
would be Save the Children USA and PLAN International.<p>
<p>
5.	Within current models of provision, particularly SFDP and PCRW, attempts
should be made to experiment with alternative models of funding the early
childhood components so that they can become self-sustaining.  <p>
<p>
6.	Currently there are several training systems which have been developed
nationally (the MLD has 5 training centres, WTC has 4 centres, and there is the
BPEP system).  The possibility should be explored that these centres also be
utilized for the training of early childhood personnel. <p>
<p>
7.	Strategies should be developed for working the content of early childhood
education (child development and the interaction of health, nutrition and
stimulation) into the content of current non-formal education and literacy
programmes.<p>
<p>
8.	Investments should be made in developing the capacity of local NGOs, not
only in terms of curriculum and training, but also in management and
sustainability.  Given UNDP's interest in developing the capacity of NGO's,
perhaps this could be a joint endeavor with them.<p>
<p>
9.	Several reports and commissions have recommended the development of a
national center to support early childhood care and development.  In documents
there is reference to a Pre-Primary Unit in the Ministry of Education and
Culture, a Child Study Center, and a Section for the implementation of Early
Child Education and Care (ECEC) programme within the Ministry of Education and
Culture.  In the private sector there is the Teaching Services Center. While
this is a worthy long-term goal, such a Unit/ Section placed within the MOEC or
a resource center based in an NGO should be undertaken cautiously.  Before
investing, an assessment should be made of the resources that would be required
to establish and maintain a resource centre since this is likely to be a costly
activity.  <p>
<p>
10.	It was recommended that a National Pre-Primary Council or National Board be
established for the purposes of providing direction to the Ministry of
Education in the development of its pre-primary education programme.  As a
result of this mission, it is being recommended that a <i>National Council on
Early Childhood Care and Education</i> be created which has a broader mandate.
It should work with the MOEC in the development of its pre-primary programmes
and also oversee the development of care for all children under the age of six
being provided for by both governmental and non-governmental agencies.<p>
<p>
11.	For the short term, the possibility of using volunteers trained in early
childhood provision should be considered and appropriate volunteers should be
actively recruited (e.g. VSO's and Peace Corps volunteers).<p>
<p>
12.	People in Nepal should become familiar with early childhood developments in
the region.  There are particularly strong  programmes in Thailand, India and
Sri Lanka.  Appropriate study tours should be created to maximize what can be
learned from these countries. <p>
<p>
13.	Advocacy efforts should be undertaken to promote a more widespread
understanding of the importance and value of the early years in terms of
children's later growth and development.<p>
<p>
14.	The early childhood position should be filled within UNICEF Nepal as soon
as possible in order to provide the appropriate coordination and backstopping.
The individual could be recruited from the region where there are some
individuals very experienced in early childhood care and education. <p>
<p>
15.	A linkage should be established with a reputable early childhood
organisation which could provide training and technical support over the next
five years. An example would be the High/Scope Foundation in the USA.  They
have the flexibility to design training specifically for Nepal and they have
developed a system for working with nationals to adapt the High/Scope
curriculum so that it is culturally appropriate.  Their curriculum has been
adapted for use in rural communities in Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru, and
Iraq.     <p>
<p>
<p>
A number of these recommendations can be implemented through a national
in-country training programme outlined in the Action Plan (Section IV).  Others
could be addressed by the individual in the UNICEC ECEC position.  While in the
initial stages the Action Plan will require periodic input from experts outside
the country, over a three year time period there would be a core group of
individuals in Nepal trained to continue to provide appropriate support to
those committed to investing in the lives of young children. <p>

<p>
The focus of this report is on early childhood care and development in Nepal.
Section I provides a brief introduction to Nepal. Section II provides an
overview of governmental commitment to investment in early childhood provision.
In Section III there is a review of a range of programmes currently being
provided for children under the age of 5, particularly in rural settings.
Section IV presents a set of recommendations for how these efforts might be
built upon and strengthened to increase coverage of services to the youngest
population most at risk, and discusses what UNICEF's role might be in that
process, and Section V provides an Action Plan which could be undertaken in
support of the recommendations.<p>
<p>
<b>I.  INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
The statistics on Nepal are daunting. Covering nearly 150,000 square
kilometers, Nepal has a population of approximately 18.5 million people, over
half of whom are under age 18; 43% are under the age of 14.  Thus the country
has a relatively young population.  In addition, the population is increasing
rapidly, despite a high infant mortality rate (107) and a high under five
mortality rate (165).  While the maternal mortality rate is the highest in the
region (850:100,000), Nepal also has a high fertility rate (5.8). All these
variables result in an annual growth rate of 2.08%  (Central Bureau of
Statistics, 1992)<p>
<p>
How does Nepal compare with other countries?  It has been described as one of
the poorest countries in the world.  It is one of the least developed nations
in South Asia, with a low GNP and a relatively high growth rate.  While the GNP
is only US 170, according to those in Nepal this figure is too high to
represent the reality of most people's lives.  They say it reflects the
relative wealth of a small minority.  According to the National Planning
Commission, nearly half of the population live in "absolute poverty". (1992, pg
1).  The World Bank has estimated that this is closer to 70%.<p>
<p>
Nepal is predominantly an agricultural country: 90% of the labor force is
involved in agricultural work.  This is surprising since only about 18% of the
total land area has been brought under cultivation.  The low percentage of
cultivatable land is understandable when taking into consideration the
topographical constraints. The country is divided into three regions: Mountain,
Hill and what is known as the Terai (plain).  The rugged topography
characterized by high mountains and deep valleys make many parts of the country
inaccessible.  The majority of the people live far (it can be several days
walk) from any road network.  <p>
<p>
While the Terai, covers a third of Nepal, it contains 57% of the total
cultivated land.  The distribution of the population parallels the availability
of cultivated land.  Only 8.7% of the population lives in the Mountain areas,
47.7 in the Hill area, and 43.6 % on the Terai. (Central Bureau of statistics,
1992, pg 4) <p>
<p>
The country contains a variety of ethnic and cultural groups.  While Nepali is
the official language, only about 58% of the people have Nepali as their mother
tongue.  Other prominent languages include Maithili (11%) and Bhojpuri (8%).
Somewhat less representative are Tharu (4%), Tamang (3%) and Newar (3%).
(Central Bureau of statistics, 1992, pg 3)  There are other languages as well,
but they are the mother tongue of less than 3% of the population.  <p>
<p>
While the official religion is Hindu, and about 90% of the population would be
classified as such, it is not the Hinduism of India.  The Hinduism of Nepal has
incorporated many of the rituals and practices prevalent before Hindus arrived
in Nepal, but Hinduism has introduced a caste system that has been imposed on
traditional ethnic cultures, making for a unique mix of beliefs and
practices.<p>
<p>
While most agree that the great majority of the population is still illiterate,
there is no agreement on the actual percentages.  The Central Bureau of
statistics (1992, pg. 5) state that the literacy rate was 23.3% in 1981, and
was estimated to be 35% in 1988.  But this gross estimate masks regional and
gender differences.  UNICEF documents describing the conditions in specific
areas help illuminate the situation.  In the Birathnagar district it is
estimated that only 18% of the women are literate compared with 74% of the men.
(Dhungana, 1990, pg 33)  In Lalitpur, the percentages are 13.5% for women and
52.6% for men.  The urban average is 37.45% for women and 62% for men.
(Presern, 1990 , pg. 46)  Regardless of who is quoted as a source on statistics
related to literacy, the data are powerful in indicating the overall lack of
literacy, and the disproportionate illiteracy among women.<p>
<p>
The situation for children is harsh.  The high dependence on agricultural
production requires intensive labor.  Much of this labor is provided by
children. A Nepali child between the ages of 6 and 9 will work 3 hours a day,
those between 10 and 14 work from 5 to 6 hours a day.  Girls work about twice
as many hours as boys. While legally girls cannot marry before age 16, it is
estimated that 22% of the girls are married before age 13, and 50% by age 16.
(Master Plan of Operations, 1992, pg. 3)<p>
<p>
Given the demographics it is not surprising that Nepal has the lowest school
completion rate in the region (27%)  (National Planning Commission, 1992, pg 3)
 The education system has been undergoing rapid change, yet the government is
being pushed to the limits in terms of providing the additional support
required to increase coverage and to assure quality education.  In 1987 about
40% of the primary school teachers were untrained, and that percentage remains
unchanged. (Educational Statistics of Nepal, 1990, pg.1)<p>
<p>
That is the context within which UNICEF and others are operating. <p>
One would expect that within this context there would be little or no
experience or interest in what happens to young children before they enter
primary school.  But that is precisely what makes Nepal such an interesting
country.  When one begins to delve into early childhood care and education --
in terms of what is being provided by the government and non-governmental
agencies -- there is a rich variety of early childhood offerings.  Many of
these efforts, particularly those developed through donor-supported rural
development projects, go back almost 10 years.  In addition there are a great
variety of private pre-schools which have been developed by individual
entrepreneurs in urban settings.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>II. THE POLITICAL WILL</b><p>
<p>
Within Nepal, in the government, donor and non-governmental community, there is
emphasis being given to early childhood provision.  As will be seen from the
discussion of individual efforts which follows, a range of interesting early
childhood initiatives has been developed during the past 10 years.  While many
of these were fairly isolated efforts, there is interest now in bringing them
together to learn from one another.<p>
<p>
A major impetus has been given to programmes in early childhood as a result of
the Education for All (EFA) conference in Jomtien Thailand in 1990.  There
early childhood education was put on the agenda and incorporated as an integral
part of Basic Education.  This has provided the policy framework within which
governments and donor agencies are able to make arguments for increased
investment in the early years.<p>
<p>
Within the <u>Master Plan of Operations 1992-1996</u> which presents the
country programme of cooperation between the government of Nepal and UNICEF
there are numerous references to the importance of investment in early
childhood provision. In that document it is stated:<p>
<p>
The obligation to protect a child's human right to develop to her full
potential is the most fundamental reason to invest in a programme which
enhances early childhood development.  Also, early childhood education lays the
foundation for successful transition to the often alien and difficult world of
the formal schools. (1992, pg.55)<p>
<p>
It goes on to state that the education programme being promoted through this
cooperative agreement, "seeks to lay a sound basis for expanding early
childhood care and education services in the country whereby parents and
communities are able to prepare children for learning and entry to school
(1992, pg. 56)  Thus there is a clear mandate and intention to invest in early
childhood provision.<p>
<p>
But how does a country as poor as Nepal enact such a plan?  The strategy being
developed is one which puts increasing emphasis on the role of the parents and
community in both the development and on-going support of appropriate early
childhood programmes.  In Figure 1 there is a representation of what is called
the <i>Strategic Triangle Empowering the Family</i> taken from the <u>Master
Plan of Operation </u>(1992, pg. 8).  In the figure there is an attempt to show
that the greatest power comes from the community itself, with support from the
agencies and organisations at the upper part of the triangle.<p>
<p>
What is impressive is to see the number of organisations (private and public)
that have developed strong infrastructures which begin at the grassroots level
and which then have supportive mechanisms all the way to the central level.
The focus on organising the community to meet its own needs is certainly well
established in Nepal.  This is one of the real strengths that can be built upon
in further promotion of early childhood programmes.<p>
<p>
In the <u>Master Plan of Operations</u> there is a discussion of the strategy
that will be used to build on this strong community base.<p>
<p>
Communities that want to establish Early Childhood Care/Education Centres will
provide most of the local requirements including the building, a locally
selected and remunerated child care worker and costs of upkeep.  The Ministry
of Education, other governmental offices, projects and NGO's will encourage and
support the communities in their efforts. (1992, pg. 68)<p>
<p>
In other words, the governmental and non-governmental agencies will provide the
technical inputs in communities that are willing and able to undertake the
costs of operating centres.  The question being raised is how to do this well.
In order to help answer that question it is important to have an understanding
of what is currently being provided, and the strengths and weaknesses which
current efforts demonstrate.<p>

<b>III.  DEVELOPMENTS: A BRIEF REVIEW</b><p>
<p>
In preparation for the visit to Nepal, a number of articles on programs in
Nepal were reviewed, there were conversations with people who had experience
working in the country, meetings with nationals studying abroad, and
discussions with UNICEF New York.  This was done in order to understand early
childhood programming developments in Nepal.  The variety of initiatives that
have been undertaken over the years is impressive, as is the range of
organisations that have been involved in early childhood provision. (For a
guide to the various acronyms which will be used, see Annex A.)<p>
 <p>
Upon arrival in the country, visits were made to NGOs and governmental agencies
that have historically been involved in provision of care and/or education for
children under the age of 5. This was done in an attempt to identify what
currently exists--the accomplishments, problems and the strengths.  (For the
itinerary of the visit refer to Annex B.)  While there are a variety of
interesting models that have been created, many of these programs have either
ended or are on the brink of collapsing.<b>[1]</b>
<p>
<p>
The interventions which have been developed in Nepal tend to fall into two
distinct groups: those which cater to children from birth to three years of
age, and those which provide for the 3-5 year old--commonly considered the
"pre-school" child.  At age 6 the children in Nepal enter the primary school
system.  Table 1 presents an overview of current provision.<p>
<p>
Programmes for children in the birth to 3 age group have been developed in
conjunction with community development and women's programmes, where the
primary objective has been to alleviate women's <i>reproductive</i> role in
order for them to be engaged in more <i>productive</i> activities. When such
projects are a part of government programming they are likely to be found
within the Ministry of Local Development (MLD), under the Women's Development
Division (WDD).<p>
<p>
Children in the 3-5 age range are more likely to be catered to by the MOEC.
However, until recently this age group has not been recognized formally as part
of the education system.  <p>

*   We obtained 2 different numbers in relation to how many centres were in
operation.  This programme is going to end in 1992.  It is unclear what will
happen to the child care centres.<p>
**  Two different numbers were provided.<p>
*** The <i>Bal Mandir</i> schools frequently contain Nursery, Lower Kdg, and
Upper Kdg. classes for children 3, 4 and 5 years of age.<p>
<p>
Before proceeding much further it is important to define some terms.  In
conversations and in the literature people use the terms <i>early childhood
education, pre-school education, pre-primary education, early childhood care
and development, early childhood care and education, early childhood
development</i>.  These terms mean different things to different people.  While
research and experience would suggest that the term <b>early childhood care and
development</b> best represents an understanding of the needs of young children
(in terms of a continuity of provision and an emphasis on an integrated,
cross-sectoral approach to programming for young children), this phrase is not
commonly used in Nepal.  For the purposes of describing current activities for
young children in Nepal, the two most common terms used locally are defined
below.  These are used as the framework for categorising programmes in Nepal.<p>
<p>
<b>Early Childhood Education</b>.  In Nepal this stands for pre-school and
pre-primary education.  In the most conservative definition, it means the
provision of education within the formal education system for children at age
five.  Some people would also include the three- and four-year-old, but this is
not common.<p>
<p>
Pre-school education has been developed most fully by the private sector, most
commonly by individuals who have created pre-schools for children in urban
areas.  <p>
<p>
More recently, however, the development of pre-school education by the
government has been prompted by the fact that the government has begun to
acknowledge and address a phenomenon which has been going on for several years.
In grade 1, which is meant to provide education to six-year-olds, there are
frequently children ages 3, 4 and 5 as well.  This is the result of six year
old children bringing younger brothers and sisters along with them to school.
If they did not, the six year old would have to stay home and take care of
these children. The result is that grade 1 may have over 100 children in it,
although less than half of this number is the correct age to enter school.  It
is estimated that 30-40% of those who attend grade 1 are less than 6 years old.
(Action Plan, pg.1)<p>
The attendance of younger children in grade 1 is one of the factors
contributing to the very high <i>repeater</i> rate between grades 1 and 2.  In
fact the younger children have not needed to <i>repeat</i> grade 1, they are
simply a year older and now the right age for grade 1.  The age-appropriate
cohort moves on to grade 2.<p>
<p>
There is now a recognition of the fact that the youngest children in grade 1
should be catered for separately in a pre-school class, more commonly known as
the <b><i>Shishu</i></b> class.  Experimental pre-schools have been developed
in the governmental sector through the Basic Primary Education Project.  <p>
<p>
<b>Early Childhood Care and Education/Development</b>.  These terms are
generally used to refer to programmes for children under the age of three.
These programmes are not under the MOEC.  Rather, they tend to have been
developed in connection with other programmes operating in a given setting,
primarily those related to women and development efforts.  While it might be
imagined that these programmes focus primarily on care, in fact, where they
exist, they clearly have an educational as well as care component.  There is
also an emphasis on health and nutrition.<p>
<p>
Within the governmental sector these programmes are being offered as part of
the Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW) and the Small Farmers Development
Programme (SFDP), both being offered through the Ministry of Local Development,
under the Women's Development Division.  In the international non-governmental
community, programmes for children under 3 are being developed by Save the
Children USA.  There is also a newly evolving NGO, Shreejana Vikas Kendra,
which has developed a child care programme that was an outgrowth of work with
women in carpet factories.  These and other efforts are described in more
detail in the section which follows.  <p>
<p>
<b>A.  Project Review</b><p>
<p>
In this section there is a brief summary of the current level of provision of
the organisations visited and interviewed, followed by a definition of some of
the challenges currently being faced by the organisation and an assessment of
the potential strengths of the activities currently being undertaken.  Given
that the consultancy was only three weeks in duration, there may well be
inaccuracies in the presentation. <p>
<p>
<b>1. Governmental organisations/agencies</b><p>
<p>
<b>	a. Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC).  </b>Within its mandate, as
defined by the National Education Commission, the MOEC is to make provision for
pre-primary children (ages 4 &amp; 5).  At the present time the focus is on
provision for children age five.  MOEC is projecting the implementation of a
pre-primary classroom at every primary school by the year 2000.  However, this
is an unrealistic projection as it would require opening more than 3000 centers
and training more than 3000 teachers each year for the next 10 years. At the
present time the country lacks the capacity to undertake this kind of massive
expansion.<p>
<p>
Given constraints within the government, the MOEC is saying that the provision
of pre-primary education should be a shared responsibility.  The community
should provide the classroom and the teacher's salary and the MOEC will provide
materials, training and supervision.  This seems like a very sound approach.
At the present time nothing is being done to obtain these objectives.  This is
partially due to lack of financial resources, but more importantly, it has to
do with a lack of personnel with an understanding of how one would proceed to
get this kind of community/government collaboration underway. <p>
<p>
Within the MOEC there are two groups that are doing some work to meet the
government's commitment for pre-primary children.  These are the Curriculum
Textbooks and Supervision Development Center (CTSDC) and the Basic Primary
Education Project (BPEP)<p>
<p>
<b>1.  Curriculum, Textbooks and Supervision Development Centre (CTSDC)</b>.
This unit is responsible for the development of curriculum, textbooks and
supervisory systems, as its name implies.  It is this group that could develop
pre-primary education curriculum and materials.  Already it has been proposed
that a pre-primary unit be established at CTSDC.  Currently there is a person
at CTSDC who has been given responsibility for the pre-primary activities, but
in reality she is pulled in other directions and little has been created.  She
has offered a few training sessions for people operating pre-schools in the
private sector, but has not really devoted time and energy to focusing on
developing pre-primary education for the government schools.  <p>
<p>
<b>2. Basic Primary Education Project (BPEP)</b>.  The BPEP project, an
outgrowth of a Primary Education Project (PEP) (developed in 1982 and
implemented until earlier this year), is currently receiving support from
UNICEF, World Bank, DANIDA, UNDP and Japanese AID.  The BPEP project was set up
to create an innovative curriculum, teacher training and teacher support
process for the primary grades.  It is operating on a experimental basis in
several districts.  Within three BPEP schools we visited near Surkhet, the
Headmaster had taken the initiative to set up a separate classroom for the
under-aged children known as the <i>Shishu</i> class.  Teachers from the
primary school have been shifted to teach this class and given some very
rudimentary training by the Resource People (RP) at the district level to work
with these younger children.  Several of the national-level staff within the
BPEP project have shown an interest in developing a solid programme for the
<i>Shishu</i> class, but at the present time the BPEP Unit does not have a
mandate to proceed with curriculum development and training for this age
group.<p>
<p>
<u>The challenges</u>:  There are many for the MOEC.  While there is  political
will to invest in early childhood programming, there is a serious lack of
resources.  Further, curriculum development and the creation of the necessary
accompanying training and support schemes, have not been undertaken.  If CTSDC
were to become the home of pre-primary curriculum and training activities, it
would need to be strengthened considerably.  On the other hand, if BPEP were to
be given the responsibility for pre-primary education, then there would be the
issue of incorporating the pre-primary efforts into regular government
provision.  Currently BPEP remains a "project"; it has not been incorporated
into the MOEC as a "programme".  <p>
<p>
Another issue is the fact that currently the MOEC is defining pre-primary
education as the provision of education only for five-year- olds.  Given the
current pattern of attendance in grade 1, there is going to be a need to
address what happens for three- and four-year-olds as well.    <p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  BPEP staff, with appropriate support and training could
undertake to develop the pre-primary component.  They have the infrastructural
support systems required to provide training and on-going support for teachers
if they could develop the curriculum and appropriate training.  Further, there
is considerable staff interest within BPEP to undertake such a project.  This
same interest was not evident in CTSDC.<p>
<p>
<b>	b. Agricultural Development Bank - Small Farmers Development Programme
(SFDP)</b>  SFDP was created in 1975 and is operated by the Agricultural
Development Bank, with financial support from the Asian development Bank and
UNICEF.  The purpose of SFDP is to provide groups of small farmers with credit,
technology and the skills necessary to improve their agricultural production.
The community development process utilized in the project also includes
education, health, family planning and nutrition components.<p>
<p>
UNICEF began providing support to SFDP in 1981, with the specific mandate to
introduce basic services.  These have included  literacy, water, sanitation,
improvements of educational facilities, kitchen gardening and the introduction
of child care centers.  Currently there are 45 child care centers operating
within this project.  The teachers and assistants (<i>Sevikas)</i> are paid by
the project.  The community provides the space and food for the children.<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenges</u>:    In 1987 there was a review of the overall effort.  At
that point it was recommended that a national center for early childhood
education be created.  The MOEC was not willing/able to take this on, so UNICEF
did not pursue this recommendation.  Also as a result of the review UNICEF
encouraged community take-over of the child care centers.  This has not
happened.  Thus when there was a request for funds from UNICEF to expand the
system, UNICEF said no.  <p>
<p>
At the present time UNICEF is considering phasing out the child care centers.
This is primarily because UNICEF does not feel SFDP is able to provide the
necessary technical support to keep the centers operational.  In addition, SFDP
is finding it difficult to make these centers self-sustainable (i.e. have the
communities take them over completely).  One of the reasons is that the
teachers' salaries are extremely high compared to the salaries of teachers in
comparable programmes. <b>[2]</b>  The community
cannot afford to take over these salaries and they have not been provided with
technical assistance in the development of alternative ways of supporting the
centers.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  There is an excellent infrastructure in place that has
led to the development of a very viable system of child care. There are WGOs
(Women Group Organisers) who see the importance of continuing to promote early
child care provision, and mothers clearly have benefitted from these centers.
The challenge is to work with the communities to develop alternative ways of
sustaining the programme, through the creation of income-generating activities
to support the child care center, restructuring salaries so that they are in
line with local resources, not established in relation to national norms, etc.
<p>
<p>
<b>	3.  Ministry of Local Development (MLD)- Production Credit For Rural Women
(PCRW)</b>.  While the Ministry of Local Development does not have a mandate to
develop programmes for children below primary school age, through a major
development effort within the Women's Development Division (WDD) they are
involved in early childhood provision.  As a result of the Production Credit
for Rural Women (PCRW) project, there is now considerable expertise within the
WDD in relation to early childhood provision.<p>
 <p>
PCRW was begun in 1982 as a joint project between the Ministry of Local
Development (MLD) and UNICEF.  Within the MLD, the Women's Development Division
(WDD) has taken primary responsibility for project implementation.  While
similar in structure and process to the SFDP project, the focus is on women.
PCRW is the only large-scale national programme specifically directed toward
meeting the needs of rural women.  The project seeks to make small scale credit
available to women for agricultural production, livestock, and cottage
industries.  This work is facilitated by Women Development Officers (WDOs) and
Women Development Assistants (WDAs).<p>
<p>
This highly successful programme has received considerable recognition
internationally and currently receives support from a variety of donors
agencies, including UNICEF, USAID, UNDP, CIDA, GTZ, EEC and the Netherlands, as
well as from the Nepalese government.  <p>
<p>
Within this programme two forms of child care have been developed.  One is a
home-based system of child care for children under age 3 (widely known
internationally as Project Entry Point).  Within the programme 6 to 8 women
with young children form a child care group.  These women are given a four day
training in their village and then they rotate responsibility for taking care
of the children.   In some sites permanent rooms have been made available and
the mothers rotate.  In other villages the children rotate from one home to
another, depending on which mother is responsible for the children on a given
day.  A tin box of materials is given to the community and it is rotated with
the mothers.  At the present time PCRW is operating 22 home-based child care
centers.<p>
<p>
The second model of provision is more formal child cares centers for children
from 3-5 years of age.  Here, as in the SFDP programme, teachers and
<i>Sevikas</i> are paid by the project, with the community providing the
building and some food for the programme.  The salaries within the PCRW project
are lower (Rs. 700/teacher/ month and Rs 500/<i>sevika</i>/month.  However,
even this amount is too much for the community to support.  There are 90 of
these child care centers currently operating.<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenge</u>:  At the present time both of the child care models are
viewed primarily as a way of relieving women's work.  There is little
understanding of the ways in which the programmes can support children's
development.  What both the home-based and the center-based programme require
is technical support, in the form of additional curriculum inputs and on-going
training and supervision.  Some of these centers have been operational for 8-9
years.  The teachers were given training before they began their work and they
were provided with a set of materials.  They have received little or no
technical support since then.  They are ready for more training, but it is not
being provided.<p>
<p>
Within the home-based programme the services are essentially self-sustaining,
but the mothers/teachers need additional technical support in terms of
curriculum.  The challenge for the child care centers is the same one being
faced by SFDP, and that is that the centers are not moving toward
self-sustainability.  This is understandable given that they were not set up
with self-sustainability as a goal.  Now programme staff are pushing
communities to take on total responsibility for the centers.  The communities
are used to receiving the services; it is difficult to now change the structure
of the project.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  Both the home-based and the center-based models of
provision developed by PCRW are extremely valuable in the rural context,
particularly the home-based option.  This should be capitalised upon and
expanded, both in terms of geographic coverage and in terms of making the
programme available to children up to the age of five, if there is no
possibility for the child to attend a child care center.  The more informal
nature of the home-based programme makes it less costly to operate, but it does
require higher levels of technical support than is now being provided. <p>
	<p>
The field-based network of WDOs and WDAs provides an infrastructure already in
place that is extremely valuable.  These individuals could be trained to
provide training and on-going technical support to both the home-based and
center-based programmes.<p>
<p>
The Women's Training Center was established to provide support to the WDD in
terms of the work of the WDOs and WDAs.  At the present time the early
childhood training offered through this organisation is very weak. However,
with some technical support this organisation could be utilized as the vehicle
for on-going training within the PCRW system and they could offer training to
other governmental and non-governmental agencies as well.<p>
<p>
<b>2. Semi-governmental organisations</b><p>
<p>
<b>	a. National Children's Organisation.  </b>This group has a long history in
Nepal. Originally it was under the patronage of the Queen and was devoted to
the creation of orphanages and the development of care for under-privileged and
handicapped children.  The NCO centers which were created are known as <i>Bal
Mandirs</i>.  Because of the Queen's involvement there was a stability to the
organisation and an assurance of funding.  Since democracy that has changed.
The National Children's Organisation has become an NGO and no longer has the
necessary funds to continue its extensive programming.  <p>
<p>
Currently, in addition to operating several orphanages NCO supports <i>Bal
Mandirs</i> in the largest urban area in each of the 75 districts.  These
consist of primary schools, beginning with pre-primary classes in some cases.
(The most developed schools have nursery, Lower Kdg, and Higher Kdg. classes.)
While <i>Bal Mandirs</i> were initially designed to serve the poorest children,
due to economic necessity these schools are now charging relatively high fees
(in Pokhara this was Rs 85/mo for the 3 pre-primary years (nursery, lower KG
and Upper KG), and Rs 65/mo for the primary school).  Thus these schools now
serve a much more middle-class population.   <p>
<p>
In an attempt to bring their programme more in line with their original
purpose, NCO, with support from UNDP, has undertaken a pilot project which
involves the creation of community centers in five semi-urban settings (serving
2000-5000 families each).  Known as the Child Welfare Through Community
Development (CWTCD) project, it is designed to evolve in each setting, based on
local needs.  It was envisioned that the centers would develop income-
generating activities, early childhood centers, programmes for youths, literacy
classes, etc.  In the design it is the income-generating activities that are to
eventually make the centers self-sustaining.  This has happened in Pokhara
where there is a fisheries project. In the other four centers the
income-generating projects (goat keeping and wool refining) have not been as
successful. (It was unclear how many of these sites actually have a child care
programme.)<p>
<p>
Originally CWTCD was a 2-year project, but it has been extended for a
additional year and an evaluation is being undertaken.  If it appears to have
some potential, it is likely that UNDP will continue funding and expansion of
the effort.  <p>
<p>
At the present time the staff of the NCO are in the process of re-grouping.
They would like to undertake an extensive evaluation of their entire system and
then restructure it to more appropriately meet the needs it was originally
designed to serve. (UNDP and UNICEF have been requested to assist in this
effort.)<p>
<p>
<u>The challenges</u>:  Currently the organisation is struggling to survive.
(They receive approximately 20-25% of their funding from the government.) The
current structure is cumbersome and the <i>Bal Mandirs</i> are not serving the
population they were designed to serve. It will take some time and considerable
resources to restore NCO to a position where it can operate effectively.<p>
<u></u><p>
<u>The potential</u>:  NCO has a well established system of schools operating
in all 75 districts of the country.  There is no other organisation that has
such a wide-spread infrastructure, covering all the districts.  Since the
<i>Bal Mandirs</i> are located in the largest urban area in the district, NCO
has the potential to reach a large number of children.<p>
<p>
<b>	b.  Research Centre for Educational Innovation and Devlopment (CERID). </b>
While not strictly an implementing agency, the Research Centre for Educational
Innovation and Development is currently undertaking a community-based action
research project in 3 districts, with one center being developed in each of the
three topological areas (Mountain, Hill and Terai).  CERID has been interested
in early childhood provision since the early 80's.  In 1982 they undertook a
survey of early childhood provision in the country.  From the study they
concluded that what was being provided, mainly by private entrepreneurs in
Kathmandu Valley, was highly academic and that the concept of early childhood
care and development, in its broadest sense, was poorly understood.  <p>
<p>
With funding from IDRC, CERID is currently undertaking an action-research
project that will include an extensive baseline survey, followed by the
implementation of a community-based early childhood project focusing on the
development of children between the ages of three and five.  The total project
will take three years.<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenges</u>:  The structure of the model of provision being
implemented in the action-research project is one already implemented in Nepal,
where there have been difficulties in sustainability.  The project is building
the center and providing the salary for the teacher/facilitator and
<i>Sevika</i>.  They are implementing the current "curriculum" and utilizing
Seto Gurans (described below) for the training the teachers.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  This is an attempt to really understand the impact of
early provision for children ages 3-5.  The baseline study promises to generate
some very interesting data on the status of young children in the different
project villages.  Dr. Joshi, Director of the Project, is committed to early
childhood education and is an important advocate for increased government
investment in care and development for young children. <p>
<b>3. International non-governmental organisations</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b> 	a.  Save the Children USA</b>.  Save the Children USA has shown
considerable interest in developing child care provision.  A primary focus of
their work has been on the development of women's groups.  In their work they
see a progression of working within a community.  They begin with literacy
training.  This frequently leads to the creation of women's groups that then
turn their attention to a variety of community needs, one of which is child
care.  At the present time SCF USA is working with more than 60 women's groups.
One of these groups has developed a home day care.  Another group has visited
the day care programme and is interested in also starting their own.  Rather
than encouraging rapid expansion of the home-based child care model to other
women's groups, SCF wants to be sure that these groups have the right kind of
training and technical support and that, from the beginning, they are
structured to become self-sustaining.<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenge</u>:  At this point SCF USA has little experience in the
implementation of child care programmes.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  There is enormous potential within this organisation in
terms of the future development of early childhood provision in Nepal.  They
are an international partner that has considerable credibility in the country,
given their work to date.<p>
The organisation has made a commitment nationally and internationally to the
development of appropriate child care systems.  They are open to working with
government and other NGO's to develop appropriate models, curriculum and
training systems.  <p>
<p>
<b>	b.  PLAN International. </b>PLAN International is currently operating in 41
villages.  Within the villages they do fairly extensive family surveys to
assess needs and then develop programmes appropriately.<p>
<p>
Over the past several years they have developed 40 pre-school centers for 3-5
year olds.  The pre-school programme (now about 3 years old in some villages),
has evolved out of other activities PLAN is doing in communities.  <p>
<p>
From the beginning PLAN has been concerned about sustainability. What they are
attempting to implement is a child care center in collaboration with the
community.  The community provides the space and 'tiffin' (snack) for the
children.  The first year PLAN pays the teacher's and sevika's salaries (Rs.
700 and Rs 500, respectively). In subsequent years the proportion paid by PLAN
decreases as the amount paid by the community increases.  (This has just begun
so it is not possible to know if it will work.)  PLAN also provides some
educational materials for the centers.<p>
<p>
As a result of their experience, PLAN have concluded that rather than beginning
a child care center immediately upon entering the village, programming should
start with adult literacy.  PLAN sees the importance of then integrating the
literacy efforts with child care, nutrition, health and income-generating
activities.  At the present time they are developing income-generating
activities to support the child care center, and they have developed a linkage
programme connecting the pre-primary school with the primary schools in the
area.  <p>
  <p>
<u>The potential</u>:  Like SCF USA, PLAN is moving slowly in a very systematic
way.  They are interested in developing approaches and evaluating them
carefully before they move on full-scale.  They could be a good group to
include in the development and testing of a self-sustaining community-based
model and a national curriculum.  They appear to be willing to work with others
on these issues.  They, like Save the Children USA, have a good reputation in
the country and are a very viable partner in the future development of early
childhood efforts in Nepal.<p>
<p>
<b>	c. Redd Barna.  </b>This international NGO has been involved in a range of
community-based initiatives.  They have a well-developed system of home-based
child care programmes (currently 47 in number) and they have developed 5 child
care centers as well.  The model of provision is based on the programme
developed within PCRW. Teachers for these programmes receive training from Seto
Gurans.<p>
<p>
Redd Barna also has an extensive Child-to-Child programme involving some 2,000
children in a community programme focused on increasing health awareness and
improving the quality of care for younger children and the community.
Child-to-Child operates through community organisers and is not linked with the
formal school system.<p>
<p>
Another activity of Redd Barna is what is known as the Cheli-Beti programmes
for out-of-school girls.  The programme is an attempt to provide girls with
primary education, utilizing a non-formal methodology.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  This international NGO is highly respected in Nepal and
has both the resources and flexibility to experiment with models of provision.
They should be brought into any effort to develop national models of provision
that are self-sustainable. They also have a weekly radio programme (Hatimalo -
Hand-to-Hand) which is developed by and for children.  In the programme they
use dramas, songs, stories, etc. to convey a range of messages.  This could be
a very useful vehicle in the promotion of an understanding of child growth and
development and the importance of the early years to later growth and
development. <p>
<p>
<b>4. National non-governmental organisations</b><p>
<p>
<b>	a.  Seto Gurans.  </b>Seto Gurans was begun by Agatha Thapa, a woman who
has been involved in early childhood programming in Nepal for many years.
Having received training in Israel in early childhood provision, Mrs. Thapa
developed a curriculum and continues to develop materials for pre-school age
children. With support from UNICEF, Seto Gurans, the NGO created by Mrs Thapa,
became a major training resource within Nepal during the 80's, providing
training to the PCRW and SFDP programmes and to the majority of the
non-governmental agencies establishing programmes for young children.<p>
<p>
In 1988-89 UNICEF's core support for Seto Gurans came to an end. While UNICEF
continued to buy training from Seto Gurans, the lack of core support has made
Seto Gurans' survival tenuous.  <p>
<p>
In addition, the Women's Training Center was established.  Trainers from this
center, who were trained by Seto Gurans, established their own training
services.  The Women's Development Division, once a recipient of Seto Gurans
training, now receives training from the Women's Training Center rather than
from Seto Gurans.  Thus WDD, the group operating the largest early childhood
programme through PCRW, and thus the greatest purchaser of training services,
no longer requires training from Seto Gurans.  While WDD was not Seto Gurans'
only customer, it was a major contributor to the on-going support of the
training unit. <p>
<p>
At the present time, there does not appear to be a systematic approach to
training.  While an extensive examination of the training was not conducted, it
would appear that training packages are put together based on the time the
receiving agency feels it can allocate to training rather than the needs of the
trainees.  <p>
<p>
In essence, since 1990 Seto Gurans has declined considerably, both in terms of
its ability to perform and in terms of its reputation within Nepal.<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenge</u>:  Seto Gurans was supported almost exclusively by UNICEF
when it began.  During the time that UNICEF was providing core funding Seto
Gurans was not encouraged to seek other sources of support.  When UNICEF monies
ceased, Mrs Thapa lacked the appropriate skills and experience to seek
alternative funding.  Key staff left the organisation as funds decreased, and
while materials continue to be developed, there is a lack of on-going
curriculum development and the quality of the training has declined.  There is
also a lack of management capability within the organisation.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  Within Seto Gurans there is a wealth of experience that
could be utilized.  Seto Gurans is particularly strong in the development of
materials.  They could be a rich resource in the development of appropriate
play and learning materials for pre-school programmes.  This is one of the few
NGO's in Nepal that has a history of working with young children.  Explorations
should be made as to the viability of trying to revive this organisation.<p>
<p>
<b>	b.  Nepal Women's Association</b>.  Although relatively new in formation,
this group has a strong network of members throughout the country, and focus on
promoting the concerns of women.  They are seeking ways to go beyond advocacy
and awareness-raising.  They would like to develop projects for women but lack
the necessary skills to put viable projects together.  For example, they
applied to UNICEF to establish a revolving loan fund for women, but the project
was not well-enough conceived to warrant funding.  <p>
<p>
They are concerned about the conditions of women and children in carpet
factories, and would like to develop a project for them.  They operated 2
creche centers in Kathmandu, but could not sustain them.  They have also
attempted to develop some projects with the National Children's Organisation
(the <i>Bal Mandirs</i>), but again these efforts have been tentative and not
well developed. Clearly NWA is concerned about the issue of child care and
would like to get involved in some way, but they are unsure on how to proceed.
<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenge</u>:  Basically this is a very inexperienced group in terms of
programming.  At least the people we met appeared to lack the skills to
conceptualize a programme and take the steps necessary to get it funded. <p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  This group consists of women from all over the country,
and they have an established network.  They are committed to trying to make a
difference in women's lives.  With the right kind of training and support, they
could make a significant contribution.  Again, this might be an NGO worth
investing in to build their capacity.<p>
<p>
Recommendation:  It would be extremely valuable for a small group of women from
NWA to visit India and meet with Ila Bhatt and others at SEWA.  SEWA is a
dynamic women's organisation that has made a substantial difference in women's
lives.  Their strategy has been to address issues simultaneously at the
grassroots level to mobilize women and at the national policy level to put into
place supportive legislation.  They have also developed a strategy for the
implementation of child care programmes in conjunction with women's work.<p>
<p>
* * *<p>
<p>
While the focus of the review was on early childhood projects directed toward
poor children, primarily in the rural areas, there are some efforts being
undertaken in Kathmandu which focus on the underclass.  These have the
potential to provide viable models of provision for urban children.  These
projects need to be taken into consideration in terms of their experience and
what they can offer to the development of early childhood resources nationally.
<p>
<p>
<b>	c. Shreejana Vikas Kendra.  </b>This relatively new organisation was
created by a very active woman (Shanta Choudwry) who has developed this NGO to
alleviate the extremely negative conditions of rural women.  Beginning with
activities to help address women's legal issues, Shreejana Vikas Kendra now
also provides literacy classes in Kathmandu (bringing the women in from the
rural areas), training for the purpose of income-generating, and a child care
center for women working in carpet factories.<b>[3]</b><p>
<p>
<u>The Challenges</u>:  Shreejana Vikas Kendra is a very small organisation,
but it is thriving. While there is a child care center being operated, it is of
low quality.  The Director admits that she knows little about children, but she
saw the need for child care and has created a place where at least the children
are safe and they are being fed.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  The Director, Shanta Choudwry, is a women of strong
commitment, and she has considerable energy and enthusiasm.  She was a
recipient of an Ashoka Fellowship in 1989, and certainly demonstrates the
qualities of individuals chosen for that fellowship.  <p>
<p>
<b>	d. Madhyamik Vidayalaya.  </b>This private school has been organised for
lower caste children.  The Director, Stella Tamang, began by creating a
pre-school.  Then as she learned more about the poor quality of the primary
system into which graduates from her center entered, she decided to extend her
school into the primary grades, and finally into secondary school. She now
operates a high quality private school.  But Stella has not limited herself to
developing and operating her own school.  She has been actively involved in
early childhood education in the country.  She is a member of the national
advisory committee for the BPEP project and she has been active in promoting
early childhood awareness.<p>
<p>
In 1980 she helped found the <u>Teaching Services Center for Early Childhood
Education</u>.  Currently membership is primarily from among the
private-schools in Kathmandu, but this group has the potential to take on
advocacy and awareness-raising activities that would serve the nation.<p>
<p>
<u>The Challenges</u>:  At this point Stella Tamang's work has been focused
primarily on the development of her own school.  <p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>: Mrs. Tamang has a good understanding of early childhood
issues and would be a tremendous resource if she could be encouraged to move to
the national arena in some way.  The Teaching Services Center could be
developed as a national resource for curriculum development, material
development and the creation of appropriate training for urban and rural child
care teacher/facilitator. <p>
<p>
<b>5. Industrial day care</b><p>
<p>
While not an organisation as such, another vehicle for the development of child
care systems is industry-sponsored/supported child care.  We visited one such
center in Pokhara that had been developed out of the initiative of a local
Business Professional Women's Club (BPWC).  This club understood the needs of
working women for child care.  They organised and then sponsored such a center
within the industrial complex in Pokhara.  <p>
<p>
Initially BPWC provided some funding for the center.  The remainder was
supplied by the factory and the parents ( 2:1 proportionally).  BPWC has now
withdrawn funding.  The current level of parent and factory funding is not
sufficient to sustain the child care centre.  However, if costs were analysed
it might be possible to sustain the center if the factory would contribute
2/3rd of the required costs, while the women workers contribute 1/3.  <p>
<p>
<u>The Challenges</u>:  It requires an individual or organisation to work with
individual factories and industries to establish such child care centers,
although there may be some national business organisations that could be
approached to develop child care systems within their setting.  At this point
there is little experience in employer-sponsored child care in Nepal, but it is
certainly an avenue worth exploring.<p>
<p>
<u>The Potential</u>:  Clearly for a country where there are increasing numbers
of women involved in the more formal work sector, there will be an increasing
need for employer-sponsored child care.  The existing models could well be
built upon so that they can serve as examples of what can be developed and
implemented.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.  A Typology of Programme Approaches</b><p>
<p>
In order to get some perspective on the initiatives that have been developed in
Nepal, it is useful to put them within a typology of early childhood provision
that encompasses efforts internationally.  This topology, taken from the
<u>Coordinators' Notebook</u> (Issue 11, 1992, pg 8) is presented in Table 2
and summarized below:<p>
<p>
<b>	1.  Delivering a service.</b>  The goal of programmes in this category is
to meet the immediate needs of children.  The services provided can include
health care, nutrition and stimulation (education), and they are provided
outside the child's home. <p>
<p>
<b>	2.  Educating caregivers</b>.  This category of services focuses on parents
or other caregivers, providing them with information that will enhance their
parenting/caregiving abilities.  Interventions can include parental education
(literacy is one vehicle), and/or efforts that focus on older children who
provide care for their younger siblings (for example Child-to-Child). <p>
<p>
<b>	3.  Promoting community development.</b>  This strategy emphasizes working
with the community to define its needs and support the development of services
they see as beneficial.  When child care and development is a desired outcome,
the services are developed in line with community resources to help assure
sustainability. <p>
<p>
<b>	4.  Strengthening national resources and capabilities</b>.  The focus of
these strategies is on developing the organisational capacity of institutions
in order for them to be able to continue their services to children and their
families.  <p>
<p>
<b>	5.  Advocating to increase demand.</b>  An important support for the
development of services for children and families is increased public awareness
of the need for such services.  Advocacy is an important part of that
consciousness-raising process.  This requires pulling together relevant
knowledge and disseminating it in a variety of ways to reach multiple
audiences.<p>

<b>	6.  Monitoring social, legal and regulatory dimensions.</b>  A critical
piece in developing programmes for families is to assure that legislation is in
place which is supportive of both women and children.  This includes monitoring
and reinforcement of labor regulations as well as assisting in the development
of appropriate programmes to demonstrate application of the legislation.<p>
<p>
<b>	7.  Developing national child care and family policies.</b>  At the
national level, it is important to have policy in place that provides an
<i>enabling environment</i> for the development of appropriate programmes for
families and children.  While policies can be directly related to provision for
women and children, tax and other incentives can indirectly benefit the quality
of children's lives.  Thus it is important to focus on developing a broad range
of social policies.<p>
<p>

categories of provision.<p>

7.  Develop national child        Ministry of Education and Culture<p>

<p>
<p>
As can be seen, at the present time the majority of the efforts have been
directed toward the provision of care, educating caregivers and promoting
community development.  In the plan of action being proposed in this report,
emphasis will be given to the <b><i>strengthening of national resources and
capabilities</i></b>, which will help strengthen what has already been
developed in terms of the other strategies.  Emphasis will also be given to
advocating to increase demand.<p>
<p>
This strategy is being recommended because Nepal is at a turning point in terms
of its support of early childhood efforts.  Nepal has been involved in early
childhood provision for UNICEF's target population for the past 10 years in the
PCRW and SFDP programmes. Other experiments have been underway within the
international NGO community for nearly as long.  While this may not appear to
be very long, in fact it is a significant amount of time when compared to other
efforts internationally.  The 10 years have allowed the programmes to move
beyond the pilot/ experimentation stage.  They have been in place long enough
to have some stability. They have not achieved self-sustainability, but that is
not necessarily the fault of the community. It has more often been the result
of the ways in which the programmes were introduced initially into the
community.<p>
<p>
Again, it is useful to put Nepal's experience in perspective.  In a review of
early childhood programmes internationally, Robert Myers (1991) summarized some
of the current issues being faced by those who have been involved in early
childhood provision.  Several of his comments are applicable to Nepal.<p>
<p>
Many projects and programmes continue to be pilot and demonstration activities
that are innovative, effective and feasible to replicate, but have not been
extended in a significant way.  (pg.55)<p>
<p>
This is certainly true in Nepal.  The two largest projects, SFDP and PCRW, have
implemented well-conceived early childhood projects. And while it may well be
feasible to replicate the efforts (with some changes in the approach to
implementation) this has not happened.  In fact, child care centres within SFDP
will be phased out by UNICEF at the end of 1992. This is illustrative of
another point made by Myers.<p>
<p>
Many...programmes have now passed the point of initial enthusiasm and
the...spirit that was so critical in getting programmes underway is growing
thin.  And yet these programmes have not been recognized as bona fide claims on
the public purse; they are in danger of fading. (pg. 56)<p>
<p>
The programmes in Nepal are indeed in danger of fading.  The time is right for
some action by UNICEF, in collaboration with the government and NGO community,
to assure that the efforts do not fade and that appropriate technical support
is provided to some of the current initiatives. In the following section there
are a series of recommendations for action.<p>
<p>
<b>IV.  RECOMMENDATIONS AND ACTION PLAN</b><p>
<p>
In order to understand the rationale for the proposed recommendations and
Action Plan it is useful to take a step back and look at what happens over time
as projects develop.  There are stages or phases to projects.  These are common
across development efforts and provide a useful framework for assessing the
level of development of early childhood provision in Nepal.  What follows is a
brief description of the phases and an indication of where the various efforts
in Nepal fall within that framework.   From this, recommendations are made in
terms of a specific Action Plan that could be undertaken by UNICEF over the
next 3-5 years.<p>
<p>
<b>A.</b> <b> Phases in the life of development projects.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	1.  An initial interest in developing a programme</b>.  Here staff of an
organisation or agency have seen the need to develop a programme and are
seeking models that might be implemented in their setting and/or they are in
the process of developing their own model.  <p>
<p>
	Save The Children USA<p>
	World Education (Family Literacy)<p>
National Women's Association <p>
	<p>
<b>	2. Experimental/pilot programme phase.   </b>This consists of designing a
model and testing it out in a few sites.<p>
<p>
	Research Centre for Educational Innovation and Development<p>
	  (CERID)<p>
	Ministry of Education and Culture (MOEC)<p>
	  Basic and Primary Education Project (BPEP)<p>
	  Curriculum, Textbooks, Supervisory Development Centre<p>
        (CTSDC)<p>
	Shreejana Vikas Kendra<p>
NCO's community center programme<p>
<p>
<b>	3. Evaluation/Review</b>.  Here the experimental model has been in place
for some time (a minimum of 3 years).  The agency/ organisation is making an
assessment of what has been accomplished and is looking to the future.<p>
	Production Credit for Rural Women (PCRW)<p>
     Small Farmers Development Programme (SFDP)<p>
     PLAN International<p>
	Redd Barna<p>
     National Children's Organisation (examining the <i>Bal Mandirs</i>)<p>
<p>
<b>	4. Redesign</b>.  For those who have determined that there are changes that
need to be made in the model, either in terms of the quality of the provision
or related to issues of sustainability, this is the time to make those
changes.<p>
<p>
This is the position of most of the groups listed in Phase 3. There is a
realization that the current model is not adequate and interest in receiving
assistance in terms of the future.<p>
<p>
<b>	5. Consolidation/dissemination</b>.  At this stage the organisation has
confidence in the model that has been developed and is in the process of
designing ways to take the model <i>to scale</i>.<p>
<p>
At the present time there is no group in Nepal at this stage.<p>
<p>
<p>
In sum, Nepal is rich in experience.  There are a number of early childhood
efforts that have been underway for almost 10 years.  It is at the point where
people are asking, now what?  The great difficulty in answering that question
is that despite the long history of involvement in early childhood provision
there is a lack of expertise in the country to assist those groups who are
beginning efforts.  More importantly there is lack of expertise to take the
more experienced groups to the next stage in their own development.  Nepal is
in danger of losing what has already been developed.<p>
<p>
<b>B.  What role can UNICEF play?</b><p>
<p>
UNICEF can play an extremely important role by helping to support the
development of human resources at the national level who would assist people
through Phase 4 (and provide assistance to those in the earlier Phases as
well).  Eventually this may lead into the development of a national Resource
Centre.  Specifically what people are requesting is assistance in:<p>
<p>
	<b>1. Curriculum development</b>.  At the present time what is passing as an
early childhood curriculum is merely a collection of activities that can be
undertaken with young children.  There is no framework that people are working
from to make curricular decisions.<p>
<p>
<b>	2. Training</b>.  The training that has been provided has not been
systematic.  People have taken what they could find in Nepal, and quite a
number have done short courses in Israel over the years, but again, there is no
overall training design that could be applied systematically.  Many of the
organisations which have already begun early childhood programmes are serving
the rural areas.  Thus a training system developed for rural, illiterate
teachers is required and could be applied across many of the organisations.<p>
<p>
	<b>3. Alternative approaches</b>.  <p>
<p>
a.	There is a need to develop a truly community-based approach that will lead
to self-sustainability.  The models that have been developed are reliant upon
external funding in order for the programme to be maintained in the community.
There is a need to re-work these models in order for them to achieve
self-sustainability.  There is also a need to provide support in the early
stages to those groups initiating early childhood programmes so that
sustainability is built in from the beginning.<p>
<p>
b.	There is a need to link early childhood provision with other programmes.
Literacy is a primary example.  There is an opportunity to bring together these
two efforts in a variety of ways: <p>
-  through the introduction of child development into literacy materials,<p>
-  through the creation of child care programmes that operate in conjunction
with the literacy classes, thus making it possible for more women to
participate.<p>
<p>
<b>	4.  Advocacy</b>.  There is a need to develop advocacy programmes to raise
awareness of the importance of early childhood provision. This
awareness-raising needs to be done with parents as well as with policy
makers.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. Recommendations and Strategy/Action Plan</b><p>
<b></b><p>
The recommendations which follow will allow UNICEF and HMG/Nepal to meet their
stated objectives in support of early childhood provision. Each set of
recommendations is followed by a suggested strategy or Action Plan designed to
allow for implementation of the recommendation.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6</b><p>
<p>
<i>1.	Rather than contribute to individual efforts in early childhood
provision, UNICEF should support the development of human resources at the
national level that can provide technical assistance to governmental and
non-governmental agencies in the areas of curriculum development, training and
related research and evaluation.  The model developed for the training of
Master Trainers in the field of Adult Education might well be followed.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>2.	Current infrastructures should be supported to provide training and
on-going support to those currently providing early childhood care and
education (e.g. WDOs, WDAs, RP's)</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>3.	Models of home-based care should be evaluated more closely in terms of
content and the quality of provision.  This is a very important model
internationally for the provision of care and education to children in isolated
rural areas.  Further experimentation with this model would be useful
nationally and internationally.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>4.	Non-governmental agencies (international and local) should be provided
with support in the development of community-based models of early childhood
care and development which are developed from the perspective of
self-sustainability. Organisations open for collaboration on such an effort
would be Save the Children USA and PLAN International.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>5.	Within current models of provision, particularly SFDP and PCRW, attempts
should be made to experiment with alternative models of funding the early
childhood components so that they can become self-sustaining.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>6.	Currently there are several training systems which have been developed
nationally (the MLD has 5 training centres, WTC has 4 centres, and there is the
BPEP system).  The possibility should be explored that these centres also be
utilized for the training of early childhood personnel. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan:</b>  Among the recommendations given above, several
address the issue of human resource development at the national level in order
to support and promote early childhood activities in Nepal.  Action which
facilitates human resource development would support Recommendations, 1-6.
What follows is a proposal for how this might be done.  It is based on several
premises. <p>
<p>
	*  More than one or two people in the country should become early childhood
care and development experts.  In fact a core group -- minimum 12 people --
should have the skills and abilities to develop curriculum and train others in
its application.  With only 1 or 2 being trained there is the risk of their
leaving the country or changing their profession.  There needs to be a solid
core group that can provide on-going support to one another.<p>
<p>
	*  To the extent possible, they should acquire new skills and abilities
through in-country training.  It would be extremely costly to send this number
of people abroad for training. In addition, sending them abroad would increase
the risk of their not maintaining their involvement in early childhood
education.<p>
<p>
	*  Training should be structured in such a way that it allows people to
continue in their present position and not draw them away from their
responsibilities.  One of the possible outcomes of removing people from their
job in order to receive training is that someone else has to take on the
person's current responsibilities.  When no one else is available, then the job
does not get done.  When someone else is available, they may want to retain the
position when the individual being trained returns to the position.  This can
cause difficulties within the organisation.  Further, if the individual being
trained can remain on-the-job it provides them with an opportunity to apply
their training immediately and to know what will and will not work in their
context.  This provides extremely useful feedback to those doing the training.
<p>
<p>
	*  As new curricular ideas, materials and concepts are introduced, those
receiving the training should take maximum responsibility for adapting them to
the culture and conditions in Nepal.  No <i>package</i> should be imposed.  All
too often a curriculum or programme is imported without regard for its cultural
appropriateness.  Through the process being suggested below, while a well-known
curriculum would be introduced early on in the process, it would be for the
purposes of providing a framework for the development of a local curriculum.
From that framework an appropriate curriculum would be developed for Nepal.<p>
<p>
	*  In order to build up expertise within Nepal it is going to be necessary to
draw on experts outside the country.  The appropriate curriculum and training
expertise to support this Action Plan does not exist in-country.<p>
<p>
	*  At the present time a separate Resource Centre for Early Childhood Care and
Education should <u>not</u> be established due to the costs of such an
investment at a time when there are neither adequate personnel to staff the
centre nor a clear sense of the objectives and mandate of such a Centre.  Many
of the curricular ideas, materials and training packages that might be offered
through such a Centre will be developed in the proposed project, but a physical
centre will not be established.  If the need for such a centralized function
evolves in 3-5 years time then a separate proposal would be developed.  (See
Annex C for an analysis of some of the current agencies and organisation in
terms of their potential to house such a Resource Centre.)<p>
<p>
Given these premises, the following course of action is proposed, based on a
series of in-country workshops, developed in consultation with external
experts. <p>
<p>
	<u>A National Workshop</u> would be held with invitees from all the agencies
and organisations currently providing some kind of early childhood care and
education activities.  Two participants would be invited from each
organisation.  Given the numbers involved (there are at least 14 organisations
that should be included, in addition to the governmental offices), it is
proposed that two workshops be held, with half of the group attending one
workshop and the other half attending the second workshop.  Further, it is
proposed that these workshops be held outside Kathmandu, perhaps in Pokhara and
Ilam.  The workshop would be of four days duration.  Its purpose would be to
help <i>ground</i> people in what early childhood care and education is all
about.  (The material provided in the UNICEF Manual would be an excellent
resource.)  There would also be a discussion of whether or not the agencies
represented were willing to nominate 1-2 of their people to become curriculum
developers and trainers.  <p>
<p>
Criteria would be established for the participation in further training of
those with a strong interest in early childhood provision.  The
agency/organisation would have to submit an application for 1-2 people from
their staff to become Master Trainers, and the agency would have to make a
commitment to utilize these individuals in a training role once they completed
the course.<p>
<p>
	<u>Training Workshop I</u>. This two-week workshop would be offered to those
who had been accepted for the training course.  During the first training the
emphasis would be on curriculum development.  The participants would engage in
a discussion of what curriculum is, they would analyse the current early
childhood curriculum in terms of whether or not it meets the criteria of a
curriculum, and they would then be given the task of identifying gaps and
setting up working groups to fill in the gaps.  Following the training they
would return to their agency and work on implementing the curriculum as
designed, making changes as appropriate, and identifying gaps not yet filled.<p>
<p>
	<u>Training Workshop II</u>.  This two-week workshop would build on what the
participants had learned as they tried to utilize the curriculum in their
settings.  The group would then try to finalise a national curriculum framework
that could be offered to those interested in establishing early childhood
programmes.  It is important to note that curricula would have to be developed
for home-based programmes, for centre-based child care programmes and for the
pre-primary classes.  While there would be a great deal of overlap in these
curricula, they would have to be adapted for use in the various settings.<p>
<p>
	<u>Training Workshop III, IV and V</u>.  Within these two-week workshops the
participants would be trained to become trainers in the curriculum.  Between
each workshop the participants would be expected to apply what they are
learning, develop training materials, document their activities and progress,
etc.  During each of the trainings there would be an opportunity to discuss
what they had learned as they tried to apply their new skills, and there would
be an opportunity to address areas covered previously in order to reinforce
earlier learning. <p>
<p>
A major aspect of the training would also include how to work with communities
to gain their support for early childhood provision and ways of developing
resources within the community to establish and maintain appropriate
provision.<p>
<p>
After the fifth workshop there would be an assessment of the progress made by
the participants and a recommendation made in terms of additional training
and/or follow-up that might be required.<p>
<p>
At the end of the process there would be 12-20 individuals within the country
who would have expertise in early childhood care and education, in terms of
curriculum development and the ability to train others in the application of
that curriculum.  These individuals would remain within their own organisations
and would have the ability to provide training to teachers and supervisory
staff working in the child care programmes operated by their agency or
organisation.  In addition, it is anticipated that they could be made available
to provide training to new groups interested in starting early childhood
programmes.<p>
<p>
If after the training it is apparent that a centralized resource centre for
early childhood provision is required, then that would be proposed to the
government, UNICEF and other donors.<p>
<p>
A timeline for action in relation to this set of activities is included in
Table 3. The costs of this strategy would be approximately $100,000/year for 2
years.  This would include the costs of the external consultants, the travel
and stipend costs for the participants and workshop costs. <p>

<p>
<p>
<b>Action Required</b>: As noted earlier, this set of activities would require
input from outside Nepal.  However, UNICEF would have to be responsible for
setting the activities in motion.  Following discussions with the government
and NGOs that might be included in the activities, an outside
consultant/organisation would need to be contracted to conceptualise and
conduct the trainings. <p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 7 - </b><p>
<p>
<i>Strategies should be developed for working the content of early childhood
education (child development and the interaction of health, nutrition and
stimulation) into the content of current non-formal education and literacy
programmes.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan</b>:  By collaborating with non-formal education and
literacy programmes it would be possible to reach a wide spectrum of people.
The non-formal programmes address the needs of those 6-14, and literacy
programmes address the needs of adults. Both of these programmes are well
established in Nepal, and UNICEF has made a commitment to support these
efforts. <p>
<p>
One of the ways that early childhood could be strengthened through the
non-formal education programme is to include child development, health and
nutrition content as a part of the non-formal curriculum.  What might also be
useful is the inclusion of parenting education.  Many of these children are out
of school because they are caring for younger siblings.  The more they know
about how to care for them appropriately, the better.  A parenting curriculum
would also help prepare them for their role as parents.<p>
<p>
In terms of literacy programmes, there are many materials available for use in
teaching basic literacy.  What is being developed at this point are
post-literacy materials, reading materials for those who are now literate.
Many people we talked with were concerned about the content of post-literacy
materials.  They wanted to be sure that they were appropriate in terms of what
people needed, and they wanted to be sure that they were in a format that
people who are basically non-readers would find attractive.  There was
considerable interest in the development of materials that would address the
interaction of child development, nutrition and health and what that means for
children's growth and development. Another topic they felt was of interest is
the ways in which parents can support children's learning.  Many felt these
topics would be of interest to women and that there would be considerable value
in developing such post-literacy content.<p>
<p>
In order to link effectively with non-formal education and literacy programmes
it would be necessary to examine the current curricula to see to what extent
health, nutrition and child development are included.  Then it would be
necessary to identify someone who could help to add these components to the
curriculum. <p>
<p>
Given the large number of people being reached through these two systems, and
their relative flexibility, there is tremendous potential to get the right
messages out to this group of people through existing mechanisms.  This
strategy would be particularly important in terms of reaching girls and women.
<p>
<p>
<b>Action required:</b> Given UNICEF's in-house expertise in non-formal
education and the hiring of a new person for literacy, activities to integrate
early childhood into these programme could be begun as soon as the UNICEF ECEC
person is hired.  The activity of developing appropriate materials could also
be incorporated to some extent into the Workshops which are a part of the
Action Plan described above.  Literacy and non-formal education curriculum
developers could attend the workshops and take advantage of the expertise
available through them.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 8 - </b><p>
<p>
<i>Investments should be made in developing the capacity of local NGOs, not
only in terms of curriculum and training, but also in management and
sustainability.  Given UNDP's interest in developing the capacity of NGO's,
perhaps this could be a joint endeavor with them.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan. </b> This is not a direct mandate for UNICEF at this
point in time. However, it is a part of helping to strengthen the organisations
currently providing early childhood programming.  Since there are other
development agencies and donors (e.g. UNDP), who are interested in
organisational development issues, the kind of cooperation that is being
proposed between UNDP and UNICEF to support the National Children's
Organisation is an excellent way to proceed. <p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 9 - </b><p>
<p>
<i>Several reports and commissions have recommended the development of a
national center to support early childhood care and development.  In documents
there is reference to a Pre-Primary Unit in the Ministry of Education and
Culture, a Child Study Center, and a Section for the implementation of Early
Child Education and Care (ECEC) programme within the Ministry of Education and
Culture.  In the private sector there is the Teaching Services Center. While
this is a worthy long-term goal, such a Unit/ Section placed within the MOEC or
a resource center based in an NGO should be undertaken cautiously.  Before
investing, an assessment should be made of the resources that would be required
to establish and maintain a resource centre since this is likely to be a costly
activity.  </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Action required: </b>There is no action required at this time since it is
being recommended that the idea of developing a Resource Centre for ECEC be
analysed over time to assess the viability of such an investment.  However,
over the next two years there should be further exploration of this
possibility.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 10 -</b><p>
<p>
<i>It was recommended that a National Pre-Primary Council or National Board be
established for the purposes of providing direction to the Ministry of
Education in the development of its pre-primary education programme.  As a
result of this  mission it is being recommended that a</i><b> National Council
on Early Childhood Care and Education</b> <i>be created which has a broader
mandate.  It should work with the MOEC in the development of its pre-primary
programmes and also oversee the development of care for all children under the
age of six being provided for by both governmental and non-governmental
agencies.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan:</b>  This would be an important activity to undertake
in the near future.  The consultancy helped to stimulate renewed interest in
early childhood activities, and the discussions held would suggest that people
are willing and able to participate in such a Council.<p>
<p>
<b>Action required:</b>  UNICEF needs to take the initiative, but work closely
with the Ministry of Education and Culture, and perhaps the Ministry of Local
Development, who would appoint the National Council.  The National Council
should be comprised of individuals from governmental and non-governmental
agencies and organisations.  The National Council should be formed as soon as
possible so that they can be active participants in the design and
implementation of the Action Plan suggested in relation to recommendations 1-6.
<p>
One possibility would be for an Executive Committee of the National Council
(4-6) members to be part of the Planning Committee for the Workshops.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 11 -</b><p>
<p>
<i>For the short term, the possibility of using volunteers trained in early
childhood provision should be considered and appropriate volunteers should be
actively recruited (e.g. VSO's and Peace Corps volunteers).</i><p>
<i></i><b></b><p>
<b></b>Clearly Nepal is open to having volunteers from a variety of countries.
This is potentially an important source of early childhood expertise.  <p>
<p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan</b>:  Discussions with those associated with the VSO
programme expressed an interest in being involved in early childhood activities
in Nepal.  They assured us that they would be able to recruit volunteers with
appropriate experience.  This avenue should be explored further, and other
agencies that provide volunteers (e.g. Peace Corps) should be approached and
requested to provide volunteers with appropriate early childhood training and
experiences. <p>
<p>
<b>Action required:</b>  It is not necessary to undertake the task immediately.
When the new UNICEF ECEC staff person gets on-board, he/she should meet with
the various groups providing volunteers and develop a plan of action for
recruiting them to work in this sector.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 12 -</b><p>
<p>
<i>People in Nepal should become familiar with early childhood developments in
the region.  There are particularly strong  programmes in Thailand, India and
Sri Lanka.  Appropriate study tours should be created to maximize what can be
learned from these countries. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan:</b> <b> </b>There are a number of exemplary early
childhood programmes in the Region.  It would be worthwhile for a selected
number of people to visit such programmes, but they should do so with a very
clear agenda.  For example, there is a Teachers Resource Centre (TRC) in
Karachi, Pakistan that is designed to develop curriculum and materials, conduct
workshops for teachers, and work at the policy level to promote early childhood
concerns.  A study tour would allow participants to learn:  how the TRC
evolved; about the services it offers; about its organisational structure; and
how it is financed. <p>
<p>
Another programme it might be worth visiting is the Self Employed Women's
Association (SEWA) in India, which has a long and rich experience in working
with disenfranchised women.  One programme that they have developed which would
be of particular interest is the Creche (child care) programme developed for
women working in the rural areas.  The SEWA model would be of interest as
alternative programming for women and children in the rural areas is being
considered. <p>
<p>
There is a parent education programme in Thailand that is well worth visiting.
Within the programme materials have been developed that help stimulate parent
discussion groups.  The materials describe the stages of child development and
emphasise the interaction between health, nutrition, and stimulation.  The
materials being developed and the process of working with parents would be of
particular interest.<p>
<p>
<b>Action required:</b>  There should be a minimum of one study tour a year
(and a maximum of 2) for a group of 6-8 people, with a very particular focus
for each study tour (e.g. models of care for children under 3, or resource
centres, or community-supported child care, etc.)  The first study tour should
be set up toward the end of 1993 when those people participating in the
Workshops described above would have some ideas about what they would like to
learn from making such a study tour. <p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 13 -</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i>Advocacy efforts should be undertaken to promote a more widespread
understanding of the importance and value of the early years in terms of
children's later growth and development.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan:</b>  Redd Barna would be a good partner for UNICEF on
this activity.  They have media capacity within their staff and a strong
interest already in advocacy work.  The <i>Hatimalo</i> programme is one
vehicle for strengthening the messages that go to children and parents.<p>
<p>
<b>Action required:</b>  Rather than expending UNICEF staff time in advocacy
work, if funds were available, it would be advisable to work with Redd Barna to
develop a proposal that they could implement and that UNICEF would help fund.
Other donors could also be brought into the project. <p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 14 -</b><p>
<p>
<i>The early childhood position should be filled within UNICEF Nepal as soon as
possible in order to provide the appropriate coordination and backstopping.
The individual could be recruited from the region where there are some
individuals very experienced in early childhood care and education. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Action required:</b>  If UNICEF is going to make a commitment to strengthen
and further support the development of early childhood initiatives in Nepal,
then the UNICEF office has to be strengthened in its capacity to backstop the
effort.  The activities listed above cannot be carried out by current personnel
given their responsibilities at the present time.  It would be advisable to
recruit someone for the position and to have them take up their
responsibilities as soon as possible.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendation 15 -</b><p>
<p>
<i>A linkage should be established with a reputable early childhood
organisation which could provide training and technical support over the next
two to five years. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<b>Strategy/Action Plan</b>:  As noted earlier, the recommendation is being
made that a linkage be established with the High/Scope Foundation in the USA.
High/Scope is known internationally for its commitment to young children.  The
research produced by High/Scope has demonstrated the importance of early
childhood education, not only in the present, but more importantly in terms of
the long-term benefits of investment in early childhood education.  High/Scope
also has a well-developed curriculum that has been adapted for use with the
rural poor in a variety of countries (e.g. Ecuador, Colombia, Bolivia, Peru,
and Iraq). <p>
<p>
High/Scope has developed a training process which provides for the training of
teachers, supervisory staff and the development of Master Trainers.  A linkage
with this institution would provide for two-way exchanges.  Through the
workshop process, a High/Scope consultant would travel to Nepal to conduct the
workshops.  At some point in time there might be individuals in Nepal who it
would be appropriate to send for advanced training. <p>
<p>
<b>Action required:</b>  If the Action Plan is accepted by UNICEF Nepal then
discussions should be undertaken with the High/Scope Foundation to develop the
Action Plan further and develop an appropriate contract.<p>
<p>
<b>D. Costs</b><p>
<p>
It is recognised that each of the recommendations needs to be developed further
to test their feasibility.  They also need to be costed.  While the Action Plan
detailed in Table 3 has been estimated to cost $100,000/year for 2 years, the
other recommendations and the proposed strategies/action plans have not been
elaborated in enough detail to attach a cost to them.  <p>
It should also be noted that some other options have been outlined for UNICEF's
consideration.  These are described briefly in Annex D.  Some of these have
cost estimates.<p>
<p>
* * *<p>
In sum, Nepal is at a turning point.  A considerable investment has been made
in early childhood provision in the country.  While the investment has provided
rich returns, there is a danger that the investment is going to be lost.
Organisations are at a point where professional support is required to keep
them moving ahead.  That support does not exist within Nepal.  It has to be
developed, and it can be, but it is going to take a real commitment on UNICEF's
part (financially and in terms of personnel) to make it happen.<p>

I. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS<br><p>
Poland is a country which, after forty years of a totalitarian (communist) regime, has started creating the mechanisms of democratic and lawful systems both in the political and social spheres of life.<br><p>
The Republic of Poland is a parliamentary democracy. The structural transformations begun after 1989 result from the victory of social and political forces connected with "Solidary" and the resolutions of the so-called "round table meeting", which secured 35% of the seats within the 460-member Parliament for "Solidarity" candidates in the parliamentary elections of 1989. Only in 1992 did free, democratic general elections take place in Poland for the first time after the second world war.<br><p> 
	Until now it has seemed that in the sphere of political democracy the
mechanisms of democratic functioning have been working, while in the area of
social democracy, on the local level, they have only gradually begun to replace the old rules.  However, the latest political decisions of the government, the Parliament, or even the President, which either ignore law or balance on the thin line between the lawful and unlawful, make one doubt the existence of political democracy in Poland.  These decisions raise fears of the return to the old authoritarian, unlawful government system, privileged political elites and disregard for the electorate, who is getting tired, frustrated and inert. There is pessimism about the future of the society and State.<br><p>
	 Poland is a country aiming at free market economy ruled by competition, supply and demand.  Polish capitalism is often called "wild capitalism",  a capitalism in which the law is imprecise and allows for arbitrary interpretations and abuses such as the exploitation of employees, the evasion of taxes and credit repayment.  It is generally assumed that the big fortunes of the last years were made by the former communist nomenclature who issued and used public money for their own benefit.  Many large companies are still administered by the State and sponsored from the national budget.  These companies bring losses rather than increase the GNP. The economic policy of the State does not promote the process of privatisation of the big inefficient
factories and companies, but keeps the old industrial structure.<br><p>
	This is also true of agriculture, which is subsidized by low interest credit, no income taxes for farmers, State subsidies for production of artificial fertilizers, and so-called compensatory dues paid to farmers from the central budget.  The compensation is supposed to eliminate the differences in prices between cheap food imported from the West and expensive food produced in Poland and to decrease the inflation rate.  The effect of this and other measures, e.g. regulations restricting the import of some foods, is that the Polish farmer finds it more profitable not to lower the cost of food production through modernisation.  Thus food prices continue to increase.<br><p>
	The economic and social policy of the current governing coalition does not promote  changes in the agriculture area and increases the conflict between food producers and the rest of the society, especially those groups who are financed by central budget.<br><p>
  	The GNP has been systematically rising and is now about 80 billion dollars, with the foreign debt (to Western banks and governments) of 45-47 million dollars, and a national debt (to Polish banks) of 20 million dollars.  The government policy to use resources to decrease debts has resulted in decreased support for the weakest sectors of the national economy -- health services, educare[1] provision, social services to families and public safety nets -- which had led to the pauperisation of several social groups (children, youth and pensioners).  It would be very worthwhile to add that 94% of pensioners in the rural areas are paid by public money.<br><p>
	The above mentioned three social groups (children, youth and pensioners) are, economically, the weakest of the whole population.	By virtue of various relevant national and international legal acts, e.g. Convention of Human Rights, Convention on the Rights of the Child,  and the Polish Constitution, the State is obliged to support these groups from public funds. So far there have been no signals of the conflict of interest between different groups of working and non-working (pensioners) citizens.  However, both the old insufficient systems of social welfare and the system of pensioners needs to be reformed.<br><p>
	The population of Poland in 1994 was 38,570,000 people, of whom 61.9% live in town and 38.1% in the country.  Around 5,338,000 of the population are children under the age of six, about 6,529,030 are children and young people between the age of 7 and 14/15,  (i.e. the period of compulsory education, (8 grades of basic school) and about 8,000,000 are retired people. (See Table 1 for child population data and Appendix, Table 1 for full population data.)   In 1980 the 0-6 population constituted 12.6% of the total population.  This changed to 12.4% in 1985; 11.1% in 1990; and 10.0% in 1993.  Clearly this age group is decreasing in terms of the percentage of the population that it represents. Across the years the 0-14 population has represented about 25% of the total.<br><p>

</pre>
<p>
The population of Poland is growing in spite of:<br><p>

<ul><li>one of the highest infant mortality rates (15-16 for every 1000 new born babies up to 27 days of life), which is clear evidence of insufficient medical and social care in the prenatal period and the first three months of a child`s life.  The most frequent cause of death among newborn babies is low birth weight. In 1991, post-neonatal mortality (above 28 days of life) amounted to 4.2 for every 1000 live births.(Appendix, Tables 2, 3 and 4); and<br>
<li>high adult mortality.  The most common causes of death being diseases of the
circulatory system for men and cancer for women, which are the effects of the low SES of society, and the bad quality of the living and working
environment.</ul>

	The birth rate has been systematically falling - from 18.2 births for 1,000
mothers in the eighties to 13.4 in 1992 (11.5 for urban areas, and 16.3 for
rural areas).(Appendix, Table 5).  And, as noted, the under 6 population has
decreased from 12.6% of the total in 1980 to 10.0% of the total in 1993.<p>
<p>
	 In 1993,  2,658,000 families in Poland had children under six (57% of which
live in urban areas and 43% are rural).   On the average, a Polish family with
children under six has two children.  Among these 260,000 are single parent
families (200,000 with mothers only).<p>
<p>
	According to the estimates of Caritas-Poland, there are over 200,000 families
that live below the social minimum.  In that group one can certainly include
families where the children are brought up by single unemployed mothers or
fathers.  There are about 282,000 married couples with children under six where
the mother is unemployed.  In a further 93,000 cases, it is father who cannot
find a job.   In sum, 14% of the families with children under six have one
parent who is unemployed.  The number of unemployed single parents is 53,000
(49,000 mothers and 4,000 fathers).  20% of the single-parent families are
unemployed.<p>
	<p>
	 According to other sources, the proportion of families in poverty, families
which have sufficient means only for food, or those families that need social
assistance, increased from 6% in 1989 to 21% in 1991.<p>
<p>
	The employment index of women in the 15-44 age group, that is of potential
mothers of children aged 0-6, was on the average, 85.9%  in 1993 (i.e 86 out of
100 women are employed).[2] This value is
among the highest in Europe.  This would probably be higher if the mothers of
children under 3 were not included.  A much smaller proportion of mothers of
preschool-aged children, as compared to mothers of infants and toddlers, take
the unpaid leave to take care of the child.<p>
<p>
	In November 1993 the number of unemployed men and women at the so-called
working age was about 2,595,000 (49.2% men and 50.8% women).   It is estimated
that in 1994 the unemployment was 2,800,000 ( 18.0% of the total labor force),
of which 50% did not receive the unemployment benefit (about 33% of average
national salary received for a year) and 30% needed social assistance.<p>
<p>
	The most characteristic feature of the labor market in 1994 was the growth in
the number of unemployed people who were no longer eligible to receive
unemployment benefits. According to the State law, people get unemployment
benefits only for a year after loosing their job.<p>
<p>
Despite these negative trends there were also positive trends in 1994:<br><p>
<ul><li> There was an increase in the number of work places (about 60,000).  This is
the first increase since 1989.<p>
<li>The inflation rate is also falling.  In 1989 the inflation rate was 250%. In
1990 it rose up to 586% while in 1991 it went down to 70%. In 1994 the
inflation rate was 30% (23% planned).  It is forecast that the inflation rate
will be 17-19% in 1995.</ul><p>
	<p>
	In would be difficult to present the structure of the Polish population as
regards nationalities and ethnic groups because so far no such distinctions
have been made. Today the population of Poland is nearly homogeneous, with
national minorities representing only 3% of the Polish population.  This was
not true historically.  Up until the end of World War II Poland was a
multi-national and multi-religious society.  In 1931 those of the Polish
nationality comprised 68.9% of the population; Ukrainians were 13.9%; Jews,
8.6%; Belarussians 3.1%; and other nationalities made up 3.1% of the
population.  After 1945, as a result of the Nazi extermination, changed borders
and several periods of political and social unrest which led to emigration,
Poland became primarily a one-nationality country.  In 1980 the national
minorities in Poland were about 1.3-1.6% of the whole population, represented
by 200-300 thousand Ukrainians, 200 thousand Belarussians, 20-30 thousand
Czechs and Slovaks, 10-19 thousand Lithuanians, 8-10 thousand Jews, and 200
thousand Germans.  Other lesser ethnic groups were Greeks, Lemks, Hungarians,
Bulgarians, Russians and Romanian Gypsies, whose numbers have been increasing
lately. <p>
<p>
	In regards to administrative divisions, Poland has 49 <i>voivodships,</i>
which, in turn, are divided into communes governed by local authorities chosen
in free elections. The latest local elections, which were secret, equal and
direct, took place in 1994. The latest parliamentary election took place in
1993.<p>
<p>
<a name="fn0">[1]</a> Educare is the term referred to the
provision of holistic services to young children--health, nutrition, and
cognitive stimulation.<p>
<a name="fn1">[2]</a>     This can be compared with the employment index of
mothers of 0-6 year-olds in Denmark-50%; Germany-45%; Sweden-9-%.<p>
<p>
<b>II.	THE STATE'S FAMILY POLICY</b><p>
<p>
	The basic obligations of the State towards its citizens are stated in Articles
79 and 80 of the Constitution of the Republic of Poland of 17 October 1992,
which includes the following:<p>
<p>
<ol>1.	Marriage, maternity and family are under the protection and care of the
Republic of Poland. Multi-children families are subject to particular care of
the State.<p>
2.	It is the responsibility of parents to bring up their children to become
honest and conscious of their responsibilities as citizens of the Republic of
Poland.(art.79)<p>
3.	The Republic of Poland ensures implementation of maintenance rights and
obligations.<p>
4.	Parents and children are obliged to support themselves.(art.79)<p>
5.	Parental authority covers in particular parents` responsibilities and rights
to take care of the child and his/her property and to bring up the
child.(art.95)<p>
6.	Children born out of wedlock have the same rights as children born in
wedlock.<p>
7.	Concerned about the well-being of the family, the Republic of Poland aims at
the improvement of the housing situation.  With the participation of citizens
the State develops and supports various forms of housing construction,
particularly cooperative housing construction, and cares for the rational
management of housing resources.<p></ol>
<p>
	Article 80 of the Constitutional Act states: "The Republic of Poland takes
particular care in terms of the up-bringing of young people and provides them
with the broadest opportunities of development.  It also creates conditions
that promote the active participation of the young generation in social,
political, economic and cultural life, developing the feeling of
co-responsibility for the development of the motherland."<p>
<p>
	The above principles emphasize the co-responsibility of family and government
in the up-bringing and education of young people.  Parents are obliged to take
care of the physical and mental development of the child, to properly prepare
the child to work for the well-being of the society, according to his/her
abilities, and to jointly decide on essential matters affecting the child. That
both parents and government have rights and duties toward education and care of
young people is further emphasized in the Education Law from 6 September of
1992.  <p>
<p>
	Generally speaking, the role of authorities is to help parents in the
fulfillment of their parenthood role.  From the point of view of laws on health
and social care provided to family and children by the State, Poland is ahead
of many highly developed industrialized countries.  For example, families in
which at least one parent is employed (single parent families included) receive
various forms of social assistance, such as the following:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> an allowance at the birth of a child;<p>
 <li>a monthly family allowance of 167,000 old Polish zlotys ( 7 USD) for each
child from birth until the age of 21, on condition that the child is still in
school. (From 1995, only the families in which the per capita income is lower
than 50% of the average monthly salary will be eligible for this allowance,
while the allowance will be increased to 10 USD);<p>
<li> a 16-week paid maternity leave for the first child (18 weeks leave for the
second and other children);<p>
<li> a 36-month unpaid further maternity leave, with the guarantee of return to the
same job, but only if the mother returns to work before the children is 4 years
old;<p>
 <li>two paid days off work per year for child care, but only for those taking a
monthly family allowance;<p>
 <li>an allowance for those bringing up a disabled child;<p>
 a 60-day fully paid doctor`s leave in case of child`s illness (from 1995 it
will be 80% of the average monthly salary);<p>
 <li>foster families that take care of a disabled child requiring specialist
medical care are entitled to 100% of the average pay;<p>
 <li>the Polish State guarantees free medical care (hospitalistion, vaccinations,
medicines at discount prices included) to all children from birth until the age
of 18 and, in case of students in higher education, till the moment they become
self-supporting;<p>
 <li>the Polish State ensures free medical care to pregnant women and mothers of
small children;<p>
 <li>families with low incomes may be granted a periodic allowance from local
social help authorities taking into account circumstances of the case.<p>
</ul><p>
	Further, privately owned companies and businesses are obliged to observe the
regulations of the Labor Code and Family and Guardianship Code which lay down
the rights and duties of employers and employees.<p>
<p>
	These regulations are the remainders of previous highly centralised and over
protective State policies.  As a result of the new economic realities, with the
huge deficit in the central budget (about 80 billions zlotys), and protective
policies toward some segments of the population (agriculture, State
enterprises, and privileged individuals), the State cannot meet its obligations
as spelled out in the regulations.  As a result, the quality of public health
care is very inferior due to a  lack of and out-dated medical equipment, poor
access to the public health service, corruption of the NHS staff resulting from
low earnings and low morale. Also, while the family and child allowances still
exist, they are extremely small.<p>
<p>
	The possibility of a paid maternity leave and aid to foster families should be
regarded as achievements. This is particularly true of the foster family policy
as it encourages families to adopt a child.  The paid maternity leave policy is
not as well utilised.  Fewer and fewer parents decide to take a 36 month leave
in fear of losing their job and because they cannot afford to do so. Therefore
more and more babies are cared for by relatives or are placed in creches at the
age of four months.<p>
<p>
	Some say that the Polish society owes much of the social care situation to
various social and political events. For example, the long unpaid maternity
leave was introduced as a result of the strikes in 1980, and the NHS employees`
strikes last year (1994) ended with pay raises for those in the social sector
(6% above the real inflation rate and not the planned inflation, as proposed by
the government). The inflation rate was underestimated intentionally for
various reasons, but primarily to lessen the strain on the budget. In effect,
expenditure on health care will increase but not enough to radically improve
the quality and accessibility of the services. An example of a decrease in
services is the fact that not long ago the monitoring of the vaccination
calendar was done by local health centers.  Now, because the centers no longer
can afford postal stamps, they cannot send notices to families reminding them
of the vaccination dates.  This means that it is mothers who have to remember
about vaccinating their babies and preschool-age children.  One can imagine
that, as a result, many small children will not be vaccinated against childhood
diseases. (Appendix, Table 6)  The consequences are easy to foresee.<p>

<p>
<b>III. 	THE FORMS OF FULL AND PARTIAL CARE PROVIDED BY THE STATE</b><p>
	<p>
	Under the Educational Law of 7 September 1991, the system of care and
education provides for the existence of institutions of partial and full care
and education.  Within the first category belong creches, preschools and
schools.  In the second are small children`s homes, children`s homes, foster
families, care centers for children and young people, and child emergency
centers.  What follows is a description of these institutions.<p>
<p>
<i>A.	FORMS OF PARTIAL CHILD CARE FOR CHILDREN UP TO 4 YEARS OF
AGE-CRECHES/NURSERIES</i><p>
<p>
	One can speak of formal and informal partial care for children up to four
years of age. <p>
Informal care is the care given by a mother on maternity leave, and the care
provided by relatives like grandmothers, when mothers are working. There are no
statistical data on the number of children in this form of care or the number
of family creches, where mothers who take care of their own children look after
the children of their neighbors or friends and are paid for that by the child's
parents.<p>
<p>
	Among the institutional forms of child care provided to children of up to four
years of age there are:<p>
<p>
<ol>1.	creches or nurseries for children from the age of 3 months up to 4 years.
The number of children within the so-called creche age group has been steadily
decreasing.<p>
2.	private nursery schools (or preschools) which cater for children between two
and four. Because they are few, it can be supposed that the number of children
under their care is insignificant.<p>
</ol><p>
<ul>	1.	WHO FOUNDS, RUNS AND FINANCES CRECHES?</ul><p>
<p>
 	In the fifties and sixties creches were founded by health departments of the
State administration - the Ministry of Health and Social Security - at the
local level.  After 1970, when changes were introduced into the health services
management, creches came under the Department of Health Care,   i.e. local
representatives of central administration.<p>
<p>
	Up until 1992 child care institutions for small children were financed from
the State budget.  At the beginning of 1992 creche management was taken over by
local governments committees.<p>
<p>
	The decentralisation of the management of child care and education
institutions, creches included, had both negative and positive consequences.
One negative consequence of creches being financed by communes is that many
creches have been closed down, but not always those with too few children.
Another source of creche financing is parent fees. Previously symbolic, they
are so high at present that some parents cannot afford them and prefer
noninstitutional forms of child care.  Parent fees cover the full cost of meals
and extra activities, and parents pay a parents' committee fee. In some
communes there is an extra fee for toys, toiletries etc.  The communes take
upon themselves the staff salaries, current repairs and equipment.<p>
	<p>
	As for positive changes resulting from local management, they consist mainly
of higher technical and sanitary standards of creche buildings, better
provision of toys and equipment, and more openness to parents.  Parents can
stay in a creche together with their child, not only during the days or weeks
of the adaptive period, but also after it.<p>
	<p>
	 The distribution of creches is uneven. They are most numerous in large
industrial areas like the districts of Warsaw ( which has 61 creches), Katowice
(79 creches ), Lodz (39 creches) and Krak&oacute;w (29 creches ).  In
agricultural areas the numbers are distinctly lower: in the Biala Podlaska
voivodship there are two creches, in the Chelm district there are 3, and in the
Zamosc voivodship there are 4 creches.<p>
<p>
	There are both small (for up to 40 children) and large (up to 82 children)
creches.<p>
<p>
	<ul>2.	CHILDREN IN CRECHES</ul><p>
<p>
	Since the seventies the number of children up to age four in creches has been
systematically falling.  During this time the long, paid maternity leave (16 or
18 weeks) with legally guaranteed return to the same working position was
introduced, and it was being used.  Prior to that time the children in creches
were those whose parents earned the least, studied or were single.<p>
<p>
	For various reasons the demand for creches fell drastically in the eighties
(45%). (See Table 2)  Social and economic factors were crucial. Many mothers
lost their jobs and now could look after their children themselves after an
18-weeks maternity leave following the birth of a child. A large number of
mothers took advantage of the unpaid maternity leave for ideological reasons.
There was pressure from opinion makers who emphasized the role of family,
woman`s self-fulfillment as mother, the importance of parenthood and child`s
early experience for his/her further development. Some women who received the
family allowance gave up work.  The family allowance amounted to the difference
between their salaries and creche fees.<p>

</pre>
<p>
	In 1993 the population of children of up to 4 years of age was 2,666,556.  At
that time there were 73,848 children (i.e. 2.8% of all children of up to four
years of age) in 694 creches in Poland.  If one assumes that creche children
are primarily those below the age of three (the majority of four-year-olds
attend preschools), the percentage will grow to 3.5% of all children in this
age bracket (from birth to 3 year of age), which still means minimal
accessibility of this form of child care.<p>
<p>
	At the moment there is a slight increase in the number of 4 month-old babies
in the creches.  Their mothers are afraid of losing their jobs because
employers often ignore the law which makes them keep positions open to mothers
returning to work after a maternity leave.<p>
<p>
	The accessibility of creches varies. In some communes there is a surplus of
places, while in other districts, the situation is the reverse. Therefore, the
rule of admitting only children from the district to the local creche is no
longer observed.  Any child can be taken in by a creche, no matter where the
child lives.<p>
 <p>
	The social and economic status of the parents who use creches has changed over
time. Among children who attend creches are those of poor families and those
whose parents are employed illegally, but also children of people with
satisfactory earnings, who could afford a babysitter but consider the creche a
better and more reliable form of child care.  In general, the creches satisfy
parents expectations as a child care institution for small children.<p>
<p>
<ul>	3.	HOW DOES THE CRECHE WORK?</ul><p>
<p>
	 The general program or guidelines of educare work is prepared by a team of
psychologists, physicians and pedagogues employed by Mother and Child Centers
operating in each voivodship.  Creches are under medical and pedagogical
supervision of the Centers. Sanitary-Epidemiological Stations take care of
medical and sanitary conditions and establish alimentary norms. Detailed
curricula and plans of activities are made up by the specialists mentioned
above working in individual creches, in cooperation with the creche director
and staff that work with individual groups of children.<p>
<p>
	Creche hours are adapted to working parent`s needs. Parents working in shifts
have a possibility of putting their children into two-shift creches, of which
there are 22 in Poland, or weekly creches, which are only five in number in the
country.<p>
<p>
	Within the creche, children are assigned to specific age groups. The number of
children in a group and the number of staff depends on the children`s age.
Table 3 presents the pattern.<p>
<p>
<p>

</pre>
<p>
	For economic reasons employment standards are usually not observed.  There is
a constant shortage of money for the staff`s salaries, however low.  A worrying
phenomenon, noticed lately among the creche and preschool staff, is poor
motivation for work and lack of identification with the job, caused by
financial deficiency within the system.<p>
<p>
	In each creche there is a parents` committee whose activities are limited to
collecting fees and organising occasional festivities for children. Parents do
not participate in decision making concerning the creche work.  Information on
the creche or the children is put up on a notice board for the parents.
Creches do not provide any instructional work for the parents or families.
Communication between the child`s parents and the child's caregiver consists of
sporadic conversations while the parent is bringing or taking the child home
from the center.  <p>
<p>
	In cases of developmental dysfunctions, the child`s parents are sent to
psychological and pedagogical guidance centers, if these are available in the
area.<p>
<p>
<ul>	4.	QUALIFICATIONS AND IN-SERVICE  STAFF TRAINING<p></ul>
<p>
	Attendants employed by creches often have had no education for the job, but
only primary schooling (8 years of obligatory schooling).  Child workers have
elementary professional qualifications on the secondary level, but often do not
have a secondary school certificate as  previously this was not required by the
employer.  In each creche there is a full-time nurse.<p>
A physician and a psychologist usually take care of a few creches and work
twice a week (about 50 hours a month) in each creche.   Today creches do not
have any program of professional and personal advancement for their staff.
This was previously provided by Departments of Health Care.  It has not been
determined who should be responsible for the organisation and funding of such
activities.<p>
<p>
	CONCLUSIONS<p>
<p>
<ol>1.	The demand for places in creches in uneven.<p>
2.	The demand for creche services has been fully satisfied because many parents
do not seek this form of State assistance for economic, social and ideological
reasons.<p>
3.	There is a surplus of child workers who cannot find employment. Therefore it
would be worthwhile to consider the creation of a legal basis for developing
cheaper forms of educare for children of creche age which would offer work to
currently unemployed child workers who are graduates of secondary schools.<p>
4.	There ought to be forms of professional advancement for the personnel
working with small children.<p>
5.	The program of education of child workers should be supplemented by courses
preparing them to cooperate with parents, local authorities and local
communities.<p>
6.	The quality of provision for children up to 3 years of age should be
assessed.<p>

<p>
<i>B.	PRESCHOOL/KINDERGARTEN EDUCATION FOR CHILDREN 3-7 YEARS OLD </i><p>
<p>
	Preschool education in Poland in the years 1954-1990 can be characterised as
follows: centralization, legal regulations preventing autonomy and creative
work of institutions, limited access, uniformity of organisation, programmatic
and methodological solutions, with a stress on ideology.  In the whole system
of education, of which preschool was a part, the teacher was in fact an
"ideological officer",  not a guide and adviser in the teacher-child and the
teacher-parents /local community interaction.  The basic aim of the preschool
was to implement the curriculum during activities which were teacher-centered
and teacher-structured.<p>
<p>
	For many years now preschool education has been treated as the first stage of
the educational system and has had connections with primary education in terms
of its theoretical, methodological, psychological and pedagogical foundations.
However, this integration of the preschool into the formal system is not
reflected in relevant legal regulations or in the amount of State expenditure
on this particular stage of education.<p>
<p>
	The decentralisation of preschool management and differentiated management of
subjects has led to negative changes, like the rise in tuition fees paid by
parents and the resulting reduction of demand for early childhood care and
education provision. (See Table 4)   <p>

  in primary schools
</pre>
<p>
<p>
	The central education authorities do not demand professional advancement from
the teachers.  The State, which is responsible for this form of teacher
education, does not provide the finances for in-service training.  The cost of
available forms of professional advancement is covered by the interested
teachers, and sometimes refunded by communes.<p>
 <p>
	Nonetheless, there were also changes for the better: legal grounds were
created for the use of teacher-developed curricula and genuine cooperation with
parents; the preschools for 3-6 years old children and the kindergartens for 6
year olds were brought closer to the child`s needs; the responsibility for
education was shifted to the individual teacher, working in cooperation with
the parents.  These steps may result in the improvement in the quality of the
teacher's work and of the experience gathered by children. <p>
<p>
	However, many teachers and most parents do not want to and /or find it
difficult to cooperate to improve the accessibility and quality of work offered
by formal institutions of early childhood education.  After the years of
enforced ideological separation of parents from settings it is difficult for
both sides to achieve effective, (i.e. partnership) communication, free of fear
and prejudice. Although the program guidelines included cooperation between
preschool and parents, it does not exist in actual practice.<p>
<p>
	So far in Poland there has been no research on the quality of the institutions
or the quality of the child`s experience. It was the accessibility of the
institutions and not its quality that the educational policy focused on.  <p>
<p>
	In earlier years (during the 1950s through 1970s), the rate of women`s
employment was high, as a result of the family's financial need on the one hand
and the ideology which promoted women's emancipation, the equality of
opportunity and socialist education on the other.  During that time there were
not enough preschools to meet the needs of parents. In a kindergarten group
there were 30-35 or more children taken care of by one teacher.  The notion of
quality does not appear, even, in the present educational law (Act of September
1991 of Educational System).<p>
  <p>
<ul>1.	HOW DOES THE PRESCHOOL/KINDERGARTEN SETTING WORK?</ul><p>
<p>
	Until September 1990, most children going to the institutions of early
childhood care and education spent an average 8-9 hours a day in the company of
their peers, that is in groups of the 3-,4-,5-,or 6-year olds, and had three
meals a day (breakfast, lunch, tea) at the centre.  Today there are different
patterns of care:  children can attend programs that last for 5 hours; children
can attend programs that offer 5-11 hours of care.  In general, preschool
programs operate the longer hours; kindergarten programs for 6 year olds
operate for only five hours.<p>
<p>
	One teacher doing shifts cares for an average of 23 children in preschools and
16 children in kindergartens. (In the rural area there are 21 children in
preschool and 14 in kindergarten; in urban areas there are 23 in preschool and
16 children in each kindergarten.)<p>
	<p>
	In the morning the teacher would organize activities of 15-30 minutes
duration, depending on the age-group. Older children (aged 5-6) had two such
activities per day. The activities were organized, initiated, structured, and
held with the entire group. The teacher had the dominant position: references
to the children`s experience were made, but seldom. The children were just
performers of the teacher`s orders. The rest of the time the children could
play in the building (indoors) or in the garden (outdoors), and they were
completely free to initiate activities of their choice.  The teacher would only
intervene if a game posed a risk to the children`s safety.<p>
This prevalent style of work resulted from the ideology that the main feature
of education is to deny/neglect a person`s individuality, responsibility,
uniqueness and autonomy, his/her dignity, and the right to take decisions.<p>
   	<p>
	Beginning in September 1990, children's time was spent differently in
institutions of early childhood education, even though they were still divided
into groups according to age.  An early childhood education setting is obliged
to pursue educational activities within the so-called 'minimum curriculum'.
That is for 5 hours a day, which is the time necessary for implementation of
the basic contents of the Minimum Curriculum of Preschool Education.<p>
<p>
	Opinions on the Curriculum vary.  To some, it merely defines the minimum
duties of the child and the teacher who is to organize that child`s activity.
Others see it as the preservation by educational authorities of their control
over the functioning of settings, despite abolition of the more rigorous
manifestations of that control in previous years and the move toward
decentralisation. <p>
<p>
	The minimum curriculum contains the basic aims, tasks and content of preschool
education for children 3-6 years of age.  It informs the teacher about the
basic skills that should be developed in a child at preschool age, and not
about the specific content to be learned by that child. It can be said that the
minimum curriculum, also called the curriculum basis, focuses on the process of
development to a greater extent than the previous curricula.<p>
<p>
	Within the Minimum Curriculum the preschool is given responsibility for
performing their tasks in close cooperation with the family, helping it in the
child`s upbringing.   In the course of their work, the teachers should:<p>
<p>
 <ul><li>see to the children`s health and safety;<p>
 <li>support the children`s cognitive activity, provide opportunities for
experiencing and recognising their own self and the socio-cultural and natural
environment;<p>
 <li>initiate the children`s sense of identity and responsibility for their own
conduct;<p>
 <li>provide the conditions for development of the children`s potential
abilities;<p>
 <li>render special care to children with special needs.</ul><p>
<p>
	  Parents pay no fees for the 5-hour program, although they do pay for meals.
Not all of the children have all three meals at the settings.   While no
statistical data are available it is known that a considerable number of
children do not stay for the full time.   There are others who stay but who do
not partake of the meals since the parents are unable to pay for them.
Of the children going to kindergartens attached to primary schools, 85.6% of
urban and 81.9% of rural children do not receive meals.  In some cases they
bring a snack from their homes.<p>
<p>
	<ul>2.	WHO RUNS PRESCHOOLS/KINDERGARTENS?</ul><p>
<p>
	The institutions of early childhood education, that is preschool for the three
to six year olds and kindergartens for the six-year-olds, are elements of the
educational system.  The institutions are public or non-public.  They can be
established, run and financed by:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> a Minister or another agency of government administration;<p>
 <li>a commune or union of communes;<p>
 <li>other legal persons;<p>
 <li>a private individual</ul><p>
<p>
	Under the act on local government and the competence act, the communes are in
charge of the setting up, running and financing of preschools and kindergartens
(with the exception of schools for children with special needs).<p>
<p>
 	Public early childhood settings offer free care and education within at least
the <i>Minimum Curriculum</i> which specifies the time to be spent by a child
at the institution (5 hours a day), and the basic content to be taught.  A
child of six is entitled to a one - year kindergarten preparation before
entering primary school at seven. The preparation consists of stimulating the
child`s general development,  but first of all teaching the primary reading
skills and mathematical notions. <p>
<p>
	 On the basis of the <i>Minimum Curricula</i>, individual programs can be
developed, but they need the Minister`s approval to be applied at preschools or
kindergartens.  At present a teacher has the choice of the <i>Minimum
Curriculum</i> developed by the Ministry of National Education or three
parallel programs that have been approved by the Ministry.  The teacher can
also develop his/her own curriculum.<p>
<p>
	Preschools and kindergartens are submitted to pedagogical supervision by the
School Superintendent, who, for example, appraises the state and condition of
the institution`s activities in the fields of teaching, education and care, and
inspires the teachers to make educational innovations.  Recommendations
resulting from supervision may be imparted to the agencies that run the
preschool and kindergarten in question, e.g. the commune.  Other spheres of the
functioning of settings are supervised by commune authorities.<p>
<p>
	Non-public early childhood care and education settings can be established, run
and financed by legal and individual persons..  They are free to follow the
Minimum Curriculum or to use other curricula approved by the Minister of
National Education, if they choose to.  Preschools run by legal and private
persons can register their program in the registry kept by the local school
superintendent and obtain the status of public preschools if those who found
and run the program formally agree to observe the educational authorities`
regulations which govern the functioning of public preschools. The signing of
such an agreement guarantees funding by commune authorities up to 50% of the
cost of a child in public preschools.  (See conditions below.)<p>
  <p>
	Many private kindergartens of this type are run by convents. Parents`
participation in the expenses of the child`s attendance is lower in schools run
by convents than in a public preschool because the nuns are paid less for their
work, the preschool is housed in private convent buildings, and much of the
food comes from the convent`s own farms.  It is the children of poorer families
that attend these settings. There are 40 public preschools and 79
non-public/private preschools run by the catholic church and convents.   <p>
<p>
	In the years 1949-1960 all preschools run by convents were dissolved by the
communist government act. These unpleasant experiences sometimes prevent the
nuns from informing authorities about the existence of a preschool.<p>
<p>
	About 400-450 preschools do not have any legal status, as they have never been
registered with the local educational authorities.<p>
<p>
<ul>	3.	WHO FINANCES PRESCHOOLS/KINDERGARTENS?</ul><p>
<p>
<b>Public Preschools/Kindergartens</b><p>
<p>
	Public preschools are administered and financed by local government
committees. The financing scheme is regulated by the Educational Act, which
recognized preschools and public schools as budgetary entities conducting
financial management according to procedures defined in other provisions. This
means that preschools cover expenditures from their own revenues.  Preschools
are financed from:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>the general subsidy received by the communes from the State budget and set in
accordance with objective criteria defined in a separate law;<p>
<li> the commune`s own revenues;<p>
<li> parents` payments for children`s meals, extra activities, and so-called extra
fees if a child attends the preschools for more than 5 hours a day.</ul><p>
<p>
	The fee is set by the commune in consultation with the preschool. Parents pay
additional fees for Parents Council and equipment, toiletries etc. The payments
made by parents vary widely and depend on the revenues of the preschools from
its own economic activities, the commune`s budget, the time a child spends in a
preschool, meals a child is provided for, etc.,but does not depend on the
parents' monthly wages.<p>
	<p>
	<p>
<b>Non-public Preschools/Kindergartens</b><p>
	<p>
	Non-public preschools are financed by the parents or other private sponsors.
These preschools may apply to the commune for additional funds up to 50% of the
current per pupil expenditures incurred in public preschools or schools of the
same type, under the condition that by no later than 30 September of the year
before the year for which the application for a subsidy is filed, the person
operating the school presents the planned number of pupils to the body
empowered to grant the subsidy.  (This is seldom applied for and/or paid.)<p>
<p>
<ul>	4.	PUBLIC AND NON-PUBLIC INSTITUTIONS</ul><p>
<p>
    	In Poland in 1993, there were a total of 20,840 public and 338 non-public
institutions of preschool education . (See also Table 5).  Thus at this point
non-public institutions account for only a small percentage (1.6%) of the
preschools.<p>
<p>
	Until the 1980s, early childhood care and educational settings were run only
by: LEA (central administration); local State enterprises such as State farms
and agricultural cooperatives; and central offices, such as Ministries of
Transportation, National Defense, or Internal Affairs.<p>
For several years now there has been a trend towards liquidation of early
childhood care and education settings run by enterprises, State Farms and
agricultural cooperatives. There were 985 such institutions in 1983.  As the
State withdrew its subsidies from cooperatives and State Farms, most
enterprises, faced with bankruptcy, resigned their social responsibilities with
respect to their employees, education being among these.  In 1983, after the
Solidarity movement and liberalisation in the sphere of education, there were
36 private preschools; 3 were run by religious congregations, 29 by the
Children`s Friends Society, and four by other social organisations. (see Table
6)<p>

<p>
<p>
	Also taken into consideration here should be the small number of full-time
preschools for rural children at different ages.  The closing down of such
institutions is accompanied by a distinct growth in the number of 5-hour
working kindergartens for six year olds to which younger children are also
admitted. No statistical data on the actual size of this population are
available.[3]<p>
<p>
	Left out from the above two tables are integrated preschools and preschools
with integrated classes for mixing groups of impaired children with those
showing proper developmental dynamics. Preschools for impaired children or
children with special needs are run and financed by governmental units, LEAs.
Increasingly such institutions are being established; the principles of their
functioning are regulated by a relevant ordinance of the Ministry of
Education.[4]<p>
<p>
	Many public preschools saw organisation of an integrated class as the way to
escape liquidation planned by the commune, since this would guarantee continued
funding.  Such preschools are now faced with many difficulties. Neither the
teachers nor the institution`s infrastructure nor the local authorities are
prepared to pursue this type of activity.<p>
<p>
  	Worthy of attention is the considerable number of preschools run by Church
people, a proportion of which have the status of public settings.<p>
<p>
	In sum, it seems that nursery schools with the status of public institutions,
run by individuals and organisations ease the local governments of some of
their responsibility in this sphere. As a necessary condition for the emergence
of such preschools, however, legal regulations have to be introduced
encouraging various organisations, foundations and individuals to establish
such institutions and facilitating their management, through, for example, tax
reductions or regular grants from the budget of communes.<p>
<p>

<a name="fn2">[3]</a>     There is a real need for a survey concerning these
children.  For example, who takes care of them after preschool or
kindergartens?.<p>

<ul>5. CHILDREN AT EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS</ul><p>
  	<p>
	In 1985, there were 2,692,900 children at preschool age; in 1991, there were
2,452,200, and the number dropped further to 2,257,894 in 1993.  (As follows
from demographers` forecasts, the number of children at that particular age
will go up again in two years time.)  The number of children going to
preschools has dropped regularly year by year.  However, in terms of the
percentage of the age group attending preschool, there was consistency from
1973 to 1990.  1985 can be called the year of triumph of the preschool lobby,
with 50.2% of children going to preschool.  (See Table 7 for data on the number
and percentage of the age cohort attending preschools/kindergartens and Table 8
for a presentation of data on urban/rural distribution.)<p>
	<p>
	Beginning in 1991 there has been a distinct decrease in the number of children
going to preschool. 1990 was the year when such institutions were taken over by
communes, preschools run by enterprises were closed down, fees for preschools
education rose, and the decrease in the population meant there were fewer
children of preschool age.<p>

	Table 8 also suggests that since the 1980s there has been fairly consistent
rural/urban representation, with 2/3rds of the preschool population being based
in urban areas and 1/3 in rural areas. <p>
	<p>
	There are different patterns of attendance in preschool/kindergarten programs.
In 1993 the population of children at preschool age of 3-6 years of age who are
offered services of the system of care and education adjusted to their age and
stage of development amounted to 2,300, 411, including 988,694 (43.3%) in rural
and 1,311,717 ( 56.7%) in urban areas. Table 9 presents data on the number of

</pre>
<p>
<p>
	As noted, there are two patterns for attending preschool/kindergarten.  There
are programs that operate 5 hours a day and those which are open 5-11 hours a
day. There has been an increase in the percentage of children attending
full-day preschool programs for 3-6 year olds.  <p>
Table 10 presents data on children's pattern of attendance in these two
settings.<p>
<p>
	What the table demonstrates is that the majority of settings in rural areas
operate for only 5 hours (75%).   In contrast, 86% of the urban programs
operate between 5 and 11 hours a day. While there is a slightly higher
percentage of rural children in part-day 5 hour programs than full-day (52% vs.
48%), there is a much larger percentage of urban children in the full-day
programs than in part day programs (94% versus 5.7%).  What this means is that
urban children have greater access to full-day programs. A highly negative
phenomenon is the limited access to full-time preschools in rural areas, where
the number of children in need of stimulation can be supposed to be much
larger.<br><p>

	In Table 11, there is a presentation of data on children's attendance in
preschools (offering programs for children 3-6 years of age), compared to
children attending kindergartens (only for six year olds). Those attending only
kindergarten (6-year-olds for a 5 hour day) has been decreasing.  It should be
noted that the recent drop in the proportion of children going to kindergartens
is caused by the present low population for 6-year-olds, not by greater access
to full time preschools for younger children or by their actual greater
attendance. <br><p>

</pre><p>
<p>
	What Table 11 illustrates is that in urban areas the majority of children are
attending preschools rather than kindergartens (91.7% versus 8.2%).  In rural
areas, there is equal attendance at preschools and kindergartens (50% in both
instances).<p>
<p>
	Public preschools are attended by children of firstly, people with higher
university education, and secondly those parents who have college or secondary
school education. A small percentage (only 5%) are children whose parents have
completed or incomplete primary school education.<p>
<p>
	The high employment index for women quoted earlier (85.9%) is worrying when
compared with data on the percentage of children in preschool.  Only 984,331
children (42.6% of the age group) are going to public and non-public
institutions of preschool education.   How are the others being cared for? Are
the Polish mothers free to fulfil their own professional and personal needs
confident that their children stay in a high-quality stimulating preschool
environment?   With concerns about their children, can these women really
contribute to the country`s economic development?   It seems that the answer to
these questions has to be, No.<p>
 <p>
	Unfortunately, no statistical data are available concerning the
number/proportion of working and unemployed women whose children go to
preschool institutions.<p>
<p>
	The following can be concluded from the above discussion:<br><p>
<ul><li>six-year olds have the highest scholarisation rate in early childhood
education programs, with close to 100% attending;<p>
<li>the remaining age groups, the youngest children of 3-4 years of age in
particular, are included in preschools education to a minimal extent only, both
in rural and urban areas;<p>
<li>the scholarisation rate at full-time (course) preschools is much lower in
rural areas;<p>
<li>more needs to be known about the situation of children who are not in
preschools or kindergartens.<p>
<p>
	6.	WHO TAKES CARE OF CHILDREN IN PRESCHOOLS/KINDERGARTENS?</ul><p>
<p>
	Article 4 of the Act on Educational System states that "in his activities in
the sphere of teaching, education and care, the teacher shall be guided by the
pupils` interests, the care for health, and also by respect to their personal
dignity".<p>
<p>
	According to law, the preschool and kindergarten teachers have the same
rights, duties and salaries as teachers involved in primary education at levels
I-III  in primary school.  Although the regulations included in the "Teacher`s
Charter", which defines the rights and duties of teachers and the conditions of
their employment, as well as the rights and the duties of the State, are still
obeyed by the local governments running preschools, there is a well-founded
fear among the teachers that the situation may change for the worse. <p>
<p>
	There are already differences in relation to hour load and social status. The
hour-load is 18 hours for primary education teachers; 25 for preschools
teachers of the younger age groups; and 21 hours for kindergartens teachers.
In terms of social consciousness, a preschool teacher is perceived as a
guardian and educator rather than teacher. Such is also the perception of
preschool teachers among many parents and decision-makers. Such opinions are
further consolidated by the low salaries of preschool teachers, by historical
conditions related to the employment of unqualified persons in early childhood
settings in the past, and by the lack of social understanding of the importance
of early experience for a person's life span. In a study of the parents`
educational expectations, it was found that they treat preschools primarily as
an institution engaged in care and upbringing of children.<p>
	<p>
	In Poland, contrary to many countries of European Union, decisions of the
educational authorities have resulted in the lowering of the status of
preschools teacher, not its enhancement. The change in the teacher's status
occurred when preschools were taken over by local governments in 1990.  The
educational decision makers did not provide for all the consequences of the
decentralisation.  Today autonomous communes can decide about the working
conditions and salaries of teachers who are financed from the communes` budget.
Preschool and kindergarten teachers are employed and paid by communes.
Teachers of primary and secondary schools, and the staff of children`s homes,
small children`s homes and care institutions are financed from the State
budget.  As a result, the teachers of 3-6 year-old children are viewed as the
commune`s servants, the teachers working at all other levels of the educational
system are civil servants.  A total of 71,234 teachers now work at nursery
schools.<p>
<p>
	The system of training nursery school teachers is constantly changing.  Many
of the graduates from the two-year teacher training colleges enter schools of
higher education (pedagogical colleges or university); alas, a large proportion
choose other than pedagogical faculties. <p>
<p>
	At present, the training offered is at so-called post secondary teachers
colleges (three year courses) as well as pedagogical colleges at the university
level (five year courses) and pedagogical faculties at universities.  Two-year
teacher training colleges are disappearing.  Graduates from these institutions
constitute the largest group among preschools teachers---48,407 persons or 67%
of the teaching force;  19.6% have other pedagogical training; with 13.4 %
having no training.<p>
<p>
	It should be noted, however, that there are enough people that have been
trained as preschool teachers (77,917).  Nonetheless preschools have to employ
many teachers specialized in other pedagogical fields since many of those
actually specialized in preschool education take jobs at other schools and
educational institutions.  In essence 37.9% of those trained as preschool
workers seek work elsewhere.  Some reasons for that are: better pay in those
places than at preschools; closeness of the work place to home (very important
when you have young children); and hours of work (many preschool teachers work
at primary schools where the work time is 18 hours per week; in preschool it is
23-26 hours.)<p>
	<p>
	The nursery teacher profession is extremely feminized, women constitute 99.3%
of teachers at this level.<p>
	<p>
	The following characteristic features of the structure of level and type of
education of preschool teachers can be observed:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>a considerable proportion of persons are without professional qualifications
to work at the preschools; those who lack any pedagogical qualifications
whatever are 13.4% of the workers;<p>
<li>there is a decided prevalence of teachers educated in preschool pedagogic at
the level of the two-year teachers training college over other levels of
education, Master`s degree included;<p>
<li>the preschool teacher drop-out rate is 38%.  This includes those who do not
work at preschool although they have qualifications to do so.<br><p>
<p>
<p>
	CONCLUSIONS</ul><p>
<p>
	The child`s living conditions and quality of experiences in the sphere of
development and education depends on many factors. These include: the economic
and psychological situation of the family; the economic situation of the agency
that runs educational institutions; and the pedagogical consciousness and sense
of responsibility of individual persons in regards to proper functioning of
those institutions.  Thus any discussion of preschool care and education should
include an understanding of selected social phenomena that determine the
current state of preschool education, its accessibility, the quality of the
services offered, and the number of children who receive educational
stimulation. <p>
<p>
	In terms of social consciousness, the function of a preschool has always been
that of caring for the child while his/her parents are at work.  The other
functions, such as stimulation, education and correction are noticed less
often.<p>
<p>
	Unemployment is among the variables that reduce the families` demand for
educare for young children.  <p>
<p>
	Another element that forces the families with children at preschool age not to
avail themselves of the services offered by nursery schools was the closing
down of such institutions after they were taken over by local governments which
lacked the necessary professional and legal preparation as well as funds to run
them.  They were taken over by local governments on 1 September 1990.  From
then until 1993, 4,709 (See Table 4) preschools were closed down, urban and
rural ones alike, mainly those run by school superintendents` office, State
enterprises and Farms, or agricultural cooperatives.  	The reduction of demand
for the services rendered by preschool resulted also from the rise in tuition
fees paid by parents.<p>
	The only changes for the better to be deduced from a comparison of statistical
data for  the year 1992 with the present situation concern a growth in the
number of rural kindergartens for 6 year old children.  This might suggest that
the tendency, present since 1991, to take the six-year-olds away from
preschools, has been checked and parents are now forcing local governments to
organize kindergartens, attached to primary schools, to fulfill children's
rights under the educational act which obliges communes to secure for the
six-year-olds a place at a preschool or kindergarten.   In the years 1992-1993,
1,255 kindergartens were established, while nearly 5000 preschools were closed
down.  This may also mean a trend to open kindergartens at the expense of
full-time preschools. It is difficult to say whether this results from "ill
will" on the part of local governments or from the reduced demand for preschool
provision by the local community, due to such factors as unemployment and/or
the rise in fees.  So far, this phenomenon has not been studied.<p>
<p>
	In many studies into the effects of preschool early experiences on children's
development, it appears to have the greatest impact on children from
socio-economically and culturally neglected environments where the family
proves unable to develop the child`s abilities. Where the child`s experiences
are limited, preschool education has the greatest effect on development. The
conclusion does not seem unduly general that in today`s Poland, such children
have the smallest access to the educational services offered by the
preschools.<p>

<i>C.	THE STATE INSTITUTIONS OF FULL CARE</i><p>
 <p>
<ul>1. THE FORMS OF FULL CARE INSTITUTIONS RUN BY LEA`s</ul><p>
<p>
	Within the system of full care, local educational authorities ran the
following institutions for children under age 7 in 1992/1993:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>51 'small children`s homes'  (homes for children 0-3 years of age), with 3,000
places, formerly under the Ministry of Health and Social security and
transformed into educare institutions by the Educational Act.</ul><p>
<p>
The change of the sponsor has led not only to a shift from care only, to care
and education in the homes` priorities, but also to some practical consequences
for the employees, i.e. new requirements concerning their education and
qualifications.  At present there are:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>289 children`s homes, with 14,300 residents, and 234 family children`s homes
for 829 children-natural and social orphans, i.e. those parents who either
cannot/are not able or do not want to take care of their own children; <p>
<li>52 child emergency centres for 2,814 children which provide safety for
children whose health and life are endangered or who need isolation from their
natural, dysfunctional families.</ul><p>
<p>
	According to the court verdict, the children from these emergency homes either
return to their families or are put in full care institutions.  In addition
there are:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>two children`s villages with 189 places, run by the Association of Children`s
Families SOS in Poland;<p>
<li>30,113 foster families caring for 38,650 children put there by the LEAs. <p>
<p>
	2. CHILDREN`S HOMES</ul><p>
<p>
  	Children`s homes are an institution which take care of children and young
people who cannot be cared for--permanently or temporarily--by their own
families.  Children`s homes replace the family, provide care and education and
conditions for development adequate to the child's needs, and prepares the
child for independent life.  The goal of the home is to ensure proper
conditions for mental and physical development and to fulfill emotional needs,
thus compensating the lack of family home.<p>
<p>
	 According to the educational law, small children`s homes, for the children
between the ages of a few days and 3-4-years, and children`s
homes for older children till the age of self-dependence at 18-19 years of age
(See Table 13)  are founded, run and financed by the Ministry of Education and
local (voivodship) educational authorities.  There are also several children`s
homes where a child stays from birth till the age of 18.<p>
<p>

</pre>
<p>
	Before, small children`s homes were run by the Ministry of Health, and
children`s homes for the older children by the Ministry of Education and
voivodship educational authorities.  The process of decentralisation in the
management of care institutions runs parallel to the same process in education.
However, although local governments did not oppose their taking on the
responsibility for kindergartens (many of the primary schools were also taken
over), they are not able to carry out the task of running child care
institutions: first, because in full care institutions there are children from
all over the country: second, because State subsidies for partial educare are
still decreasing.<p>
<p>
	These two reasons discourage local government from taking over schools and
other education and care institutions. Therefore, for economic reasons, State
educational authorities were forced to take over the children`s homes.  Within
the State educational authority it is possible to ensure the continuity and
direction of educational work in all education and care institutions.<p>
<p>
<ul>3. WHO FINANCES THESE INSTITUTIONS ?</ul><p>
<p>
 	The institutions of full child care are run by the body of State
administration--voivodship educational or social authorities--and financed from
the central budget. Since 1992 full care institutions have been financially
independent.  That is, they can apply for additional funds from other sources
(e.g. private foundations and companies, which get tax reductions of up to 10%
of the donation), to cover so-called social needs,  (A higher tax reduction
would probably encourage more donations.)   Funds for-so-called social needs
can be used for various purposes. <p>
<p>
	The institutions manage their finances on the basis of the Ministry of
Education's Instruction ( No 156 of 28 June 1994).  Parents pay a very small
fee, based on 25% of the national average salary. In practice, it is impossible
to enforce the payments.  So far there have been no laws which would oblige
parents to pay, proportionately to their financial situation, for their
children`s stay in child care and resocialization institutions.<p>
<p>
	The budget of a full child care institution is prepared on the basis of
so-called  "Organisational Chart of the Institutions" made by its management.
The chart includes, for example, the monthly cost of child support, building
repairs, equipment, etc. The daily board of a child is calculated to meet a
child`s calory intake and the current prices of food.  The cost of a child`s
monthly support varies from 5 million in old money to 10 million old money
depending on the region and other factors like current prices, the cost of
services, the state of the building, etc.<p>
<p>
	The annual budget received from LEAs is spent in the following way: 71% goes
to staff salaries and associated expenditure,  e.g. social security, (48.5% of
monthly salary), taxes (21% of monthly salary); 14% is spent on repairs; 6.5%
covers the food expenses and 7.5% are spent on medicines and chemicals like
cleaning powders, etc. <p>
<p>
	In one of the small children`s homes I visited, I was told that the resources
provided by the local educational authority never meet the needs.  For example,
there is not enough money to buy clothes for the children.  (Under the Ministry
regulation, each year children should receive 250% of the national average
monthly pay for clothes and pocket money.)<p>
<p>
<ul>4. CONDITIONS FOR ADMISSION TO CHILDREN'S HOMES</ul><p>
<p>
	Children are taken in by care institutions on the basis of a court decision or
an administrative decision. The former case concerns children whose parents
have been deprived of parental powers or whose parents have limited parental
powers. The latter case applies to:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>children admitted by the application of parents who are not able to care for
the child because of financial problems, single parenthood, etc.;<p>
<li>children left by their mothers in hospital after childbirth;<p>
<li>lost children, admitted to child care emergency centres.</ul><p>
<p>
	 In each of these cases the children`s home is responsible for a child to a
different degree.  In the first case, only the court can change the decision.
In the second case, it is the institution that takes full responsibility for
the child, e.g. when putting it up for adoption.<p>
<p>
<ul>5. CHILD CARE EMERGENCY CENTRES</ul><p>
<p>
	There are 52 child care emergency centers in Poland, with 2,814 places. These
are institutions of safety for those children whose life and health are
endangered, who have to be isolated from a dysfunctional family, who have run
away from home or got lost. (See Table 14 for data on number of centres and
children involved.)   The children cannot stay in these centres for more than
three months. After that period, at the latest, the child is either returned to
the natural family or taken in by a full child care institution, following the
decision of the diagnostic and qualifying board or the court.<p>

<p>
<ul>6. CHILDREN IN FULL CARE INSTITUTIONS</ul><p>
<p>
 	The population of children in various forms of full care reflects the whole
spectrum of social problems.  Children come from families that are
educationally dysfunctional or inefficient, caused by alcoholism, mental
illness or unemployment of the parents, difficult living conditions, mental
disability, lack of acceptance and social isolation. The residents of small
children`s homes are more and more often children who are placed in these homes
as the result of the anti-abortion law.  These are children who are not wanted.
They are left in hospital at birth, or brought by teenage and single mothers
directly to children`s homes.<p>
<p>
	In small children`s homes there are also under-age mothers with their small
children, thrown out of their family homes, unaccepted by the society.  Often
residents include pregnant women who are minors, single, and unable to support
themselves. The objective of taking these women in is to help the mother to
assume her responsibility for the child instead of abandoning the child to the
State.  The mothers who stay in children`s homes take care of their children
themselves.  If provided with appropriate skills and resources that would allow
these women to live independently,  e.g. housing, financial allowance and,
later, a job, many of these mothers would undertake the task of bringing up
their children themselves.  However, the Polish law does not provide such
resources.   <p>
<p>
	"Homes for single mothers",  having been founded by convents or the State,
perform similar functions. They help lonely, deserted women in their difficult
situation before the child is born.  They provide a safe place for the mother,
save the children from abortion, and provide a "home" after childbirth.<p>
<p>
	As a principle, small children`s homes do not admit mentally handicapped
children, but there are many older handicapped children in these homes because
there is no place for them to go  after they are 3 years old.   Children with
special needs over the age of 3 are taken in by child care homes run by the
Ministry of Labor.  There are also private homes for blind, deaf or mentally
impaired children.<p>
<p>
	The children admitted to the children`s homes reflect the country`s social
problems. For example, nine months after the former Soviet border opened,
children were born in Poland of Russian origin.  The children are subject to
Russian, not Polish law. Their legal status causes many problems at the moment
of adoption or putting a child into a foster family. Usually the child`s mother
is ready to renounce her parental rights, but the Russian authorities in Poland
do not grant their permission and the child stays in a children`s home with its
legal status unsolved.<p>
<p>
	 Another group of children under 7 who live in children`s homes are neglected
children whose parents do not fulfil their basic duties.  An example is a child
who does not start school at the obligatory age of 7.  The school informs the
authorities, and if admonitions do not help, eventually the child lands in a
children`s home. The situation is similar when parents do not bring their child
for compulsory vaccinations, medical examinations, etc. <p>
<p>
	Children over the age of 10 in such institutions often change schools,
teachers or surroundings, and have increasing difficulties at school.  If a
child has educational or behavioral problems, the school is obliged to
cooperate with the parents. If there is no such cooperation, caused by the
parents` or teachers` ill will or incompetency (pathological, educational or
financial inefficient families), the child is directed by the school to a
centre for psychological and pedagogical assistance.  The centre usually
prescribes individual education and contact with the family.  These
recommendations are often neglected by the school for various reasons, e.g. the
lack of ability to cooperate with the family, the heavy didactic and
administrative load of the teacher, high pupil/teacher ratio (about 30-35
children in a group).  In consequence, the child is sent to a children`s home
as neither the family home nor the teacher is able to carry out the increased
duties.<p>
<p>
<ul>7. HOW DO THE FULL CARE INSTITUTIONS WORK?</ul><p>
<p>
	The administrative policy of the institutions (i.e. fees, hours of operating,
the child-teacher and child-worker ratio and the conditions of the child's
admission), is defined by the director, according to the Ministry`s
instruction.  The director`s decisions are limited by the above mentioned
instruction and the financial means at his disposal.<p>
<p>
	The program of work/daily routine in a small children`s home is defined by the
director and pedagogical council and confirmed by the LEA.  Pedagogical
supervision is exercised by the LEA.  Sanitary and health conditions are
controlled by sanitary-epidemiological stations.<p>
<p>
<ul>8. WHO LOOKS AFTER THE CHILDREN?</ul><p>
<p>
	 The number and qualifications of employees of full child care institutions
are defined by the Educational Act of 7 September 1991, and the Ministry of
Education`s Instruction no 156.  These are based on the number of resident
children and their needs.<p>
<p>
	 Usually small children`s homes and children`s homes employ medical personnel,
nurses, teachers and child-workers, attendants, administrative and ancillary
staff.    Medical staff consists of pediatricians and consultants like
neurologists, orthopedists, and radiologists. There are also psychologists (1
to 50 children); social workers who keep contact with natural, foster and
adoptive families;  pedagogues (1 to every 100 children); methodologists;
instructors of gymnastics and physiotherapy; and also a director, secretary,
accountant, and other administrative staff.<p>
<p>
	The personnel employed is 50% less than the regulations require due to
financial restrictions.  For example, in a small children`s home I visited
there were 135 children (the home has 130 places for children and 4 places for
mothers).  According to the legislation, one child-worker and one nurse should
take care of 6 children, while in the home visited they have to care for 12
children.  There were only 35 instead of 64.5 child workers; 4 teachers instead
of 13.5;  35 nurses instead of 65.5; and 1 pedagogue. There was no driver and
no car, which makes it difficult to transport children or purchased food. There
are twelve voluntary workers (students of the 5th year of child care pedagogy
at the University in Warsaw).<p>
<p>
	Although there are many people who would like to work on a voluntary basis,
the director rarely accepts their offer as permanent and continuous care is of
primary importance for the establishment of emotional relationships which will
assure proper emotional and social development of the child. <p>
<p>
	 There are no statistical data on the qualifications of the employed
personnel--the specialists like physicians, nurses and psychologists--yet these
people have been trained. Of concern is persons employed as child workers.  A
high percentage do not possess proper qualifications.  Some of those with
qualifications do not have a secondary school certificate.<p>
Such a situation was acceptable when small children`s homes were managed and
financed by the Ministry of Health.  <p>
<p>
	With the change in sponsor and the new regulations, the demand is that child
workers  have a secondary education and a secondary school certificate which
entitles them to take professional advancement courses.  The new requirements
concerning the professional status of a child worker have also caused financial
problems.  Currently, many child workers are not only being employed in lower
positions but they also receive lower pay.  Therefore there is a need for an
amendment to the new regulations concerning employment and financing of child
workers that would consider the interests of those who have 20-30 years of
practice, since a secondary school certificate was not required before.<p>
<p>
<ul>CONCLUSIONS</ul><p>
<p>
	The evaluation of the organization of full care institutions for children and
young people (partially or completely deprived of parental care), and the
conditions for the proper development, preparation for independent life
provided by them, lead to certain conclusions:<p>
<ol>1.	In some regions the number of places exceeds the demand, in other regions
the situation is the reverse.  Many children with court verdicts can not be
admitted into child care institutions because of the lack of places.<p>
2.	Many LEAs who run the full care institutions do not know if and to what
degree children's needs are being met.<p>
3.	The general level of professional qualifications of the care institutions'
staff is unsatisfactory (sometimes described as low), which results in the
wrong diagnosis of children`s mental and physical needs and lack of an
appropriate individualised approach to the child. <p>
4.	These homes suffer from faulty management and supervision and improper
recording systems and use of records. <p>
5.	There is no systematic diagnosis of children to establish the developmental
potential of the child and to define the individual approach.<p>
6.	The housing infrastructure is unsatisfactory as most full care institutions
are located in ancient, sometimes several-hundred-year-old buildings, adapted
for the purpose and usually in need of repair.<p>
7.	There have been recorded shortages of basic equipment and negligence in
relation to sanitation, hygiene and fire safety (almost 100% of the
institutions do not have fire alarms), and the feeding and clothing of
children.<p>
8.	Gross offenses related to the lowering of food norms (quantity, quality,
calorie and nutrient contents) have been documented.</ol><p>
<p>
	Generally speaking, the institutions of full child care do not have sufficient
support from the government educational administration and their financial
means are insufficient. The funds at their disposal are used primarily to
maintain the full complement of personnel, with little regard for other needs,
such as building maintenance, equipment, didactic materials, and clothing for
the children.<p>
<p>
<i>D.	ADOPTION</i><p>
<p>
	In Poland there are about 50 adoption centres, two of which are authorised to
take care of adoptions abroad.  The adoption centres are run by LEAs or are
privately owned. The laws in force now allow anyone to open an adoption centre
after registration with the local educational authority.<p>
<p>
	The children put up for adoption are those whose parents have been deprived of
parental rights by a court verdict.  Around 40% of children`s homes residents
are adopted.  At present, about 400 foreign families are waiting to adopt
Polish children.  Under the current law, Polish families have priority.  Polish
families willing to adopt a child would like it to be healthy, both mentally
and physically.  Foreign families adopt every child they are able to. The
majority of children adopted by families from abroad are children with special
needs.<p>
<p>
	The association "Chance" is starting a program of <i>contract familie</i>s,
with the aid of the "Children and Young People`s Foundation".[5]  In this program, children who are in
children`s homes are outside their natural families temporarily.  Their parents
have not renounced their parental rights, nor have they been deprived of them
by the court.  Children are put temporarily into<i> contract families </i>till
they become independent or return to the natural family, rather than remaining
in children's homes. As a result of the association`s promotion campaign in the
mass media many potential families expressed an interest in joining the
project. They would receive pay for child care consisting of two elements:
mother`s pay and child`s allowance,  amounting to 100% of the national average
pay in the case of families taking care of children under 2 years of age and
80% of the national pay in the case of older children.  Only Polish families
can become contract families as the children under their care are not available
for adoption. <p>
<p>
	The project will make it possible to lessen the psychological and social harm
suffered by children deprived of the natural family`s care, and to lower the
expenses of children`s homes which are shared by the whole society via the
State budget. A transformation of this program from an experimental into a
systemic solution would be desirable. To this end more financial resources
should be employed to promote the idea in the society and to encourage families
to take on this form of child care. The authors of the project count on the
positive effects of the enterprise, the social support of families, and the
financial support of institutions and individuals for continuation of the
program.  The initiative seems sound and its failure, due to the lack of funds,
would be unfortunate.<p>
<p>
<a name="fn4">[5]</a>     The foundation provided the financial resources for
the educational programs for the prospective contract families. It is not known
if the Ministry of Finance will find money for contract families.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV.	OTHER ORGANIZATIONAL FORMS OF FULL CHILD CARE</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i>A.	CHILDREN&#146;s VILLAGES/FAMILY CHILDREN&#146;S HOMES</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	 Other forms of full child care are children's villages and family children`s
homes. Children`s villages are based on a model developed by SOS Kinderdorf
International, and operate under a 1978 agreement between SOS Kinderdorf
International and the former Ministry of Education and Instruction.  Here 6-9
year-olds children are cared for by "mothers" (single, childless women) and
together they form a family who lives in a one-family house in the SOS village.
These forms of child care have not developed well, primarily because they
operate separate from the local community.  A systematic decrease in the number
of children`s villages has been noticed. They were founded (the first one in
the fifties) by young teachers or pedagogues who have a different conception of
child care from what is found within Polish society. There are only two
children`s villages at the moment.<p>
	<p>
	Another model, family children`s homes, are financed by the Ministry of
Education.  Before, some of them were sponsored by the Society of Children`s
Friends, an organisation not connected with the government, although sponsored
by the State. Family children`s homes provide care similar to that of the
natural family as there are usually from 6 to 12 children there.  Unfortunately
the number of family children`s homes has been constantly decreasing, primarily
because of the limited resources.  Money is supposed to come from LEAs, but the
money is not there.  In 1994 there were only 132 family homes serving 786
children.  This small number does not begin to meet the need.  (In 1994 there
were 14,618 children in children's homes.)  Something should be done to change
these proportions.<p>
<p>
	A promising form of child care are the newly-founded family children`s homes
organised like a hostel, where a few older children run their house themselves
with the help of a teacher (for example)  who acts more like a foster mother
than an official guardian. The aim is to encourage the development of
self-reliance and independence of the children and their integration with the
neighborhood community.   At the present time the children in these homes are
regarded by community members with suspicion.  The people feel threatened by
the children, who are regarded as a potentially criminal population.  The
latest observations would suggest that relations are improving between
children`s homes and local communities. <p>
<p>
<i>B.	FULL CARE INSTITUTIONS RUN BY CARITAS -POLAND</i><p>
<i></i><p>
  	The association Caritas-Poland is involved in extensive work in child
care.[6]  Creches, preschools, small
children`s homes, children`s community centres and homes for single mothers are
among the institutions they run which bring aid to the poorest and those in
need. Small children`s homes, children`s homes and community centers are run in
agreement with the local educational authorities, while homes for single
mothers and children`s community centres are provided based on an agreement
with the local representatives of the Ministry of Labor and Social Affairs.
All the institutions are financed from the State budget, via the voivodship
authority. Their functioning is based on the Educational Act and the Social Aid
Act (homes for single mothers) under control of appropriate educational and
medical services.[7]<p>
<p>
	Economic arguments favour the existence of such forms of educare. They are
less expensive because they are housed in convent buildings and the nuns`
earnings are lower. A problem is pedagogical qualification of their personnel
and their professional advancement.  This issue should be solved as soon as
possible if we want children to receive appropriate experiences in relation to
their individual and cultural needs and experiences.<p>
<p>
	In 1993 Caritas-Poland were operating 29 homes for single mothers. According
to the data of Caritas there are 150,000 single mothers in Poland), 4 small
children`s homes for 200 children, and 70 children`s homes in Poland.  Caritas
children`s homes also take care of children with minor disabilities over the
age of 3 until they become self-sufficient. <p>
<p>
	Although children`s community centres exist in many places, there are no
accurate data on the number of centres, the number of children being served and
the kind of program offered because they are founded according to local needs.
There are no regular hours of stay for children, who get a meal there and care
in their parents` absence (on full or partial basis).<p>
<p>
	Social assistance homes are for children with major disabilities. Similar care
is provided in Health care homes (sanatoriums) run in agreement with the
Ministry of Health and Social Welfare, for children who are normally mentally
developed but physically disabled.<p>
<p>
<a name="fn5">[6]</a>     There are other religious communities that run
institutions of full and partial care and education for young children, but
their work it is not so broad and it does not have such wide repercussions to
the society.<p>
<a name="fn6">[7]</a>     The legal basis of private (for example run by
convents or churches) schools and educare institutions is the Educational Act
of 7 September 1991, and its executive regulations. The institutions are
registered with the head of LEA which also sends children to them.<br><p> 
<p>
<p>
<b>V.	GENERAL CONCLUSIONS</b><p>
<b></b><p>
	 Within a system of educare provided to children from birth till the age of
seven (i.e. the beginning of obligatory schooling), there are different forms
of full and partial care.  The former include small children`s homes,
children`s homes, single mothers` homes, care institutions and foster families.
The latter include creches, preschools and kindergartens.<p>
<p>
	  The above listed forms of full care are founded and administered by the
Ministry of Education, Ministry of Health, and Ministry of Labour and Social
Affairs, all financed from the central budget. <p>
<p>
	Creches, preschools and kindergartens are set up by local governments which,
together with the parents, cover most of the expenses.  In the case of creches
and preschools the fees are quite high. The central budget provides only
minimal financial support.  <p>
<p>
	In terms of all the services for young children there is inadequate financial
support.   For financial reasons the norms concerning the equipment, the number
of staff and the child-teacher ratio are not followed.  Inadequate financing,
along with poor management systems, leads to negative consequences.<p>
 <p>
	If the institutions did not get financial aid from other sources (a few
individual sponsors and the income from their own economic activities, like
nursery schools), the resources of the central budget or local funding would
result in services of even worse quality.  <p>
<p>
	There is no system of professional advancement for teachers and staff (about
33 % of preschool teachers do not have appropriate training). The in
service-training that is available has to be paid for by the individual
interested in receiving training.   In a few cases it is being paid by the
LEA.<p>
<p>
	 In the nineties the number of full and partial child care settings decreased,
particularly the latter category. The number of homes for single mothers run by
the church, in agreement with the Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs, has
increased.  <p>
<p>
	There has been a significant drop in the number of creches, preschools and
kindergartens caused by many factors:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>the bankruptcies of State industrial enterprises and State farms which ran
many nursery schools;<p>
<li>rising unemployment in families with children under six;<p>
 fee increases, (up to 1992 parents paid monthly fees of 10% per capita income,
extra activities fees and, theoretically voluntary but actually obligatory,
Parents` Committee fees.  Since 1992 parents have been paying the full cost of
the child`s meals, a Parents` Committee fee, extra activities fees, and
so-called <i>group </i>or <i>special fees</i> towards the cost of equipment);<p>
<li>delegation of the running of child care and educational institutions to local
governments that are unable to carry out the tasks imposed by the State which
supports only a minute part of the local budgets.</ul><p>
<p>
	The funding of creches, preschools and kindergartens is provided within the
framework of so-called total subvention or general grant received by a commune
from central budget, and not a definite purpose grant as is the case for
compulsory education.  In this situation child care and education are neglected
by many local governments that have to allocate available resources to other
more important (according to them) needs of the local communities.<p>
<p>
	When exploring new directions in the future work on medical, social and
educational assistance given to families with young children by the State one
should, I suppose, consider the following problems:<p>
<p>
<ol>1. 	Increasing the availability of child care for children under five by
setting up family creches and preschools for children of various ages, run by
well-qualified people like mothers of young children or unemployed mothers,
which would be available in addition to more expensive forms of preschool
institutions.  The mothers would be trained, employed and paid by the communes,
with parents and local governments sharing the financing;<p>
<p>
2. 	Establishing workable sanitary, medical and pedagogical supervision of such
creches and preschools to ensure proper and good/high quality provision;<p>
<p>
3. 	Creating a system of in-service training and systematic, ongoing
supervision of children's activities;<p>
<p>
4. 	Creating an efficient, real and workable method of parental involvement,
which so far does not exist;<p>
<p>
5. 	Raising family allowances proportionately to the number of children and to
Western European country standards;<p>
<p>
6. 	Creating a legal basis of obligatory preschool education for children over
six (over five in the future).  For the time being it is not obligatory for
parents to send six-year-olds to kindergarten nor for local authorities to fund
such provision. This transitional form of educare should be managed by the
local government and financed from the national budget.  (Such approaches have
been taken in some countries, e.g. France, Sweden and Denmark.)  This would
make preschools more available to 5-year-old children, who, in 1993, made up
only 21% of the whole preschool-attending population;<p>
<p>
7. 	Undertaking research to identify the forms of care provided to the majority
of the Polish children who do not attend creches or nursery schools;<p>
<p>
8.	Creating more effective regulations and financial support for potential
foster and contract families to make the process of adoption easier and fast.</ol><p>

                    <b>I. INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
	For a number of years UNICEF programs have been expanding from purely child
survival concerns to include components which foster the healthy psychological
and social development of children. This is in recognition of the fact that
physical survival and early psycho-social development are interdependent in
intricate ways and that the intellectual and emotional aspects of a child's
life should not be separated from his physical well-

being.<p>
<p>
	Any program which aims to assist deprived or disadvantaged children must be
based upon information concerning the nature of the deprivation. As background
for child survival programs we are by now well-

equipped
with data concerning malnutrition and other health problems in west Africa. We
must likewise have an understanding of the psycho-

social
realities of the West African child if we are to effectively intervene in this
area of his life.<p>
<p>
	It would seem that the identification of children who are at risk
psychologically and socially must take into account existing child-

rearing
practices, the society's expressed goals in raising children and its beliefs
about the potential and nature of children. We would suggest that assistance
programs are most effective when they are built upon current, local attempts at
coping with the situation at hand, and thus sociological and psychological data
of this nature must be obtained and used. The young parents who need help in
adapting to the new modern situation need to feel that some traditional
practices have positive value, and that their attempts to integrate change into
their child-

rearing
practices are based on essentially sound instincts.<p>
<p>
	A young child is completely dependent upon the care given to him by his
caregivers and any study of the conditions in his environment must take as a
basic element the child-

rearing
habits of his caregivers. We attempt in this paper, by way of a framework/model
and also many examples, to suggest areas of investigation into existing
practices and patterns of child-

rearing
in West Africa.<p>
<p>
<p>
                  <b>II. B A C K G R OU N D  R E M A R K S</b><p>
<p>
<b>A. Child-

rearing
during a time of rapid social change</b><p>
<p>
	It is probably safe to say that the goal, whether explicit or implicit, of any
human society is to provide the social and physical contexts which maximally
promote the intellectual, emotional and social development of its children. In
a situation of gradual social mutation where a basically integrated, intact
society operates according to long-

established
cultural norms and social values, any modification of the context, whether in
terms of goals or of the economic and social system, operates to produce
gradual changes in childrearing practices which are not overly perturbing
either to the child or to the culture. The problem in the present-

day
situation is that a process of very rapid social change is taking place
throughout west Africa, triggered by many factors: the move from subsistence
economies to cash economies; the continued development of cash crops to the
detriment of food crops; the migration of rural populations to the cities; the
effect of prolonged drought and crop failure; and the establishment of modern
institutions such as primary, secondary and university education and elaborate
civil services. The desire to participate in modern society has radically
changed the child-

rearing
goals of families, and the need to develop new skills in order to cope with
urban life and with formal schooling has had a profound effect on how children
are being cared for. This is apparent in the rural sector as well as in the
urban context.<p>
<p>
	Rural to urban migration places not only the immigrating urban family under
stress -

-

often living in crowded conditions in a slum or shanty town -

-

but also the rural community which has to cope with having many fewer
productive adults. In both types of communities the families which are coping
with such rapid change undoubtedly still have the best interests of their
children at heart but in many ways they are overwhelmed by the consequences of
the change and find that accepted child-

rearing
habits and previously held values are no longer operational. Any attempt to
intervene on behalf of the children being raised in these contexts must focus
on helping parents with their adapting skills. The starting point of such an
effort will be what the parents already know and practice in raising their
children. Arguments can no doubt be made for the introduction of different child-

rearing
techniques and strategies to help meet the new goals and the unfamiliar
exigencies of modern life. However the solutions cannot be totally foreign to
the families and communities responsible for the raising of the children.
Caretakers have parenting skills which are based on what their culture has
taught them about parenting; thus they innovate and adapt their child-

rearing
practices from the starting point of their own culture. Young parents who find
themselves in an unfamiliar situation need support not only from the outside
but also from knowledgeable adults of their own culture. Certain positive
traditional practices which are perhaps no longer being encouraged might need
to be reinforced. And since each culture has its own particular child-

rearing
customs as well as its own beliefs and attitudes to uphold these, programs to
aid child development and to educate caretakers must take into account this
diversity and be adapted to the different child-

rearing
goals and ideals of each culture within the country or region.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B. The diversity of West African cultures</b><p>
<p>
	In the following discussion we will make sweeping statements such as "many
West African cultures" or "in most West African societies" . It is obvious that
there are certain similarities among cultures that live within contiguous
geographical zones. However, we would not want to overemphasize the homogeneity
of West African societies. There are far-

reaching
parameters which underline very basic differences, and which, at the very
least, must be taken into consideration when planning educational programs :
Islamic vs. Christian vs. traditional religions; patrilineal vs. matrilineal
social organization; agricultural vs. pastoral societies; and forest vs.
savannah vs. sahelian ecological zones, to name only the most obvious. In each
country research must be carried out to discover the different elements which
are important for understanding child-

rearing
practices, The following discussion is not intended to obliterate diversity,
but rather to provoke questions in looking for it.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. Early prevention instead of later intervention</b><p>
<p>
	The first-

two
years of a child's life are as crucial for mental development as they are for
physical development. When traditional child-

rearing
practices no longer efficiently correspond to modern realities or when a
breakdown in the social structure of the family or community prevents
caretakers from following. Their best instincts and normal practices, the child
receiving deficient child care is at risk not only of encountering obstacles to
his physical development, but also of
being deprived of adequate conditions for healthy psycho-

social
development. Preventing deprivation during this important early childhood
period makes "recuperation" unnecessary later on in the child's life. Assuring
that parents are as aware of the psycho-

social
needs of their children as they are of their physical needs means that the
generation of care-

givers
who are making the transition from a "traditional", familiar family context to
a "modern", sometimes unfamiliar, always evolving context will still be able to
produce psychologically healthy children. Strengthening the parenting process
at this early stage will hopefully reduce the requirement for remedial programs
later on in the child's life.<p>
<p>
<b>D. "Universal" evaluation of child development</b><p>
<p>
	It is not, however, as easy to assess psycho-

social
development, and deprivation, as it is to assess physical development.
Universal grids for the measurement of child development have essentially been
created using data taken from non-

African
societies. And much of the cross-

cultural
research on child development undertaken in Africa has as its primary purpose
to corroborate or refute theories based on Western child-

rearing
practices and ideals. Growth charts and other testing devices do exist for
determining physical development by evaluating the health and nutrition status
of a child, and these are considered to be universally applicable. However, at
present, there are few tests or other devices, which can yield indicators of
child psycho-social development that are not culturally biased.<p>
<p>
	The various measuring devices and scales which are held to indicate psyche-

social
"developmental milestones" of the normal child are all the result of research
done in the West, observing and testing Western children, and as such they use
categories and concepts of development which are deeply rooted in Western
cultural traditions. Although attempts are being made to reorient research and
to rethink basic categories and concepts so that new scales of normal child
development can be constructed that apply to non-

Western
societies, current testing devices must not be accepted and adopted as
universally appropriate screening tools. Similar criticism can be levied
against standard IQ tests (i.e., devices for testing levels of intelligence),
which are culturally weighted and culturally biased for middle-

class
Western society and thus inappropriate for testing children outside that rather
narrowly defined culture. <p>
<p>
<b>E. The identification of the child whose psycho-

social
development is &#147;at risk"</b><p>
<p>
	If it is not possible, using standardized measuring devices, to accurately
determine deficiencies in psycho-

social
development, then how is it possible to identify families and communities who
might need help in this area? How can children be identified who are
disadvantaged or deprived psychologically or socially? An obvious attempt to
find an answer lies in drawing a parallel between physical development and
psycho-

social
development. According to this thinking, the child who is at risk physically is
probably also at risk psychologically and socially. Just as prolonged and
persistent threats to his physical development lead to deficits which, as they
accumulate, become harder and harder to overcome, so unfavorable environments,
where the child's basic needs are not met, result in the cumulative effects of
psychological and social deficits such that a child has a difficult task in
catching up and later realizing his full potential in the modern world. This
view, we would argue, is potentially erroneous since in many cases the parallel
cannot be drawn.<p>
<p>
	There are generally accepted and rather clear notions of what constitutes a
child who is at risk nutritionally and medically: he is undernourished; he is
ill; and he does not measure favorably to expected standards for growth. Such
notions, although differing in detail from culture to culture, can be
considered to be universal. In any culture of the world a parent has defined
notions with which he distinguishes between the health or sickness of a child,
between one who is growing well and one who is not . There are terms for
illness in all languages, and usually there are concepts for illnesses typical
of childhood. Sometimes indeed, there are concepts and terms which correspond
closely to a Western, biomedically defined state of malnutrition. All parents
everywhere are conscious of symptoms of illness and disease, although similar
symptoms may be interpreted and diagnosed differently in different cultures.
What is considered to be a symptom of illness in one culture may not
necessarily be so in another. In many West African cultures, for  instance, a
depressed fontanelle is considered to be a symptom of a serious neo-

natal
illness. In Western medicine, the explanation is rather that a depressed
fontanelle is a symptom of dehydration, often due to excessive liquid loss
through diarrhea, Similarly, in western biomedical terms the excessive crying
of a newborn suggests a physical ailment, whereas for a Baule (Cote d'Ivoire)
mother it is more likely to suggest that the infant has come from the "other-

world"
with a message which needs to be interpreted by a specialist.<p>
<p>
	Nevertheless, Western science, which advances the universal biological basis
of illness and malnutrition, has been able to claim that its testing devices
and scales of normality for physical development are universally applicable and
non-

biased
for cultural categories, It is possible to unequivocally determine if a child
is sick or undernourished and to describe the conditions that 'led to these
states. Environments can be identified which, because of biological stress and
the failure to satisfy the basic physical needs of the child, threaten his
development. Out of this theoretical paradigm comes a very clear notion of the
child who is physically "at risk", who is disadvantaged or deprived, and it is then a fairly straightforward matter to
imagine the steps which need to be taken to counteract such deprivation and
improve the health and nutrition conditions of &#147;high risk&#148;
children.<p>
<p>
	The analogical error is made when the same economic and social parameters that
typify the environment of the child physically at risk are used to predict the
conditions in which children are psychologically and socially at risk.
Demographic and economic statistics are used to demonstrate that pervasive
poverty and harsh surroundings place a child's development in jeopardy.
Experience has shown that there are associated parameters which taken together
can be effectively used to predict the environment in which the high risk child
will be found: low per capita income; unequal income distribution; low adult
literacy rates; high infant mortality rates; low parental educational levels;
and large numbers of children per family (among others). But these parameters
cannot be blindly accepted to predict which children are at risk of being psycho-

socially
disadvantaged. A child growing up in a rural community in an environment where
his nutritional situation is precarious, where annual measles epidemics take
their toll, where malaria and other parasitic diseases may be endemic is
correctly defined as a child physically "at risk". But if he is part of a
family and a community which function in an integrated manner and which are
intact and well-

adapted
to local ecological and social contexts, that child is probably not "at risk"
in his psycho-

social
development. Yet middle-

income
children living in a clean, modern
home in an urban center may be. well-

fed,
immunized and free from disease without necessarily being in a situation that
is positive for psycho-

social
development.<p>
<p>
	Healthy physical growth cannot simply be assumed to assure healthy psycho-

social
growth. This would appear to be especially true for children of educated,
"elite", urban families in West Africa who are one generation removed from the
traditional society in which it was not the nuclear family who was solely
responsible for taking care of and socializing the child. Such parents may have
no model for raising their children themselves but may have nevertheless
abandoned, either deliberately or necessarily, traditional child-

rearing
practices. In fact, low income urban families who are clustered in crowded
slums may be able to create a situation for children which is more closely
related to traditional practices, values, and social environment than the more
prosperous urban families who live by themselves in relatively spacious, single
family dwellings, There thus needs to be a new definition of the child who is
"at risk" in the realm of psycho-

social
development.<p>
<p>
	Having made the point that we cannot equate the high risk environment for
psycho-

social
development with the high risk environment for physical development, it is
necessary to add that there is in fact often a correlation between the two. The
health and nutrition status of a child has an effect, either adverse or
positive, on his psycho-

social
development , and conversely, a child who is basically psychologically healthy
and socially integrated into a family is able to overcome health handicaps much
faster than a child whose psycho-

social
development is in jeopardy.<p>
<p>
<b>III.CHILDREARING PRACTICES</b><p>
<b>IN WEST AFRICA</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A. DEFINITION OF CHILD-

REARING
PRACTICES</b><p>
<p>
	What do we mean by the childrearing practices of a given society or ethnic
group? In effect we are talking about the customs used by members of that
society in raising and taking care of their children. These customs are
integrated into the everyday life of the society and not necessarily given
conscious thought nor easily articulated. Rather they are often taken for
granted. The explanation for a certain practice might be that it is inherently
"natural" or "correct", Although there is obviously room for individual
variation in the practice of social customs, we are talking about practices
which are generally shared by the society as a whole. They can be seen as a
society's answers to the problem of dealing with a child of a certain age in a
given setting. In fact, they are strategies for responding to children's needs,
for encouraging their development.<p>
<b>B. THE CONTEXT OF CHILD-

REARING</b><p>
<p>
	In order to get a total picture of the strategies used in raising children in
present-

day
West African societies we must look at, not only how people have traditionally
brought up children in a given culture, but also how practices have changed in
response to diverse factors, such as the pressures of modern life, rural to
urban migration, formal education, and greater participation of the parents in
a cash economy. The examination of both the child-

rearing
practices of a society and the change in these practices must focus on two
other aspects of the total picture: a) the physical and social setting in which
the child is brought up; and b) the attitudes and beliefs of his caretakers and
the other adults of the society towards children and their care. Taking into
consideration these other aspects helps us understand, on the one hand the
adaptive function of certain child-

rearing
practices in a given setting and, on the other hand, the reasons these
practices may be abandoned or changed when the setting changes or when
attitudes and beliefs change.<p>

                   Childrearing practices


*These three elements are similar to the three components of the "developmental niche"", a theoretical framework developed by Super  and Harkness for studying the cultural context of the micro-environment of the child (1987).
</pre>
<p>
	<b>Physical environment</b>. The immediate physical environment of the child
clearly has a direct impact on certain child-

rearing
practices. In hot climates where few clothes are worn by the child and also by
the mother, there is often close skin-

to-
skin
contact between mother and child. Some studies have sought to show that this
creates a more intimate attachment bond between mother and child. In societies
where food acquisition requires the mobility of the mother (or other
caretakers) and the free use of the hands, babies are often carried on the
back. Other physical, aspects of the child's environment can have an impact on
child-

rearing
practices, such as a high prevalence of disease and parasites or the
precariousness of the food supply. In many West African cultures children are
expected to forage for "children's food": nuts, wild fruits, grubs, termites,
mice, or small birds. They learn this behavior, not from adults, but from other
children. Although adults often do not consider these things to be
&#147;food&#148;, this does not alter the fact that they are important sources
of nutrients for rural children and thus partially compensate for deficiencies
in the diet provided by the caregivers. The difficulty in obtaining these items
when the
family lives in an urban context can have a potentially detrimental effect on
the child's nutrition status, but is not consciously taken into account by the
parents since they are often unaware of the important role such food plays in
the child's diet.<p>
<p>
	<b>Social environment</b>. Equally important as the physical environment of
the child is the social environment. The daily routine of a child takes place
in a social setting peopled by members of the community. It is in recurrent
interaction with these people that the child learns appropriate social
behavior, that he discovers the need for and has the opportunity to practice
certain behaviors. In short, it is the various elements of his social setting
that give the child the essential information for the "acquisition of culture".
It has been observed that in most African societies little importance is
placed on verbal interaction between caretakers and young children, and much
speculation has been put forth as to how this may affect the development of
productive language competence and subsequent performance in school. However in
a typical village setting, and even in the urban situation to a certain extent,
a young African child, hearing all day long the various intricacies
of elaborate greeting systems arid rule-

governed
speech events among the adults, learns at a very early age about subtle
differences in social status and may master elements of the greeting system
long before an American child knows how  to say more than "Hello". The social
environment of the typical African village child is rich in people and rich in
experience. He is in effect constantly stimulated in his environment by
interaction of many types: in addition to his parents, many adults have the
right and responsibility to correct and encourage him; his peer group, which is
large, with members coming and going, provides constantly changing stimuli.
Contact with the next older generation of children, from whom are often
recruited his caretakers, provides him with an important source of countless
elements of culture (for instance, when to laugh, how to react to
ridicule, how to forage for food, how to make slingshots, how to flirt with the
opposite sex, etc.).<p>
<p>
	It is not necessarily the case that every one of these ecological and social
factors must be taken into consideration when we examine a particular child-

rearing
practice, but rather that any one of them might be important in understanding a
given practice, its adaptive function for the society, and its vulnerability to
change.<p>
<p>
	<b>Beliefs and attitudes</b>. The other element upon which we want to focus
when we are examining child-

rearing
practices involves the attitudes and beliefs of the caretakers. Whereas it
might be true that most child-

rearing
customs are uncritically practiced without individual rationalization, they are
usually associated with specific, socially posited beliefs as to their
significance. Each culture, for instance, has its own way of characterizing the
stages of childhood and for defining characteristic behavior of each stage. In
some West African societies a newborn is considered to be unable to see or to
hear. Likewise, a young child who has relinquished his place on his mother's
lap to his next younger sibling and joined the ranks of his peers may be
considered ready to fend for himself and to participate in family chores. Adult
members of the society will be able to articulate a certain number of
principles that govern child-

rearing
practices, or "explain" them in terms of what a properly brought up child
should be like. For instance, a belief among certain Akan groups of Cote
d'Ivoire and Ghana that some head shapes are more esthetically pleasing than
others leads to manipulation and moulding of an infant's head.<p>
<p>
	However, not all attitudes and beliefs are explicit, and it is in looking at
other aspects of the culture that one might find explanatory beliefs for a
particular custom of childcare. Among
certain ethnic groups of central Cote d'Ivoire, children are given daily enemas
from birth onwards. When adults are asked for an explanation of this practice,
they will variously say that it
is to "wash out the insides" of the child, or that it is a way to administer
medicines for different reasons. A few may say that it is done So that the
child will not soil his caretaker. It is in understanding the attitude of the
society to the dirtying nature of faeces that one obtains a clearer picture of
the importance of controlling the defecation of an infant. Whereas, in these
societies anyone may urinate in the village (behind a house or in a bath
enclosure), and a baby&#146;s urinating on an adult is considered to bring good
luck, all responsible children and adults have learned to leave the village in
order to defecate. Children just learning this behavior are allowed to defecate
on garbage middens, which are at the edge of the village, but nevertheless
outside the village limits. Before a baby can learn this behavior his faeces
are still considered to be dirtying, and
this accounts in part for the ritual of induced defecation by enemas. Among the
Yoruba, on the other hand, both the urinating and the defecating of an infant
on an adult are considered to be
fortuitous (Sannoh 1986).<p>
<p>
	Universal behaviors and development processes in children do not provoke the
same adult reactions in all societies. Rather these reactions are governed by
interpretations based on the particular belief system of the society. Jerky
hand movements of a newborn in response to a touch on the face may be seen as a
sign of health and strength for an African mother, whereas an American mother
might be concerned that the movement implied a worrisome lack of motor
organization of the infant (Super, 1986). Other neonatal research in Africa
shows that some cultures consider newborns to be fragile and easily threatened
by rough handling or stimulation, whereas other cultures see babies as hardy
and not in need of special handling ( de Vries and Super
1979, Dasen <u>et al</u> 1978). Excessive newborn crying is considered by the
Baule to be an attempt on the part of the spirit of the child to transmit a
message from the other world from which he has just come. A diviner is thus
engaged to interpret the message, which may concern the child himself (his
identity, his name, his character, his taboos) or another member of the family
(personal field notes).<p>
<p>
	It should be emphasized that the three elements outlined above, the
child-rearing practices of a community, the beliefs and attitudes of the
caregivers and the social and physical environments of the child, are all
closely interrelated. Specific customs reflect the constraints of the physical
environment as well as the ideas held by the society as to the nature of the
child and his capabilities. Take for instance breastfeeding, which is practiced
throughout West Africa and for relatively prolonged periods. In pre-

modern
times, and in many rural communities today, a child was/is breastfed for
periods of up to three years. Elements of the child's physical and social
environment which are important in examining this practice are the
unavailability elf 'mother's milk substitutes or other baby food; the
unavailability of technology to feed infants with something other than the
breast (i.e. no feeding bottles); the constant availability of the mother who,
even if working, is still accessible; and the presence of substitute
caretakers, often young girls, who can follow the mother around and easily take
the baby to the mother. A change in any of these components can have a direct
effect on the practice of breastfeeding: the availability of cow's milk and
feeding bottles; the mothers job-

related
absence from home; the caretaker not being able or willing to take the child to
the mother, etc. Any of these changes can affect both the frequency and
duration of breastfeeding.<p>
<p>
	The attitudes and beliefs of the mothers and other adults of the community are
also important to look at in order to understand completely the role and
importance of breastfeeding in the life of the infant and in the eyes of the
society. Mother's milk, for example, may be considered to be the means by which
certain spiritual or cultural essentials are passed on to the child. In many
West African societies it is considered appropriate for grandmothers or other
uterine kin (I. e., blood relatives of the mother) to also nurse the infant.
Likewise it is usually considered "normal" that a baby have access to the
breast at all times, even at night. It is obvious that a change in any of these
beliefs and attitudes concerning breastfeeding, such as would come about
through contact with other ways of life and in contexts other than the
traditional village setting, would contribute toward changing the practice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C. STAGES OF CHILDHOOD</b><p>
<p>
	Each culture has a specific way of dividing up the phases of childhood, and
although different stages may not be explicitly named, they may well be
recognized and talked about in terms of respectively appropriate behaviors
attached to each one. In many West African societies, child developmental
stages are not directly tied to chronological age. The child is rather
described by his development: he walks; he talks; he has teeth; he knows how to
carry a message; he is responsible; he knows the truth. The child is seen as
what he is at that moment, not what he should be because he is a certain age,
An Igbo proverb says: "A child learns by taking one step at a time and with
patience he will eventually get there" (Makoju 1986). There may be great
cultural significance attached to the passing from one stage to another which
will be expressed in elaborate rites or initiation ceremonies.<p>
<p>
	Stages of childhood are not the same in every society. Among the Baule a
newborn infant is referred to as <u>banoman</u> or &#147;unripe child&#148;. At
about three or four months the child then enters the
stage referred to as <u>bakan</u>, "small child", where he remains until he is
considered developed enough to be called simply <u>ba </u>"child".This usually
occurs when he is around the age of five or six or when he is considered
responsible enough to carry out errands and be trusted to tell the truth. At
puberty, girls become<u> talua </u>"maiden", and boys become <u>gbaflen,</u>
"youth" (personal field
notes).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>D. THE PSYCHO-

SOCIAL
NEEDS OF A YOUNG CHILD</b><p>
<p>
	One of the truths held to be universal by specialists in child development is
that there are certain fundamental needs which should be met in any society and
in any context in order to ensure the complete and healthy psychological growth
of a child. These are: a need for attachment (to create a strong bond with the
mother or other primary caretaker); a need for physical and intellectual
stimulation; a need for security (to live in familiar, consistent and
predictable surroundings); and a need for exploration (to try out new things,
to play) (Myers and Landers, ms.).<p>
<p>
	In investigating the child-

rearing
practices of a given social group, it is important to explore each of these
areas to discover how the needs are met, for this can be very different from
group to group. And we would claim that in established, well-

functioning
societies these needs are adequately met, given that society's goals and
expectations for what constitutes a properly socialized adult. In modern-

day
Africa, however, with expectations and goals undergoing rapid change, and
social groups being radically redefined, these four basic needs are perhaps not
always adequately met. Considerable cross-

cultural
research has been devoted to the study of how child-

rearing
practices of non-

Western
societies satisfy these needs, For instance, two of these themes, attachment
and stimulation, have received considerable attention because of remarkable
differences between African and Western societies in these areas. And
discussions of potential deficiencies in the child-

rearing
practices of African communities often focus on a lack of certain kinds of
stimulation or encouragement of exploration. We will examine certain child-

rearing
practices which correspond to each of these needs, taking into account the
cultural rationale and context of the practices.<p>
<p>
	<b>Maternal attachment and alternate caretakers</b>. One of the most important
needs of the young child is an early psychological bonding or attachment to his
mother or primary caregiver. Psychologists tell us that this first relationship
is crucial in the development of feelings of security, trust in other people,
and a sense of self-

worth.
The child builds his expectations and strategies for subsequent relationships
upon his relationship with his first primary caretaker. The corollary to this
theory is that the absence of a strong, caring relationship in the first months
of life may jeopardize the child's later social and psychological development
or even impair his intellectual
curiosity.<p>
<p>
	What do we mean by attachment, and what are considered to be the required
behaviors necessary to promote successful attachment? Attachment is usually
defined as a close psychological bond between the infant and the mother which
is a result of constant caring, the exchange of affection, and a close loving
relationship. Admittedly this definition and theory it
reflects are based mainly on observation of Western families, but research in
different parts of Africa has shown that perturbations in the development of
attachment do create maladjusted, troubled children who are lethargic and fail
to develop either curiosity or socially interactive skills. Thus to the extent
that all human babies have a basic need for a primary attachment relationship
in order to develop into successfully socially integrated adults, we can assume
that each society has
its own child caring customs and attitudes which promote attachment.<p>
<p>
	Much has been written about the closeness of the mother-

child
bond in African societies: breast-

feeding
on demand; sleeping together, usually in skin-

to-
skin
contact, for the first year of life; and the constant availability of the
mother for the child. These behaviors and others are said to promote unusually
strong attachment between the child and his mother. Yet many researchers and
writers, both African and non-

African,
have pointed out an-

apparently
detached attitude that many African societies have towards newborns. An
examination of some of the beliefs and practices concerning new-

borns
is necessary to understand this seeming incongruity.<p>
<p>
	It has been stressed by many Western child development specialists that the
first few moments after birth are already important for the initial attachment
between infant and mother. They thus suggest the immediate placing of the
newborn on the mother's chest and putting him to the mother's breast as soon as
possible after birth. However, in many West African societies, the newborn
infant is laid to one side (on a mat or cloth) while the mother is tended to,
and is not paid much attention until the placenta has been delivered and the
mother is considered to be out of danger. During a Baule birth personally
observed by the author, two babies were allowed to die, undoubtedly in part
because of inattention (both were small, having trouble breathing and were
lying uncovered on the cold, bare earth during a dry season morning) because
the mother had not yet delivered the placenta. After an hour and a half of
ineffective massage, pushing and pulling, local medicines and much dialogue
with the spirit world, the mother was finally put on a bush-

taxi
for the local health center, an hour away. The babies were wrapped up and sent
along but they were dead on arrival. It might be added that for the Baule,
unlike some other West African societies, the birth of twins is a positive
event with few negative overtones. They were not left to die because they were
twins but rather because the life of the mother was in danger.<p>
<p>
	To make sense of such an event one must understand the  attitudes and beliefs
of a society concerning childbirth and  newborns. Although this may seem to be
outside the scope of an  examination of childrearing practices, these beliefs
form the basis for attitudes and behaviors in caring for the young child. Many
anthropological analyses of pre-

industrial
societies have pointed out the pervasive dichotomy which exists between nature
and culture, between that which is untamed, wild and non-

human,
but basic to life, and that which is structured, man-

made
and governed by social rules. The female/male dichotomy fits this scheme by
equating man with culture and woman with nature. Men are the ones who tame
nature, who make social rules, who keep the peace, who are the caretakers of
the society. Women, in their basic role as life-

givers,
are in close harmony and contact with nature. They are the primordial
connection between nature and the society (culture) of man. (Ravenhill 1976)
Many customs and beliefs point to this association of women with nature. There
are often special rules limiting contact between men and women
during menstruation,.a period when a natural function makes a woman socially
unacceptable. Among the Baule Kode the secret rituals of cleaning and
maintaining the life-

giving
water hole (outside the village limits, that is, in nature) is exclusively the
domain of women and cannot be attended by men on pain of death. Among many Akan
groups of Cote d'Ivoire, in times of
calamity, the most powerful ritual, used when all the men's rituals are
considered to be ineffective, involves women parading through the village in
their natural state, nude, and men are excluded on pain of death. Women also
often play essential roles in customs and rituals surrounding death and burial -


the end connection of humans with nature (personal field notes).<p>
<p>
	In many West African cultures childbirth is often considered to be a very
dangerous time for the woman, one in which she is in direct contact with the
unpredictability and uncontrolability of
nature. In some societies (Guro, Baule, Senufo, Yoruba, Ashanti) a woman
traditionally gave birth in a special place, sometimes the women's bath
enclosure, at or just outside the village limits, that is, in the domain of
nature rather than culture. The Baule have a euphemism for childbirth: "She has
gone to(a place) between life and death." The outcome is never sure. The
important thing is that she return safely. Whether she returns with an infant
or not is almost secondary, she can always try again. As a Ghanaian proverb
puts it "It is better to save the pot than to break the pot in attempting to
save the water it contains.&#148;<p>
<p>
	And so the unborn infant may be seen as a potential danger, a threat to the
mother. This is not to say of course that the child is in any sense unwanted,
for throughout Africa adults from any traditional society will often say that
it is good to have many children, that children are the wealth and security of
a family, endowing the parents with prestige and the ability to command respect
in the community as well as being an economic asset. In some cultures, spread
in an area from central Cote d'Ivoire to Nigeria, an especially high value is
placed on having ten children, there being special festive rituals on the birth
of the tenth child, who is sometimes given a special name. Among the Guro a
special rite has to be performed for a woman who has born her tenth child
before she can become pregnant with the eleventh, Children are considered to
come from God a pre-

christian,
creator God) in most west African cultures and he will keep sending them to a
family until something goes wrong (intervention of ancestors, malevolent
spirits, illness) or until he decides the woman has born enough (menopause).<p>
<p>
	Thus the birth of a child, although desired and celebrated, is not without
potential complications. The newborn is seen as a stranger who does not earn
acceptance simply by nature of being born. He has to prove, by acting like a
"normal" baby, that he is a human being and not a changeling. In the world view
of many West African cultures the newborn comes from another world peopled by
ancestors, by spirits, by the unborn and the dead. Because he is just newly
arrived from the spirit world, he often brings with him messages (which are to
be interpreted from his cries by a diviner). These may concern someone in the
family and once they are transmitted the matter is finished. But they may also
concern the special identity of the child himself, in which case he is saddled
at an early age with expectations (positive or negative) as to his character
and its associated behavior. The newborn is also considered to be able to
directly transmit bad luck to the family from the spirit world in the form of
serious illness, death or other calamity. This is especially true for infants
born in unusual circumstances. Thus for the Yoruba in former times, the
survival of both twins was considered to predict the death of a close family
member, Among the Baule (and other Akan societies of Cote d'Ivoire and Ghana)
certain newborns were not allowed out of the wash enclosure (the birthing
place) but were put to death by the birth attendants. These included infants
born with deformities (including teeth), or infants of the opposite sex of the
two preceding siblings.<p>
<p>
	The early days of an infant's life are considered tenuous. The ancestors or
spirits can recall him at any moment. Among the Igbo in former times, twins
were thrown away in the bush because it was a sign that evil spirits wished the
family ill luck and were seeking vengeance for concealed evil deeds by the
parents or family members. In cases such as these the mothers may refuse to
look at their newborns, not out. of cruelty but because nature has a definite
course and anything to the contrary is an abomination (Omali, quoted in Manley
1968).<p>
<p>
	After this initial stage of uncertain attachment to life, which is often
accompanied by a certain distance and noninvolvement on the part of the mother
and other carertakers, infants in most West African societies are showered with
attention and affection. There is usually a special ceremony which marks the
end of the first week of life, although among some societies the initial period
is four days for girls and three days for boys. The ceremony is not always
elaborate in all societies, but usually does include the coming out of
seclusion of the mother and infant, and the naming of the child. After this
official acceptance into the society of mankind expenses are not spared to buy
perfumes, powders, magic potions or amulets to keep the child in good health.
Whereas older siblings may not be clothed. Young infants often will be smartly
dressed. The infant is passed around among many caring adults, fondled and
admired by the whole family. As one Nigerian writer has noted, the babies are
fondled, cuddled and kissed more freely than in western societies (Sannoh
1986). The child's cries are immediately tended to. A Wan mother cannot wander
far from her infant without someone (usually a man) yelling to her "Your child
is calling!" In some societies, the Ebrie for instance, a mother is excused
from participation in normal daily activities during the first three months of
her child's life. Her exclusive activities are to eat, sleep and tend to her
child (personal field notes). In other, less indulgent, societies the new
mother may be expected to r&eacute;sum&eacute; her agricultural activities,
although perhaps in a limited manner for the first few months after
childbirth.<p>
<p>
	In most West African societies, the child is breastfed on demand and sleeps
with his mother, who can no longer sleep with her husband out of respect for
the very widespread custom of post-

partum
sexual abstinence. The new mother is not allowed sexual activity until, in some
societies, the child walks or, in others, until the child is weaned. (Each
culture hats its manner for explaining this taboo, but the most commonly stated
reason is that sexual intercourse contaminates the mother's milk and causes the
nursing child to become very ill). All-

night
breastfeeding on demand and constant daytime contact with a caretaker has a
direct effect on the sleep patterns of infants. Research by Super and Harkness
with Kipsigis infants has shown that while the average longest bout of sleeping
during a 24-

hour
period is eight hours for American infants of four months, Kipsigis babies
sleep for no more than an average of four hours at a time through the age of
eight months. Furthermore the total amount of sleep during a 24-

hour
cycle for the African and American babies differed markedly by the age of four
months, with the African babies sleeping on the average two hours less. These
data have interesting implications for "universal" claims that the infant brain
needs a certain amount of sleep time for proper development (Super and Harkness
1982).<p>
<p>
      In traditional West African societies infants are weaned relatively late.
Two to three Years of breastfeeding is considered the norm for societies in
Senegal, in Nigeria, or in Central African Republic, to cite a few examples.
For the Guro the ideal length of time for breastfeeding is still two and a half
years although women say that in former times weaning took place even later
(Tafforeau and Timyan 1987). Much has been made of the fact that in some West
African societies weaning is very abrupt, the family deciding from one day to
the next that the child should no longer be breastfed. The child to be weaned
is sometimes sent away from the mother; in other societies he is given bitter
medicine when he wants to nurse, in yet others he is scolded and rejected by
the mother. For many researchers these abrupt weaning practices are held to
have a direct and lasting impact on the mother-

child
attachment bond. According to some this contributes to widespread dependence
behavior and fixation on the mother by West African children and adults (Erny
1972). It should be pointed out however, that a) weaning is not abrupt in
<u>all</u> West African societies and b) that the child may continue to have
access to the breast after formal weaning has occurred (Wolof: Zempleni-

Rabain
1962, Baule and Guro: personal field
notes).<p>
<p>
	The overall picture of early infant nurturing in West Africa is one of
indulgence and strong attachment between mother and child and this is confirmed
over and over again in the literature on West African societies. Some
researchers have pointed out, however, that such indulgence is counteracted by
a pattern of "casual nurturance" (Levine, 1963) in which African mothers are
typified as having a noticeable lack of anxiety and emotional intensity in
their nurturing habits. The notion that the mother is expected to be the
exclusive caretaker of a young child is virtually non-

existent
in traditional West African societies. The baby belongs to the family and from
the day of birth throughout his childhood he will have surrogate mothers and
even surrogate breasts to take care of him. After the first crucial period of
assuring that the newborn infant stays in this world (from three months to six
months) the child is left for longer and longer periods with other caretakers,
often young girls (but also older women) in the family. Another factor which is
seen by some as exhibiting casual nurturance is an allegedly off-

hand
attitude towards feeding the child. Breastfeeding is done at any moment, in any
position, and the young child often feeds amidst much noise, jostling and
commotion. Once the child is considered able to eat he might be given a small
portion of food to eat by himself without ceremony or encouragement, or even
left to fend
for himself around a common pot with his older siblings. Even though in a few
societies (the Banda or the Egba, for instance) there is a traditional notion
of providing special foods for babies, in many societies the child is given
adult food as soon as he can chew, although his portions may often consist
mainly of the starch staple of the diet with very little protein or vegetable,
these being reserved for adults.<p>
<p>
	In traditional societies this pattern of casual nurturance could be seen as
determined by the necessity of the mother to participate in the food-

acquiring
activities of the family. But as it is an integrated part of the attitudes
towards infant and child care it is still intact in the current modern
situation. So that even in an urban context, where markets and a cash economy
give some mothers greater leisure time, one sees the same pattern of leaving
the child with a caretaker. Even in low income urban families mothers may use
any number of different strategies (bringing a sister or niece from the
village, "hiring" immigrant girls, using the services of a neighbor) to have a
caretaker for their children. And studies (Lloyd, 1970) have shown that among
the non-

working
mothers of the "elite" Nigerian class there is only a superficial shift away
from these traditional patterns of reliance on surrogate caretakers.<p>
<p>
	<b>Stimulation in early infancy</b>. As important as the subject of mother-

child
attachment and security in west African societies is the subject of early
infancy stimulation. The manner in which African infants are handled often
involves much sensoral stimulation. Carrying a child on the back or on the hip
with skin-

to-
skin
contact involves stimulation of many kinds. The vigorous bathing which an
infant undergoes in certain West African societies is a totally stimulating
experience. Throughout Africa infants sleep next to (in skin-

to-
skin
contact with) the mother, and when they no longer sleep with the mother they
sleep in close contact with another family member, usually a
sibling.<p>
<p>
	Carrying an infant on the back, supported by a piece of cloth, or carrying him
an the jutted-

out
hip (held in the crook of the arm) is common throughout Africa. Backcarrying is
used not only as a way to travel with the child (a built-

in
baby carriage) but also as a means of childcare. A fussy child may be put on
the back to calm him or an active child may be put on the back to keep him out
of trouble. As a Wolof proverb says, "The mother's back is the baby's
medicine". A study of Kipsigis society (Super 1981) showed that backcarrying
was used for 17 percent of an infant's daytime care. In addition, the infants
were being carried on someone's hip or being held for an additional 12 percent
of the day. With all the other childcaring activity, these infants were
observed to be lying down for only about 10 percent of their waking hours. (For
comparative purposes this is contrasted to an American urban sample where
infants spend 30 percent of their waking hours lying down.) Not only does being
carried on the back or the hip provide constant tactile stimulation through skin-

to-
skin
contact with the carrier, it also requires the infant to constantly exercise
his muscles in order to compensate for the body movements of the one
carrying him. In addition, since the infant accompanies his caretaker wherever
she goes during the day and thus observes all aspects of her daily routine,
there is a high level of visual stimulation and a wide variety of visual
patterns for him to interact with.<p>
<p>
	In some West African societies the bathing routine which infants undergo is
highly stimulating. Among the Baule, from the first day of life, a child is
given a bath twice a day. The whole bathing process is very elaborate and
becomes a sort of ritual, starting with an enema to clean out the bowels.
(Enemas are also given to administer medicine.) The infant is scrubbed
vigorously, using hot water, lots of soap and a vegetable sponge. The head is
especially well scrubbed. Little attempt is made to calm the screaming child or
to keep soap and water out of his eyes and mouth. Halfway through the bath,
cool drinking water is administered by closing off the nose and forcing the
child to swallow or "inhale" the water. The infant typically reacts with
shocked stiffening of the body and even more vigorous crying. He is put to the
breast for calming only after the mother has thus washed and rinsed him twice.
Unlike any other time during the child's day, when crying leads to instant
pacification and the mother who does not react fast enough is scolded by the
men of her family, crying during bathtime bothers no one. If the infant is
being bathed, his most insistent, vigorous screaming will get no reaction from
any adult, male or female. After the bath, the baby is massaged, his hips and
shoulders manipulated and stretched, and his head pressed and molded. He is
then rubbed with creams and powders, daubed with perfumes and kaolin and his
hair is combed. During the manipulation stage of the toilette the infant is
typically calm and wide-

eyed
and after the whole ritual is finished and he is clothed and given by the
mother to a family member to hold, the general impression one gets is of a very
alert, active, and awake but completely calm infant. (For comparative purposes
we can oppose this routine to the gentle, calm, supposedly soothing, bath that
Western mothers give their newborns which tends to leave the babies sleepy and
lethargic, or sometimes tense and fussy.)<p>
<p>
	One positive effect of a large amount of physical stimulation is enhanced
psychomotor development, It has been found by researchers working in many
different African societies that there is a marked precocity in psychomotor
development among African children as compared to "norms" established by the
study of Euro-

American
children. These findings are based on testing behavior such as motor head
control, eye-

hand
coordination, sitting, standing and walking, where African children reach these
developmental landmarks earlier than Western children. Although there are
varied explanations posited for this psychomotor advance among African
children, the factor which is most often cited is increased levels of sensory
stimulation such as has been described above. Another consideration is that
African children do not have to contend with a large amount of restrictive
clothing. Sometimes overlooked as contributing factors are the attitudes of
adults in a given society to the development of specific motor behavior. In
many West African societies the ability of the child to walk is very socially
significant since it is at this point that the mother can r&eacute;sum&eacute;
sexual relations. Much verbal play between men and women concerning a child not
yet walking alludes to the day the child will walk and when the status of the
mother will return to that of being a sexual partner. This engenders much
encouragement and support of the child's motor development, to the extent that
certain behavior is specifically taught and children are coaxed into practicing
it often. But again this is a cultural phenomenon, since focus is placed an
those activities seen as contributing to walking ability. Among the Baule,
sitting up is considered to be an important landmark towards the desired goal
of walking in a way that crawling is not. Young infants are thus placed in a
sitting position, their legs spread apart, their hands placed on the ground for
support and balance, with occasionally a rolled up cloth on one side for
additional support, As the Baule say, "A sitting child will soon walk." No such
encouragement or positive reinforcement is given to the child who crawls;
rather, when a child shows signs of independent locomotion, he is often given a
"walker" to push around (a traditionally made 3-

wheeled,
T-

shaped
device).<p>
<p>
	In support of the idea that motor precocity has as much of a cultural
component as a physical component, one study has pointed out that although
there is a general overall precocity in psychomotor development in African
infants, when specific behaviors are looked at separately there are some
milestones that African children achieve at the same time or later than infants
from Western cultures. Prone behaviors (such as lifting the head, turning over,
and crawling) may not be particularly valued or encouraged, and there may be
little opportunity for babies to practice them, in that they are rarely set
down while awake. Thus in these specific behaviors, African babies do not
exhibit the same degree of precocity that would be expected when general
overall motor development is looked at (Super 1981).<p>
<p>
	<b>Intellectual stimulation and exploration</b>. As we have seen, the
practices of many West African societies used in caring for infants provide
them with much sensorial stimulation. But what about intellectual stimulation?
As the child gets older his curiosity develops and his need for exploration is
manifest. The observation has often been made that traditional child-

rearing
practices in Africa do not consciously encourage curiosity and exploration on
the part of the child and thus he may not receive the intellectual stimulation
necessary to help him develop certain skills required for successful adaptation
into today's world. It has been noted that adults in traditional West African
societies do not endorse "play" as a beneficial pasttime for their children and
thus there is not the positive reinforcement or verbal encouragement of
intellectual curiosity that one has come to expect in most modern Western
societies. (Burdin n.d., Erny 1972, Dasen et al 1978).<p>
<p>
	The notion of "play" is assumed to be a universal concept by most child
development specialists, but it is interesting to note that terms used in
different languages for this concept do not always mean the same thing, In some
West African languages the term for "play" is used to refer to organized games
of competition that involve a degree of skill, or to singing and dancing games.
A child who is engaged in an activity which might be considered, by Western
observers, as exploration and manipulation of his environment out of curiosity
and enjoyment (e.g. playing with sand, piling up stones, moving stools around
to make an enclosure, creating toy vehicles or dolls), but which is not
recognized as "play" by the culture, might be said in to be "doing nothing".
(Such is the case in Baule or Wan, two Ivoirian languages.) Analysts have
observed that in these societies where there is little explicit value placed on
exploration and curiosity there is an associated socialization process that
discourages independence and the excessive asking of
questions of adults. It is important, however, to take into consideration the
whole context of the West African child's experience. In traditional societies
he spends a good deal of his time in the presence of other, often older,
children and his day is typically spent moving throughout the village and
outside the village to the farms, engaging in all manner of activities which
stimulate him to ask questions , to observe, to improvise solutions to
problems, to create new "games". And what of the child who does not readily
accept conformity but who exhibits a high degree of individuality and
independence of thought, inventing new things or exhibiting precocity in some
adult skill? In many societies he is considered to have something best
translated as &#147;ingenuity" or "craftiness", and although somewhat marginal,
he does get positive reinforcement for his individuality and initiative.<p>
<p>
<b>E. EARLY CHILDHOOD SOCIALIZATION</b><p>
<p>
	Having looked at a series of habits and attitudes involved in childcare from
the point of view of the young child's needs, we will now consider three areas
in which the socialization processes of most West African societies place great
emphasis.<p>
<p>
	<b>Respect and obedience</b>. In West African societies a remarkable emphasis
is placed on learning to be obedient and responsible. A comparison of worldwide
socialization practices done in the 1980s showed that African societies as a
whole differ significantly from societies in other areas of the world in two
dimensions: the learning of obedience and the learning of responsible behavior
(Doob, 1985). In a Ghanaian study, most parents interviewed equated "bringing
up a child" with "control and rigid discipline&#148;. To the majority of the
parents interviewed, a child "should be seen rather than heard" and the child
who asks many questions or engages in discussions with adults is considered to
be exhibiting bad manners (Akwesi 1985). The child is taught at a very young
age to do exactly as he is told without asking for an explanation, Among the
Igbo, a mother or family member will give a baby a piece of yam or fruit and
then ask for it back again; if the infant is reluctant to give it up, pressure
is put on him to do it against his will. (Dilim Omali, quoted in Manley
1967).<p>
<p>
	Each culture has its way of defining a well-

brought
up child and the terms that are used to describe the ideal child are
significant. In some West African cultures (Ibgo, Yoruba, Baule,
Attie, and Ebrie, to name a few), whereas there are no specific abstract terms
meaning " obedient" or "responsible" there is a term used to refer to a child
who exhibits these characteristics,
a term that is best translated as "intelligent", and adults are able to cite
the behavior which characterizes such a child. In one study, Yoruba mothers
answered questions about well-

behaved
children with a number of specific behaviors: doing tasks such as running
errands, doing household chores, and performing personal tasks for oneself
(e.g., washing and dressing oneself). Of these the one which was rated the most
highly desirable in a well-

behaved
child was the running of errands. (Lloyd, 1970)<p>
<p>
	One of the first responsibilities given to a young child in many West African
societies is the running of errands. Practice for this important function
starts as soon as a child can walk, at which time he is given objects to go and
put in a specific place or to give someone in a very deliberate attempt to
teach him to obey instructions. As soon as the child can talk he is given
messages to transmit and errands to run in another part of the village or in
another household. These get more and more complicated as he grows older, but
he is always expected to carry them out seriously. A child who fails to perform
such tasks successfully is belittled and ridiculed by his peers as well as by
adults. He thus learns at an early age that older members of the family and the
community depend on him to be honest, responsible and efficient in carrying out
duties.<p>
<p>
	Expectations such as these often change when the structure of the family
changes or when the aspirations of the parents for their children change. A
study comparing traditional and modern childrearing practices in Nigeria (Lloyd
1970) pointed out that traditional mothers expected immediate, unilateral
obedience from their children, whereas "elite" mothers expected qualified
obedience, taking into account the nature and urgency of the request and
excusing a disobedient child because he might not as yet understand what is
expected of him. Other studies have shown that caretakers in traditional
societies employ corporal punishment much more frequently as a way of enforcing
obedience than in families who are no longer integrated into a traditional
context. Caretakers from this latter group rely more on dialog and reasoning
with the child to make him comply (Levine 1967).<p>
<p>
	In general children in West African societies tend to learn by doing rather
than by having things explained to them. They are expected to pick up a skill
or a proper behavior by observation and practice rather  than by formal
instruction. Ridicule is an important method  of social control in these
societies and is applied even to the young child. Some researchers have found
that typically an African child is more sensitive to ridicule than a European
child. This could be one
of the factors responsible for the African child's learning to do things well
in a relatively short time, knowing that if his product or performance is
comparatively below expected standards,
his peers will not spare him their tongues.<p>
<p>
	<b>Dependence vs Independence</b>. It has been pointed out by many that
traditional West African societies place great value on dependent behavior and
do not encourage social independence (Burdin n.d,; Oppong 1973; Sannoh 1986;
Shelton 1968, among others). It is not uncommon for peoples who live in small
agricultural or pastoral communities to be interdependent in their
relationships with one another, and West African societies are not an
exception. Relationships of dependence permeate the culture; for instance, in
Igbo society there is a clear notion of a hierarchy of power, from the
ancestors, who exist perpetually in the spiritual realm, down to the elders of
the lineage, to the younger men and women and finally to the children. Each
rank possesses powers over the one below, enforcing social rules and demanding
respect and proper carrying out of duties (Shelton, 1968). This is not unlike
many other West African societies, although the degree of institutionalization
of the authority hierarchy differs from culture to culture. The child is on the
bottom of the heap in the social structure but he is also very important since
he is the one who will support and perpetuate the power relationship of his
parents and grandparents when they become ancestors. All members of the society
are thus part of a hierarchy of dependence and the child-

rearing
practices teach and reinforce this. Older children are responsible for the care
of younger ones, and thus children have the experience of being both dependent
in an ascending line upon those older than they, and of being responsible, in
descending order, for those younger than they, As has been pointed out for the
Yoruba, children come to view growing up as a process of progressive relief
from menial tasks and of increasing authority to pass these tasks on to others.
Maturity increases a child's status in the dependency hierarchy, and higher
status means getting others to do things for you (Levine 1966).<p>
<p>
	The maintenance of the dependency relationship is in some ways made the
child's responsibility. Once he is old enough to keep up with his caretaker(s)
without having to be carried, it is he who must take the initiative to
accompany them since, in many village societies, the mother or other caretaker
may not manifest overt anxiety about whether the child is following her. The
child must follow his caretaker, or later, his band of friends, or he will find
himself alone. The responsibility for maintenance of the relationship between
elder and youngster therefore is placed at an early age upon the shoulders of
the child, for if he fails to maintain close contacts with his group he will
lose his sense of belonging, his bodily security, and his right to emotional
comfort in times of distress. To avoid the trauma of isolation he observes
closely his peers and elders, learning the coping techniques of his culture.
Throughout his life's experience the child will find himself constantly
dependent upon forces greater than he -

the
elders, the ancestors, the gods-


and his success will depend upon his adaptation to external forces (Shelton
1968).<p>
<p>
	It can de said that all children everywhere have to contend with superior
forces and are dependent on their elders. However, modern-

day
Western cultures tend to draw a sharp distinction between being a child and
being an adult. Children have their own manufactured objects, their own food,
their own parties, their own culture. Heavy pressure is exerted by the society
to become an independent, self-

reliant
individual who takes initiative and stands up against pressure to conform.
"Manliness" and "adulthood" are made synonymous with independence and solitary
individualism. Western children then are obliged to undergo a major
transformation from being naturally dependent to being independent, although at
the same time there is an attempt to inculcate the need to behave as involved,
responsible members of the community in which they live. A child growing up in
a traditional West African society recognizes the importance of knowing one's
place within the family and society and fulfilling it satisfactorily.
Independence of spirit is usually not taken seriously or is frowned upon. In
many African societies a person desiring "privacy", engaging in "secret"
behavior, or consistently refusing to share (food,  objects , news, feelings)
is immediately suspect and is open to criticism or more severe penalties. All
experiences are expected to be shared with the community at large, and thus one
has not only the right to call upon one's neighbors for needed help but one
also has the responsibility to share with them, even if only symbolically, the
good things that one receives.<p>
<p>
	As one African writer has put it, traditional education among the Yoruba
emphasizes suppression of the quest for individual autonomy while promoting the
quest for social values.<p>
The goal is not that the child should discover himself and be what he has in
him to be, but rather that he should achieve if at all possible a culturally
defined and expected norm, a correct way of being in society. The worst thing
is for a child to turn out to be irresponsible and lazy, a tattler or a non-

respecter
of others or of others' belongings. These traits are considered to be anti-

social.
(It should be noted that although there are very strong sanctions on stealing
in most, if not all, African societies, the notions of property and ownership
and rights to the belongings of certain other people is not the same from
culture to culture. Thus what is considered "stealing" in one society is not
necessarily so in another.) No parent wants the terms "born but not trained" or
"taught but does not learn" used to describe his child (Sannoh, 1986).<p>
<p>
	<b>Communicative skills</b>. Another area of great emphasis in the training of
children throughout West Africa is language and communication. It has been
observed by many researchers (Gay and
Cole 1967; Levine 1974; Harkness 1975) that in traditional African cultures,
mothers and other adults do not make a conscious effort to speak often to their
infants with the intent of teaching them how to communicate, and that there is
not the same degree of awareness as in Western societies of encouraging a child
to express himself. This has sometimes been used as an explanation for the
extreme timidity and inability of traditionally raised African children to
perform well, not only in school, but also in testing situations which require
them to speak to adults. According to one study (Harkness, 1975) the emphasis
in language socialization is on comprehension rather than production, much of
the speech of adults to toddlers being in the form of commands. As the child
leaves the permissiveness and indulgence of infancy, adults' verbal
interactions with him become more directive and more negative, and the total
amount of attention he receives from adults decreases, This points to an
important aspect of communicative competence in many African societies: silence
when in the presence of older or higher status people. This behavior is carried
over to adulthood and is difficult to alter. As one Ghanaian author has pointed
out, it is a sign of respect for a child to address an elder but he must learn
how to do so correctly and the conversation must be as short as possible
(Akwesi 1985).<p>
<p>
	These attitudes to speech production should not be taken to mean however that
children raised in traditional West African societies are disadvantaged in
language acquisition or in productive competence. It is true that there may be
a certain social distance between generations characterized by a lack of
spontaneous verbal interaction, a quiet, even impassive demeanor on the part of
a younger person, and sometimes even an avoidance requirement. These speech
behaviors would be expected in societies which place a heavy emphasis on
responsibility and
obedience, and much research bears this out (Munroe &amp; Munroe 1972; Whiting
and Whiting 1974). One must not forget however that these are also societies
which place a heavy emphasis on the development of verbal skills in almost
every area of daily life.<p>
<p>
	In societies which do not have a written language (and virtually all
traditional West African societies fall into this category) verbal competence
is highly valued. There is no written history, no body of recorded legal
precedents, no written literature, no postal system. The spoken word is taken
very seriously and competence in verbal expression is an essential skill. In
many West African languages there are a large number of terms to refer to ways
of transmitting in formation , both correctly and incorrectly, many more than
there are in English. In some Ghanaian societies the first advice which is
given to a newborn child -


after the customary touching of the umbilical cord to the child's lips -


is that the child keeps its mouth shut. In other words he should not became a
babbler; his words should be significant and what he says should have meaning
(Akwesi 1985).<p>
<p>
	Children are thus trained early to carry messages and to transmit them
faithfully, without distortion and without personal involvement, for this is an
important link in the social interaction of the community. The child thereby
learns the role of "interpreter" and intermediary, a principle role in
societies where few important conversations take place without an official
witness. In time, the child learns about the manipulation of information and
the possibility of control of the communicative act, skills that will serve him
well in an oral society. Every adult should be able to perform in giving
evidence in court cases, in telling stories, in posing riddles, in using
proverbs,
in recounting histories, in mediating palavers, and the person who does these
things with eloquence and elaborateness receives much praise. In addition most
languages throughout West Africa have elaborate greeting systems and children
are expected to start learning these at a young age. An Akan or a Yoruba child,
if he is brought up according to traditional custom, is required to start out
his day with the proper greeting to the members of his family, accompanied, in
the case of the Yoruba child, with the appropriate gesture, curtsey for girls,
prostration for boys.<p>
<p>
	Children receive their verbal training by constant participation in adult
life. They attend all social events, are usually required to serve the guests
of the family, and accompany parents to group meetings. They are not usually
allowed to participate verbally in adult gatherings, but practice of the
observed verbal behavior can and does take place in their peer group. The
importance of the language socialization function of child caretakers and peer
playgroups should not be overlooked in traditional West African societies.
Observation of Baule children's play reveals that much time is spent in
practicing and exhibiting verbal prowess: telling of fables and stories, posing
of riddles, singing of games and dance songs, carrying out of mock adult
rituals, exchanging of elaborate and eloquent insults. Creativity and
imagination are highly valued in these domains (personal field notes).<p>
<p>
	One other area which is often overlooked in discussing the language skills of
most West African children is bilinguialism or even multilingualism. In many
traditional societies, adults are competent in more than one African language
and function daily in bilingual situations, where in a given conversation
between two people each person speaks his own language, each understanding the
other. Children thus grow up hearing many languages and often have the
opportunity to gain proficiency before they are adults. Given the increase in
inter-

ethnic
marriages, more than one language may often be spoken in the child's
household.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV. THE APPLICATION OF DATA TO CARETAKER EDUCATION PROGRAMS</b><p>
<p>
	Data on child-

rearing
practices such as have been discussed in this paper are invaluable for many
aspects of developing programs for early childhood care, They can be used in
the training of personnel for formal childcare facilities, in parents'
education seminars, in community-

based
action groups, to name just a few.<p>
<p>
<b>A. THE IMPORTANCE OF KNOWING HOW INFORMATION IS TRANSMITTED</b><p>
<p>
	In order to identify the audience who is to receive messages on child
development it is essential to be aware of existing patterns of the
transmission of knowledge and of responsibility for childcare. Which adults in'
a family or community have the right to intervene in the welfare of the child?
Whose advice is sought for problems with children? What are the channels
through which messages from the outside must pass in order to be accepted by
the community? What are the cultural norms and expectations as to the
appropriateness of discussion of certain topics with certain audiences? These
must all be identified for a given society if we expect intervention and
education to have a lasting effect.<p>
<b>B. TH. EFFECT OF CHANGE ON THE CHILD'S SITUATION</b><p>
<p>
	The childrearing practices of any well functioning society are directed toward
shaping the development of the child so that he will become a well adjusted
adult, with the abilities and skills necessary to function in the social and
physical environment of that particular society. We have seen that, although we
can talk about physical deprivation (inadequate nutrition, high prevalence of
disease, etc.) in traditional West African societies, we cannot necessarily
assume psycho-

social
deprivation. The traditional childrearing practices of these societies are
appropriate to promote healthy psychological development for the particular
ecological and social context of that society, It is when the traditional
lifestyle is confronted by rapid change that existing childrearing practices
seem to be inadequate.<p>
<p>
	Having examined some of these childrearing customs and having seen how
appropriate these are to the ecological and social contexts of traditional
cultures we can now perhaps attempt an answer to the question: where can one
expect to find the child who is potentially disadvantaged psychologically?
Using the model which was discussed earlier for considering childrearing
practices in terms of their integration into a culture's belief system as well
the ecological and social context of the family, we can say that the child who
is living in a situation where there is no longer harmony among these different
elements may be psychologically or socially at risk. When the childrearing
practices of a family, the social or physical setting in which the child is
being raised, or the beliefs, attitudes and expectations of the society
concerning the child's development have undergone a rapid change, a lack of
synchronization may occur which produces a situation where the child is no
longer being appropriately prepared for integration into adult life. Children
raised in newly developed urban slums, in refugee camps, in traditional
villages where half the adult population has emigrated, in isolated urban
apartments are sometimes victims of this lack of harmony.<p>
<p>
We must keep in mind, however, that child-

rearing
customs are adaptive. In evolutionary processes of change within a society,
customs change gradually as the physical and social
contexts change and as the belief system of the society changes. Practices are
gradually selected and reinforced across generations and within generations as
they adapt to change. A study of urban Nigeria showed that "elite" parents are
more likely to use psychological techniques of discipline than corporal
punishment because their attitudes towards children and children's education
are different from those found in traditional society. Parents consider that
their children need to be more independent and need to have considerably more
inner resources than their peers in traditional contexts (Levine 1967). A
practice is thus given up because of a change in attitude.<p>
Another  example serves to illustrate change in a custom due to a change in the
child's physical context. In newly constructed villages in Cote d'Ivoire, where
often three or four separate villages have been built together in one large
conglomerate, many of the households in the middle of the village find
themselves too far away from the edge of the village to oblige small children
to go to the "bush" to defecate. They are thus allowed to use chamber pots
behind the house for this function and do not get the normal strict Baule
training about the dirtying nature of faeces until later in their
development.<p>
<p>
<b>C. &#147;GOOD&#148; AND &#147;BAD&#148; PRACTICES</b><p>
	Societies which remain essentially intact can accommodate a certain number of
changes without overly perturbing the healthy development of the child. What
needs to be investigated are the new elements in today's societies, both rural
and urban, which are fostering situations where we find psycho-

socially
deprived or disadvantaged children. And in programmatic terms, solutions need
to be sought which are sensitive to the individual cultures concerned. Whatever
the context, be it traditional village life, urban life, caretakers act
constantly as mediators between the child and his surrounding environment.
Caretakers, whether parents, kinfolk or community members, serve as a catalyst
to the learning opportunities given to a child. Thus the specific behaviors
used by caretakers in their roles as mediators will change in response to new
sociological and ecological variables, but always as a function of a particular
culture and its belief system. What is an appropriate adaptation in one culture
is not necessarily considered appropriate in another. And because societies are
changing, what was once considered a legitimate practice may no longer be seen
as such. We must recognize that what is considered a " good" practice in one
socio-

cultural
context may not be so considered in another. Careful attention must be paid to
the cultural rationale for childrearing practices and their adaptive function
for a given society in order to be able to identify those that are "positive",
and therefore to be encouraged as well as those that are "negative" and to be
discouraged. Western notions of "good" and "bad" childrearing practices cannot
be uncritically accepted. They must be juxtaposed to the reality of local
cultures and to the reality of today's African families, doing their best to
adapt to new information, new requirements for survival, and new
expectations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>D. WHAT ARE THE STATED GOALS AND ASPIRATIONS OF A SOCIETY FOR ITS
CHILDREN?</b><p>
<p>
	We must take a critical look at child development programs which are designed
to introduce new ways of bringing up children. Before we assume that caretakers
need help in adapting new techniques and strategies for child development to
their particular situation we need to look at the underlying goals and expected
outcomes of proposed early childhood development programs. In Western
societies, parents and educators have in mind a certain goal when they
encourage the early stimulation of their children. These children are being
prepared for sixteen to twenty years (or more) of formal schooling, and will
have, after that, a fair chance of being employed in one of thousands of
different sectors in complex, highly industrialized societies. And since most
Western parents have themselves received a formal education, the kind of
training, stimulation and encouragement the child experiences in the home
environment is similar to what he will experience at school.<p>
<p>
	The question must be raised: should the goals of early childhood development
in Africa be conceived primarily, as they are in the West, in terms of later
success in formal schooling?<p>
In a region where currently 30 to 40 percent of the children do not go to
school (African Development Bank 1986) is it valid to consciously introduce
child-

rearing
practices designed primarily to prepare children for formal education which is
developed from a Western model? In what other ways can we begin to think about
the measurement of childhood psycho-

social
development? What is child development in preparation for? What constitutes
"successful" psycho-

social
development, and why?<p>
<p>
	We would argue that it is important to look carefully at the skills necessary
for successful integration into the adult social and economic life of today's
societies before we establish child development programs. The goals need to be
tailored to the realities -

-

the strengths, the potentials -

-

of African societies. They should encourage the intellectual and social
development of children in such a way that they will be prepared to function in
and adapt to a rapidly changing world.<p>

<p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>In collaboration with the Ministry of Education, UNICEF/Socialist
Republic of Vietnam requested consultation from the Consultative Group on Early
Child Care and Development in order to assess the current strengths and
weaknesses of preschool education in Vietnam.  The analysis is part of a larger
UNDP funded effort designed to assess the overall education system within
Vietnam. <p>
<p>
The objective of the UNDP project is to help the Government frame a long-term
strategy common to all agencies involved in education, training activities, and
human-resource development.  It also hopes to enable all such agencies to
coordinate their efforts in order to strengthen and modernize the country's
human capital in spite of limited resources.  The project is not intended to
modify the situation of education in the short run, but rather to strengthen
the country's institutional capacity for; (a) evaluating the education system
in terms of both internal and external efficiency, (b) formulating long-term
strategies adapted to changing socio-economic requirements and financial
constraints; and (c) improving institutional relationships among all actors
giving each administrative unit better tools to monitor the delivery of
educational services.<p>
<p>
Twelve national working groups will examine individual sub-sectors and issues
of concern to the Education and Training Ministry.  UNESCO has appointed an
International Team of exerts to provide technical assistance throughout the
sectoral analysis.  The final output of the national working groups will be a
common strategy document that addresses the following issues; major orientation
for future development, projected output and costs, prioritization of tasks and
projects, and proposed organization and management plan. <p>
<p>
<b>Goals and Objectives</b><p>
<p>
With the support of UNICEF, Cassie Landers, Consultative Group on Early
Childhood Care and Development, provided technical assistance to the national
working group responsible for the analysis of the preschool sector.  Under the
direction of Mrs. Mai Chi, the working group was comprised of 20 professionals
with expertise in the implementation of the Ministry of Education (MOE) early
child development activities. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
During a 2.5 week period the following tasks were accomplished:<p>
<ul>	&#149;Review current creche and preschool programmes supported by the Ministry
of Education.<p>
<p>
&#149;Review UNICEF's early child development activities<p>
<p>
&#149;Design and develop a set of qualitative and descriptive instruments to
aid the evaluation of the preschool sector<p>
<p>
&#149;Pretest and revise instruments <p>
<p>
&#149;Develop survey implementation strategy and general analysis framework<p>
<p>
&#149;Develop proposal to investigate the long term impact of preschool
education on primary school performance</ul><p>
<p>
In addition to these activities, the working group also provided feedback on a
series of early child development messages that are being developed by Cassie
Landers for possible incorporation in a revised publication of <i>Facts for
Life</i>.  The highlights of each of these activities are summarized in the
following section of the report.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Instrument Development</b><p>
<p>
A brief orientation to the Ministry of Education and Training preschool
programmes as well as a review of existing documents provided the  necessary
background information on the current status of ECD activities.  In addition,
the consultant's prior knowledge of early education activities in Vietnam was
further enhanced through several field visits to creche and kindergartens as
well as to the informal home day care provider system in Hanoi.<p>
<p>
Within this perspective and a familiarity of the goals of the ECD working
group, the need to construct a battery of evaluation instruments was identified
as the most important priority.  Utilizing qualitative research techniques,
several types of instruments were generated including; self administered
surveys, structured interviews, and observation checklists.  The overall goal
of these instruments was to identify the strength and weakness of the current
system to provide high quality child care environments to Vietnamese children
between 6 months to 6 years of age.  Particular emphasis was placed on
assessing the impact of current changes in the cooperative system on the
enrollment of children in both creches and kindergartens.<p>
<p>
<b>Self-administered Surveys.</b>  This instrument attempts to summarize the
existing data on preschool activities currently collected by the Ministry of
Education.  The survey, which was designed by the Ministry prior to the
consultant's arrival will be mailed to administrators in all District Education
Offices.  One important outcome of this survey will be to determine the
accuracy and completeness of the existing record keeping system.  In addition
to providing insights into current the level of operation, the results should
identify additional types of data required to enhance the ongoing monitoring of
the preschool sector. <p>
<p>
<b>Interviews.  </b>The interview format was suggested as the most effective
way to obtain an accurate perspective on the current functioning of the
preschool sector as well as the attitudes and beliefs of service providers and
programme recipients.  Several types of interviews were designed to be
conducted with Schoolmasters, Teachers (Creche/Kindergarten), Home Day Care
Providers, and Parents.  Through a series of close ended questions with ordered
answered choices the interviews were designed to obtain information on the
following preschool components; Provider's socio-economic background,
educational level and ECD training; Characteristics of the children;
Characteristics of the school and teaching environment including  curriculum
and learning materials; Parental involvement; Costs, financing, and management;
Health and nutrition services, and Community integration and support.  Several
open-ended question asked respondents to identify level of satisfaction derived
from work, strengths of existing system, constraints to providing optimal care,
and suggestions to improve the overall quality of services.<p>
<p>
In addition to interviews with providers, a parent interview was designed to
obtain insights into the parents' perception of the quality of care, child
enrollment and attendance patterns, and beliefs and attitudes on the value of
ECD programmes. In addition, several open-ended questions attempted to elicit
parents' perceptions of the major problems confronting families with young
children and the identification of the types of services and programmes most in
need. <p>
<p>
In developing each of these four interviews, efforts were made by the
participants in the working group to overcome some of the common problems
encountered in the design of semi-structured interviews.  For example, special
measures were taken to cast question that were clear and straightforward and
stressed the use of simple language, common concepts, and manageable tasks. In
an effort to avoid common problems, a series of questions were kept in mind
during the identification and section of specific questions.  These included:<p>
<p><ul>
Will the words be uniformly understood?<br>
Do the questions contain abbreviations or unconventional phrases?<br>
Are the questions too vague?<br>
Is the question too precise?<br>
Is the question biased?<br>
Is the question objectionable?<br>
Is the question too demanding?<br>
Is it a double question?<br>
Are the answer choices mutually exclusive?<br>
Have you assumed too much knowledge?<br>
Has too much been assumed about respondent behavior?<br>
Is the question technically accurate?<br>
Can the responses be compared with existing information?<br>
Are the questions too intrusive?</ul><p>
  <p>
<b>Observation Checklists.  </b>In addition to the interviews, two observation
checklists was designed to assess the characteristics and quality of care
provided in creche/kindergartens as well as in home day care centres.  The
checklist consisted of items arranged in the following categories; Facilities
and Equipment, Learning Materials, Children's Characteristics, Teachers'
Characteristics, Teacher-child Patterns of Interactions.  The individual items
comprising several of the sub-scales were derived from the set of standards and
regulations endorsed by the preschool sector.  <p>
<p>
Observers were asked to record "yes" or "no" to the items listed in each of the
five subcategories.  In addition, overall ratings using a five-point Leikert
scale were obtained on each of the following aspects; Environment, Equipment
and Facilities, and Learning Materials. Sub-scores as well as a total score
will be obtained. Since the application of this checklist allows individual
comparisons between programmes, the results could be used to monitor variation
in the quality of care provided by different programmes across different
settings. <p>
<p>
Through the working group's active, lively, and highly participatory
discussions, drafts of each of the four instruments as well as two observation
checklists were prepared during the first week of the consultancy. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Pretesting and Revision</b><p>
<p>
A procedure for pre-testing and revising the instruments was implemented during
the second week of the consultancy. Following the procedures specified for all
working groups, the instruments were pretested on a sample of headmasters,
teachers, and parents residing in Ha son Bingh, a district just outside Hanoi.
The home based day care provider interview and observation checklist was
pretested on a sample of providers within Hanoi. <p>
<p>
Prior to the pretesting working group participants received a half-day training
in administering the interviews and observation instruments. Working in pairs
each participant had the opportunity to role play as both the respondent and
interviewee for each of the instruments.  Through this practice session working
group participants were exposed to all aspects of survey administration and
response coding.<p>
<p>
The following aspects of interview techniques were highlighted during this
training session; <p>
<p><ul>
Description and purpose of interview<br>
Sensitivity to respondent's needs and concerns<br>
Asking questions <br>
Recording open-ended responses<br>
Coding close-ended responses<br>
Using probes<br>
Timing and efficiency<br>
Recording supplementary information</ul><p>
<p>
In addition, interviewers were asked to obtain information on aspects of
specific questions as well as the strength and weaknesses of the interview
process.  For example interviewers were asked to assess the suitability of each
question in terms of response variation, accuracy and completeness of response
categories, comprehension, task difficulty, and respondent interest and
attention.  The interviewers were asked to be aware of problems related to the
flow and naturalness of the interview, the order of questions, timing,
respondent's overall interest and attention, and respondent's well being.<p>
<p>
During a two-day pretesting period, each of the 18 working group participants
had the opportunity to administer at least three of the four instruments and
one of the two checklists.  Based on the results of the information and
feedback provided through the pretesting procedures, all survey instruments
were significantly revised.  In order to shorten the time requested to
administer the interview, repetitive questions and those with little response
variation were deleted.  Response categories were refined and issues related to
coding were addressed. <p>
<p>
A copy of each of the four interview instruments and two observation check
lists are included in the Appendices attached to this summary report.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Sample Selection and Survey Implementation</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The Office of Planning and Statistics has been awarded a subcontract to
develop a sampling strategy to be used by all the working groups participating
in the UNDP Education Sector Review.  Thus, in order to ensure comparability
between working groups, it was suggested that the sampling procedures utilized
by the preschool sector follow the overall guidelines proposed by the Office of
Statistics and Planning. <p>
<p>
While the sampling strategy had not been completed at the time of the
consultancy, a representative of the Office of Statistics participated in the
working group.  According to the proposed sampling strategy, surveys would be
administered on a representative sample in five provinces, including Houng lien
Son, Ha son Bingh, Hanoi, Thai thien Hue, and Ho Chi Minh City.  <p>
<p>
Working group participants discussed the need to obtain a representative sample
with equal representation from urban, rural, and mountainous ares.  Issues
related to the management of data collection activities and quality control
were also discussed.  In carrying out the objectives of the preschool sector
review, participants emphasized that the proposed sampling strategy must
consider the limited availability of personnel trained in interview techniques
well as the tight schedule which had been allotted for survey implementation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Impact Study</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>The working group also discussed a proposal for a longitudinal study of
the impact of early child development programmes on progress and performance in
primary school.  Using a matched control group, quasi-experimental design,
high-risk children in urban areas would be followed from 6 month of age through
the third year of primary school.  The study would include approximately 100
children from high-risk urban families in each of the intervention and control
groups. Over the course of the study, children's health, nutrition, and
developmental status would be monitored through the administration of a battery
of carefully selected and culturally appropriate instruments.  In addition
since children's early development is strongly influenced by the environment,
data in both the intervention and control groups would be collected on patterns
of caregiver interaction and aspects of the home environment. The analysis of
the data on children and their families would attempt to determine the impact
of early child development programmes on primary school progress and
performance. <p>
<p>
The working group was provided with a battery of instruments prepared by the
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, Ypsilanti, Michigan. These
instruments are being utilized as part of a longitudinal study implemented by
the International Education Association. This project is an ongoing
international study investigating the nature, quality, and effects of the
experiences of children prior to formal schooling in 14 developed and
developing countries.  There would be considerable value in following the
protocol laid out by this international study as comparisons of the situation
in Vietnam could be compared to those with other developing and developed
countries. <p>
<p>
As a follow-up to this discussion, the working group under the direction of
Mrs. Mai Chi, would design a proposal for submission to UNICEF as well as other
national and intentional funding agencies.  Given the magnitude of this task as
well as the time required to obtain results, this proposal was seen as a
supplementary long-term activity of the working group. In carrying out this
investigation, the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development
would be available to provide technical consultation in study design,
implementation, and data analysis. <p>
<p>
Given Vietnam's longstanding history and expertise in the field of early child
development the results of such an investigation could have tremendous
implications for other countries within the region.  In light of the high
priority placed on early child development as result of the World Conference on
Education for All, it is suggested that the UNICEF/Viet Nam office give serious
attention to the possibility of supporting such research.<p>

<i>The following article by Kagitcibasi, Bekman and Goksel illustrates how an
applied research project carried out with scientific rigor by academic
researchers can, over time, have an important effect on policy.  It can provide
the basis for a new and large-scale initiative, and for cooperation between
governmental and non-governmental and international organizations.  Although
the research results presented here are of interest in and of themselves, our
main purpose in including the article in this issue of the Notebook is to show
how these results have been tranlated into action.  The first section of the
article describes the original research project and its extremely encouraging
results; the second section indicates how the design of the original project

<b>A Multipurpose Model of Nonformal Education</b><p>
<b>The Mother-Child Education Programme</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Cigdem Kagitcibasi, Sevda Bekman &amp; Ayla Goksel<p>
<p>
In Turkey, the Mother-Child Education Programme (MCEP) has introduced a new
approach to early childhood education, which targets and has many positive
benefits for both the mother and the child. Born from a research project
conducted over a ten-year period, it has advanced to form the basis of a major
government educational policy. It has also led to the establishment of the
Mother-Child Education Foundation and has served as the incentive for a new
collaboration between UNICEF, the Ministry of Education and the Mother-Child
Education Foundation.<p>
<p>
The Mother-Child Education Programme originated in a desire to provide early
enrichment to children from disadvantaged environments and to strengthen their
immediate environment. It thus targeted the enhancement of the overall
development of preschool-aged children within their immediate social context.
The Mother-Child Education Programme, as a model of nonformal education, is
based on a two-tiered approach which aims to provide early enrichment to the
young child and training and support to the adult (mother).  The dual focus of
intervention is both the positive development of the child and the empowerment
of the mother.  Thus it involves both preschool and adult education. <p>
<p>
In the literature it is well documented that intervention programmes,
especially for women in development, should be multipurpose, directed at the
intersecting needs of women and children. (Engle, 1980; Evans, 1985)
Multipurpose programmes are found to create greater motivation for
participation. Programmes that integrate different components such as family
planning, mother-child health, nutrition and school preparation, are found to
be more effective than programmes with a singular purpose. (Myers 1992) The
Mother-Child Education Programme is an example of a successful multipurpose
programme.<p>
<p>
 The state of early childhood development and education programmes in Turkey
calls for cost-effective programmes which will reach large numbers of children
from socioeconomically disadvantaged environments who are in need of early
education. Early education in this instance can help to bridge the gap between
these children and their more advantaged peers when they start their schooling.
Similarly, women with a low level of education, low status in the family and
with low contribution to economic life deserve priority. Community-based and
culturally-sensitive multipurpose programmes have a higher chance of being
accepted and successfully applied  on a large scale when they are designed to
offer solutions to social problems in the country.<p>
<p>
As mentioned above, an <i>empowerment</i> model underlies the Mother-Child
Education Programme.  The goal is to offer children and mothers enrichment, by
providing support for their already existing strengths and building on them at
both the individual and family level.  This contrasts with <i>deficiency</i>
models that focus on parents' shortcomings. The mother is the key figure in
this context since she is empowered to provide sustained improvement in her
child's as well as her own well-being. <p>
<p>
The programme is a community-based intervention, capitalizing upon women's
networks through the use of group discussion sessions.  Especially in
sociocultural contexts where close-knit family and community ties exist, as in
Turkey and many parts of the developing world, it makes sense for an enrichment
programme to build on these ties as support mechanisms. (Kagitcibasi, 1988)
These mechanisms would be expected to continue to provide support to the women
after the completion of the programme. <p>
<p>
<b>The Turkish Early Enrichment Project </b><p>
<p>
The origins of the Mother-Child Education Programme lie in the "Turkish Early
Enrichment Project", a research project conducted between 1982-1986 by Cigdem
Kagitcibasi (Ka[[eth]]&yacute;tc&yacute;ba[[thorn]]&yacute;),  Diane Sunar and
Sevda Bekman of Bogazici University. (Kagitcibasi, Sunar &amp; Bekman, 1988)
The project, involving early childhood enrichment and mother training in low
income areas of Istanbul, set out to assess the impact of an optimal
combination of educational preschool care and home intervention on the overall
development of socioeconomically disadvantaged urban children. Both
centre-based and home-based enrichment were studied, separately and in
combination. <p>
<p>
The study was conducted in five low-income shanty town areas of Istanbul where
the majority of the population were blue-collar workers or involved in the
marginal economy. The population was mostly of rural origins, having migrated
to the city in search of employment.  The main reason for the choice of these
areas was the existence of factories employing over 300 women and thus required
by law to provide a child care unit. Six daycare centres catering to low-income
children were chosen. The children were three and five years of age. Of the
sample, one third of  the children were enrolled in educational nursery
schools, one third in custodial care centres and the other third in home care
with no preschool education.  Some of the children in each group were randomly
selected and given a home intervention in the form of a Mother Training
programme.<p>
  <p>
Mother Training had two elements: a programme to foster social and personality
development of the child and a programme to foster the cognitive development of
the child. The former was addressed through group discussions on topics
designed to increase the mother's sensitivity to the child's social and
emotional needs and to help her to foster the child's social and personality
growth.  The programme to foster cognitive development was a Turkish
translation and adaptation of HIPPY (Home Intervention Programme for Preschool
Youngsters) developed by the Research Institute of Innovation in Education at
Hebrew University, Jerusalem. (Lombard, 1981)  As a home-based enrichment
approach, the programme focused on three main areas of cognitive development
(language, sensory and perceptual discrimination skills and problem-solving)
with materials provided for educational activities in each of these areas. <p>
<p>
In the second and third years of the project, the Mother Training Programme
consisted of  biweekly home visits and group meetings that were held on
alternate weeks. The programme to foster social and personality development of
the child took place in the fortnightly group meetings through guided group
discussions. The topics in the first year were based on children's health,
nutrition and creative play activities. In the second year, the stress was on
mother-child interaction. <p>
<p>
The original project lasted four years (1982-1986). In the first year of the
project baseline assessments were carried out with mothers and children using
developmental tests, observations and interviews. In the second and third years
of the project the intervention was introduced to a randomly-selected group of
the mothers, and in the fourth year reassessments were conducted. These fourth
year assessments were used to determine the short-term effects of the
programme. Six years after the end of the original study (and ten years after
the start of the project) a follow-up study was conducted in 1991-1992 to
assess the long-term effects of the project.  As detailed below, the findings
have been positive and impressive. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Effects of the Applied Research Project </b><p>
<b><i></i></b><p>
<b><i>Short-term effects</i></b><p>
The project set out to study the overall development of the child, rather than
only his/her cognitive development, as is commonly done. For this reason a
variety of assessment measures were employed.  Determination of the results of
the four-year study was based on the cognitive, personality and social
development of the child, the mother's orientation to the child and direct
effects on the mother.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Effects on the child.  The results were striking: significant
differences were found in cognitive development between children whose mothers
had undergone mother training and those who had not.   Those who had benefited
most were the children in custodial or home care, rather than the children who
were already attending an educational care centre, suggesting a "ceiling
effect" of educational enrichment. Significant differences were found between
children whose mothers had been trained and those who hadn't on various
cognitive measures: IQ scores, school grades, standardized tests of academic
achievement and subtests of Weschler intelligence tests.   Children whose
mothers were trained also exhibited positive effects on their social and
personality development, displaying less dependency, less aggressiveness,
better self-concept and better school adjustment. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	Effects on the mother.</b>  The benefits of the programme were also
reflected in the mother. Trained mothers were more verbal, less punitive, and
more responsive to their children and had greater interaction with their
children. Mothers who had been trained valued autonomous behaviour of the child
more than the nontrained mothers and were more cognitively stimulating.  A
great deal of research and theory in developmental psychology has stressed the
importance of the above orientations in childrearing and discipline for the
cognitive, moral and personality development of the child.    <p>
<p>
Not only did the Mother Training Programme have effects on the mother's style
of interaction with her child, thus leading to changes in the child's
environment and behaviour, it also had direct effects on the mother herself.
Trained mothers reported a different pattern of interaction with their husbands
than nontrained mothers. Trained mothers were more likely to share
decision-making with their spouses on subjects such as birth control and child
discipline than nontrained mothers. They also enjoyed a greater degree of
communication and role-sharing with their spouses, the latter being evident,
for example, in husbands helping with household chores.
</a><p>
 <b><i>Long-term effects</i>
</a></b><p>
<b></b> A study of the literature on intervention programmes has shown that
while short-term gains in cognitive ability have been observed, these gains
were found to dissipate in the longer-term. Mother training introduced in this
project attempted to overcome this problem by initiating changes in the
mothers' behaviour, expectations and values in order to constitute changes in
the child's environment.<b> </b>The dissipation of early gains found in
intervention studies in the literature has been due at least partly to
exclusive concentration on cognitive skills and focusing only on the child,
abstracting him/her from his environment. (Kagitcibasi, 1983; Bronfenbrenner,
1974) In this way the child is left to rely on his/her limited resources when
the intervention ends. When the child's environment is supported and changed,
however, it can in turn help sustain the gains.<p>
<p>
Although the short-term results of the project were very encouraging, only
long-term investigations could indicate whether mother empowerment can ensure
that with continued support from the mother, the maintenance and extension of
the positive development of the child brought about by the intervention
programme can be sustained. <p>
<b>	Long-term effects on the child.  </b>In 1991, six years after the
completion of the intervention programme a follow-up study was conducted to
investigate the long-term effects of the project. 225 mothers of the original
sample of 255 were found; 217 mothers and their children participated in the
follow-up study.  Home intervention in the form of mother training was found to
have sustained effects<i>. </i> A most important finding had to do with school
attainment. At the time of the follow-up study compulsory schooling was five
years in Turkey. Therefore in low-income areas especially, those children who
are not successful in school drop out after they finish primary school (five
years). Continuing with schooling is an important factor for future success and
social mobility. Of the young adolescents  (13-15 years of age), 86% of the
mother-trained group were still in school, compared with 67% of the nontrained
group, the difference being highly significant (p= .002).<p>
<p>
The children in the mother-trained group surpassed the nontrained group on a
vocabulary test, showing higher cognitive capacity.<b>[1]</b>   Also, the children in the mother-trained
group showed better school performance than the nontrained group over the five
years of primary school<i>. </i>They also manifested more positive attitudes
related to schooling and better self-concept. For example they felt that they
could be the best in class if they studied hard, that the teachers and they,
themselves, were pleased with their school performance; and they gave fewer
nonacademic reasons for continuing in school, such as "having nothing better to
do" or "parents wanted them to attend school", than the nontrained group<i>.

The adolescents whose mothers had been trained reported more positive
retrospective memories of their mothers (from childhood).  They remembered
their mothers as talking to them, being more appreciative of them, more
consoling and less likely to use physical punishment. These adolescents also
showed better social integration and autonomy, in terms of their ideas being
accepted by their friends and making their own decisions<i>. </i><p>
<p>
More children of the trained mothers than the nontrained mothers believed that
they were prepared for school at the beginning.  Since two-thirds of both
groups had been in preschool, this difference between the trained and
nontrained group is likely to be due to mother training. This suggests that the
early family experiences of the mother-trained and nontrained groups had been
quite different, leading to more positive long-term outcomes for the
mother-trained children. <p>
<p>
<b>	Long-term effects on the mother.</b> Mother training resulted in a positive
change in the mother, both in empowering the mother to provide a more
supportive and stimulating environment for the overall development of the child
and also in long-term benefits to the mothers themselves.  In terms of
mother-child interaction,  mothers who had been trained reported having better
relations with their children, such as understanding the child, talking
problems over with the child, and not beating the child as much as the
nontrained group. They also had better family relations and had higher
educational expectations for their children. These results from the mother
interviews confirmed the adolescents' self-reports.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>	Direct effects on mothers.</b>  Trained mothers were more likely to have
the last word in making decisions (48%) than untrained mothers (38%).  A
significant difference was found between the two groups indicating the higher
status of trained mothers in the home, as measured by an index combining shared
decision-making, communication and role-sharing with their spouses (also used
in the fourth year of the original study).  Trained mothers were found to read
newspapers and magazines more than untrained mothers, employed contraceptive
methods more than untrained mothers and were more knowledgeable on issues of
family planning. These mothers seemed to utilize available services more and
had a better evaluation of their economic situation than untrained mothers.
   <p>
<p>
Thus the programme seemed to enable women to communicate more effectively with
their children, to prepare more positive environments for their overall
development and success, as well as to achieve better relations with their
family and to increase their status in their family. <p>
<p>
<b>Discussion of the Effects of the Project</b><p>
The long-term effects of the project seem tied to its holistic and contextual
focus. Given the key role of the mother in the utilization of resources for the
production of family health and well-being, especially regarding the
development of children, it makes good sense to target the mother for
intervention. The programme results indicate how nonformal early childhood
education and parent education can be integrated and how the mother can be
empowered to promote her child's as well as her own well-being.<p>
<p>
The project built and strengthened women's networks through the group
discussion sessions. These networks were expected to continue,  providing
support to the women after completion of the programme. Another reason for the
sustained effects is the nature of the changes in women and in their
interactive styles with their children and spouses. The mother training
programme provided the participating mothers with better interpersonal skills;
these newly acquired skills helped them to solve problems more effectively,
which can be expected to take root and be self-sustaining. (Kagitcibasi 1992)<p>
<p>
The follow-up study of the project, especially, has far-reaching policy
implications. Most important, it has constituted a crucial test of the value of
the original research project as a model for further replication. In countries
like Turkey, where there is a need for large-scale early support and training
programmes, it has not often been clear which approach is most effective, due
partly to the lack of long-term evaluation studies. (Evidence is often based on
Western experience which may or may not be generalizable to different cultural
contexts.) The programme offered an example of the great potential of a
culturally sensitive, contextual approach, rather than an individualistic
approach, in supporting child (and mother) development. Specifically, the child
was reached <b>in context, </b>through the mother, and the mother was
reached<b> in context, </b>through the community-based mothers discussion
groups. Such parent-family oriented interactive learning experiences promote
both the child's overall development and the empowerment of the woman since the
context is mobilized to support the target persons. <p>
<p>
While the aim of the original project was to investigate whether mother
training constituted a useful supplement to educational nursery schools in
order to create a "comprehensive preschool education", the results of this
study, based on the variables measured, suggest that centre-based intervention
and home-based intervention programmes may be considered as alternatives to
each other rather than viewing them only as complementary elements. <p>
<p>
In countries like Turkey where state resources are directed toward formal
education, concentrating on primary schooling, preschool education is bound to
have low priority.  In Turkey, only 5% of the children attend any type of
preschool before entering primary school. Therefore there is a need to develop
cost-effective alternative models to formal preschool education. Adult
education programmes can be utilized for this purpose. They can help to
overcome problems encountered due to educational and economic disadvantage.
This is important, considering Turkey is a country which does not have a
widespread system of early childhood education, although it has a very large
number of children who are at risk of developmental deficits because of
socioeconomic disadvantage.   Since most preschool programmes are located in
the larger cities and are mainly private tuition-charging centres, rural
children and those from socioeconomically disadvantaged sectors have limited
access to preschool education, although they need early enrichment the most.
(Bekman, 1990)  Center-based educational programmes, while producing desired
effects in terms of the child's cognitive and social benefits, are expensive to
implement on a large scale. <p>
<p>
Beside the positive effects of the Mother-Child Education Programme, the cost
effectiveness of the model also makes it attractive for wide-scale use. Home
intervention is a highly effective and relatively low-cost strategy for early
enrichment.  Expensive institutional investment is not required, as the most
important resource used is the human resource. Furthermore, being
community-based, the Mother-Child Education Programme has the inherent
flexibility to benefit from the indigenous culture and to be culturally
relevant. <p>
Through enriching the child's environment, this approach has the potential to
promote self-sustaining changes and growth.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>From Project to Programme</b><p>
<p>
In order for the research project to move beyond its limited status to
application on a broader scale, a number of things had to happen.  First, the
content needed to be adjusted so it could be more easily administered and could
be applied in various contexts and with groups with differing needs.  To this
end, a major shift was made in the content of the Cognitive Training Programme
as set out by HIPPY. (Lombard, 1981)  The new Training Programme (Kagitcibasi
and Bekman 1991) was condensed into a span of 25 weeks and was directed
specifically at children in the year before they begin formal schooling.  This
revised model was tried out separately in both Ministry of Education and
nonministry, settings even before the research project ended, and was further
adjusted based on these experiences.<p>
<p>
The revised organization and content involve 25 weekly group meetings of around
two hours duration. Each group is made up of approximately twenty mothers. The
Mother Enrichment part of the programme is realized in the form of group
discussions guided by a trained group leader during the first part of every
week's meeting. The mothers are expected to attend every week and they do make
an effort to do so, which is a constructive action on behalf of the mother. The
mother's participation in the discussions teaches her to develop effective
communication with the child, increasing her sensitivity to the child's needs,
aimed to equip her to promote the child's healthy physical and psychosocial
development. The mothers ask questions, generate answers and express opinions
related to their own experiences in the discussions, guided by the group
leader.  Group dynamics techniques are used.  There is not a unidirectional
flow of information, rather learning takes place through an exchange of
real-life experiences and self-expression is encouraged. In the first half of
the twenty-five weeks the topics for the group discussions focus on children's
development, health, nutrition and creative play activities. In the second
half, the emphasis is on discipline, mother-child interaction, communication,
expressing feelings and the needs of the mother.    <p>
<p>
A further component has been added in the past year. During the group meetings
and following the weekly Mother Enrichment topics, the group leaders direct the
discussion to a specific topic in family planning and health.  The topics range
from birth control methods to problems that can be encountered in pregnancy and
childbirth.  <p>
<p>
Following the group discussions, mothers are taught how to use that week's
Cognitive Training Programme.  Thus in the second part of the group meeting,
the group breaks up into smaller groups of four or five, headed by a mother's
aide (who is a part of the group but has completed the worksheet with her child
the previous week).  Each small group role-plays through the worksheets and
storybooks in order to be able to use the Cognitive Training Programme
effectively with their children at home during the week. Each week's materials
contain various exercises to be used by the mother with the child each day. The
group leader (Ministry of Education Adult Education teacher) conducts home
visits now and then to ensure the Cognitive Training Programme is being
implemented correctly and to assist with problems that may be encountered with
the child.<p>
<p>
In addition to adjusting the actual organization and content of the
Mother-Child Education Programme, it was necessary, in order for the project to
become a larger programme, to disseminate and publicize results of the Mother
Enrichment component of the project.  Accordingly, in collaboration with the
mothers participating in the mother training programme, an eleven-session
television series was prepared.  The participating mothers volunteered to take
part in the small group discussions which were televised on the state
television channel.  These television programmes were well-received.<p>
<p>
In order to extend the programme, additional funding and a continuing
institutional base were required.  Based on the research results and television
series, it was possible to obtain limited funding from various groups,
including parent-teacher associations, women's groups and private businesses.
With these funds additional applications of the mother training programme were
carried out as a public service, mainly in Istanbul.<p>
<p>
 In 1991, additional advances were made with the collaboration of UNICEF and
the Ministry of Education.  A major breakthrough occurred when the Mother
Enrichment component of the project was adopted into the Adult Education
Programme of the Ministry of Education, targeted at training childminders.  The
project team trained Adult Education teachers and the revised training manual
was published by UNICEF. <p>
Also in 1991, a foundation belonging to a private bank, the Finance Foundation,
began providing financial support for the programme in Istanbul in Adult
Education Centres attached to the Nonformal Education Division of the Ministry
of Education. In two years, over 700 mothers in Istanbul participated in the
programme. During 1992 and 1993, with the collaboration of UNICEF and the
Finance Foundation, the programme was applied in [[Thorn]]anl&yacute;urfa in
the less-developed South Eastern region of Turkey to over 700 women and young
girls. Another replication of the project was begun in 1992, when group leaders
were trained in the Netherlands to work with Turkish workers there.  In
addition the Mother Enrichment component of the project is currently being
applied on a pilot basis in two early enrichment programmes carried out by
Averroes Foundation. <p>
<p>
These successes and adaptations have helped to promote formation of a privately
funded nonprofit organization called the Mother-Child Education Foundation
(MCEF), founded in August 1993 with the initiative and support of the finance
Foundation.  The aim of the MCEF is to "contribute by means of educational,
social economic and financial activities to the development of modern Turkey."
The Foundation not only finances the programme but also trains teachers,
prepares material and collaborates with the Ministry of Education and other
organizations for the expansion of the programme across Turkey.<p>
<p>
Continuing collaboration between the Nonformal Education Division of the
Ministry of Education and the MCEF has allowed the programme to expand.  The
Nonformal Education Division is responsible for Adult Education centres in each
district in the country.  Adult Education teachers are trained by the MCEF to
apply the Mother-Child Education Programme in their own districts, mainly in
low-income shanty town and working class areas.  The aim is for the Nonformal
Division Ministry staff to be responsible for the implementation of the
programme at various levels of the organizational structure.  This will allow
the number of beneficiaries to increase as the training of staff currently
being undertaken by the Foundation can be assumed by Ministry staff.  This will
also quicken the process of training, reduce costs and set in place a
decentralized system.<p>
<p>
In the past three years this collaboration has led to participation of over
3,000 mother-child pairs and in 1993-1994, the programme was applied in ten
provinces across Turkey.  In 1994-1995, expansion to 20 provinces and 4,000
mother-child pairs was planned with the Ministry of Education.  In addition, a
collaboration with the General Directory of Social Services and the Child
Protection Agency (SSCPA) attached to the Office of the Prime Minister has led
to pilot projects in Izmir and Ankara.  The intention is to implement the
programme in twelve districts in 1994-1995.<p>
<p>
The process that has been described above, still in progress, is an example of
a research project leading to a national programme. It is also an example of
scientific research affecting public policy. With the help of the Mother-Child
Education Programme, the rather narrow definition of preschool education in
Turkey in terms of formal centre-based preschools has expanded to include
nonformal community and home-based early enrichment. In terms of the goals and
targets of nonformal education, also, there has been an expansion in scope to
combine early childhood education and care with parent (adult) education and to
combine child development goals with women's empowerment, health and family
planning. Finally, we also have here an example of effective cooperation among
a university, a Ministry (government) and international (UNICEF) and local
agencies (Mother-Child Education Foundation). It is clear that programmes have
much to gain and are more likely to go to scale with such cooperation. The
Mother-Child Education Programme promises to contribute to human development
and well-being in Turkey. <p>

<b>ANNOTATED BIBLIOGRAPHY</b> by Cassie Landers<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
1.	The following "annotated bibliography" is in one way less and in another way
more than an annotated bibliography: less, because not all documents included
are annotated separately; more because it is organized around themes, and
closer to the genre of essay reviews rather than annotations. We have opted for
this approach, because it allowed us to not only present documented
information, but also include more extensive comments which tie in with the
main body of the paper.<p>
<p>
2. 	The "themes" are countries/communities which have specific features in
terms of the role of language/s at the preschool level. Thus, the entries are
listed alphabetically by country/community.<p>
<p>
3. 	With the purpose of making some kind of comparison easier, most entries
follow the same scheme: Specific features of the document/s discussed are
organized under a set of headings. These are: <p>
<p>
		 Document Source/s (what kind of document/s were      consulted); 	<p>
	  Community (including language situation); <p>
	 Educational System Specifics (of the country or community involved); <p>
	 Program with the following subheadings character-istics/components<p>
<p>
		  Origin		<p>
		  Program Goals<p>
		  Specific Objectives<p>
		  Difficulties in Implementation<p>
		  Outcomes<p>
<p>
	 Comments (these are our comments, not additional ones made by the authors of
the documents)<p>
<p>
"N.a." following any of these headings or subheadings means "not applicable" or
"not available", according to the situation and document/s. A few entries
differ slightly from this organization, either because less or more material
was available which did not fit into the set of headings.<p>

<p>
The documents consulted cover six different projects all concerned with
educational provisions for aboriginal Australians. In the following, after a
brief summary of the main issues of all six projects (section I), we
concentrate on the <u>language issues</u> of two of these, the "Bourke Project"
and the "Queensland Project" - the only two of the six which have a specific
language component (section II). <p>
<p>
<b>I. General Issues - All Projects</b><p>
<p>
<b>Communities:  </b>Aboriginal communities in various parts of Australia
(Bourke project involved aboriginal and white children). Projects only in
communities where standard English and/or aboriginal English are spoken.
Depending on project, aboriginal English seen as "impoverished" English or as
dialect in its own right. No attempts made in these six projects to revitalize
any tribal language/s. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Origin:</b>  Expansion of aboriginal preschool facilities a direct result of
change in federal government policy. Projects timely to serve two functions:
accelerate government action in field of aboriginal education and focus
interest at early childhood level (D, p. 147).<p>
<p>
<b>Common Goal:</b> Help overcome some of initial educational disadvantages
encountered by aboriginal children, pave way for higher levels of school
achievement (D, p. xiii).<p>
<p>
<b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> "usual problems of action-research: too
much pressure to achieve results quickly; poor communication between project
staff; ...conflicting demands of human need versus research design...(D, pp.
136/7)." In addition because of location: huge distances, extreme climate.<p>
<p>
<b>Outcomes:</b>  Actual establishment of preschool facilities; positive
effects on children's general academic and social development including easier
adjustment to formal schooling; less shy at school; more regular attendance;
<b>clearer and more fluent speech</b>; improved general health and nutrition.
But all based on impressionistic reporting, not objectively measured outcomes.
Very little research output.<p>
<p>
<b>II. Language Issues - Bourke Project and Queensland Project</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Bourke Project,</b> started in 1969 by child psychiatrists and
psychologists, established a compensatory highly structured preschool program
in the town of Bourke (New South Wales). Main feature: strong emphasis on
language development. Based on deficit hypothesis (that the children's major
handicap is impoverished English), project was based on so-called
Bereiter-Englemann method where preschoolers receive "verbal bombardment [here
of standard Australian English] by trained teachers in a special setting (D, p.
53)" and 'participate' by shouting out speech patterns, drills, etc.<p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
The Bereiter-Englemann approach has come under a lot of criticism, and it seems
unlikely that anyone would openly support its use (or a similar approach) in
preschool and/or early primary school settings that encourage language
maintenance or promote language revitalization actively. However, classroom
observation in a rural primary school in the Department of Puno (Peru), showed
that the "shouting out" of speech patters, drills, and shouted out chorus
repetition of the teacher's answers is still relied upon by--in this case
primary school--teachers. (This approach was used in a Spanish-medium as well
as in an Aymara-medium class). The observer's impression was that the children
were well used to this <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
method and that attempts at other methods such as eliciting non-<p>
drill, non-repetitive individual responses largely failed (Heise-Baigorria,
1988, fieldnotes). Is this simply more evidence that 'meaningful' teaching
cannot take place unless the teacher and children "speak the same
language"--i.e. understand each other? Or to what extent does this reflect
antiquated, insufficient, or non-existent <b>teacher training</b>? We raise
this question, because--irrespective of level--teacher training is a major
component in many education projects. Policy makers must be informed not only
about what really goes on in the classroom, but also about the motives teachers
have for choosing particular teaching styles and methods. Unless these motives
are understood it seems fruitless to try to 'convince' teachers of 'better'
approaches; and to get to know teachers' motives, dialogue with teachers must
take place.<p>
<p>
<b>The Queensland Project</b>, for 5 - 8 year olds also put great emphasis on
language development. It started out with a similarly strong compensatory
approach which described the children's language (i.e. aboriginal English) as
inadequate and impoverished. However, due to the personal philosophies of some
of the fieldworkers and large amount of data collected on children's usage of
language in their natural settings, the concept of "language deficit" quickly
changed to one of "language difference". Extensive language research was done
and distinctions between aboriginal English and standard English clarified.
They were both described as dialects and it became one of the principal goals
of the project to <b>help the child become fully bidialectal</b>: facilitate
the use of standard English in school settings; enhance the use of aboriginal
English in out-of-school settings; actively support switching between
aboriginal English and standard English. In the "oral language" part of the
program, language units that were introduced moved "progressively from words
and sequences common to both aboriginal English and standard English, to those
constructions not found in aboriginal English (D, p. 159)." <p>
<p>
Characteristic of this project--and in this markedly different from Bourke
project--was combination of four 'strands' integrated around language units:
oral language patterns of standard English; reading and writing skills;
perceptual skills; problem solving and critical thinking. Project has been
described as most thoroughly researched and carefully prepared program for
aboriginal children in Australia. Soon became adopted in aboriginal schools
throughout the State and had major impact on language arts curriculum for all
primary schools in Queensland. <p>

<p>
<b>Document Source:</b> Collection of papers presented at a 1983 symposium
organized by the "Wiener Arbeitsgemeinschaft..." [Vienna Working Group for the
Concerns of Ethnic Groups - Institute for Ethnic Groups]. Majority of
contributors to this volume are of an ethnic minority in Austria (e.g. Croat,
Slovene, Czech, Hungarian). <p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> Various ethnic groups, but mainly Slovenes in the state of
K&auml;rnten and Croats in the state of Burgenland. Hardly any monolingual
Slovenian or Croatian speakers. No details about language use.<p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> Federal laws determine national language
and specific rights for ethnic groups, but education is "L&auml;nder" [states]
-responsibility. Schooling for ethnic groups in K&auml;rnten and Burgenland
substantially different; participation in bilingual (Slovenian/German)
schooling in K&auml;rnten based on parental decision; in Burgenland on
percentage of size of ethnic (non-German L1 speaking) group in the area and
subsequent decision of the Land's superintendent. Provision of bilingual or
ethnic group language kindergartens not obligatory.<p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> Some kindergartens or kindergarten-groups
exist in all ethnic group languages, but availability differs. K&auml;rnten has
no public, and only three (!) private bilingual kindergartens; but there are 67
(!) elementary schools where children are registered for the bilingual or
Slovenian program. Kindergarten teachers are not adequately trained for work in
bilingual kindergartens: Slovenian language is only an optional 2 hour/week
course in kindergarten teacher training; nothing else is offered.<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> Federal laws of 1955 concerning ethnic rights;
Burgenl&auml;ndish Education Law of 1937 and K&auml;rnten Education Law for
Minorities of 1959. Slovene and Croatian cultural and/or religious groups and
some parent initiatives promote public bilingual kindergartens. <p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> To help support successful development of ethnic
groups.<p>
<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Teaching Objectives:</b> n.a.<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> Pedagogical arguments were not heard;
plans for an obligatory bilingual education program victim to political
interests; main problem is parent resistance: parents pressured by political
and social groups against Slovene in general and bilingual kindergartens and
schooling in particular. Slovene/bilingual kindergartens receive less financial
help. Too few qualified teachers. In case of Croatian: children's language
(Burgenl&auml;ndish-Croatian) different from standard Croatian-Serbian (as
promoted in elementary school). <p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> n.a.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
 Education for Hungarians in Burgenland and Vienna and for Czechs in Vienna are
further topics, but only briefly treated, and only concerning formal schooling
(which excludes kindergarten).<p>

pages).<p>
<p>
<b>Document Source:</b> In-depth case-study-based investigation sponsored by
the Canadian International Development Research Centre, published by UNICEF.<p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> Rural Andean Highland Aymaras in Santiago de Huata District
near the Titicaca Lake, province of Omasuyos, department of La Paz, Bolivia.
District's pop. approx. 20.000; about 1.100 of these in town of Santiago de
Huata; about 5.500 in the 10 communities under investigation. These chosen as
representative of Bolivia's large rural Aymara-speaking population, and
characterized as in the "heart of the Aymara world" with a "strong language
loyalty"; use of Aymara is preferred over use of Spanish by large majority,
particularly in the home. In province of Omasuyos by 93%; in Omasuyos 50% are
bilingual (Aymara/Spanish); 1% is monolingual Spanish. Illiteracy in Omasuyos:
53%. Undernourishment and high infant mortality rate are chronic problems.
Parents' progressive impoverishment and loss of land motivate younger
generation to migrate to cities and other regions. <p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> Educational segregation depending on type
of school (rural, urban fiscal, private). Many rural children start working as
early as 3-4 years old; most 4-5 year-olds are integral part of family work
force. Pre-school is defined as the two levels of structured, formal
pre-elementary education for four-to six-year olds. Non-obligatory. Nationwide
about 28% of 4-5 year-olds assist. Two to three times more in urban than in
rural areas.<p>
<p>
<b>Program:</b> <p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> Two national official programs for rural
preschool education are in use. Objectives and contents are very similar to
those for urban programs. Curriculum not based on rural reality; e.g. agrarian
activities only tangential; teachers give them no importance. <b>Language of
instruction is Spanish.</b> Aymara proficient teachers use Aymara only as a
"last resort" when children do not understand what was said in Spanish,
particularly at beginning of school year. Preschool teachers promote
individualism and competition among children, whereas Aymaran communities are
characterized by solidarity and mutual cooperation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> 1981 "Programa M&iacute;nimo para el Nivel Pre-Primario
Rural" [Minimum program for pre-primary rural education] under the national
supervision of pre-primary education of the Ministry of Education and Culture
and the "Contenidos M&iacute;nimos del Programa de Educaci&oacute;n
Preb&aacute;sica Rural" [Minimum contents for the rural pre-primary education
program]. Both come from and are under supervision of national public
institutions (ministry of education and national directorate of initial rural
education).<p>
Since 1918 eight education plans of diverse orientations for pre-school;
majority with emphasis on socializing child into formal school life (i.e.
Spanish only education); plan of 1918 was the only one that contained as a
teaching objective "various exercises in the mother tongue."<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> Prepare children for formal primary education. Adapt
them to a learning environment that is removed from their ethno-cultural
reality. Help children "overcome the archaic ways of their parents' life" and
teach them "modern models." <p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Teaching Objectives:</b> Castellanization. Teachers' objectives
as expressed in this investigation, reflect to some extent parents'
expectations. Many parents expect children to a) learn Spanish, b) learn to
read and write in preschool. Parents' expectations reflect dominant group's
pressures: Spanish seen as (only) way to better future, higher social status.<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> Aymara is seen as principal
"obstacle" in pre-school teaching and learning although almost all involved
(children, parents and most teachers) dominate it. Language becomes a problem
even with Aymaran proficient (i.e. bilingual) teachers, because methodologies
and materials for fostering bilingualism are not available. Lack of these
reinforces teachers' negative attitude towards Aymara as medium of instruction
and towards Aymaran culture in general.<p>
 Preschoolers desert program for various reasons, prominent among these are:
Children have to work; whole families migrate in hope of better income
possibilities; and preschoolers suffer severely because of tremendous clash
between Aymaran family/community life and Spanish-only urban-style formal
education.<p>
 High student teacher ratio (28:1); lack of facilities and materials.<p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> In highlands of Department of La Paz 13% do not finish
preschool. Children experience serious confusion. <p>
<b>Comments</b> <p>
<p>
 Book investigates a "what-is" situation, but in view of Ministry of
Education's intent to expand preschool education and rural education for adults
. The Ministry's objectives as<p>
<p>
regards preschool education include: extend rural preschool education and
consider native languages [Aymara and Quechua] in new curriculum.<p>
<p>
 Investigator's recommendations include: health and nutrition programs
alongside and related to preschool program; program based on rural life reality
with emphasis on continuity between home and community life and school
environment; bilingual program with corresponding texts, teaching materials and
trained teachers. Administrative bases to ensure continuity of this type of
program through all levels; foster parent participation and parent further
education through non-formal education programs.<p>
<p>
 Situation in Peruvian highlands in many ways similar (see ......).<p>

<b>Document Source:</b> Description of program by two supportive insiders.<p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> Mohawk community in Caughnawaga, Quebec, just North of the US
border. English/Mohawk bilingual situation with few monolingual Mohawk
speakers, but about 1000 Mohawks speak Mohawk perfectly. Mohawk is spoken
primarily by adults over 30 - 40 years old and by many children. Most teenagers
are confined to English.<p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> n.a.<p>
<p>
<b>Program</b> <p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> Bilingual program. Mohawk taught to all
children from nursery school through grade 6 and to those who want it in high
school.<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> Grassroots level and voluntary. A dedicated group of Mohawk
teachers learned to master Mohawk and designed language curriculum in their
spare time over a period of several years.<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> Revitalize Mohawk; provide for Mohawk children a link
with their past and source of solidarity; recapture personal and social
identity.<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Teaching Goals:</b> Teach a "way of thinking" in Mohawk, and get
an understanding of the polysynthetic nature of Mohawk and of its rich
metaphorical and idiomatic usage. Enable children to participate in a form of
enjoyment specifically related to their language (linguistic manipulations for
teasing, entertainment). <p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties/Problems in Implementation:</b> Unavailability of materials;
little everyday exposure to written language outside of school; limited funds;
but major problem was community resistance. For many Mohawk speaking adults,
speaking Mohawk had been a reason for ridicule and difficulties in school, and
less than excellent command of English later in life a reason for job
discrimination. Convincing parents of usefulness of Mohawk revitalization and
soliciting their help and that of wider community in general therefore became
one of the major components of the program.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> Overcame community's resistance; gained community's active
interest and participation in program; demand for adult Mohawk classes;
children again use Mohawk spontaneously among themselves and with adults
outside of school.<p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<b></b><p>
 Substantial part of chapter describes characteristics of Mohawk language and
invites reader to "learn" some Mohawk while reading the chapter. This is
helpful in understanding vast differences between Mohawk and English and fun to
read.<p>

pp. 89 - 105.<p>
<p>
<b>Document Source:</b> Description of program and account of how it developed
by supporter of program. Author relies heavily on information and opinions
provided by two persons involved in program since its early stage. <p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> Small community (called Zhahti Koe, in English known as Fort
Providence) of Native Americans along Mackenzie River, Northwest Territories.
Population of 602 (in 1981): 76% Dene, 11% Metis, 14% others. Different
dialects spoken in region are understood by most of the Dene (in English known
as South Slavey). Slavey, French, English are spoken; French because of
remaining impact of Roman Catholic mission established in mid-1800s. <p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> n.a., but education still influenced by
earlier Roman Catholic missionary work. <p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components: A "three-stage" program:</b> <b>First
Stage:</b> "initiation period" (1980-81) included preliminary research (see
below under "Origin"), meetings, consultations with other communities involved
in indigenous language programs. Hiring of research team. A short <b>Second</b>
<b>Stage</b> (summer 1981): Teacher training, research and development of
curriculum and Slavey teaching material. <b>Third Stage</b>: implementation in
school and continuation of research. <p>
<b>	 Main Components</b><p>
		 Ongoing research projects on traditional Dene way of life to gather
materials for oral Slavey program were based on interviews with elders and
parents;<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
		 All researchers local, of Dene descent and Slavey/English bilingual, most
already involved in education (as teachers, aids, parents);<p>
<p>
		 Home visits to parents by school principal and LEA chairperson to inform of
program;<p>
<p>
		 <b>Oral Slavey language program</b>: Kindergarten in Slavey; grades one
through nine one-half hour of oral Slavey each day implemented in ([the] one)
school; <p>
<p>
		 	Intensive Slavey language evening course to adult population 			(oral and
written language);<p>
<p>
		 Above led to decision to put <b>written Slavey in school curriculum</b>; -
Establishment of Slavey Program Development Committee to insure ongoing
implementation and coordination of program in school;<p>
<p>
		 Since September 1982: full (oral and written) Slavey language program
<b>made compulsory</b> to all children with at least one part of Slavey
descendant; recommended for those of non-Slavey descent;<p>
<p>
		 Since 1983: Slavey a required program.<p>
<p>
<p>
 b) <b>Origin:</b> Started as research project in 1980: a community survey
documented community's wish to incorporate more Slavey culture and language
into school program. Grew into "Slavey Research Centre"; then became a program.
Author stresses that involvement of variety of people and groups was essential
to program's initial development. Apart from research team, these included the
Chief and the Dene Band Council (representing the community); Settlement
Council (representing Local Government); LEA (some kind of local school
authority; not specified in text, and Appendix not available); area
superintendent; school principal. Significant that first funding proposal was
signed by Chief of Dene Band, all members of research team and two 'informants
to this study'. <p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> Raise overall low academic achievement of students who
had [all] followed English-medium instruction; make learning fun and
interesting; improve communication between elders and children; save knowledge
about Dene traditional way of life values and culture and save and revitalize
the language; address needs identified by community itself.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Objectives:</b><p>
		 Develop Slavey teaching materials for full oral program of immersion at
Kindergarten level and half-hour daily instruction for grades 1-9;<p>
<p>
		 Establish a full "bilingual program".<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> reservations about including written
Slavey into the program; parental opposition to making program compulsory. <p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> "children's language skills improved to the point where
"non-fluent" category was eliminated (all now "passively bilingual or fluent");
"increasingly positive self-concept among Dene students"; "strengthened and
affirmed use of Slavey today"; saved traditional knowledge; increased
community's participation in decision making; strengthened community;
established important precedent; "pioneered approach to community language
development."<p>
Outcomes attributed not least to ability to combine mobilizing community
support with working within the "political machinery."<p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b> <p>
<p>
 Article mentions rather fleetingly that there were reservations to the move
from oral language to a written standardized form and that there was opposition
to making the Slavey program compulsory for (part-) Slavey descendent children.
The comments on how this was handled are confusing: on the one hand, "the
project [the research team?] and the LEA decided to introduce written
Slavey..." and the "LEA unanimously [established] the [above mentioned] policy
[on compulsory program participation]"; on the other hand, the author implies
that the "collective process" and "traditional Dene methods of decision-making,
based on consensus" were instrumental in solving these difficulties. <p>
<p>
 The "LEA" is presented as a major force in the establishment of this program,
and the reader is referred to "Appendix K" which (presumably) specifies what
"LEA" stands for and who is part of it. Unfortunately, though, this Appendix
(and Appendices A through J) are missing.<p>

<p>
In Chapter 3 (Dong-feng: A Chinese Preschool) and chapter 5 (A Comparative
Perspective) we find information about the role of "language" and "language
teaching" in the Chinese preschool: Preschools begin educating the children in
the civic virtues that "lie at the heart of the revolution" (p. 220). This has
its reflection also in "language teaching" which "is centered on encouraging
children to express that which is socially shared rather than, as in the United
States, on that which is individual and personal (p. 191)." <p>
<p>
"...[H]elping children develop language skills is believed central to the
mission of the preschool...The emphasis in language development is on
enunciation, diction, memorization, and self-confidence in speaking and
performing. Chinese children learn in preschool to recite stories and
inspirational moral tales ... [they] flawlessly deliver long, rehearsed
speeches...(pp. 188/89)."<p>
<p>
"Oral skills are approached as an academic subject: Chinese teachers frequently
correct children's mispronunciations and misusage and encourage them to learn
public speaking as well as reading, writing, and arithmetic (p. 191)." <p>
<p>
With this stated emphasis on language education, we find it unfortunate that
nowhere is there any mention of the use of different languages in different
provinces or communities or of the possibility of more than one language in one
preschool.<p>

<b>Document Source:</b> Descriptive chapter by scholars.<p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> Population of 10.7 million, considered monolingual by and
large with about 95% belonging to Hungarian nationality. Rest know Hungarian to
a certain extent. Non-Hungarians divided into regular "nationalities" (e.g.
Germans, Slovaks, etc.) and an "ethnic group", the Gypsies (with three language
groups).<p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics</b>: Cost of education mostly covered by the
state. Very high attendance of preschool: In 1984, almost 90% of 3-6 year olds
attended the regular (non-obligatory) preschool. An additional 4% took a
192-hour preparation course. Following eight-class primary is compulsory.
Special education exists at primary and nursery school levels.<p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> (For children with L1 other than
Hungarian): Three types of preschools available: 1. "Nationality-language
preschool": same program as Hungarian preschool, but working language is that
of nationality; three times a week Hungarian is medium of activity. (Most
children here are bilingual with slight predominance of Hungarian over their
parents' language). 2. "Language-teaching preschool": Hungarian preschool with
three times a week nationality language as medium of activity, and 3. the most
recent: preschool which employs one of the Gypsy dialects jointly with
Hungarian as means of communication. Decision between use of 1. or 2. lies in
competence of local education authority and is conditioned by availability of
bilingual trained preschool teachers and aids.<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> n.a.<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> prepare children for primary school; in the case of
Gypsies address the problem of unproportionately high presence in "correctional
first class" and high drop out rate. <p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Objectives:</b> develop communicative skills; literacy readiness
(but not teaching reading or writing).<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties In Implementation:</b> for program in "nationalities
languages": lack of professionally trained bilingual nurses and aids; for Gypsy
dialect program: no training of Gypsy educators so far.<p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> In 1984, about 5% had grade repetition of some kind (before
joining normal first grade); but document does not provide separate data for
Hungarian L1 and others (and in this group for participants of different
programs). <p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
  Parental influence on choice of type of preschool is unclear.<p>
<p>
 Continuity of preschool-primary school approach is ensured for children of
national minorities who learn reading and writing in their own language if they
attend a nationality primary school. (Acquisition of Hungarian reading begins
in second grade in these schools). <p>
<p>
 Few primary schools have a Gypsy dialect as an auxiliary language. In these,
(any) reading and writing begins in second half of first year; "speech
development" (in Gypsy) is given in first half instead. This latter approach is
as yet an unsystematic attempt to find a more promising way of schooling for
Gipsies. Whether this is exclusively a "compensatory" approach or also includes
a concern about maintaining or revitalizing Gypsy languages and culture cannot
be deducted from the text. "Gypsy education" would most likely be a fascinating
and informative area of study in relation with language maintenance and
revitalization.<p>

<b>Document Sources:</b> (A) and (B) are descriptive accounts of the history
and organization of preschool education in India. Of these, (A) seems the more
thorough. (C) is a book-size account written by an ardent advocate of the
"Vikaswadis". Of the three documents this is of most interest to us. To put the
Vakiswadi document into context we first give minimal background information on
preschools in India: <p>
<p>
<b>General Situation and Issues</b><p>
<p>
<b>Types of Preschools:</b> There are different types of preschools: The
(private) Montessori system and Froebelian kindergarten (the influence of
Montessori and Froebel are very widespread in India); the 'minimum-standard
preschool (literate rural women conduct these preschools; children and
expectant mothers are being fed here; there is no special equipment and there
are no special buildings); the 'mobile creches for working mothers' children
(for communities that consist mainly of migrant workers, e.g. in construction
work; improvised facilities; the (two dozen) 'laboratory preschools' attached
to universities which have well structured programs, are well staffed, well
equipped and the public so-called 'Balwadis', public preschools, controlled by
the Central Welfare Board.<p>
<p>
<b>Language/s in (preschool) Education:</b> (Based only on document A; document
B has nothing about language/s). Language used in most <b>private [pre]
schools</b>, except those catering to the upper classes [!], is generally
mother tongue of the children. Schools for the upper classes use English (as do
exclusive primary and secondary schools.) But language of instruction in Indian
<b>primary</b> schools is the predominant language of the state, <b>which may
or may not be the children's mother tongue.</b> Fourteen state languages out of
more than 105 Indian languages are used for instruction. If instructional <p>
language used is not Hindi, children must learn it as well as English. Thus,
Indian children must often learn to read and write minimum of two and sometimes
four languages, including two or more alphabet systems.<p>
<p>
<b>Educational Priorities:</b> With high rate of adult illiteracy and many
parents' unfamiliarity with the school system, preschool is seen as critical to
prepare children for entrance into primary school. However, despite the strong
interest in preschool education in India (prebasic education for children under
7 as the first part of basic education for all Indian children was a Gandhian
concept), priority lies in universal primary education and eradication of
illiteracy. In 1979, only 2% of three to five year olds attended preschools.
(1982: about 12700 preschools in India, compared to about 15200 in Japan in
1984). (UN Statistical Yearbook 1984/5). <p>
<p>
<b>Remedial Character:</b> As in many other countries, preschool education is
associated with the problem of failure in the primary schools. Hence,
preschools have a compensatory origin much like those of 'Headstart' in the
USA. <p>
<p>
<b>Continuity Preschool-Primary School:</b> Two experimental models are
mentioned: 1) The program in the state of Rahasthan, where preprimary classes
are attached to primary school: the first-grade class is reduced to a half-day
session, and the (same) primary teacher (after a short orientation and with
regular in-service training) also teaches the preschool. 2) the "Vikaswadi" (in
the state of Maharashtra) which integrates a cr&egrave;che, a Balwadi, and a
primary school into one organizational unit. This is described in more detail
below:<p>
<p>
THE "VIKASWADI": education for tribal children<p>
(The following is based on document C). <p>
<p>
	The Vikaswadis, a combination of cr&egrave;che, Balwadi and preschool, were
developed out of the so-called Anganwadis, "courtyard centres" [for which the
"Western" term "open preschools" is not really adequate.] Anganwadis, developed
in the late 40s, early 50s were decentralized preschool centres "held in any
available spot" (a courtyard of a house, under a tree, etc..) where teachers
went out to attract children, and the first educational provision, where
Harijan children (untouchables) were also induced to come. Children from ages
six months to 15 years gathered in Anganwadis which were also an informal
training ground for older siblings--mainly girls--and for parents. The
Vikaswadis were an effort to bring together in one unit the different age
groups of the Anganwadis and to provide a more organized and stable, but
non-formal educational program for tribal children. The first Vikaswadi was
started in 1954, and by 1956, the Indian government provided financial
assistance for conducting Vikaswadis as "a special project for the education of
tribal children (p.35). <b>Objectives and characteristics</b> of Vikaswadis
are: non-directive child education, right of child to learn in an atmosphere of
freedom and creativity, educate parents <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
alongside with children, first step for educators: to go among the people to
learn (part of Gandhian approach), avoid heavy expenditure and ostentation.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Vikaswadi in Kosbad </b><p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> People of the Warli tribe. <b>Language situation</b>: Main
regional (non-tribal) languages in the Kosbad area are Gujarati and Marathi.
Tribals speak their own language. The observer contends that "The vocabulary of
the tribal dialect is extremely limited and most adults can manage with just
about 300 words at their disposal. By habit, the tribals are reticent and there
is not much conversation between parents and children either (p.38)." <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> n.a. <p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> 1. Most important feature is its
integrated approach: not only that the three levels: cr&egrave;che, Balwadi and
preschool are integrated, but moreover, there is a training center; there also
evolved a night school which was later converted into a center for youth and
adult education where literacy and post-literacy work was done, as well as
training in skills that could help to improve the economic and family life
(e.g. health, hygiene, better farming practices, sewing, etc.). The teachers
were oriented towards working with the people through home visits, parents'
meetings and health work. 2. Language component: curriculum was adjusted to the
agricultural operations. Songs about paddy-cultivation, stories adapted from
Warli folk-tales narrated by the children themselves, reading lessons prepared
on the spot <b>partially using the Warli dialect</b>. Tribal language,
socio-economic conditions of the tribals, their art, music, dance, drama and
games were some of the features of the specially designed training programme.<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> see general description above.<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> Spread among tribals "such education as would lead to
their all-sided development and would be relevant to their life (pp. 41/42)."<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Objectives:</b> Reduce rate of primary school dropouts in the
Kosbad area; evolve appropriate teacher-training programs.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> main constraints of work among the
Warlis are poverty, "their traditional belief in magic," language
barriers.<u></u><p>
<u></u><p>
<u></u>f) <b>Outcomes:</b> n.a. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
 This kind of integrated approach, and particularly the importance of the
community's involvement is characteristic of programs in other countries.
'Community involvement', as well as 'learning across generations' are often
singled out as two of the most basic features necessary for a successful
language revitalization program. <p>
<p>
 'Growing up at Kosbad Hill' is a fascinating account of the emergence of
preschool education for rural children, and in particular tribal children,
undertaken by Tarabai Modak (soon joined by Anutai Vagh), two pioneers in
Indian early childhood education. It is fascinating on several accounts of
which three are mentioned here: 1) it describes exactly <b>how</b> a rural
preschool for tribal children was established, beginning with "enticing" the
children to come out of the woods where they were hiding; 2) it gives an
insight into the relevance of history, politics and social class structure for
(preschool) education (e.g. how the preschool movement derived from Gandhian
thinking; how resistance to equal treatment of children in preschools had its
roots in the caste system; the influence of the British educational system,
etc.); 3) it is testimony to the pioneering educational work of two women in a
"non-Western" country who are perhaps not as widely known as they should be. <p>

<b>Document Sources:</b> Reports from van Leer Foundation supported projects.
Only Kwale District report includes issue of language. Kakamega District report
used for obtaining illuminating background information (please see "Comments"
below). The following refers to Kwale District unless otherwise specified.<p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> In South Eastern part of Kenya, in Coast Province. Consists
of arable and lowland dry agricultural zones. Main occupation is subsistence
farming. In whole district with population of estimated 440 000 by 1989, 20%+
are children under six. Child mortality higher than national average (which is
1 in 8). High malnutrition rate. Clean water only sparsely available.<p>
Predominantly Muslim society. No details about language/s usage in
communities.<p>
<p>
<b>Educational system specifics:</b> Traditionally child care and education
done by older siblings and grandparents when parents engaged in farming. Now
more (older) children in primary school, and decline of extended family ties.
Preschool therefore more accepted as alternative for child care. About 200
preschools with 11,000 children. In addition: 3000 preschool-aged children in
<b>"madrasa"</b> (muslim schools). Complete madrasa education takes 12 years.
About 20 subjects taught, including Muslim religion, Arabic language,
kishahili. Before the project, preschool-aged madrasa children were learning
religion through memorization (in Arabic only). They did not do any activities,
nor use materials or equipment. Teacher's only materials were Arabic books,
chalk, blackboard.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Program</b> <p>
<p>
Project is in two sites: <b>Mahuka Islamic Education Centre</b> and <b>Matuga
Preschool Centre.</b> Unless otherwise specified, following refers to the
Mahuka part of project, since language issues are only addressed there.<p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> Integrated madrasa (Islamic)/preschool
(secular) curriculum includes daily: "pillars of Islam" (Islamic belief and
law); "how a Muslim child should behave"; Arabic (read and write in Arabic
script); outdoor activities; readiness activities (including literacy
readiness); environmental and creative activities; oral skills (including music
and movement, but as per Islamic law). Madrasa teacher training in secular
curriculum components and child-centered approach. <p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> Through initiative of a Muslim leader and in cooperation with
a team from DICECE (District centers of early childhood education), Education
Islamic Centre was started in 1981. Madrasa, mosque and water well were
completed by 1983; Muhaka preschool started in 1984 using one of the madrasa
classrooms. Islamic center principal requested from DICECE to train their
teacher in preschool curriculum. (Matuga preschool was started in 1974). Van
Leer Foundation supports DICECE preschool-teacher training courses. <p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> Integration of Islamic and secular preschool
education. Using Matuga preschool and Muhaka madrasa/preschool as entry point
to community to improve health, nutrition, care, and education of young
children ("integrated approach"). Raise awareness of importance of
child-centered preschool education. Increasing community commitment. <p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Objectives:</b> Change curriculum; increase use of Swahili in
preschool, decrease use of Arabic and of memorization. Develop resource
centers, train teachers, involve community in preparing facilities and
material. <p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> Preschool education in very poor
state (e.g. 100 children with one teacher in one small unequipped room). All
emphasis was on primary school. Educators as well as parents had to be
convinced of value of preschool and in particular of a "non-academic"
preschool.<p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> Parents who had been reluctant sent children to preschool.
Enrollment increased dramatically. Children had fun learning. Even Islamic
components were being taught through child-centered approach. Community
(including siblings) got involved in building sites and preparing materials. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
 Not even the Kwale document mentions the use of languages other than Arabic
and Swahili in either community or preschool. One is left wondering whether any
vernaculars are used in the preschools described here. Speaking more than one
language (and this does <b>not</b> refer to Arabic or English as a second) "is
the natural state of affairs all over East Africa... Kenyan policy once again
sanctions the vernaculars as media [of instruction]...[and] the present policy
to use vernaculars as a medium in the first three years of primary school is
highly flexible... (Myers Scotton, p. 211). There are about 18 official school
vernaculars, with Swahili one of them in the coastal areas" (Myers Scotton, p.
211). The situation is further complicated by the fact that although Swahili
was recently made a compulsory subject on the primary school-leaving
examinations, these are still held in English.<p>

<p>
1. <b>Bilingual Kindergarten Education</b>:  Even Modiano who has extensively
worked in bilingual education in Mexico as an educator, language planner,
program developer and researcher, beginning with her now famous research
project in the Chiapas highlands, provides hardly any information on bilingual
preschool education. The Office of Indian Education within the Secretariat of
Public Education (to which Modiano was (is?) affiliated) houses a program of
<b>formal education</b> for Indian children for grades kindergarten through six
grade. This is a large scale program. The kindergarten component has over 4000
kindergarten centers for about 150,000 children aged five to seven. The program
was mainly designed by Indian teachers. All teaching is in the children's
mother tongue. Spanish is introduced at the end of the school year via songs
and common greetings. The program's goal by the end of grade six is to have
children who are bilingual in their mother tongue and in conversational as well
as academic Spanish. Modiano cites an evaluation of the Indian language
kindergarten which found--not surprisingly--that most children achieved the
program's objectives when they were instructed in a language they understood.
We must point out that although the original (Spanish) title of this report
speaks of "el <b>preescolar</b> ind&iacute;gena" (our emphasis), the context
and Modiano's own translation make clear that the "preescolar" in this case is
the child who attends the kindergarten within the formal public school system,
not really the child we consider "preschool" here. <p>
<p>
<b>Community - Based Preschool:</b> Per&eacute;z Alarc&oacute;n et al., on the
other hand, present us with a detailed account of a community based
<b>preschool</b> project for four and five year olds who (according to this
source) are considered the preschool-age population in Mexico. In all Mexico,
approximately 48% of five- and 32% of four year olds are enrolled in preschool.
The project described here, Proyecto Nezahualpilli, was started in 1980 in two
marginal urban <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
settlements in Cd. Nezahualc&oacute;yotl, East of Mexico City. Although this
project does in no way address questions of bilingual preschool or language
maintenance/revitalization, we mention it here as an interesting contribution
for people involved in setting up community based preschool programs from
scratch. The book is a somewhat curious mix of something like a practical
guide, a detailed account of problems envisioned and/or encountered (and often
overcome) and a simplified course in childhood development and preschool
education theories. It contains a wealth of useful suggestions (but
unfortunately also an often overly didactic and righteous tone).<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusion</b><p>
<p>
If we could combine what both the large scale bilingual kindergarten program
for Indian children and the much smaller scale community based (non-bilingual)
preschool project have to offer, we might come up with a very interesting
language maintenance program for Indian preschoolers in Mexico. <p>

<p>
<b>Community:</b> Formerly nomadic reindeer-herding Saami population now mostly
settled on both sides of Swedish/Norwegian border. (1987: less than 10% of
total Saami population are reindeer herders). Target communities are scattered
in three areas: Tysfjord, Hattfjelldal and Lavangseidet. Traditional Saami way
of life kept alive by reindeer herders rather than others.  <p>
<p>
<p>
1976 data from Swedish Saami: adults' use of Saami language/s in conversations
with children much higher (60%) among reindeer-tenders than among
non-reindeer-herders (35%) (F). Saami consists of different mutually hardly
understandable languages (5 according to (B); 3 main groups with a total of
about 50 dialects according to (F). <p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> Primary education begins at age 7.
Everything up to age 7 <b>not</b> part of formal educational system. Pre-school
education is responsibility of local communities, but federal subsidies are
provided. Since 1975 legal provisions for pre-school education; under
jurisdiction of Ministry of Consumers and Administration which provides
guidelines, sets standards (D).  Since 1967: per government decision Saami
children have opportunity to be taught in Saami during first three grades of
primary. (Before, only regular Norwegian medium primary education was available
to Saamis). Since 1974 specialization of teachers' training for the Saami
school. Since 1975: Saami Council of Education: responsible for pedagogical
development in the Saami school (E). <p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> bicultural early childhood education
project, initiated in 1984, still running in 1989. Funded by Bernard van Leer
Foundation; operated [since when?] by Nordlands Research Institute in Bod.
Helps establish Saami language kindergartens and parent groups. Promotes
learning of Saami among non-Saamis. Produces teaching materials for use in
Saami districts; collects Saami stories; co-operates with print media and radio
in disseminating positive image of Saami culture; organizes workshops for
teachers; helps build up larger local networks among teachers, kindergarten
teachers, school administrators; promotes correspondence and exchange visits
with Saami children in school nearby in Sweden.<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> Initiated in 1984. (Foundation had already started similar
project in Sweden in 1979). Beginning in Hattfjelldal where a Saami School and
Saami cultural Center already existed. Work in Lavangseidet started in 1985, in
Tysfjord area in 1986.<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> Build up positive racial and cultural attitudes among
majority community; help Saami children build up positive self-view; improve
children's performance; equip them to cope with demands of school system and
challenge of living in a culturally mixed society.<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Objectives:</b> Increase use of Saami language by pre-school-age
children, students and parents; arouse interest in and increase knowledge of
Saami culture nationwide (i.e. among non-Saami); integrate Saami studies into
normal curriculum.<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> Population lives in scattered areas;
not easily accessible. Parents' reluctance to children's learning Saami
(assimilation seen as only way to get on in competitive Norwegian society).
Variety of Saami languages. Lack of written materials in Saami languages.
(South Saami written language officially recognized in 1978). <p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> "Saami culture is no longer regarded as a handicap for
children [in Lavangseidet area] (B)." "Increased interest in integrating Saami
studies into the normal curriculum (C)." Collection of stories and other
traditional materials. Production of some Saami teaching materials. Marginal
interest of non-Saami in learning Saami.<p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
 Document (D) makes reference to children of 'foreign workers', their problems
in regular day-care centers and the establishment of small centers where they
can "learn their mother tongue." However, the same document does not once
mention Saami.<p>
<p>
 In the case of Sweden: Special law regulating reindeer-husbandry has to some
extent a dividing effect on Saami population, expressed in difficulties of
keeping up former close relations and solidarity between reindeer-herding and
other Saami; the latter rapidly losing contact with the former, once they leave
reindeer husbandry and are being pushed into a marginal position not only with
respect to mainstream culture, but their own as well (F).<p>

<b>Document Source:</b> An evaluation case study of a vernacular preschool
program conducted in 1982 at the request of the provincial government three

political context of the program, and detailed observations and interviews.

<p>
<b>Community:</b> North Solomons Province (1 of 20) in Papua New Guinea (PNG).
21 language areas in the province. Tok Pisin is the lingua franca throughout
the province, but the 86% of the population living in rural areas use local
languages for everyday communication. Tok Pisin is not now considered a
language suitable as a medium for school instruction because it is less precise
than either Tok Ples (the term for each vernacular language) or English, and
people fear it will destroy Tok Ples. In 1982, the Villes Tok Ples Skuls (VTPS)
was operating in two language areas, around Buka and Buin. The schools could
start most easily there because linguists from the Summer Institute of
Linguistics (SIL) had worked in these two areas for more than 10 years.<p>
<p>
<b>Origin:</b> PNG became independent from Australia in 1975, and the new
constitution included provisions for decentralizing many government powers.
Moves to initiate mother tongue education began immediately after independence.
They became a reality after the establishment in 1978 of the North Solomons
Education Research Project, which conducted a province-wide survey of desires
for educational change via interviews conducted in the local language by a
group of university students.<p>
<p>
<b>Education System Specifics:</b> Before VTPS, children started the
English-medium primary school at age 7. The VTPS is planned as a two-year
vernacular preschool for 7- and 8-year olds, delaying primary school entry
until age 9. The parents consider that a better age for coping with English
instruction; and when the children graduate six years later, they are more
ready for jobs and other responsibilities in the community. In 1981, the
program was in 30 schools, and the first VTPS-educated children entered primary
Grade 1.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> Daily program includes religious
instruction, reading and writing, math, nature study, and cultural studies. The
literacy materials were developed by SIL linguists. All instruction is in the
Tok Ples ((Telei in Buka; Halia in Buin).<p>
<p>
b) <b>Program Goals:</b> <i>Educational</i> benefits from letting children
start literacy and gain other preschool skills in their mother tongue.
<i>Social</i> benefits from giving children knowledge, skills and values that
prepare them for participation in their community after school, and enabling
them to complete primary school at a later age. <i>	Cultural</i> benefits from
allowing children to receive the foundation of their education in the language
and culture of their community, and encouraging their tok ples to have equal
status with English in their minds.<p>
<p>
c) <b>Difficulties in Implementation</b> specifically related to language:
First, the choice of language for the teachers' guides. Tok Ples languages lack
vocabulary for technical issues (e.g. words for `word' or `syllable'); Tok
Pisin is not precise enough; and English many teachers read with difficulty.
The best solution seemed to be to put the guides in both Tok Ples and English.
Second, the problem of maintaining the VTPS learnings in the primary school.
Constraints include the cost of Tok Ples curriculum materials and the fact that
many primary school teachers are not assigned to schools in their own language
areas.<p>
<p>
Delpit suggests one possibility for the primary school curriculum:<p>
<p>
<i>Considering these constraints, one solution might be to 	approach teaching
tok ples through creative writing classes 	where children write and illustrate
short stories about their 	life and environment. The best of their work could
be 	duplicated and made into books for sharing with other classes 	and other
schools. This would provide a means to maintain and 	develop children's
literacy competence in their tok ples, 	create a body of written material in
the indigenous 	languages, and prepare children for the task parents wish 	them
to eventually undertake--writing books in tok ples about </i><p>
<i>what they learn from their Western education for their 	village communities
(p. 201).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>Third, before the VTPS can expand to other North Solomons language
areas, orthographies have to be established; and decisions made about the
language of instruction in town schools enrolling children from various tok
ples areas.<p>
<p>
<p>
d) <b>Outcomes:</b> With respect to <i>educational</i> benefits, Grade 1
teachers believed the VTPS graduates were superior to children without VTPS
experience. (The VTPS children were also 2 years older.) On the basis of tests
of metacognitive language skills, an international reading researcher, John
Downing, concluded that the VTPS children were superior to children who
received all their education in English. Delpit tested the children's oral
reading achievement and found they could not only read in their tok ples, but
could also use their training to decode Tok Pisin, a language that they could
not yet understand. The <i>social</i> benefits can only be evaluated over a
longer time period. The <i>cultural</i> achievements were less than with
language:<p>
<p>
<i>The young, Western-educated teachers frequently knew 	little about their own
culture; the children are often too 	young at ages seven and eight to be
presented with cultural 	knowledge traditionally transmitted to older youth;
and two 	years is generally considered too short a time to pass on 	significant
cultural instruction. Furthermore, the secret 	nature of much cultural
knowledge limits what can be 	taught....[And] the expectation that elders would
freely come 	into the classrooms to </i><p>
<i>share cultural knowledge runs counter 	to the tradition of reciprocity in
which the value of 	knowledge is acknowledged by the willingness to pay for its
acquisition (pp. 246, 248)."</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b> <p>
<p>
Delpit ends with a strong statement for education in both mother tongue and a
world language:<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Some scholars concerned with development issues have 	suggested that such a
planned integration of the past and the 	present is impossible, that a people
must make an all or 	nothing choice between outward-looking, nation-oriented
modernity and inward-looking, village-based traditionalism. 	This view is
reflected in two commonly held presumptions:... 	In one instance indigenous
people are seen as unable to reach 	a state of modernity without the wholesale
forfeiture of 	their own identity and adoption </i><p>
<i>of another under the constant 	tutelage of outside advisors; and, in the
other, they are 	seen as needing to be protected from any </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>exposure to outside 	information which can only serve to destroy and
debilitate 	their </i><p>
<i>culture .... The people of the North Solomons are 	striving to integrate the
two cultures on an equal footing. 	When they speak of "preserving their
culture," no, they do 	not mean hermetically sealing it away from all possible
contamination of change, rather they seem to mean maintaining 	the integrity of
their core values in the process of 	responding to new ways of life....Literacy
and the school 	have become a means of cultural transference and cultural
pride (pp. 237, 238, 240). </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>In addition, the significance of the VTPS program is in 	the process of
letting decisions about language choice be 	made by those served by the
educational system. With access </i><p>
<i>to information to inform their decision-making, "their advice 	on their own
aspirations, motivations, and expectations is 	invaluable in structuring
workable learning environments for 	their children (p. 249)."</i><p>

<b>Communities:</b> Catalonia in northeastern part of Iberian Peninsula; most
industrially developed region of Spain with Barcelona as industrial and long
established cultural center. Catalan (derived from Latin) is mother tongue of
50% of population (total 6 million); additional 30% understand it. It is the
language of the middle-class and intellectuals in Barcelona and of the rural
population. Most industrial workers (largely migrated from South of Spain speak
Castilian ("Spanish") only. (But Castilian is also official language of the
state). <b>Basque provinces (Euskadi)</b> in northeast (territories of Navarre
and French Pays Basque not included here), population around 2 million.
Depending on province between 8 and 45% speak Basque. Before revival of Basque,
it was still spoken in rural, isolated districts, but people who spoke Spanish
had lost use of Basque.   <p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> 1978 Statutes of Autonomy grant full
autonomy to the regions in administering education.  <p>
For latest developments, please see under "Comments" below.<p>
<p>
<b>Programs</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/components:</b> Catalonia: Decree on Bilingual Education
(see below) only refers to formal schooling from grade one on. At preschool
level there is a Catalan immersion program for children with Castilian L1:
begins at age four or earlier; teachers use Catalan systematically, but allow
children's use of Castilian and respond when children use L1. Idea is not to
devalue L1 and discriminate because of it, but present learning in L2 as
enrichment. Affective relation between teachers and children is stressed. L2
immersion in context of child's playful (i.e. not academic) activities
resembles child's first contact with his/her L1. Children are not rushed.
Reading in L2 begins only after solid oral competence of L2. Throughout later
formal schooling, child also receives instruction in L1. <b>Basque:</b> Types
of schools and percentage of enrollment (elementary school students): public
(42%), private (37%), and "ikastolas"(10%). <u>All might include preschool</u>.
<b>Ikastolas</b> are Basque-language schools beginning at preschool level.
Originally private and in opposition to government, now gradually being
integrated into public system. In original form, Spanish L1 children admitted,
but instruction only Basque (i.e. total immersion program). Because of numerous
difficulties some now feature gradual introduction of Basque to Spanish L1
children, "leading in some cases to true bilingual education" (Siguan, 1988, p.
465). Number of ikastolas increased rapidly (figures for development of school
enrollment in ikastolas include preschool and basic general education).<p>
<p>
Continuation of language policy throughout education:<p>
<p>
In all regions with local language/s : compulsory at all levels and grades of
Basic Elementary Education (ages 6 - 14) to have minimum of three to five hours
of instruction in local language. Can be more if school wants it. In secondary
education, same guidelines are followed (in Catalonia, however, secondary
academic programs use more Catalan than secondary vocational programs).
<b>Universities in Catalonia</b> use both languages. Anyone there has right to
use either language in any given situation. <b>University education in Basques
provinces</b> is new (even in Spanish). Recently established university offers
about 20% of courses in both Spanish and Basque. Goal is to teach all
disciplines in both languages.<p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> According to Pla I Molins, issue of bilingual education in
Spain has been going on for two centuries. (Her book includes an appendix with
documents about bilingualism of school children from 1758 to 1938). Decree of
Bilingual Education (implemented in 1981): in areas with local languages.
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>In</b> <b>Catalonia</b>: an earlier experimental bilingual project under
auspices of University of Barcelona (1970) which had positive results
(introduction of Catalan improved children's competence in Catalan
considerably, did not adversely affect their competence in Spanish nor their
academic achievement). <b>In Basque provinces:</b> Ikastolas first established
in 1967 (still during Franco government) as one expression of Basque people's
struggle against Franco and for Basque political and cultural autonomy.<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals:</b> In <b>Catalonia</b>: Avoid separation of the two
communities along linguistic lines. Maintenance of Catalan in a region
increasingly populated by Castilian L1 speakers. <b>In Basque provinces:</b>
Strengthen language as symbol of national identity. Revitalize language which
until recently had been in total regression and used only in rural and family
settings.<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Teaching Objectives:</b> In <b>Catalonia</b>: Enable students to
use both languages freely (inclusive academic settings) after finishing basic
education. <b>In Basque provinces:</b> increase number of fully bilingual
students.<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> In <b>Catalonia</b>: with rapidly
increasing number of Spanish L1 speaking students from less advantaged South
requires new approaches within Catalan education that can be beneficial to all
groups. <b>In Basque provinces:</b> large dialectal variety of language; lack
of written materials, particularly textbooks (partly because language was not
standardized); few trained teachers (lack of teacher training in Basque); great
differences between two languages; earlier low status of language. <p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> (Not limited to preschool).<b> In Catalonia</b>: Catalan-L1
children can be educated in their own language without suffering adverse
effects. Whether a mainly Catalan education is equally beneficial for group of
Spanish-L1 children (particularly with increasing proportion of children from
socio-economically disadvantaged migrant families from the South) remains to be
studied. <b>In Basque provinces:</b> "Thanks to a great educational push, the
Basque language has passed from a state of regression to one of expansion"
(Siguan, 1988, p.469). Not only has number of Basque speakers increased
dramatically, but also its official and urban use. <p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b><p>
<p>
 Reform proposals to be implemented over the period 1991-1996 include:
"Pre-school education (0-6 years) will become a formal part of the educational
system, although not compulsory. For the age group 0-3 years capacity will be
developed in cooperation with the local authorities and other interested<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
institutions." However, the Preschool Education Federation (Federaci&oacute;n
Espa&ntilde;ola de Escuelas Infantiles, FEDEI) is doubtful about this division
into two separate stages and furthermore concerned about the proposals'lack of
clarity concerning the financing of preschool education and the qualifications
of those who would be working with preschool children. (Source: Council of
Europe, <i>Newsletter 2/89</i>, pp. 32 - 33). In March 1988, the Spanish
Federation of Parent Associations had recommended that pre-school education
should be divided into three stages (0-2; 2-4; and 5-6 years) and be compulsory
from the age of 4 years; whereas the Catholic Parent's Federation recommended
that institutionalized preschool education should not start before age 3.
(Source: Council of Europe, <i>Newsletter 1/88</i>, pp. 27/28). <p>
<p>
 The cases of Catalan and Basque in Spain (i.e. two different minority
groups/languages within the same political and educational system) highlight a
number of factors which should be taken into consideration when developing
educational language policies whether for preschool or other levels of
education: <p>
<p>
1) The status of the people who speak the minority language as their mother
tongue: although Catalan and Basque are both minority languages in Spain, and
at the same time official languages in their respective areas, Catalan
speakers' socioeconomic status is in general higher than that of Castilian
speakers in the region, whereas with Basque this is not the case. <p>
<p>
2) Oral "vs" written languages: Whereas Catalan is "supported by an old and
significant literary and academic tradition, ...completely standardized [and]
lexical, grammatical, and orthographic norms accepted without question"
(Siguan, 1988, p. 453), this is not the case with Basque which is fragmented by
many dialects, hence was not standardized until recently and has little
literary and academic tradition. <p>
<p>
3) The degree of un/relatedness of the (two) languages involved is important,
particularly when it comes to learning reading. In the case of
Catalan/Castilian, for example, the "arbitrary rules that link letters and
sounds are relatively similar in the two languages" (Siguan, 1989, p.85). On
the other hand, Basque is totally different from Castilian so that learning it
requires a conscientious sustained effort over a long period of time. <p>
<p>
4) Continuation of language policy is important. These are two outstanding
cases in as much as education in the minority language starts in preschool and
carries on through university (albeit to different extents). <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
5) The same educational language policy can have divergent results: If
'education in Catalan' is not adapted to the growing number of migrant Spanish
L1 children from the South, Catalonia might become a case for the claim "that
identical systems of bilingual education may have quite different effects
according to the social and cultural level of pupils for whom it is provided"
(Siguan, 1988, p. 460). <p>

<p>
<p>
BOELENS, KR. (1976). <i>Frisian-Dutch Bilingual Primary Schools.</i> The Hague:
Netherlands Ministry of Education and Science. (86 pages).<p>
<p>
<b>Community:</b> Dutch Frisians in province of (West) Friesland (about 560.000
inhabitants, ca. 4% of total population in the Netherlands). No monolingual
Frisian speakers. 97% understand, 83% speak, 69% can read, 31% can (but rarely
need to) write Frisian. Frisian spoken by 71% at home. Use of Frisian as home
language diminishes with higher level of education and further distance from
home. Dutch used by majority when speaking to strangers or authority figures.<p>
<p>
<b>Educational System Specifics:</b> "Nursery" education attended by almost all
four to six year olds, though not compulsory. Almost all nursery schools have
own school board, are self-sufficient, can decide individually on language/s of
instruction.<p>
<p>
<b>Program</b><p>
<p>
a) <b>Characteristics/Components:</b> about 2/3 of nursery schools use Frisian,
mostly for storytelling and conversations. Of 559 primary schools half teach
Frisian as subject, 73 are bilingual with Frisian as language medium in years 1
and 2; increasingly former monolingual Dutch schools use Frisian in oral
communication for initial few weeks or months; flexible education plan offering
Frisian-speaking and Dutch-speaking grammar and reading groups side by side in
one first form in several villages; cooperation between nursery and primary
school teachers in curriculum development; 7 Colleges of Education and the 3
Training Colleges for nursery school teachers working towards common goal;
student training in and by means of Frisian promoted in 8 of these teacher
training institutions; interaction between schools and advisory service of
"Fryske Academy" and parents; school visits by advisory centre a crucial
program feature. <p>
<p>
b) <b>Origin:</b> a mix of educational experimentation (9 experimental schools
started using Frisian as language of instruction in 1950) and political
pressure (proceedings started by a Frisian poet and editor to accept Frisian in
the law courts that led to political violence). A 1955 amendment to the 1920
Primary Education Act officially sanctioned use of Frisian as language medium
in primary school (up to year 3). In 1974 Frisian was made compulsory subject
in primary schools and its use as language medium in all classes authorized.
Since 1959: educational advisory board established by the Fryske Academy, fully
state subsidized serves bilingual schools, promotes Frisian in nursery and
primary schools. Teachers <p>
<p>
<p>
involved in materials design and testing. Individual school boards decide
(after hearings with parents) which language policy to opt for. Decision for
bilingual education means acceptance of advisory board's services .<p>
<p>
c) <b>Program Goals: For Nursery School</b>: although nursery school should not
deny opportunities for intellectual performances it should in no sense be
preparatory primary education, therefore it should stick to the child's native
tongue. <b>For Primary School:</b> for non-Frisian speaking pupils: being able
to appreciate Friesland's bilingual culture; for Frisian-speaking pupils:
willingness and ability to contribute to this culture at one's own level.
<b>For Both:</b> make equal allowance for Frisian-speaking and Dutch-speaking
children; foster sound incorporation of Frisian in nursery and primary schools.
<p>
<p>
d) <b>Specific Teaching Objectives:</b> language should "come to life" at
school; ensure smooth transition between nursery and primary school.<p>
<p>
e) <b>Difficulties in Implementation:</b> lack of materials; inadequately
trained nursery school teachers; different language policies in nursery and
primary school, sometimes in the same village (e.g. Dutch medium nursery and
bilingual primary school); little or no attention has been paid to written use
of Frisian; predominance of Dutch mass media.<p>
<p>
f) <b>Outcomes:</b> About half of the primary schools feature Frisian in
curriculum; Frisian used freely among children and between them and teachers
Frisian gaining status; opinion moving in favor of bilingual education after
experience showed that Dutch does not suffer.<p>
<p>
<b>Comments</b> <p>
<p>
 Only third of book deals with present day Frisian situation. Other chapters
are about bilingualism in general; summarize well-known case studies from other
countries; describe situations in other parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands
(including overseas).<p>
<p>
 A 1975 evaluation of preschool education ("child centres", "kindergartens" and
"playgroups and day nurseries") in The Netherlands done under the auspices of
the Council of Europe (Kohnstamm &amp; Wagenaar-Hardon, 1975) does not even
mention non-Dutch or bilingual preschool.<p>

Education in the USSR." In LALL, G.R. and LALL, B.M. (Eds). <i>Comparative
Early Childhood Education.</i> Springfield, IL: Charles C. Thomas Publisher.<p>
<p>
This chapter describes preschools in the USSR as an integral part of Soviet
society with nurseries/creches for ages 2 months to three years and
kindergarten for three to seven year olds. The program is divided into six
groups, corresponding to the first six years of life. The role of language
education and languages is not systematically dealt with, but some information
is given: The goals for language education for each of the six programs are
briefly outlined (e.g. "know the names of a few objects" (program 1); "express
his needs in words" (program 3); etc. <p>
<p>
<b>Mention to other languages</b> is only made three times:<p>
<p>
 By the end of the fifth year, the child should be able to pronounce all the
Russian sounds correctly and "they are also able to tell stories in their
mother tongue (which might not be Russian)" (p. 13).<p>
<p>
 In the sixth year, "[o]ther important objectives include training in their
natural language" (p. 15); (supposedly, mother tongue is meant).<p>
<p>
 In the six year, too, "they memorize and recite or write out poems in their
native tongue" (p.16).<p>
<p>
There is no mention of how these skills are achieved, and what the specific
language policies are. For example, in which language/s are children in the
fifth year taught to "learn to read and recite with expression and feeling (p.
14); and in the sixth year "to count from one to ten" (p. 17)? But if the
children are supposed to be able to tell stories in their mother tongue in the
fifth year, then, clearly, we must assume that this or similar activities have
been practiced in the mother tongue before.<p>

<b>General Language Policy:</b> A 1958 document states the official view that
instruction in the Soviet schools is<b> conducted in the native language
</b>(our emphasis). However, (and this since 1938), Russian is compulsory in
all schools of the non-Russian people. Teaching <p>
<p>
<p>
Russian as a second language has, according to the author, not met with the
expected success, particularly in Central Asia and here specifically among
rural children "who are unable to speak and write a simple Russian sentence
after ten years of in-class instruction" (p. 436). <p>
<p>
<b>Kindergarten</b>: Referring to a 1972 (!) document, the author refers to the
teaching of Russian in some of the kindergartens as "another innovation" which
is not uniformly administered in the USSR. The amount of Russian-only hours
varies greatly from republic to republic, but an overall increase of Russian in
kindergarten is envisioned in the 1985 Education Reform. Unfortunately, there
are no details about this. <p>

<i>Those of us who are advocates of Early Childhood Development spend much of our energy promoting the concept of the </i>whole<i> child. We point out that children need more integrated attention than just nutritional help or cognitive stimulation. We ask decisionmakers, programme
providers, and parents to consider ways to support all dimensions of the
child's growth, and to pay attention to enriching the environment in which that child grows.  Applying that same kind of thinking to the field of ECCD the
Consultative Group promotes ways to link research, policy and programming, so
they can have beneficial synergistic impacts on each other.  Research is not
just an intellectual exercise; it is a process of refining our understanding of
young children and their needs so that we can be more responsive to them.
Quality programming is not just a curriculum exercise designed at a desk; it
arises from experiences, knowledge about the particular children being served,
and awareness of the specific social conditions for which it is being designed.
Similarly, as Judith Evans mentioned in </i><u>Creating a Shared Vision</u><i>, policy
does not exist in a vacuum.  It should be formulated with awareness of the
people it will affect, and should be based on experience, research and
programming.  As proponents of ECCD we are searching for ways to integrate
research, policy, and programming so that they can truly benefit each other.
In the following short excerpt adapted from his preface to the book, <b>Human
Development and Family Studies in India.  An Agenda for Research and Policy
</b>(Saraswathi and Kaur), Robert G. Myers suggests some possible ways of
viewing research, to take into account its interrelationships with programming
and policy.</i><p>

<b>The Interconnections Between Child Development Research, Policy and
Programming</b><p>
<p>
Robert G. Myers<p>
	<p>
	The most frequent model used to connect research with policy and programming
is one in which research results are first created, then communicated from the
researcher to the potential user.  The communication may be face-to-face or may
occur in written or visual form.  Or, the research results may be<i>
brokered</i> by an intermediary acting on behalf of the researcher, such as a
policy institute or a professional association engaged in lobbying.  It may be,
also, that <i>basic</i> research findings are first transformed into an
application or technology and that application is then passed on to
practitioners.<p>
<p>
	This traditional way of thinking about research and its practical consequences
has several characteristics.  First, in this conception, the researcher and the
user are always separate.  Second, and following from the first, knowledge is
always transferred from one person to another.  Third, research results are
first produced, then disseminated (perhaps after being repackaged or turned
into a curriculum, technology or application).<p>
<p>
	When judging the success of the transfer of knowledge to action, there is also
a tendency to associate specific pieces of research or specific outcomes of
research with specific policies or actions in the world of policy and
practice.<p>
<p>
	This way of approaching the relationship between research and its use in
practice is not wrong.  Such interfaces occur and they can and should be
fostered.  However, this view of how to use research is limiting and, in my
opinion, probably does not represent the principal way in which research gets
converted to action.  What are alternative conceptions and what do they
imply?<p>
<p>
	One alternative model is that researchers might seek ways of informing a broad
public.  This is important for two reasons.  First, it gets away from the
assumption that all actions occur through governments.  Research can be used
directly by the public and can be <i>empowering</i>.  For example, the
successes of the Dr. Spock baby book in the United States, the best selling
book on early stimulation in Chile, and similar popular publications in other
countries testify to the potential efficacy of repackaging research results for
use directly by the public.  A second, less often recognized reason for using
the public as an audience is that, in democracies, citizens put pressure on
governments to change their policies.  While this change may occur over long
periods of time, such a use of research results can have an important impact on
policies.  In this case, the journalist, popular writer or even the television
actor may become important allies of the researcher who wants to contribute to
better practice.<p>
<p>
	Directing research results to the public barely breaks with the traditional
way of thinking about the research/practice nexus described above.  It goes
beyond the traditional tendency to associate specific research findings with
specific changes in policy.  It also opens up the timeframe, offering a
different way to influence policy, practice and those who set policy and plan
programmes.  However, the approach continues to separate researcher from user
and is linear in conception.<p>
<p>
	There is another, more radical way of thinking about the production and use of
knowledge.  In this view, the researcher and the practitioner come back
together; they are one and the same.  In this non-linear view, the
dissemination and use of knowledge begins to occur with the conceptualization
of a research project.  Knowledge is used and disseminated over the course of
the research process.  It is also embodied in the people who carry out the
research and who then use the knowledge, without having to transfer what was
learned to others.<p>
<p>
	We have a basis for this view in the literature on research utilization
showing that, "...for a study to exert a strong conceptual influence on
practitioners, interactions between researchers and practitioners must occur
not only on completion of the study, but also during and, ideally, before the
conduct of the study.  Also, many of these contacts must be face-to-face."
(Huberman, 1990, pg. 365)  What is still missing from this formulation is the
explicit notion of practitioner as researcher, and vice versa.  It is only then
that the possibility of a tie between research and use is maximized.<p>
<p>
	In this more radical view, we are led to think as much about <b>who</b>
carries out the research and about what they will do with the experience as
about the specific content of it.  We are led to the idea of participation in
research as a form of education. One common example is when graduate students
are involved in research (policy-oriented or not) with the idea that they will
embody the resulting awareness and move into positions as practitioners, using
what they have learned in the course of the research.  But it is far from being
the only case.  For instance, there are situations in which knowledge acquired
in research is put to policy and programme use because researchers themselves
move into policy or programme positions.  There are also instances when
practitioners are incorporated into research with the idea that the experience
will inform their own work.<p>
<p>
	In this view, attempts to incorporate practitioners directly into research
become as important as incorporating researchers into practice.	 One can
imagine, for instance, cases of classroom teachers who are involved in
continuing education or training that uses their own classroom as the
laboratory for research.  This is seldom done.  Given the proper atmosphere and
using methodologies that link action to reflection, such participatory research
can overcome the possible problems of bias in observation, can be done without
sacrificing rigor, and can lead to the immediate use of research results.<p>
<p>
	Incorporating policymakers into research is less common and more challenging,
but it may be possible to find ways to achieve it.  For example, exchanges can
be set up where not only do ECCD students carry out internships in government
offices where policies are made and programmes are directed, but also where
responsible individuals in government offices (or non governmental
organizations) can be provided with similar study opportunities.  These study
opportunities could revolve around projects directly related to their work and
around research that would inform their work.  <p>
<p>
	Participatory research can be designed to include parents, teachers,
supervisors, programme planners and policymakers.  Since each of these groups
has much to contribute to our understanding of young children and the
experiences which support their growth, it makes sense for ECCD researchers to
draw on them in their research projects.  Similarly, it makes sense for
researchers to reach out in a myriad of ways to (and to be sought out by) these
influential people, to make sure that the interconnections between research,
policy and programming are strong and vital.  <p>
<p>
	In the book for which this Preface was written, reporting on the results of a
Symposium<a href="bobpolic"fn.html#fn)">[1]</a> that explored the interface
between research and policy, several suggestions were made to facilitate that
interface.  The suggestions were based on the central notion that "the key to
effective linkages ... lies in better communication between researchers,
policymakers, programme planners and the public".  To communicate better it is
suggested that:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	there is a need to communicate research results without using technical
jargon;<p>
<li>	research brokers be identified and a process of <i>lobbying</i> be
strengthened in which professional organizations and national research
institutes take on a more active advocacy role;<p>
<li>	use of the media should be increased, particularly in reaching the public;<p>
<li>	two-way channels be provided that include mechanisms for identifying gaps
and the kinds of questions that need to be addressed from time to time;<p>
<li>	an interdisciplinary task force be established by the government to evolve a
comprehensive framework for guiding research efforts, monitoring the
translation of research findings into implications for policy and programming,
and coordinating dissemination.<p></ul>
<p>
	Other specific suggestions for improving the linkages included:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	encouraging policy-oriented research;<p>
<li>	building evaluation into programmes from the start and on a continuous
basis;<p>
<li>	sensitizing graduate students to the importance of policy-oriented research
and to the importance of making the linkages, by introducing appropriate
concepts in methods courses, by offering seminars for drawing policy relevance
from existing research, by encouraging research, and by establishing
internships in government bodies or advocacy groups;<p>
<li>	seeking a greater understanding of the policy and programme processes and
then selecting research topics with a <i>high impact potential</i>.  In general
these will be topics that are not only of current interest, but also ones that
must be treated in a culturally relevant way, in context;<p>
<li>	paying greater attention to research that delves into why some programmes
succeed and others fail.</ul><p>
<p>
	  For the most part, the above suggestions depend on some sort of interface by
researchers directly with policymakers and planners.  Major exceptions to this
are the suggestions concerning the use of the media to reach the public, the
incorporation of researchers into the evaluation of on-going programmes, and
the encouragement of students to become involved in research with a policy
orientation.  I would like to stress these exceptions precisely because they do
not depend on communicating research results directly or through brokers. <p>
<p>
	While it is often difficult to make these more direct connections and build
the desired partnerships  (It may require repeated invitations and personal
lobbying to get individuals from the policy or programming realm to participate
in research meetings, people from research and policy to participate in
programming meetings, etc.) it is well worth the effort.  <p>

<b>How Policy Affects Early Childhood Care and Development</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Judith L. Evans<p>
<p>
	A recent policy initiative in Ghana, <i>The Accra Declaration, </i>has
established a radically new perspective and approach to the country's attention
to young children.  It puts highest priority on children who are at greatest
risk.  It calls upon all relevant government departments, agencies,
non-governmental organizations, individuals, and other partners in early
childhood development to collectively broaden Ghana's scope and vision for
young children. The Accra Declaration has provided the impetus for greater
cooperation between government, donors, and non-governmental organizations.  It
also sets the stage for a very different kind of programming for young
children, and offers official sanction for a greater variety of activities to
receive attention and funding.   Moving away from the more traditional emphasis
on preschools as preparation for formal schooling, it calls for early childhood
care and development programmes to make a range of community-based services
available to the children who are most in need.<p>
   <p>
	Because the policy arose from a National Seminar on Early Childhood
Development (1993), it represents a process of thinking about young children
and their needs, carried out collectively by diverse stakeholders in ECCD.  As
the Ghana government works to adapt its education and social strategies to this
new perspective, it will be supported by the stakeholders who helped bring this
focus on children forward.  <p>
<p>
	What does the Ghanaian experience have to do with you?  It is an example of
the way in which non-governmental organizations, government and donors can come
together to create policies and programmes to support young children and their
families.  In this edition of the<b> Coordinators' Notebook</b> we will explore
what policy is and how we, the early childhood community, can influence the
development of policy that supports young children and their families.
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>	Many of us engaged in planning and creating programmes for young
children see policy as a distant, abstract process, carried out by suited
politicians sitting behind paper-laden desks. We view policymakers as
inaccessible as they make decisions about our fate, dictating national
priorities and how the national budget is to be allocated.  We are aware of
policy only when we find ourselves supported or limited by it, but most of us
do not see ourselves as active participants in the creation of policy.  In
reality, however, we are all affected by policy, or its lack, on a regular
basis.   If we are going to make a real difference in the lives of young
children and their families then we must focus our efforts on creating policies
that will allow needed resources to be shifted to structures and programmes
which can provide that support.<p>
<p>
	It is perhaps useful to step back and consider all the levels on which we deal
with policy. We begin by defining it more clearly.  According to the American
Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, (1969), policy is "any plan or
course of action adopted by a government, political party, business
organization or the like, designed to influence and determine decisions,
actions and other matters".  The definition also describes policy as "a course
of action, guiding principle or procedure considered to be expedient, prudent
or advantageous".   <p>
<p>
	When we see policy as a course of action designed to influence decisions and
actions, it becomes a less abstract proposition.  At a national level policy
represents a distillation of a philosophy about the role of government in the
lives of those being governed.  It positions the government in terms of what it
will and will not support.  Policy guides how monies are allocated and the
processes that will be put into place to disburse the monies.   <p>
<p>
	 There is increasing interest within governments in creating national policies
that guide and validate the provision of a broad range of early childhood care
and development and family support activities. To do that effectively,
governments need information from the field of early childhood development on
what kinds of policies can be developed to most effectively support young
children and families.  <p>
<p>
	Many within the early childhood community fear that the energy it would take
to get involved in the political process of creating policy would be a drain on
already limited resources.  Yet, for the long-term it is important to focus our
attention on policy.  If we are not involved in the policy process, others will
be.  We have a responsibility to bring our knowledge, skills, and experience to
the creation and implementation of policies that support young children and
their families. The early childhood community needs a better understanding of
the relationship of policies to planning and programmes, the types of
mechanisms that can be put into place to effectively serve as policy, and how
to go about creating an effective policy if that is deemed desirable. <p>
<p>
<p>
	Within this issue of the CN the question being explored is, How can we
influence the development of policy that supports young children and their
families?  To try to answer that question we will present a series of three
articles.  The first offers a brief discussion of what policy is and is not.
It outlines the kinds of information that policymakers need in order to make
informed policies regarding young children and  describes a process that can be
undertaken to generate that information and get it into the hands of
policymakers. This is illustrated by case studies from Malaysia and South
Africa.  The second article is a brief discussion of the relationship between
research and policy, and the third article looks at a specific instance in
which the combination of a strong programme and longitudinal research have led
to the creation of a national policy.<p>
<p>
	<p>
<b><i>Policy--what it is and is not.</i></b><i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
	 Policy frames the course of action taken by governments in relation to the
people. This happens at several levels.  At the most general level is the style
of government in place--democratic, capitalist, socialist, etc.  At this level
there are <u>broad policies </u> that frame how the government operates, the
judicial and legal systems and the type of economy that is in place.  Within
that broad framework is <u>social policy </u>which addresses the role of the
government vis-a-vis families and society as a whole.  What does the government
see as its responsibility in relation to families and the care and development
of children?  Within the general social policies are <u>sectoral policies</u>
that determine the services to be provided by the sector.  For example, there
are education policies that specify when the government becomes responsible for
the education of children, whether or not attendance at schools is mandatory,
and if so, for how long.  Within the sectoral policies are policies that
address <u>implementation</u>.  These policies are much more specific and
define who has responsibility for what.  If there is to be intersectoral
collaboration it specifies how that should happen.  Implementation policies
clarify the role of central government in relation to local units, and they
define standards and procedures.  The levels are interlinked.  In order to have
a comprehensive understanding of policies within a given country it is
important to assess the policies at all levels. <p>
<p>
	As part of an article on the relationship between policies and programmes in
India, Mina Swaminathan (1993) presented an analysis of 135 countries.  She
ranked them on the continuum from developing to developed countries, and also
ranked them according to where they fit along a continuum ranging from market
economy to socialism.  Third, she rated them from best to worst in terms of
their maternity support laws and policies.  Not surprisingly the Scandinavian
countries (developed countries with a socialist philosophy) had the most
comprehensive set of laws and policies in support of women and families, and
the most generous provision by the government. Also, not surprisingly, the
United States (developed country with a strong market economy philosophy) was
ranked the worst in terms of its policies and laws in support of women and
families, and had the least government provision.  In general, whether they
were developing or developed countries, those with a socialist philosophy had
more comprehensive policies and laws in place than countries based on a
market-oriented economy. (pg. 8)    <p>
<p>
	It is important to note that simply having a policy in place is not
necessarily a good thing, for some of the following reasons.<p>
<p>
	<i>Policies can be inappropriate. </i> Swaminathan noted that many of the
developing countries "have borrowed their legislation directly from the
industrialized countries with very different conditions, and it is hence often
inappropriate to their situation". (pg. 9)  She provides the example of the
Maternity Benefits Act (1961) in India.  Within the act there are provisions
that protect pregnant women from being fired because they are pregnant.  Women
are also to be freed from doing arduous work during the last 10 weeks of their
pregnancy.  This Act addresses the needs of women working in the formal sector.
In India this is only 11% of all working women; 89% are in the informal sector,
so this Act has little meaning for them.  Not only does the Act apply to only a
very limited work force, but even within the 11%, only 2.28% of those women
have benefitted from the Act. (pg. 3)  In essence the Act has little meaning
for the great majority of working women in India.<p>
<p>
	<i>Policies can be restrictive rather than facilitative.</i> In an attempt to
address an issue, policies may be created which inhibit rather than promote
what was originally desired.   There are many examples of this within the early
childhood field.  As early childhood programmes begin to proliferate, many
governments decide they cannot afford to operate ECCD programmes themselves.
However, they want to be supportive of the programmes being developed as the
result of NGO and community initiative.  They then decide that an appropriate
role for government is to provide guidelines for the programmes and to register
them so that they know what programmes are being offered, and where.  The
government develops regulations for the establishment of centres.  What tends
to happen is that these regulations (generally based on standards from
developed countries) are so restrictive that the majority of current ECCD
programmes cannot comply, and operate illegally.  In effect the government
limits the availability of quality ECCD programmes rather than supporting a
diversity of approaches appropriate to the setting.  A Nigerian example
illustrates the issue.<p>
<p>
	In 1987 the Nigerian government issued Guidelines on Pre-Primary Education.
(Federal Ministry of Education, 1987)  Within the section on Requirements for
Pre-Primary Institutions the following areas were addressed: physical
facilities, playground, furniture, fees, teacher qualifications, and other
miscellaneous items.  Within the physical facilities section (pg. 4) it
states:<p>
<p>
Building must conform to the following standards:<p>
(i) The classroom size should be 12 m by 6.5 m to accommodate about 25
children;<p>
(ii) Each classroom should be cross-ventilated and well lighted;<p>
(iii)  Each classroom must have storage facilities and built-in cupboards for
items of equipment;<p>
(iv)  The classroom should have two access doorways to serve as alternative
exits, and a veranda on either side of the classroom;<p>
(v)  There must be a cloakroom, toilets and wash hand basins of appropriate
height....<p>
<p>
In terms of furniture the guidelines state:<p>
"Provision of chairs and tables suitable for different ages and sizes should be
made.  Tables should be made of polished wood or formica surfaces.  Chairs and
tables should be of light materials and carry no sharp edges.  There should be
a large table with drawers for teachers' use.  Provision should be made for
book racks and toy storage in every classroom."  (pg. 5)<p>
In terms of the playground it requires:<p>
"(i)  A well-fenced playground of varying size according to the enrolment of
the school....<p>
(ii)  The playground should be grassed and installed with facilities for
climbing, jumping, pulling...<p>
(iii)  A track or hard surface for pushing along wheeled toys should be
provided..."  (pg. 4)<p>
<p>
Few early childhood programmes could meet these criteria.  For example, it is
hard to imagine that people are able to create grassed playgrounds in the
majority of settings in Nigeria.  These regulations necessarily restricted the
growth of registered preprimary programmes, and incidentally led to an increase
in the number of unregistered clandestine programmes.<p>
<p>
	During recent years UNICEF has been working with the Nigerian government to
create a more realistic set of guidelines for the establishment of early child
care, development and education (ECCDE) centres.(UNICEF, 1994)  Some of the
differences are illustrative of a shift from referencing the experience of
developed countries to a focus on creating context-appropriate programmes for
children.  They begin by stating that there are different types of centres
(models) that can be developed (pg. 2).  These include:<p>
<p>
(a) Rural community-based centres ( in community buildings or multipurpose
halls;<p>
(b) Periodic, rural market-based centres;<p>
(c) Urban, market-based centres in low cost shades (sic) or market stalls;<p>
(d) Work environment-based centres;<p>
(e) Pre-school annex (in primary school premises during school hours);<p>
	(f) Church/ Mosque annex (in or near the Church or Mosque);<p>
(g) Home-based centres;<p>
(h) Factory/office-based creches.<p>
<p>
The requirements in terms of physical facilities have become:<p>
<p>
(a)  Building must be safe, strong and in good condition;<p>
	(b) Classroom must:<p>
		be spacious<p>
		be located on the ground floor if a storied building...<p>
	be equipped with age appropriate seats and mats....<p>
<p>
In terms of the playground, it now calls for a "playground, grassed or filled
with sand and with equipment safe for children's climbing, jumping, swinging,
balancing".  (pg. 4)  <p>
	<p>
	Thus there has been a shift from the regulations and standards based on
Western, developed country norms to regulations that are more responsive to
local needs and resources.  Today the policies and the derivative laws and
regulations are more supportive of the development of a range of ECCD
alternatives within Nigeria, all of which could be registered.<p>
		<p>
	<i>Policies can be contradictory.</i> An example comes from India.
(Swaminathan, 1993) In 1990, India adopted the National Code for Protection and
Promotion of Breast-feeding.  In 1992 the Regulation of Infant Foods, Breast
Milk Substitutes and Feeding Bottles Act was passed.  In essence these support
breastfeeding for the first 4-6 months of life.   Meanwhile the Maternity
Benefits Act cited above provides a woman with only three months of maternity
leave. Since some time is generally taken prior to the birth, maternity leave
does not take the infant into even the fourth month of life.  Within the
Maternity Benefits Act, once women return to work they are entitled to two
15-minute nursing breaks, with a small amount of time allowed for travel if the
infant is in an off-site creche.  The number of working women who could
actually continue breastfeeding within these limitations is minuscule.  Thus
while the two laws (the 1990 National Code and the 1992 Regulation of Infant
Foods) try to promote breastfeeding the Maternity Benefits Act effectively
forces women to use bottle feeding once they have returned to work.<p>
<p>
	<i>Policies can have unintended consequences.</i>  Many countries have
instituted policies that state that establishments employing more than a given
number of women have to provide creches at the workplace for their workers'
children. This law was enacted to protect women's jobs.  It also facilitates
breastfeeding and the caretaking of the infant by the mother.  It allows women
to return to work soon after the birth of the child.  While this policy is
supposed to help maintain women in the workplace, in many instances it has
restricted women's participation in the formal sector.  Employers simply hire
fewer than the minimum number of women required to establish a creche.  Thus
before rushing to put a policy or law into place it is important to anticipate
the consequences.<p>
<p>
 	<i>Policies may not be implemented.</i>  To have a policy in place does not
necessarily mean that it is being implemented.  There may be good (or bad)
policies already on the books that have never been enacted.  Thus before
creating a policy it is advisable to assess what currently exists, the extent
to which it is being implemented, and to determine what has stood in the way of
its implementation.  It may be more important to focus on creating mechanisms
that allow for the implementation of current policy than it is to create new
policies.<p>
<p>
	<i>Having no policy may be better than having a bad policy.</i>  There are
times when a certain momentum has been achieved by an idea and there is
informal support for the expansion of a programme or project.  The project may
be flourishing even in the absence of a clear policy to support it.  Sometimes
turning the spotlight onto the project and attempting to formalize it by
creating a policy to assure its sustainability can backfire. Lawmakers can
actually curtail the potential and halt the momentum of a project through slow
or self-interested deliberations.  Knowing when to push for a policy requires
sensitivity to the political situation and a careful approach.<p>
<p>
	With these preliminary notes about policy, what it can and cannot do, we will
now turn to a discussion of the process for introducing new policy and or
changing current ones.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i><b>What is the motivation for changing or creating national
policy?</b></i><p>
<p>
	There are a variety of reasons for creating and/or changing current policy.
The motivation for making the change or instituting a new policy will greatly
influence the form the new policy takes.  For example, policies are often
scrutinized when there is a shift in government.  This is demonstrated most
dramatically in Eastern Europe.  With the changes to a market economy there
have been dramatic alterations in government policy.  In many of the countries
there has been a shift from a centralized government which controls all
activities to a decentralized system that requires action and decision-making
at the regional or district level.  In addition, the government is less willing
to provide the range of services that were previously accessible to families.
An example from Poland is described below by Malgorzata  Karwowska-Struczyk.
(1995)<p>
<p>
	Poland is a country which, after forty years of the totalitarian (communist)
regime, has started creating the mechanisms of democratic and lawful systems
both in the political and social spheres of life.  The Republic of Poland is a
parliamentary democracy. The structural transformations begun after 1989
resulted from the victory of social and political forces connected with
<i>Solidarity</i> and the resolutions of the so-called <i>Round Table
Meeting</i>. Only in 1992 did free, democratic general elections take place in
Poland for the first time after the second World War... (pg. 1)<p>
<p>
	In the fifties and sixties creches were founded by health departments of the
State administration--the Ministry of Health and Social Security--at the local
level. After 1970, when changes were introduced into the health services
management, creches came under Departments of Health Care, (i.e. local
representatives of the Central Administration). Up until 1992 child care
institutions for small children were financed from the state budget. At the
beginning of 1992 creche management was taken over by local governments. <p>
	The decentralization of child care and education institutions, creches
included, had both negative and positive consequences.   One negative
consequence of creches being financed by communes is that many creches have
been closed down, but not always those with too few children. Another source of
creche financing is parent fees. Previously symbolic, they are so high at
present that some parents cannot afford them and prefer noninstitutional forms
of child care. Parent fees cover the full cost of meals and extra activities.
In addition parents pay a parents committee fee. In some communes there is an
extra fee for toys, toiletries etc. The communes take upon themselves the staff
salaries, current repairs and equipment. <p>
		As for positive changes resulting from the local management, they 	consist
mainly of higher technical and sanitary standards for creche buildings, better
provision of toys and equipment, and more openness to parents. Parents can stay
in a creche together with their child, not only during the days or weeks of the
adaptive period, but also after it.   (pgs. 11-12)<p>
							<p>
Poland is an example of an instance when the change in government has brought
about considerable changes in terms of the services that the government is
willing to provide and the mechanisms used for the implementation of
services.<p>
<p>
	Policies are also changed as a result of international pressures.  There are
two common kinds of international pressures.  The first type are those brought
to bear by initiatives that arise from international fora, where countries come
together and reach joint agreement on a set of principles to be implemented.
For instance, the declaration agreed upon in Jomtien, Thailand as a result of
the Education for All (EFA) initiative, and the UN approval of the Convention
on the Rights of the Child are good examples of this phenomenon.  Countries
respond to these international initiatives by setting new goals for themselves,
establishing different priorities, amending current polices and /or creating
new policies.  For example, the Government of Botswana, in the Revised National
Policy on Education, March 1994, stated:<p>
<p>
Government recognizes the need to develop effective and comprehensive policy on
pre-primary education with a view of linking it to the formal education system
in the long run...Government will continue to provide an enabling environment
for the expansion of this level of education as well as provision of adequately
trained teachers and effective supervision. (pg. 7)<p>
<p>
As a result of international initiatives, processes are established to
determine the extent to which countries are in compliance with international
norms.  (A project to identify and develop indicators for use in the monitoring
and implementation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child is described on
page ___ of this Notebook.)<p>
<p>
	The second type of external pressure comes from donors.  Many international
donors set up conditions for the receipt of funds and/or loans.  Some of these
involve the implementation or revision of a set of policies.   For example,
some countries are required to make structural adjustments in terms of their
economic policies in order to receive funds from donors like the World Bank.
Increasingly countries are realizing the need to get their house in order
before working with donors, in order to better evaluate what the donor has to
offer.  One way to address the issue is to set policies in place so that the
countries have a clear agenda when they are approached by donors.  If the
government has relevant policies then it is possible to more clearly facilitate
donor coordination and reduce duplication of services.  In a recent regional
seminar held in Myanmar in March 1995, where this issue was addressed,
participants made the recommendation that there be "clear ministerial policies
and solid strategic plans of action to which donors are oriented, and into
which they must fit" (Shaeffer, 1995, pg. 13), rather than expecting or
requiring the country to adjust to the donor's agenda. <p>
<p>
	Policies are also changed when there is an increased awareness within the
government of the need to address a particular issue.  This awareness can come
about as the result of lobbying, campaigns designed to focus attention on
critical issues, and through the use of research (national and
international).<p>
<p>
<b><i>What is the process for changing policy?</i></b><p>
<p>
	Policy creation or change does not need to be a top-down proposition.  It does
not need to rest solely in the hands of lawmakers and ministry personnel.  Most
important, policy is not created in a vacuum.  Each local solution, each
successful research project, each advocacy effort has the potential to
influence decisionmakers' thinking about what best supports young children and
their families.  In Turkey, as reported on page __, a research project showing
the benefits of parent education has led to changes in the national government
policy, increasing government support for early childhood programmes through
the Ministry of Education. (Kagitcibasi, 1995)  In the United States the
mothers of children enrolled in Head Start, a national early childhood
programme for disadvantaged children, took to the streets in protest in the
early 1970s when the funding was about to be cut by policymakers who believed
Head Start was a waste of money.  The mothers' actions influenced policymakers
to continue support for the programme.  Later, longitudinal research results
demonstrating the social benefits of preschool education helped to cement
government commitment to Head Start, which continues today despite massive cuts
in other social programmes.<p>
<p>
	No matter what the impetus for change, policy-making is a process.   The
process should assist the government in formulating ECCD policies linked to
overall national development priorities.  The process should also lead to
arrangements for effective implementation, monitoring, management and
coordination of  ECCD programmes, and subsequent identification of policy and
strategy options for strengthening ECCD's contribution to national development.
The next section describes a process that was undertaken in recent years in
Namibia, Malaysia, and South Africa to create national early childhood
policies.<p>
<p>
1.  	Initiating the process<p>
<p>
	The impetus for examining policy can come from a variety of sources, as noted
above.  As the process gets underway it is critical to ensure adequate
participation from relevant agencies and groups, both within the government and
from outside.  Then someone within the government has to take the
responsibility for actually overseeing the process.  The extent to which the
exercise is taken seriously will depend on whether or not this individual has
power or access to power within the system. Policy reviews that are initiated
by the Planning Office, or the Prime Minister's Office, or an equivalent body,
will get the cooperation of high ranking officials within the various
ministries.  If the initiative is taken by a ministry with low status, it may
be possible to change the policy within that ministry, but it is unlikely that
the ministry will be able to impact national policy.<p>
<p>
	The Office or Ministry that begins the policy review process may receive
support from an external agency. As noted, donor agencies may provide technical
and/or financial support for such a review.  UNICEF is another organization
that has taken an active role in the policy-making process.<p>
<p>
2.	Determining who is to be involved in the process and in what capacity.<p>
<p>
	As noted, a government ministry/department generally coordinates the process
because ultimate responsibility for establishing policy lies with the
government. However, a much broader constituency may well be involved in
developing the policy.  This can include citizen groups, non-governmental
agencies, and the private sector.  When a broad-based constituency is involved
in the process of creating the policy, and includes representatives of all the
people who will ultimately be affected by the policy, it is much more likely to
be accepted, embraced and implemented.<p>
<p>
	Somebody needs to take the lead in overseeing the process.  The ministry or
office that initiated the activity may continue to coordinate it over time, or
stakeholders may decide that the policy would carry more weight if overseen by
a different ministry with more perceived power.  For example, in the Education
for All Initiative, Ministries of Education are designated as the key
implementors.  However, in many countries it has been necessary to involve
other ministries and offices in order to develop national social and economic
policies that would support the initiative and garner the necessary resources
required by the Ministry of Education to meet national educational goals.  <p>
<p>
	Because government ministries are generally interdependent, and sometimes must
compete for limited resources, it is important that the formation of national
ECCD policy not be seen as a unilateral <i>education</i> policy.  ECCD deals
with the whole child in its family and community context, and thus policymakers
need to draw on the support and engage the participation of diverse ministries
such as Health, Social Welfare, Women and Youth Development, and, as was the
case in Namibia, the Ministry of Regional and Local Governments.<p>
<p>
	Regardless of who takes the lead in the process, in order to ensure maximum
participation by key agencies and sectors and to enable adequate data to be
collected, a Task Force should be set up.  The Task Force may be composed of
only  government representatives, or it may be more broadly based, comprising
representatives from government agencies, the private sector and NGOs.  With
the assistance of a small part-time team of local consultants/resource persons
hired to undertake specific activities, the Task Force should have
responsibility for the following functions:<p>
 define more specifically the needs to be addressed through the study;  <p>
 undertake and coordinate the various substudies and activities of the
review;<p>
 facilitate the collection of data; <p>
 make arrangements for major review events, such as seminars and workshops; <p>
 ensure broad representation of relevant points of view; <p>
 supervise the preparation of the report; <p>
 review the recommendations and finalize the report. <p>
Once the policy is framed by the Task Force, it is then the responsibility of
the lead Ministry/Office to take the recommendations through the legislative
process.<p>
<p>
To help the government become aware of a broad range of possibilities, and to
make the best possible choices within their country, it is useful to provide
case studies of alternatives tried elsewhere.  Examples from within the region
may be of particular interest.  In order to provide the international
perspective and a degree of 'objectivity', it may well be useful to include a
person with regional and/or international ECCD experience who can inform the
Task Force of relevant and alternative experiences from other countries.
Sometimes, when stakeholders have competing political agendas, an external
consultant can help catalyze the participation of Task Force members who would
have trouble accepting the expertise and guidance of any one local resource
person. <p>
<p>
3.	Gathering Information.  <p>
<p>
	The Task Force needs to build a case for increased investment in ECCD.
Policymakers require information that will both convince them that policies
need to be changed and guide them in terms of what appropriate policy might be.
The data to be gathered need to answer the following questions that policy
makers are likely to ask:<p>
	a. Why should we invest in ECCD programmes?<p>
	b. What is the need (under what conditions do children live; what is their
physical, emotional and mental status) and what is the demand for ECCD
programming?<p>
	c. What coverage is provided by current ECCD programmes, and in what ways does
this respond to need and demand?<p>
	d. In the best of all possible worlds, what would we like to see in terms of
ECCD provision?  What are some short-term and long-term goals we can set in
order to move toward the kind of coverage and provision we envision?<p>
	e.  Where are there gaps in service and why do these gaps exist?<p>
	f.  What would be the most productive role for this government to take in
addressing the gaps and supporting provision of quality services?<p>
	g.  What supports and resources--legislative, financial, human,
organizational, and technical--are available for the creation and maintenance
of ECCD programmes (including governmental, non-governmental, and international
resources)?<p>
	h. What are the costs associated with different models of ECCD provision?  Who
is currently paying those costs, and who will pay them in the future?<p>
<p>
4.	Moving  From Recommendations to Policy and Action<p>
<p>
	The data-gathering process provides an important foundation for the
development of  policy.  But gathering data and making a set of recommendations
are only the preliminary steps in the process.  There is then the task of
taking the recommendations through the legislative process within the country.
The lead government agency will have responsibility for this, and the
procedures will vary from one country to another.  Even as the process begins
it is wise to anticipate what some of the roadblocks might be.  For example, is
there a significant group or organization that has not been included in the
policy-formulation process who may raise opposition as recommendations are put
forward?  In one instance the government developed its ECCD policy without the
inclusion of NGOs who have been involved in ECCD programming in the country
over the past 30 years.  When the new policy was put forward the NGOs
effectively blocked adoption of the policy because they had not been involved
in framing it, even though, had they been involved, a similar policy might well
have been drafted.<p>
<p>
	Opposition might also come from a political party that is not currently in
power.  Their reaction should be anticipated and addressed if possible.<p>
<p>
	The greatest constraint is likely to be time.  Unless there is considerable
pressure to act quickly, it can take several years from the time the policy
formulation process begins until a policy is actually in place.  Then there is
likely to be a gap in time between the policy's adoption and putting the
mechanisms into place to allow for its implementation.  Thus it is important
for those involved to realize that they are making a long-term commitment to
the process.  It also suggests that policy should not be thought of as a way to
respond quickly to current needs.  Policy should be designed to foster
long-term, national development goals and not be viewed as a stopgap measure to
respond to pressures of the day.<p>
<p>
	In sum, those involved in ECCD activities in the country need to determine
what they would like to see as appropriate policies within their country.
Guidance on what those policies might be can come from outside the country, in
line with international initiatives, but ultimately national policies have to
be developed within the ethos of a given nation.  The questions that need to be
asked are: Does the policy strengthen ECCD's contribution to national
development?  Does the policy allow for ECCD programmes to be linked to and
reinforce high priority objectives of the current national development policy?
<p>
<p>
<b><i>A Sample Design for an ECCD Review</i></b><p>
<p>
	One possible design for a policy review is to set up six phases.  The
activities in each phase would be as follows:<p>
<p>
<b>Phase One. </b> <b>Establish the Task Force</b>.  Membership on the Task
Force should include all the important stakeholders, both those currently
providing ECCD services and those who could potentially be involved.  When
possible the Task Force should include NGOs and representatives of private
providers as well as government officers.  In instances where the government
does not want outside participants during the study, NGOs and the private
providers can be brought in when the study is reviewed, but before final
recommendations are made.<p>
<p>
<b>Phase Two.  Conduct an Initial Workshop.  </b> The purpose of the first
workshop is to analyze the issues, identify data and research requirements, and
propose methods of obtaining and analyzing data.  During the Workshop the Task
Force members and key individuals should make presentations on ECCD activities
sponsored by their agencies.  This will help establish the level of current
ECCD provision and activity among the current stakeholders.   The Workshop
should also offer an arena within which arrangements can be made for data
collection by agencies and by individuals/ groups undertaking substudies on
areas such as curriculum, children's activities and materials, training and
supervision of  teachers, parental involvement, community participation and
management arrangements, costs, etc. A possible agenda for a two-day workshop
is as follows:<p>
<p>
	<i>Initial Workshop Agenda</i><p>
<p>
 Introductions<p>
 Clarify expectations for Workshop in relation to the study <p>
 Arrive at a common definition of ECCD<p>
		Brainstorm what it means<p>
		Develop definition acceptable to group<p>
 Define why the country should invest in ECCD<p>
Presentation on reasons for investment (The Consultative Group publication,
<i>Meeting Basic learning Needs </i>is a good resource for this.)<p>
 Come to agreement on what the aims of ECCD provision should be.<p>
 Determine the status of ECCD provision in the country<p>
Reports by each of the agencies on their coverage. (Before the meeting they
should be asked to prepare relevant statistics/tables to be handed out at the
meeting.)<p>
 Identify the gaps in provision<p>
 Outline the information required in order to determine if additional provision
is required, and by whom? <p>
 Develop a framework and timeline for gathering the information<p>
 Determine next steps<p>
<p>
By the end of the workshop the Task Force members should have a clear
understanding of the aims and objectives of the study and their role in it.<p>
<p>
<b>Phase Three.</b> <b> Data collection and analysis (6-8 months)</b>:  During
this phase, the individuals/ institutions contracted collect data and carry out
research according to the requirements and methodologies identified at the
workshop in Phase Two. Information collected during this phase will help
establish a foundation for the development of policy options to be examined in
the next phase. <p>
<p>
<b>Phase Four.  Analysis of data and a formulation of policy options (1-2
months)</b>:  Once the substudies are completed, the researchers should compile
the report to be submitted to the Task Force.  The report should include a set
of recommendations in relation to policy.<p>
<p>
<b>Phase Five.  Review and finalization of Recommendations</b>:  During this
phase a second workshop would be held.  Prior to the Workshop, all those who
will be attending should receive a full copy of the draft report and
recommendations. Participants at the second Workshop would include Task Force
members, those involved in the studies, and invited outsiders (NGOs, private
providers, and possibly donor agencies).  At this second workshop the findings
of the study would be presented, major issues would be discussed and analyzed,
and ECCD programme experiences and funding options would be shared for
discussion and analysis.   Through small group work, participants would then
formulate recommendations.  These could be shared with the large group and
consolidated into a single set of recommendations.<p>
<p>
After completion of the Workshop, a subcommittee of the Task Force would
prepare a comprehensive report setting out the data base, the issues, the
options and the consensus of the workshop.  The final report would then be
submitted to the Ministry/Office taking primary responsibility for the
process.<p>
<p>
<b>Phase Six. Moving From Recommendations to Policy and Action</b>: The Task
Force should develop a strategy for disseminating the recommendations and for
moving them through the political process.  In addition, steps should be taken
to inform the broader public about the recommendations so that they can
undertake lobbying and advocacy efforts to help assure adoption of the policy.
If there is broad representation within the Task Force,  it will simplify this
task and assure ownership of the policy by constituents.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><i>Case Studies:  Where this process has worked</i></b><p>
<p>
<b>Malaysia</b><b>[1]</b><p>
<b><u></u></b><p>
<b><u></u></b>	Malaysia, a country rich in culture and resources, is projected
to have a population of nearly 20 million people by 1995.  It consists of two
land masses separated by the South China Sea.  Peninsular (or Western)
Malaysia, which holds 82.3% of the population has 40% of the land.  Sabah and
Sarawak, on the other hand, with 60% of the land, are the home to 17.7% of the
population.<p>
<p>
	The population of Malaysia is relatively young.  According to population
projections, at the present time the 0-15 age group constitutes approximately
39% of the population (18% are in the birth through 6 age group), and 57% of
the population is in the 16-64 working-age group. Nearly 4% of the population
is 65 or older (EPU, 1991). The population growth rate was 2.3% in 1990. (Yusof
&amp; Zulkifil, 1992)<p>
<p>
	In terms of health indicators, Malaysia has an infant mortality rate of
11/1000 live births, with a maternal mortality rate of 2/1000 live births.  The
child immunization rates are high: more than 90% of all children have been
immunized against BCG, DPT and Polio, with nearly 80% of all children immunized
against measles.  In terms of nutritional status, 75.5% of all children are in
the normal range; only .5% are severely malnourished.<p>
<p>
	In the 1970s, Malaysia implemented the First Outline Perspective Plan (OPP1),
which embodied the New Economic Policy (NEP).  The NEP focused on eradicating
poverty and the restructuring of society. The Second Perspective Plan (OPP2),
covers the years 1991-2000 and embodies the National Development Policy (NDP)
It aims at balanced and sustainable development.  It also aims at promoting
human resource development and gives priority to the role of the private sector
as the engine of growth. <p>
<p>
	The Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995 has as its main thrust, "to sustain the
growth and momentum and manage it successfully so as to achieve a more balanced
development of the economy".  One of the specific strategies undertaken to
achieve balanced development is to "enhance human resource development".  <p>
<p>
	The goals of balanced development are based on the following: <p>
<p>
Firstly, the principle of growth with equity is fundamental to ensure the
realization of a fair and equitable distribution of national wealth.  Secondly,
a balanced societal development is conducive to the maintenance of social and
political stability. Thirdly, the nurturing and moulding of a Malaysian society
with high moral values and ethics as well as positive attitudes are fundamental
towards the creation of a responsible, resilient, progressive and caring
society...The balanced development of the economy is essential to ensure stable
growth, minimize social conflicts, promote racial harmony and enhance national
unity.  (Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995, pg. 5)<p>
<p>
	With the above parameters of national development, Malaysia has in the last
twenty years experienced rapid changes economically and socially.  There have
been increasing education and employment opportunities for women.  For example,
the proportion of women classified as unpaid family workers fell from 39.7% in
1970 to 21.6% in 1990.  This was largely due to the absorption of women into
the modern economy.  The proportion of women classified as 'employee' rose from
38.9% in 1970 to 62.9% in 1990. (Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995, pg. 415.)
Women's participation in the labour force has increased significantly since the
Sixth Plan began.  Between 1970 and 1990 women's participation rate increased
slowly, from 31% in 1970 to 32.7% in 1980, 34.6% in 1985 and 35% in 1990.  In
1993 it was 47%.  (Mid-Term Review of the Sixth Malaysia Plan: 1991-1995,  239)
 Thus, increasingly women are entering the labour force. This has impacted on
their role within the family.<p>
<p>
There have been other changes which have influenced family life.  Over the past
twenty years there has been a significant rural-urban migration, as well as
resettlement programmes engaging rural communities in land development and
rehabilitation schemes.  These have disrupted the traditional extended family
structure; many families now live as nuclear families.  This means that women
lack the traditional supports in terms of child care, thus creating an increase
in the demand for alternative care of young children. <p>
<p>
	Since the 1970s, and due to the emphasis given to the importance of education,
there has also been an increased awareness among parents, government and
non-governmental agencies (NGOs) of the importance of preschool education for
five- and six-year-old children. Given parental demand, there is a rapidly
increasing involvement of the private sector in providing preschool programmes,
particularly in terms of bringing in <i>imported</i> models and materials.  In
addition, there is a tendency for many in the private sector to provide
commercialised programmes which are appealing to parents, preschool teachers
and caregivers, but which may not be sound in terms of child development
principles.<p>
<p>
	Besides the increasing demand for programmes for children from zero to six
years old, there is now a demand for afterschool care for children of working
parents.<p>
<p>
	It is in relation to this changing situation in Malaysia that the Government
of Malaysia was interested in undertaking a study of needs and formulating an
ECCD policy that would support the national development goals.  The study
provided an understanding of the strengths of ECCD provision within Malaysia.
It also indicated issues to be addressed to enhance the capacity of government,
non-governmental agencies, the private sector and the public to promote the
well-being of all young children. As a result of the study the following set of
recommendations was formulated, based on findings from the study.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations</b>  <p>
1.	At the present time Malaysia lacks a comprehensive policy to support the
overall development of young children as they make the transition from home to
care outside the home, to preschool and then into the primary school.  Current
services are fragmented  and there is a lack of interface among the agencies
currently serving young children and their families.  <p>
<p>
<i>Therefore it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>a comprehensive and integrated ECD policy for Malaysia be adopted to meet
the needs of children from conception through the early primary school years.
The policy should:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	1)	be related to Vision 2020, and the National Development Policy;</i><p>
<i>	2)	address important national issues, for example:</i><p>
<i>		</i><p>
<i>-  challenges associated with the quality of life desired for Malaysians,
including the strengthening of the family and moral, ethical and spiritual
values;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>-  the support and enhancement of the National Plan of Action related to the
World Summit on the Survival, Protection and Development of Children;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>-  challenges associated with increasing the labour force participation
among women for the industrialization programme, and the implications for the
family.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Thereby, ECD contributes to Human Resources Development.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
2.  	Currently ECD services are fragmented, addessing only selected ECD
needs<i>.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Therefore, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>a review of current legislation affecting young children and their families
be undertaken. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>3.	There is a lack of knowledge about what happens to children who are
not in registered child care and preschool programmes, and what happens for
children when they are not attending child care, preschool or lower primary
school. <p>
<p>
<i>Therefore, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>a study be undertaken to more completely document the situation and needs of
young children.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
4.	There are well-developed Preschool Curriculum Guidelines for children 4-6
years of age.  There is no equivalent curriculum guideline for children under
the age of four.  <p>
<p>
<i>Therefore it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>comprehensive, integrated Curriculum Guidelines be developed for children
from birth to six years of age that interface with the Primary School
Curriculum. </i><p>
<i></i> <p>
5.	ECD planning and practice must rest on a comprehensive and integrated data
base.  At the present time there is no comprehensive data bank on ECD needs and
provision.  It is important to have a better understanding of needs as related
to provision.<p>
<p>
<i>Therefore, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>the Ministry of Health, through additions to their Home-based Child Health
Card, collect relevant data on children 0-4. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Further, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>the Ministry of Education maintain responsibility for the data base for
children aged 4-9.  Agencies providing services to this age group should
channel their data to this Ministry.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Further, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i>data for target groups like immigrant children should be collected by
the Ministry of Home Affairs and channelled to the Ministry of Health or the
Ministry of Education for the respective age group.<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>6.	A cornerstone of effective early childhood programmes internationally
is parent and community involvement in all aspects of the programme.  The study
revealed that this is lacking in most programmes.  <p>
<p>
<i>Therefore it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>the concept of parent involvement be broadened to a concept of parent
participation which respects and strengthens the parent's role in the child's
development and establishes linkages between the home, early childhood
programmes and children's transition into the primary school.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Further, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>parent and community support and involvement be mobilized in creating
awareness, planning, implementing, and sharing the cost of ECD
programmes.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>It is also recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>media be involved in promoting a greater understanding of child development,
and the responsibility and role of the private sector in ECD provision.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>7.	Training is a key component in the successful implementation of any
curriculum.  The study revealed that current training, for the most part is
inadequate.<p>
<p>
<i>Therefore it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>a national ECD training system be established which provides a framework for
the development of training packages, certification for trainees, accreditation
of trainers and training centres, decentralized resource centres, and
mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating training programmes.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
8.	Research and evaluation provide data important in the planning process.
Across ECD programmes there is a lack of evaluation of programme effectiveness
and impact.  Further, there is a gap between academic research and its
application in terms of programming. <p>
<p>
<i>Therefore it is recommended that the following research be pursued:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>-  the impact of available models (e.g. home and community-based as well as
centre-based) on children's later growth and development.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>-  the cost-effectiveness of different programme approaches.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
9.	At the present time government provision of ECD is heavily subsidized.  <p>
<p>
<i>Therefore, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>in line with government policy to increase the private sector participation
in all public services, strategies be developed, which will shift the financing
of ECD from Government to the private sector, the community and parents.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Further, it is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>alternative models of financing ECD be explored, including taxation, the
development of Trusts, and philanthropic initiatives.  The 1994 Budget includes
a tax benefit for businesses offering ECD services.  The effectiveness of the
approach needs to be evaluated.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>To address the issues identified and the recommendations made thus
far,<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>It is recommended that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>as an interim measure, a National Early Childhood Development Council be
created within the Prime Minister's Department for the purpose of formulating,
conceptualizing and overseeing ECD programmes in the various sectors
(government, non-governmental and private).  The Council should be supported by
a strong Secretariat with technical skills related to ECD.  In the long term
the Council should be institutionalised within a major Ministry. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
The draft policy that resulted from the study reads:<p>
<i></i><p>
<i><b> A NATIONAL ECD POLICY</b></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>It is known that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>the foundation for children's growth and development is established within
the first few years of life and that learning begins at birth;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Further, it has been demonstrated that:</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>conducive and stimulating environments that enhance young children's
physical, mental, social, emotional and spiritual development lead to holistic
and balanced individuals; and that </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>investments in early childhood development modify social and economic
inequalities, addressing the issues of accessibility, equity and equality; and
that </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>quality early childhood programmes provide an environment which supports the
transmission of cultural, moral and religious values that are the underpinnings
of a fully moral and ethical society.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Thus, with a focus on Vision 2020 and the nine central strategic challenges,
the Government of Malaysia has made a commitment to the promotion of the
importance of early childhood years, from conception through the early primary
grades.  Further, in accordance with government policy, close collaboration
will be sought with the private sector in the implementation of appropriate
early childhood programmes.  </i><p>
<p>
	The recommendations of the Task Force are currently under review by the
Government of Malaysia.	<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>South Africa</b><b>[2]</b><p>
<p>
	The motivation for the study in South Africa was different from the motivation
in Malaysia.  The study was begun a year and a half before the first free
election in 1994.  The impetus for the study was the high rates of repetition
and dropout in education for a large percentage of the population.  It was
recognized that once the new government came into power there would be
political demands to <i>level the playing field</i>.  Therefore the new South
African government would need to consider how to ensure that all children were
ready to enter the first year of primary school. <p>
<p>
 	A Study Team, consisting of eight ECCD specialists from South Africa and an
international consultant, undertook an examination of the situation of young
children in South Africa, looking particularly at the kinds of supports that
are available to them and making recommendations in relation to how they can
benefit more effectively from basic education.  The Team was charged
specifically with making recommendations in regards to the value and
feasibility of creating a preschool programme for five-year-olds.  While the
Study Team did in fact conclude that an essential part of the strategy for
upgrading education is to bring five year olds into the education system, the
team felt that if this were to be the sole focus of state input to early
childhood development, it would be too little too late for the majority of
young children. Furthermore it fails to take into account the particular
vulnerability of the first three years of life and the particular needs of
working parents. <p>
<p>
	The Study Team also believed that a preschool year for five-year-olds could
only be effective if it was part of a larger strategy designed to address the
roles that government, non-governmental agencies, the private sector,
communities and parents should play in supporting children's growth and
development.  Thus the recommendations placed the creation of a programme for
five-year-olds in a broader, more appropriate context.  <p>
<p>
Results of the Study<p>
	 The study included information on the following:<p>
<p>
	(a) 	The evidence from South Africa on the effects of preschool on repetition
and dropout and on nonschool outcomes was summarized.<p>
<p>
	(b)	The key skills that all children should have acquired by the end of the
preschooling period were identified and elaborated upon.<p>
<p>
	(c)	The types of skills required of preschool staff in order to support the
development of children's skills were defined, and an appropriate
cost-effective mix of staffing was proposed.<p>
<p>
(d)	There was an examination of the various 'bridging' modules being offered at
the time to see to what extent these provided the skills defined in section
(a), and an assessment was made of the modules' strengths and weaknesses,
including their impact on repetition and dropout.<p>
<p>
	(e)	A <i>mapping</i> of the preschool provider network was undertaken. This
included a description of the provision of ECCD programmes by various
government and NGO programmes and the number of children served, and the
geographic spread of provision.  The process also allowed for the
identification of programmes or programme elements (e.g. initial training,
ongoing support, instructional materials) that could be used as models for
future expansion of  ECCD provision.<p>
<p>
	(f)	Recommendations were made in relation to an appropriate cost-effective mix
of preschool staff, and the availability of training for different levels of
staff, and cost per trainee was determined.  Given the capacity at that point
in time an estimate was made of how many teachers could be trained in a
12-month period.  There was also a specification of the conditions under which
the existing training capacity could be expanded. <p>
<p>
(g)	The roles that government, NGOs, communities and parents should play were
defined in relation to:  setting standards and monitoring provision, the
development of curriculum, training, paying staff, providing physical
facilities, and covering the costs of recurrent materials.  Also,
recommendations were made in terms of the institutional arrangements that were
needed in order to coordinate preschool if it were to be offered by
government.<p>
<p>
	(h)	An assessment was made of the recurrent costs associated with the existing
models of preschool provision, and a description was provided of how these
costs were being financed.<p>
<p>
	(i)	A description was provided of the positions of the then-current
government, political movements, parties and extra-parliamentary groups in
relation to preschool provision.<p>
<p>
	(j)	The key policy issues to be resolved by a new democratically-elected
government were identified and, where appropriate, recommendations were made
for consideration by the new authorities.<p>
<p>
	(k)	An intervention strategy and programme were proposed to address the demand
for preschool services over time.  On the basis of different models of
provision, the cost of a new government offering a year of preschool to every
child in the country was estimated.  Cost estimates were also made for a
gradual increase in ECCD provision over a five-year time period.<p>
<p>
	In essence, the Task Force  recommended that the government, in partnership
with NGOs, the private sector, trade unions, the community and families, invest
in the provision of early childhood services for children from birth through
the early primary years.  The recommendations focussed specifically on the
provision of support to early childhood development programmes for selected
children from birth through age four, and the provision of universal preprimary
education for five-year-olds prior to entry into the formal school system.
However, the report made the point that it was important that this year not be
offered in lieu of or apart from school reform at the junior primary level. <p>
<p>
	The recommendations made as a result of the study were based on resources
already developed within South Africa.  For example, there is a strong
community of non-governmental agencies which have developed appropriate
curriculum for young children, and a variety of outreach models allowing for
the provision of services to isolated rural areas. The variety reflects a
sensitivity to differing regional and local needs within generally accepted
principles of development which seek to redress historical imbalances through
appropriate and cost-effective strategies. <p>
<p>
	The NGOs involved in early childhood development (ECD) programmes have also
developed extensive training systems that 1) provide ECD staff with appropriate
skills and knowledge to work with young children and their families, and 2)
enable communities to take ownership of ECD programmes and sustain them over
time. It is these strengths that will be built upon in the creation of a
national system of support to ECD programmes. <p>
<p>
	It was the belief of the Study Team that over the next five years the current
training agencies could develop the capacity to train the required number of
ECD workers, provided that they were given the necessary resources to do so,
and provided that appropriate linkages were established with formal teacher
training institutions.  Within the recommended Plan of Action the services
provided by current Resource and Training Agencies will be expanded and
strengthened.<p>
	<p>
<b>Selected Recommendations</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<i>Support for the development, expansion, management and funding of early
childhood provision</i> <i>is the joint responsibility of the state, provincial
and local governments, the private sector, the community and parents.  </i><p>
<p>
<i>Responsibility for the development of policies and guidelines for the
implementation of early childhood development programmes should be the
responsibility of central government.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>A Department of Early Childhood Development (ECD) should be created within
the Ministry of Education and Training, responsible for creating policy and
guidelines. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Curriculum guidelines for early childhood development should be established
by the National Institute for Curriculum Development (NICD), taking into
consideration children's needs in health, nutrition, education and psychosocial
development.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Responsibility for interpretation and implementation of guidelines and
policies for ECD programmes should be based at the Provincial level.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Implementation of ECD programmes should be the responsibility of Local
Authorities and ECD management committees. They would be responsible for
stimulating the development of ECD programmes, registering and monitoring the
activities of individual early childhood programmes, and they would be involved
in direct provision. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>At the programme level, parents will have responsibility for management of
early childhood provision.  They would be responsible for establishing and
maintaining the facilities, and paying of the teachers whose salary would be
provided through a combination of state subsidies, local funding and parent
fees.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>An Interministerial ECD Committee should be created to promote integration
across sectors of services in support of young children and their
families.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>A Reception Class for five-year-olds should be created.  This is to be
phased in over a period of five years. By the end of the fifth year 100% of the
five-year-olds should have access to a Reception Class.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Resource and Training Centres need to be established in each Province to
provide training and support to ECD programmes. Current NGOs can be accredited
and contracted to serve as RTCs. These should be subsidized by
government.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>A Reception Year for five year olds should not be implemented in isolation.
It must be linked to reform within Junior Primary.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Alternative ways of reaching those under 5 need to continue to be
explored.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	</i>The costs of implementing the recommendations were calculated.  The per
capita costs of provision, inclusive of the costs of facilities and the
training of teachers and appropriate support staff, decrease as more children
have access to the services.  In the first year there would be state subsidies
of ECCD services for 579,000 children, from birth to 5 years of age, in a
variety of settings.  The average per capita cost is R1,960 (US$ 653/year). By
the end of the fifth year more than 3 million children would have access to
ECCD provision, at an average cost of R1,504 (US$ 501) per child per annum.
This is a small investment to make in the foundation upon which a nation is
being built. <p>
<p>
	When the new Government came into power the Report was submitted to those
formulating government policy.  What follows is what was written into the Draft
White Paper on Education and Training. (Staatskoerant Government Gazette,
1994)<p>
<p>
<i>57.	The care and development of infants and young children must be the
foundation of social relations and the starting point of a national human
resource development strategy.  The national and provincial Departments of
Education will have specific roles to play in this field.  They cannot
undertake the full responsibility for ECD, which is a multi-disciplinary field.
Instead, the national Department of Education will liaise with the Departments
of National Health and Welfare in order to establish an inter-departmental
committee or working group to develop their joint interests in policy for the
infant and young child.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>58.	The Department of Education has particular responsibility for the
education components of ECD, especially the development of policy frameworks,
norms and standards in relation to curricula and teacher education, including
paraprofessional training.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>59.	The new national department is planned to have a directorate for early
Childhood Development, and Lower Primary Education, in the light of the
continuity in developmental approaches to the young child and the need for a
reshaping of curricula and teaching methodology for the early years of school.
Hopefully, similar units will be established in provincial Departments of
Education, which will undertake similar liaison functions with Health and
Welfare.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>60.	The new national directorate will have the major responsibility for
developing policy for the reception phase, the first year of compulsory general
education programme, in consultation with its provincial counterparts.  These
new provincial units would therefore take up the massive challenge of
spearheading the phasing in of the policy, in conjunction with NGO providers
and accredited training agencies.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>61.	However, before the policy process could properly begin, it would be
necessary to consult with all national stakeholders in the field, including the
national representative body of ECD practitioners, in order to develop an
appropriate statutory consultative group to advise on ECD policy, resourcing
and development.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>62.	State funds will not be sufficient to mount a major developmental
programme in 1995, but the seed money should be made available, as in the new
ABET programme, to begin the startup phase and attract other funders.  This
process needs to be driven through a partnership of local government,
community, business, worker and development agency interests, in order to build
public awareness and develop a funding strategy for a national ECD
programme.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
	The South Africa case study provides a good example of how recommendations can
be turned into policy language.  The policy has not yet been put into place and
implementation has not begun, so it is not possible to evaluate the effort.
However a start has been made toward a policy that unifies diverse efforts into
a cohesive nationwide response to the needs of young children.<p>

This page was inspired by Dave's real-life sock drawer. You can find
the most amazing things there. Things like Dave's high school diploma
and college degree, both still unused in their little presentation 
binders. Another charming item is Velvet's first hairball, which Dave 
had bronzed.

Awards
</H2>
<P>
Awards are generally displayed prominently on the top page of a web
site to show how wonderfully cool the site has been determined to be.
Of course the logos really show how much of the webmaster's terminal 
egomania will be displayed this particular week. Most of these awards tend
to make visitors wonder about the people who give out the awards. Questions
like, "Did the awards people ever actually <i>visit</i> this site before
giving it an award?" spring immediately to mind.

RAH96: About Industrial Smoke & Mirrors, Ltd.
</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
Industrial Smoke & Mirrors, Ltd. is the former R&D division of Vaporware
Corporation that was sold off in February 1995 after the parent firm
declared bankruptcy.  Dr. Kung Pao Har Hoo, the former Vice President for
Research & Development with Vaporware Corporation, took over the newly
independent firm as President and CEO.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Smoke & Mirrors (ISM) is a world leader in totally useless
technological advances, trailing only Apple Computer in this area.
</P>
<P>
After a wildly successful ($2.2 billion) Initial Public Offering (IPO)
in February 1996 ISM had money for acquisitions. The firm spent nearly 
$200 million on pizza for all its programmers and scientists within 
the first month alone. This resulted in a great deal of work being 
accomplished, although a few folks had to be treated by paramedics for 
oregano and anchovy poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Things became even stickier soon thereafter when agents from the Securities 
and Exchange Commission began investigating the circumstances surrounding 
the ISM IPO. It seems that many investors had been attracted to the ISM 
offering by the words "Internet" and "World Wide Web" which appeared more 
than 200 times each in the prospectus. Nosy SEC agents soon ferreted out 
the minor detail that ISM's business had nothing whatsoever to do with the 
Internet or the Web. Dr. Hoo moved quickly in response to this revelation, 
making two critical hires.
</P>
<P>
Vinnie "The Knife" Calamari was hired as ISM Security Director, reprising
the role he played at Vaporware. Calamari's job will be to see that no
further investigative embarrassments befall ISM or its executives.
</P>
<P>
Dave Bealer, the former editor of <I>Random Access Humor</I>, the only
successful Vaporware venture other than ISM, was brought on board to run the 
new ISM Internet Division. Bealer spent the last year serving as editor and 
publisher of <I>Dream Forge - The Electronic Magazine For Your Mind</I>.
When asked about the change, Bealer said, "I really hate to leave a successful
venture like <I>Dream Forge</I>, but I just couldn't pass up the 
opportunity to work with Dr. Hoo and Vinnie again."
</P>
<P>
Bealer's first action upon taking the reins of the new ISM Internet 
Division was to begin work on <I>Random Access Humor 96</I>, the 
WWW-exclusive successor to <I>Random Access Humor</I>. Successful
efforts were made to secure the participation of such renowned RAH 
authors as Greg Borek.

Editorial: The Spree Is Over<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<H3>
Irresponsible Behavior
</H3>
<P>
When I was but a wee tyke there was a game show on television that
ended in a shopping spree. The lucky winner would get to roll a 
shopping cart around a grocery store and stuff as much food into it
as possible during a one minute period.  For some reason the idea of
rolling a shopping cart around a grocery store and putting whatever
I wanted into it held a great fascination for me.  Bear in mind that 
I was extremely young at the time and prevented by parental authority
from having whatever I wanted when in a <i>real</i> grocery store.
</P>
<P>
What I didn't realize at that time was that a much larger, much more
sinister shopping spree was taking place on a national level. The
liberals had gained control of government and were spending money they
didn't have like there was no tomorrow. After a few decades of this it
became apparent to all but the most irretrievably liberal that there
really <i>was</i> no tomorrow for this nation unless the uncontrolled
spending was brought to a halt.
</P>
<H3>
Reality Check '94
</H3>
<P>
We all know that the liberal gravy train derailed in November 1994 in a 
wreck that made AMTRAK look safe by comparison. The Democratic Party
leaders, who were the sole occupants of the locomotive cab at the 
critical moment, have tried to blame the crash on Oliver North, Reagan/Bush, 
swamp gas, Rush Limbaugh, America's high fat content diet, Desert Storm, 
Hailey's Comet, sun spots, and (most of all) those angry, closed-minded, 
ignorant, non-pain-feeling citizens who were, for some strange reason, 
given the right to <b>vote</b> by some even stranger people a couple
hundred years ago. The idea that citizens who earn the wealth which is
collected by the government in the form of taxes should have some say
in how those taxes are spent is appalling to liberals. 
</P>
<P>
Most liberals would benefit from skipping one or two of the latest 
New Age I-feel-your-pain tomes and reading a little history. Perhaps 
if they knew what <b>real pain</b> can feel like they wouldn't be
so quickly impressed (or depressed) by a little everyday human misfortune.
This is not to say that there is no genuine need in this country - there
most certainly is. But the simple, brutal fact is that even America, the 
wealthiest nation on the planet, does not have unlimited wealth or resources.
</P>
<P>
The oh-so politically incorrect consequence of this critical fact is that 
the majority of voters in a democracy have the absolute right to allocate
the available resources as they see fit.  This includes the right to refuse 
financial (or other forms of) aid to anyone they want to exclude. The 
majority also has the right to impose conditions on the receipt of any such 
aid that is offered.
</P>
<P>
Ooo! Can you hear that whining? It's deafening. Those of you who are still
with us may want to throw some cold water on those who have fainted. They
may be happier remaining unconcious, but will have to face reality sooner 
or later. And the quicker they get started, the sooner they'll figure out 
what life is all about.
</P>
<P>
Don't get me wrong. I'm not condoning withholding aid from people because
of their race, religion, gender, fashion/social sense (or lack thereof),
or other affiliation or status. The folks footing the bills do have the
right to require work from those aid recipients capable of doing so, and
to place limits on the length of time that aid may be received.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of limits, term limits for elected officials are also a good
idea. A "ruling class" of professional legislators and executives is
not what the nations' founders had in mind. It is no accident that the
only lifetime appointments included in the constitution were for the
justices of the Supreme Court.
</P>
<H3>
Decision '96
</H3>
<P>
The national election this November will be one of those crucial
elections that determine, in a large way, the future course of American
history. We will have to decide whether to let the liberal kids loose in
the store again with an open line of credit, or whether to put someone
responsible in charge for a change. 
</P>
<P>
As you go to exercise your franchise on November 5th, please remember that 
although shopping sprees can be fun, especially for the young and 
irresponsible, the bills always come due eventually.  You, or your children, 
or their children will have to pay those bills.

Dear Mr. Bealer:
<BR><BR>
I know you are a busy man so I'll make this short.  How can
I get a copy of <I>Command Line Cowboys: The Best of RAH Vol 0</I>?
<BR><BR>
The files I got from Dreamforge BBS, (The Last 12 issues of RAH)
didn't include the file RAHORDER.FRM

Hi Paul,
<BR><BR>
Unfortunately, you can't get a copy of <I>Command Line Cowboys:
The Best of RAH Vol 0</I> (CLCV0). I stopped promoting it because only a
few copies sold.  The real bite here is that during a hard disk
crash I lost the Hyperwriter setup (the hypertext product used to
create CLCV0) and never bothered to reinstall it because I never
needed it again.
<BR><BR>
Yes, I'm sure that the production release for CLCV0 (including the
Hyperwriter runtimes) exists on diskette here somewhere (I'm not quite
THAT irresponsible <g>).  The trouble is that we're talking a time lapse of
at least 18-24 months since the hard disk crash.  I have no idea where the
diskette containing this prize could be.  It would take far too much time
to try and find it.
<BR><BR>
One consolation is that CLCV0 wasn't too good, being my very first attempt 
at hypertext.  So quite honestly you didn't miss much.  If I ever become
famous, perhaps the Smithsonian folks will find it when searching through 
all my diskettes. <g>
<BR><BR>
I'll publish selected bits of your request and my response as the first 
"Lettuce to the Editor" for RAH96.  That way any other interested parties 
will know about this situation too.  Then if I ever encounter the magic 
CLCV0 diskette in my travels around my work area I'll announce that in 
RAH96 as well.  Whether I charge for it in that event depends on how broke 
I am at the time.  <g>
<BR><BR>
Sorry I couldn't be more helpful.
<BR><BR>

I would like to publicly (and sincerely) apologize to anyone who attempted

Born Late, And In The Wrong Time Zone
</H2>
<H3>
by Dave Bealer
</H3>
<P>
Copyright &#169; 1996 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</P>
<P>
I don't do mornings. Never have, never will. I was born at about
10:30 A.M. on a Wednesday morning (some few decades ago), and 
immediately began to loudly express my dim view of being disturbed 
at such an early hour. My mother gave birth to me about a week after 
her due date. Late for my very first appointment, I've managed to 
live up to that first impression throughout most of my life. 
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately my parents were both early birds. Even worse, they
were punctuality freaks. Exasperated by my constant tardiness, they 
insisted that I leave "extra early" for everything so I wouldn't be 
late. It got so bad that I often found myself waiting for the school 
bus at 4 A.M. -- and that was for kindergarten. Once I entered first 
grade they really started cracking down.
</P>
<P>
My school years were an unrelenting nightmare of having to get up in 
the middle of what my body considers the night and venture forth to 
deal with chipper, bright-eyed, totally infuriating morning people.  
It's a wonder I didn't end up in reform school for strangling one of 
those sappy, happy yoyos.
</P>
<P>
Getting out of school didn't help all that much. My parents lacked
a certain sympathy for their college dropout son and expected me to 
get up and go to work...or at least look for work. Curses, foiled again! 
</P>
<P>
When I finally returned to college I did manage to schedule all my 
classes in the afternoon and evening for a couple of semesters, but so 
many required courses were offered only at 8 or 9 A.M. that I was often 
found sleepwalking to my first class. 
</P>
<P>
Even summer held no respite. I had summer jobs - always on day shift.
The final insult was that on days off from work my mother would take
perverse satisfaction from waking me up in the morning if one of my 
morning person "friends" telephoned. The ringing phone would wake me 
up, at least partially. From out in the living room I'd hear Mom saying,
"No, he's not up yet, but it's definitely time for him to <b>get up</b>!" 
Wearily I'd eye the alarm clock on the dresser. Ten A.M. Groan!
</P>
<P>
Eventually I graduated from college, and somehow managed to turn up in
time for the ceremony, which started in the morning. I ended up finding 
a good job almost immediately... on day shift! The first job I had offered
a benefit called flextime, which allowed employees to show up any time 
between 6:30 A.M. and 9:30 A.M. Guess who just barely made it to work 
between 9:20 and 9:40 A.M. every day? 
</P>
<P>
The early birds used my arrival as an alarm. "Hey, Dave's here! It must be 
9:30, give or take a few minutes - time for me to take my morning break."
On those rare occasions when I was in the office at 6:30 A.M. (usually
because I had been there all night working on some problem) it would 
really shake people up. They'd do double takes, glance at their watches,
then look at me like they had just seen the sun set in the east.
</P>
<P>
I suffered through these various forms of torture for just over 35 years.
The only time I ever felt truly at peace getting up in the morning 
is when I was in the western states. Now in California this could be 
due to inhaling a little too much secondary marijuana smoke, but it 
could also have to do with the time zones.  Since I feel the same way 
when I'm in Nevada, we'll assume for the moment it must be the time 
zone thing.
</P>
<P>
Could it be? Is it possible that I was born in the wrong time zone?
Is my internal clock set for Pacific time? There is some anecdotal
evidence to support this theory. On my first trip to California (July 1987)
I was getting to work at 6 A.M. regularly - because that's when the
client required us - to monitor the results of the operating system
install we had done. Strangely, this posed no problem for me. 
</P>
<P>
Of course that was only my second airplane ride anywhere (the first 
occurred just a month before) and the first cross-country excursion. 
The trip lasted only 8 days, so jet boost (or whatever they call inverse 
jet lag) could have played a factor, not to mention the novelty of seeing 
the Pacific Ocean (and San Francisco!) for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
California was just too weird (and wonderful) to really absorb it all on 
that first trip. After five or six days I found myself looking at things
that would have caused me to exclaim, "Look at that, isn't that incredible!"
on the first day of the trip and saying (in a bored, flat voice), "Like,
wow, man."  At least I had discovered what causes "valleyism" in the speech 
of Californians. It's the scenery!
</P>
<P>
In 1992 I spent most of the month of April in California and Nevada.
After flying into San Francisco International on 4/5/92 I did all my
travelling by car until the flight home on 4/29/92. This eliminated
jet lag (or whatever) from the equation after the first few days.
Again, I simply didn't have a problem getting up early. True, I reset
my watch on the flight out, but my biorhythms stayed the same...and
fit right in.
</P>
<P>
This must be it! My body is set for Pacific Time. I can get up early,
and it's not much of a problem. I can also fall to sleep early in
California, before midnight, without any hassle (save from the occasional 
earthquake, flash flood, firestorm, or plague of locusts). The question 
was, did I want to move all the way to the West Coast just for that reason?
</P>
<P>
Fortunately I was saved from that necessity by an opportunity which
cropped up just a few months later. In October 1992 I changed jobs,
moving into DP management, and onto <b>night shift</b>, both for the first
time in my life. It was magical! (Night shift, not DP management.) 
</P>
<P>
Suddenly I could sleep in every morning with no nasty phone calls from
the boss.  In fact I only need to set an alarm when I have some morning 
appointment (which I avoid like the plague, of course). The only problem
with this situation is that training classes, which used to mean a welcome
day or few out of the office, now mean switching back to <i>day shift</i>.
The horror!
</P>
<P>
The biggest advantage of working evenings is missing prime time television.
I tape "Dave's World" and "Home Improvement", the only two worthwhile 
shows on the air these days, and happily ignore the rest.  There isn't
anything better on at 1 AM when I get home, but I do have the tapes of
the aforementioned shows, not to mention an extensive collection of
British Comedy tapes.  Besides, I do my best writing in the wee hours 
of the morning.
</P>
<P>
So life, in general, is good. My only concern is that someday someone will
prove that being awake late at night causes cancer. My personal theory
is that being alive on planet Earth is what causes cancer.

A 25,000 Year Still Life

...Og awoke with a start.  The sun was shining full in his cave.
Damn, he thought, overslept again.  He was stiff and still weary from
yesterday's hunting, but survival is a relentless effort...
</P>
<P>
...I have got to get this damn alarm clock fixed.  No clean laundry,
no time for breakfast, and I am going to have to drive like an idiot
to get to work on time.  Damn it to hell.  Mr. Goteborg is already on
my case about being late.  Where are my clean pants?...
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/og.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="89" HEIGHT="95">
...The river has been extremely swollen lately.  Og knew crossing
would be difficult now that that tree that had been a bridge fell in
and was washed away.  Og thanked the Forest Gods when they knocked
the tree over for him to use as a bridge and prayed they would give
him another one.  Without a bridge the river would be difficult to
cross.  He wondered what he did to displease the Gods...
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/johnson.gif" ALIGN="RIGHT" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="95">
...When are they going to put in a damn left turn arrow at this
intersection?  It's going to be at least five changes of the light
until I'll get to turn left.  Green.  Finally.  Come on, let's go.
What!?  Move!  Come on, come on, you old fart get that piece of junk
moving.  What are you stopping for?!?  <I>Move!!</I>  Don't you know I'm
late for work!?!?  Great, I had to get stuck behind a hat person.
Who did I piss off to deserve this?...
</P>
<P>
...Og knew he would have to move swiftly through this part of the
valley to avoid the old goat.  This time of the day the goat was most
temperamental.  It was always alert and always very, very mean.  Og
did not know why the old goat was so mean, but he knew many old goats
were.  Meeting the old goat would mean fighting or more likely
running away.  Suddenly, the old goat appeared directly in his path
preparing to attack...
</P>
<P>
..."<I>Johnson!!</I>  Johnson, I spotted you coming in so don't try running
away.  Well, had a restful night's sleep last night, did you?  You
must have if <I>you are only getting here now!  Do you have any idea
what time it is?</I>"<BR>
<BR>
"Sorry, Mr. Goteborg.  My alarm clock..."<BR>
<BR>
"<I>That sounds dangerously close to an excuse!</I>  You know how much I
<I>hate</I> excuses!  Now, get to work and <I>don't let this happen 
again!</I>"<BR>
<BR>
"Yes, sir.  Sorry, sir."...
</P>
<P>
...Og was always glad to get away from the goat, even if it meant
running away.  He was still able to take on the goat without taking
much damage, but he must try harder to avoid it.  These close calls
were getting more and more stressful.<BR>
<BR>
   Og made it to the watering hole.  As he approached the water, he
noticed some droppings from another caveman.  It was from the She-Og.
It must be.  Only she would be so careless, leaving her scent
everywhere.  Og knew from her behaviour that she wanted to mate
although she had never shown any signs of wanting to mate with Og.
Odd, Og thought, she did not want to mate with Og even though she had
never seen Og's club and how he could handle it.  Og did not know why
he wanted to chase the She-Og; he knew he just did.  He decided he
would have to do things to try and impress her next time he saw her.
Suddenly, Og spotted the She-Og across the watering hole...
</P>
<P>
..."Morning, Sheila.  You look very nice today."
<BR><BR>
   "Oh, it's you.  Make more coffee.  And make sure you don't screw
it up again this time."
<BR><BR>
   "Not a problem.  So unlike a problem, it's not to be believed.  I
would actually enjoy making a new pot of coffee just for you."
<BR><BR>
   "Shut up and do it, lunkhead."
<BR><BR>
   "Okey-dokey.  Say, Sheila, I was looking for a new video card for
my computer at home.  You know, the one I put together myself?  You
can really save money putting a system together yourself.  Anyway, I
was thinking of going to the computer show this weekend at the
fairgrounds and was wondering..."
<BR><BR>
   "Oh, the fairgrounds!  That reminds me...my boyfriend, Biff, the
doctor <I>and</I> lawyer, is racing his new car this weekend at 
the fairgrounds.  Or was it next weekend?  One is the triathalon and 
the other is the race.  I can never remember.  What were you saying?" 
<BR><BR>
   "Absolutely nothing you would want to hear."
<BR><BR>
   "I thought so."...
</P>
<P>
...The She-Og turned and was gone.  Og knew it was pointless trying
to catch her now.  He would have to wait for another opportunity.
Maybe he could catch her in a moment of weakness.
<BR><BR>
   Og started down into the valley.  He was certain it would be a
good day for hunting.  He was behind on his usual route, but he
was well rested.  Og took a few practice throws with his spear,
testing his sore shoulder.  Not as good as it had been, but he needed
to hunt...
</P>
<P>
...My hands are getting numb quicker and quicker.  I can barely type
anymore.  Damn this carpel tunnel.  And exactly what am I doing in
here on a nice day like this?  I should be doing something else.
Anything outdoors has to be healthier than sitting in this
air-conditioning breathing stale air.  Outdoorsy people have to be
healthier.  This programming is wearing my body out...
</P>
<P>
...Og made it to the best part of the valley.  This was hard work but
he enjoyed the hunting.  He was soon rewarded for his patience and
perseverance.  A wild boar, a large one, wandered near where Og was
hiding.  This was going to be a good kill - he would receive much
honor for his bravery and skill.
<BR><BR>
   Og waited, prayed to the Hunting Gods, and hurled the spear.  A
solid hit!  The struggle was violent but brief.  Og thanked the
Gods...
</P>
<P>
...Yes, yes, yes!  Thank you, Mr. Spock.  Wow, finally got that damn
bug.  I've been trying to squash that bug all week.  Excellent.  I
cannot believe how hard it was to find that.  And who else would have
thought of looking in that allegedly working piece of code checked
into the Quality Assurance machine.  I am simply a genius.  Wait 'til
I tell the Quality Assurance Group.  Shown up by the Development Team
once again.  They will simply turn "don't run me over" green with
envy...
</P>
<P>
...Og's success was short lived.  The Clan from Below the Valley was
attracted by the death throes of the boar, and began converging on
the scene.  Og knew right away what was going to happen.  He had more
strength, skill, and ability than his rivals from the Clan, but there
were too many of them.  He would never be able to hold on to his
prize...
</P>
<P>
..."Johnson, there you are.  I noticed you checked some of the
finished source code back into the library.  What's up?"
<BR><BR>
   "Wiggins, I'll have you know you are presently addressing a
certified genius.  I fixed a 'memory leak' bug in the old module.
That's what was causing the random crashes."
<BR><BR>
   "Get out of town.  The old module was tested and checked in by
Smithers and Brown last week.  I don't see how they could have missed
that."
<BR><BR>
   "Yeah, me either."
<BR><BR>
   "Good work, Johnson, I knew you had a brain somewhere in that ugly
head of yours.  Tell you what - I have some other things checked out
from the library so I'll submit a full build for the source code
right away from my area.  OK?  And when I tell Goteborg that it's
working now I will be sure to mention you.  I know you're on the
Development Team but I really appreciate the hard work you've put in

   Og would not be able to hunt again today.  He would have to rest
first.  He was glad to rest being so weary from his struggles.  Too
weary.  He did not notice the old goat and the sabre-toothed tiger

President Mom

<P>
There is no person more qualified to run the country than a mom. She would 
straighten out this country while talking on the telephone, making dinner,
wiping runny noses, and doing her nails. There would be day care in every
ball park, a stroller on every golf course, and a changing table in every 
men's room.
</P>
<P>
She would run on a Dependent Party platform with the slogans "Don't say no 
(to me young lady)" and "Don't cross your eyes you'll stick like that."  She'd
promise that Mother's Day would be a paid holiday in the Bahamas, instead of 
a card and a breakfast that looks less appetizing than old gym socks.
</P>
<P>
She would end all world conflicts by issuing time-outs to quarrelsome world
leaders and making them say they're sorry. Guns and violence would be banned
from the streets "Because," she would state, "it's not nice and someone could
get hurt." Hardened criminals would be sent to their rooms without television
or supper and fast food restaurants would only serve fresh meat loaf, peas,
and carrots.
</P>
<P>
Nuclear physicists would stop working on weapons and spend their time
developing a play dough that didn't crumble all over the living room carpet,
while meteorologists researched a way to prevent it from raining more than 
two days in a row.
</P>
<P>
A mom would also use tough negotiating skills to persuade Democratic and
Republican congressmen to support her views. "This is what I get for climbing
ten flights of White House stairs with bad knees to deliver a fresh batch of
chocolate chip cookies to Congress?" She'd  pause. "Eat, enjoy. It's 
okay.....really."
</P>
<P>
Only a mother would be able to balance the Federal budget by negotiating a
strict weekly allowance for politicians based on attitude, personal hygiene,
and taking out the garbage.
</P>
<P>
Big Bird would replace the eagle as our national emblem and the Statue of
Liberty would be replaced by a sixty foot, portable potty chair as the 
symbol of freedom.
</P>
<P>
Yes, this country could definitely use a mother to lead it; but the hours 
are long, the pay is low, and they already have the most important job in 
the world.

Techno-Rant:<BR>
Framed On The Web
</H2>
<H3>
by Dave Bealer
</H3>
<P>
Copyright &#169; 1996 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</P>
<P>
Oh, no! I've been framed! Such is the cry of the frames-capable browser
user as he falls victim to another runaway frame job. As a long-time Netscape 
user, I've got my own war stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
Sure, frames <i>can be</i> cool - though usually not the ones your
mother picks out for you. So can BLINK, and graphics, and even the 
occasional image map. I'd even go so far as to say that server push
may have its place, although not on any page of more than a few lines
that someone expects <i>me</i> to read.
</P>
<H3>
Framed Into A Corner
</H3>
<P>
The first time I ever cursed out frames was the day I tried to find
a network card driver on the Gateway Science Theater 2000 tech support 
website. As I descended through the levels of the GST2K site, the viewing 
area on my screen was being subdivided into smaller and smaller segments.
Eventually the active area of the browser screen was confined to a tiny 
frame (about 20 x 20 pixels) in the lower right corner. This screen was 
too small to hold any useful information, and I had a heck of a time
backing out of it.  (Did I mention that this was also my <i>first</i>
experience with frames?)
</P>
<P>
Since that bad first impression, I have seen some sites that put
frames to good use.  My favorites are the ones that place the site
menu in a narrow frame on the left side of the screen. The rest of the 
screen is the active area for whatever option I'm viewing/using at the 
time. The biggest advantage of this setup is that I can scan the menu
entries, and even scroll through the menu, while new information is
being downloaded into the option frame.
</P>
<P>
Another thing I don't care for is the link that launches an entire new
copy of the browser. Since I often go off and do something else while
waiting for any lengthy page download, I usually don't even notice
that another copy of Netscape has been started until I try to use
the "Back" button and nothing happens. Since I'm already fairly senile
(a bad thing at age 39), this can cause several minutes of fun and games 
each time it happens until I figure out what is "wrong."
</P>
<P>
So the moral of this story is that frames have their uses. Like most
things in life (and the web), frames are best used in moderation, and 
only then with sufficient planning and testing of the implementation.
Just don't look for them on RAH96 any time soon, unless I happen to
think of a really funny application for them.

RAH96 Humor Review: PythOnline
</H2>
<H3>
by Dave Bealer<BR><BR>
Copyright &#169; 1996 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
Long before there was spam on the net, there was Spam, Spam, Spam,
Spam, lovely Spam, wonderful Spam on the telly. Not only that, there
were silly elections, the Pirahna Brothers, dead parrots, silly walks, 
architects, cheese shoppes, arguments, upper class twits, pantomime 
horses, fish slapping dances, and, quite unexpectedly, the Spanish 
Inquisition.
</P>
<P>
All this insanity - and a great deal more - was the result of the
lethally funny combination of five mad Brits and one lunatic Yank. 
Monty Python's Flying Circus first hit the airwaves of Great Britain 
in 1969. This totally original half hour comedy program eventually 
spawned three major motion pictures and numerous comedy albums, books, 
fan clubs, t-shirts, and Giant Electric Killer Penguins.
</P>
<H3>
PythOn The Net
</H3>
<P>
Monty Python's humor was the product of conflict. In fact, according
to Eric Idle, the only thing all six Pythons ever completely agreed 
on was that the show "would never work in America." More than a quarter
century later Monty Python still has legions of fans in America, not to
mention most other English speaking (approximately) countries of the world.
So it was only natural that Monty Python became a favorite topic of 
conversation in online chat and the USENET newsgroups. When the web was 
created, Monty Python fan sites sprang up like mushrooms after a Spring
shower.
</P>
<P>
Now, 27 years after it all began, there is a Monty Python web site 
officially sanctioned by the Pythons themselves. PythOnline is coded 
and operated by 7th Level (the folks responsible for the PC games
"Monty Python's Complete Waste of Time" and "Monty Python and the Quest
For the Holy Grail"). The final touch of legitimacy is provided by the
site's editor, Python alumnus Eric Idle.
</P>
<H3>
Graphics Ahoy!
</H3>
<P>
PythOnline is a graphics-intensive site, which should come as no surprise.
Commercially prepared sites always throw loads of graphics at visitors
whether they improve the objectives of the site or not. Strangely enough
the graphics at PythOnline really do improve the browsing experience.
They are appropriately silly, while at the same time remaining functional.
In fact the PythOnline main menu is the best (meaning least obnoxious)
use of an image map I have yet encountered.
</P>
<P>
PythOnline does require a recent version of Netscape or Microsoft
Internet Explorer to be fully appreciated. The games section claims
to be compatible with any 32-bit version of Netscape, but the games
wouldn't work with my copy of Netscape Gold for Windoze 95. Apparently
some plug-in is needed to run the ".7th" MIME type, but there was
no information I could find on where to download said plug-in.
</P>
<H3>
The Spam Club
</H3>
<P>
One of the first things you'll want to do PythOnline is to
join the Spam Club. This allows you to benefit from the many
members-only features which include:
</P>
<P>
<b>Change Your Star Sign</b><BR>
Tired of being a boring old Aries? Try becoming a Newt, a
Lobster, a Mad Cow, a Lumberjack, a Hedgehog, or a Parrot.
</P>
<P>
<b>Abuse</b><BR>
This hysterical set of forms allows you to send abusive e-mail to
your friends, family, boss, teacher, or whatever. Features many
authentic French taunts and professional abusive insults from the
gentleman in Room 12.
</P>
<P>
<b>Be A Silly Organ Donor</b><BR>
This equally hysterical set of forms allows you to e-mail parts
of your body you no longer need (and probably never knew you had 
anyway) to your friends, family, boss, teacher, or whatever.
</P>
<P>
<b>"De recta non tolerandum sunt."</b><BR>
The motto of the Spam Club. Find out what it means.
</P>
<H3>
Chit-Chat
</H3>
<P>
This area contains several sections including the Swedish
Message Board, which hosts various public Python-oriented
conferences. A real time chat area is included, as well as
info on Python projects like "The Wind In The Willows."
</P>
<H3>
Plugs
</H3>
<P>
Each Python has his own cleverly named space (Idlewild!,
The Cleese Shop, Palindrome, etc.) in which to rant, reflect,
or plug his latest project. Some fascinating stuff is included,
and the memorials to Graham Chapman are touching. Among the 
stranger features are the "autographed pictures" available in 
JPEG format from each Python.
</P>
<H3>
Shopping
</H3>
<P>
The Python Store offers videos, shirts, mugs, games, music, and
printed items. I have placed an order and will report on product
quality and service promptness after the order arrives.
</P>
<H3>
Go For It!
</H3>
<P>
If you're really into Monty Python or are very silly, do yourself
a favor and

Funny/Useful/Interesting Links<BR>
On The Web
</H2>
<P><B>
Warm up your funny bone and don your favorite web-cruising togs -
it's time to seek out some other interesting places on the web.
Just don't forget to save a bookmark or hotlist entry for our
site (<CODE>http://www.rah96.com/</CODE>) and come back to visit
RAH96 regularly!<BR><BR>
This page should be considered under construction at all times.
You never know when things will change. If you know of a funny
and/or interesting/useful site we don't mention here, report it
to the editor: <A HREF="mailto:dave@rah96.com">dave@rah96.com</A>

Useful/Interesting Spots That Aren't Necessarily Funny
</H3>
<P><B>
Laughter may be the best medicine, but not every worthwhile thing
in this world is funny. Here are some places worth visiting, even
if they don't post the ultimate Dumb Blonde Joke Collection.
</B></P>

<A HREF="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</A><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.wizvax.net/humor/">The Humor Project, Inc.</A>.<BR>
This site looks at the <EM>serious side</EM> of humor. Topics include
humor in stress management, humor in medicine (as used for healing
patients, not a set of drunken doctor jokes), and humor for public
speakers. They have an online catalog of publications available,
and a speakers bureau is said to be on the way.

<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://www.minorcon.org/">A Minor Consideration</A><BR>
Many of the best (and funniest) moments in cinema and television history 
have been provided by the performances of children. Most children dream of 
becoming some kind of performer at one time or another. But how many of us 
ever contemplate the cold, hard realities of growing up in the entertainment 
industry?<BR> 
<I>A Minor Consideration</I> (AMC) is a non-profit organization formed to 
give aid and support to child performers - past, present, and future.
AMC was founded by former child actor Paul Petersen (Jeff on the <I>Donna 
Reed Show</I>) in an effort to prevent any repetition of the tragedies that 
have struck down so many former child stars. Mr. Petersen writes with
passion and doesn't sugar coat the facts. If you visit this site, prepare
to have your concept of child stardom changed forever.

the following list of humor site lists is provided.

<BR>
<H3>
Funny Stuff: Only On The Web
</H3>
<P><B>
Most sites on the web act as references/indexes to real world
people, places, and things. But there are a few web sites featuring 
activities that are unique to the World Wide Web.  Here are some of 
the funnier ones.
</B></P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://www.ecst.csuchico.edu/~pizza/">Internet Pizza Server</A><BR>
For those of you who like your pizza with everything, including the
kitchen sink, here is your chance. This virtual pizza parlor offers
toppings ranging from the usual (green peppers, olives, pepperoni,
etc.) to the incredibly unusual (nails, bolts, baseballs, and Curly heads).
These guys are so cocky they've declared war on Pizza Hut!  You can also
<A HREF="pizzadb.html">see a picture of my favorite pizza</A> from this place.
(This site seems to be down quite a bit, but if you keep trying periodically
you should get through eventually.)

Then this is the game for you!
</P>
<BR>
<H3>

that aren't readily imaginable).

<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://www.clark.net/silhan/home.html">
Paul Silhan's Parody PARO-DISE</A><BR>
Paul Silhan is the demented person behind many of the hilarious
political parodies heard on Rush Limbaugh's show. Here is where you
can see all his parody lyrics and order Paul's parody albums. Be sure
to check out the "Bob Dole: Mission Possible" spoof! (WARNING: this
site is politically incorrect in the extreme. Close-minded individuals
should avoid it like the truth.)
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://obryan.com/congbillybob">

<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://www.wbanimation.com/">The Official WB Animation Site</A><BR>
This place is actually kind of anemic compared to the unofficial sites
scattered around the web. One particularly bright point: the Acme Hall
of Fame's Bios section. Read about the history of your favorite classic 
Looney Tunes/Merrie Melodies characters.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://www.usyd.edu.au/~swishart/">Looney Tunes Homepage</A><BR>

</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/brahbul.gif" ALT="">
<A HREF="http://www.uoknor.edu/scs/WILE/">The Wile E. Coyote Question</A><BR>
A great place to check out if you're a Coyote fan and happen to be in
a philosophical mood. This site poses the question, "Is Wile E. Coyote
the greatest cultural icon of our times?" and "If so, why?"  Okay, okay,
that makes two questions. My answer? It just so happens that I have a 
Roadrunner/Coyote poster on the wall of my dining room - a few feet away 
from the Bugs Bunny poster. You figure it out... my shrink has given up.

<P>
Here is the definitive trove of official answers to the most frequently asked
questions about Random Access Humor 96 (RAH96). Please look through this 
document for answers to any questions you may have before asking a staff 
member via e-mail. If the answer to your question is contained herein you 
will simply be referred back to this document anyway. If you need further 
clarification on something feel free to write, but be prepared to be smacked
in the head with a rubber chicken if the answer to your question appears
three or more times in this FAQ document.

<H3>
RAH96: Format and Availability
</H3></A>
<P>
Q) What's all this, then? (i.e. What is the purpose of this site?)
</P>
<P>
A) Many people think of this site as a worthless pit of degradation. While 
these folks may be correct, the staff considers RAH96 to be the finest 
electronic humor magazine available online. It will probably require the
services of court-appointed psychiatrists to determine who is right.
</P>
<P>
Q) In what formats is RAH96 available?
</P>
<P>
A) RAH96 is available only in HTML format on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
Q) What about in plain ASCII text format?
</P>
<P>
A) Sorry. RAH96 is available only in HTML format on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
Q) How about in hardcopy? On newsstands?
</P>
<P>
A) You really don't get this, do you? RAH96 is available only in HTML format 
on the World Wide Web.
</P>
<P>
Q) What about in Postscript, so I can print it myself?
</P>
<P>
A) RAH96 is available only in HTML format on the World Wide Web. This
is a recording.
</P>
<P>
Q) How do I change the text and background colors of the RAH96 pages?
</P>
<P>
A) RAH96 is available only in HTML format on th... no!  Wait!  Many browsers
allow you to override the colors defined in the HTML documents you are
viewing. The same goes for displaying/not displaying the graphics files
included in the pages. Check your browser documentation for details on
how to change these settings. (In other words Netscape and Microsoft
don't pay us to answer tech support questions on their products. We don't
pay them to write humor, mercifully, so it all works out best for everyone.)
</P>
<P>
Q) Why doesn't the RAH96 FAQ Page (i.e. this page) have the standard
RAH96 background?
</P>
<P>
A) So that folks who can't read the text when displayed on that background
can read the previous question and answer, which gives them help in 
overriding the default background. Clever, eh?
</P>
<P>
Q) The "Boob Shield" and "Table of Incontinence" pages seem awfully long.
Now that I've laughed at all the stock jokes a few times, is there any way
to skip right to the link part of those pages?
</P>
<P>
A) Yes.
</P>
<P>
Q) Well?  Are you gonna tell us how to do it?
</P>
<P>
A) Yes.
</P>
<P>
Q) Do it now!
</P>
<P>
A) Okay! Okay! Simply click on the "RAH96 tumbling letters" logo at the 
top of the page. This will take you to the link section of the page.
This feature will only be implemented on large pages with a single link
section near the bottom. Pages with multiple link sections (e.g. "The Best
of RAH" page - or this very page you are reading now) will have the classic 
table of section links located just below the title area of the page.  Note 
that the "stock jokes" in various parts of RAH96 <i>do</i> change from time 
to time. If you always take the shortcuts you might miss some good laughs.
</P>
<BR>
<A NAME="Cost">
<H3>
RAH96: Cost
</H3></A>
<P>
Q) Is there any kind of fee to access/read RAH96?
</P>
<P>
A) Our policy is to never charge the end user a fee to access the web edition 
of RAH96. This doesn't mean there is suddenly such a thing as a free lunch. 
We plan to make money from advertising which will appear on the RAH96 pages.
Eventually we may offer t-shirts, caps, sweatshirts, towels, shower curtains,
and stuffed hamsters emblazoned with the RAH96 logos for sale to our readers 
(that is, if more than six people ever show interest in the magazine).
</P>
<P>
Q) Will the stuffed hamsters be radioactive?
</P>
<P>
A) They can be, but that will cost extra. Lead-lined boxes require a lot
of postage.
</P>
<P>
Q) Will the stuffed hamsters be rabid?
</P>
<P>
A) What are you, some kind of nut? Rabid hamsters, even dead ones,
are incredibly dangerous!
</P>
<BR>
<A NAME="Advert">
<H3>
RAH96: Advertising
</H3></A>
<P>
Q) It is possible to buy advertising in RAH96?
</P>
<P>
A) Yes. Send an e-mail to: 
<A HREF="mailto:advert@rah96.com">advert@rah96.com</A> (message content
and subject can be anything) for an automated e-mail response containing the
current RAH96 advertising rates/policies.
</P>
<BR>
<A NAME="Submit">
<H3>
RAH96: Submissions
</H3></A>
<P>
Q) Does RAH96 accept submissions from freelance writers?
</P>
<P>
A) Yes. Send an e-mail to: 
<A HREF="mailto:submit@rah96.com">submit@rah96.com</A> (message content
and subject can be anything) for an automated e-mail response containing the
current RAH96 submission policy.
</P>
<BR>
<A NAME="Troubles">
<H3>
RAH96: Troubleshooting
</H3></A>
<P>
Q) Why do the RAH96 pages display correctly except for a single broken
graphic near the bottom of most pages?
</P>
<P>
A) The probable cause for this is that the RAH96 Admin Server is down
or disconnected from the net. Nearly every RAH96 page calls a usage counter
(for that page) whenever the page is loaded. The usage counter returns a
small invisible graphic which is "displayed" near the bottom of the page.
This is transparent to users except when the Admin Server is unavailable.
In that case the user sees a "broken graphic" symbol when using Netscape,
or whatever symbol the browser being used has for denoting a missing graphic.
</P>
<P>
Q) Why is the rest of RAH96 available when the Admin Server is down?
</P>
<P>
A) The HTML, graphics, and MIDI files that comprise RAH96 are served
through a T1 connection from a UNIX system in the office of our Internet 
Server Provider (ISP). The RAH Admin Server runs on a Windows 95 machine
located in the RAH96 offices and is connected to the ISP via a 28.8 KBPS 
dial-up modem connection which is supposed to stay up 24 hours/day, 7 days 
a week.  That is the theory, at any rate. In practice the phone circuit 
gets interrupted occasionally, and the system doesn't always dial back 
automatically like it should. Power outages in the office can also cause 
the server machine to shut down. Such outages usually last only a few 
minutes or hours. When the RAH96 staff is out of town (like for the Olympics
- July 21st through August 2nd) these outages can last for a few days. Don't
worry, the only things missing are the usage counts which are not displayed to 
the end user anyway. We decided that we would rather lose a few days worth of
usage data than spend loads of money on some "fail safe" solution for keeping
the Admin Server connected to the net.
</P>
<P>
Q) Why don't I receive an answer from any of the RAH96 infobots (automated
e-mail responders)?
</P>
<P>
A) You should receive a reply from the infobots within 2 - 24 hours.
If you don't, there are three possible reasons:<BR>
<OL>
<LI>The bots don't like you and are hoping you will go away.
<LI>The RAH96 mail server is down. It's located on the same Windows 95
machine in our offices as the Admin Web Server, so if the link (or
power) goes down, both servers are down until the link (or power) is
restored.
<LI>You sent your message to Tibet rather than our mail server. (And the
Tibetans aren't the least bit happy about it.)
</OL>

Sorry, this page has nothing to do with the hit television show based
on the life of humor columnist Dave Barry. On the other hand <I>Dave's

Mr. Barry is definitely the best newspaper humor columnist of his generation.

Vinnie "The Knife" Calamari's Home Page
</H2>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/radwarn.gif" ALT="">
<IMG SRC="/grph/hamster.gif" ALT="">
</P>
<P>
Vinnie's page is not quite ready yet. In fact, Vinnie claims he'll
get around to it "when he damned well feels like it."
</P>
<P>
Until that time, whenever it is, we'll just stick with Vinnie's bio,
which first appeared in the December 1994 issue of <i>Random Access 
Humor</i> under the byline of RAH replacement ace reporter Muffy Mandel.
</P>
<H3>
Biography of Vinnie "The Knife" Calamari<BR>
by Muffy Mandel
</H3>
<P>
Curiosity is a powerful thing.  It can kill cats, and get humans 
into lots of trouble too.  Not all humans are equally curious, or
even curious about the same things.  The subject of this month's
installment in the Vaporware biography series, Vinnie "The Knife"
Calamari, is curious about things which don't even interest most
people.  
</P>
<P>
Vinnie never wondered who shot J.R., or where "the beef" was.  Born
in Philadelphia and raised in the Germantown area of that city,
Vinnie demonstrated an early, abiding interest in just two things -
making music and watching things die.
</P>
<P>
The second of three children born to Marco and Irina Calamari, Vinnie
spent the carefree years of his early childhood safe behind a cliche-
grade white picket fence.  There he took up the piano and the torture
of small animals and insects.  As with most youngsters, his early
piano playing was torture to any species equipped with aural sensory
apparatus.  Vinnie rapidly showed a talent for the piano, however,
and studied seriously.
</P>
<P>
At the age of ten Vinnie's father gave him his first hunting knife.
This gift really helped Vinnie with his dissection of any local fauna
he happened upon, whether it had stopped moving or not.  As Vinnie
grew older he began to display an athletic bent.  By nature he tended
towards the more violent sports.  The young Vinnie gained his sense
of sportsmanship from watching his heroes, the 1970s-era Philadelphia
Flyers, skate their opponents into the ice, into mine fields, and into
quicksand.
</P>
<P>
Intelligent and quick to learn, Vinnie nevertheless narrowly avoided
going to prison over a tragic misunderstanding about the idea behind
high school rifle team competition.  For the rest of his school
career Vinnie stuck with sports he knew well and enjoyed, such as
football and hockey.  
</P>
<P>
Eventually deciding on a career in music, Vinnie attended the
Juilliard School on a football scholarship.  A competent concert
pianist, Vinnie realized soon after graduation that he would never be
world class.  Unable to accept not being the best in his chosen
field, Vinnie found a new use for piano wire and became a collection
agent for his Uncle Vito's sports accounting business.
</P>
<P>
Vinnie found he liked his new work.  He turned down an invitation
from his older brother, Carmine, to join him in the finance
department of a large automobile dealership in southeastern
Pennsylvania.  Although he appreciated the magic Carmine could
perform with numbers, making them change drastically for no apparent
reason, Vinnie was looking for something different.
</P>
<P>
It was during a trip to Las Vegas, where he was tracing one of his
uncle's more elusive clients, that Vinnie found what he was looking
for.  He met Luther Lecks while searching a dumpster behind the Frump
Pyramid.  Lecks had a lot more work for him than Uncle Vito, so
Vinnie joined up.  He has never regretted that decision.
</P>
<P>
A few years ago Vinnie repented his earlier mistreatment of animals
and joined the animal rights movement.  His rabid, radioactive
hamsters were rescued from the Three Stooges Nuclear Power Plant in
Isotope, PA., where they were being used to clean up the damaged
reactor.  (Previous attempts to use rabid snail darters and bald
eagles had failed miserably.)  The radiation has increased the
life span of Vinnie's little friends, and he hopes to enjoy their
company for years to come.

</P>
<P>
FYI: this is a large pizza with tennis balls, kittens, and mushrooms.
</P>
<P>
Many readers will no doubt be disgusted by at least one of the toppings
on this pizza.<BR>
Tough darts! I just don't consider it a pizza unless it has mushrooms.

RAH96 Editorial<BR>
Random Insanity Online: The Next Generation<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H3>
</CENTER>
<P>
So here we go again...RAH is back. <I>RAH.</I> Something so blatantly 
improbable that many people who read it thought they had suddenly been 
transported inside a Douglas Adams novel. (Hey, they're a ball to read, 
I grant you. But have you ever considered <I>living</I> in one of them?)
</P>
<P>
Just a couple of months after quitting the electronic publishing game, I'm
right back at it again. I've always been a glutton for punishment, but
this is more than slightly ridiculous. A few things have changed, though.
</P>
<P>
1) I'm four years older now than when the original RAH first took to the
virtual air of cyberspace. So are all of you. Whether any of us are wiser 
remains to be seen. (Hint: If you were reading RAH back in 1992 and you're 
reading this now, your wisdom quotient is one hurtin' puppy.)
</P>
<P>
B) The RAH writing team has more experience and, in general, a more mature
writing style. Only time (and the readers) will tell if our stuff is as 
funny as it once was.
</P>
<P>
3) The medium has changed. It's a large now. 
</P>
<P>
D) But seriously, folks... the World Wide Web offers a vast new array
of ways for a publisher to <BLINK>annoy</BLINK> his readers. There were 
serious limitations on that kind of thing in the ASCII text-based world
of the original RAH. Add a MIDI-based soundtrack and you're talking a
major barf-inducing opportunity. Hey, at least I'm aware of these facts.
Most of the pathetic geekazoids who inflict blinking graphic horrors on 
unsuspecting web crawlers have each other totally convinced that they're
being cool. (A free clue for these clowns: try walking along the Las Vegas
strip at night. Sure, the gaudy flashing lights are exciting to look at 
for an hour or two. Just try spending a solid week there and see how you 
feel about that incessant flashing by the time you're heading to the 
airport for your return flight.) <BR>
<BR>
Don't even get me started on that infernal Server Push "feature" they 
have in the new servers and browsers. A whole screen that is flashing is 
just what my diminishing eyesight needs. I can literally feel my eyeballs 
shrivel in their sockets every time I try to read one of those idiotic 
screens.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Oh, joy! The Techno-Weenie Ltd. logo is changing color every second or 
so. All that at the mere cost of me going blind a day or two sooner than 
nature intended. Thanks a bunch! I'll be sure to find some way of adequately 
expressing my appreciation to your firm.</I><BR>
(Oh, dear! Has my attention wandered again? Let's get back to the subject 
at hand.)
</P>
<P>
5) No dead lines. All RAH96 articles are carefully checked for dead lines
before being posted live on the web. Wait! Make that deadlines. We get the
new stuff done when it's done. If that's not fast enough for you... invest
a few hundred hours a month and see if you can do better. Besides, there
are always sites on the RAH96 Funny/Useful Links On The Web page to check
out. (RAH96 motto: we post no joke before its time.) On the upside, since
there is no set monthly "printing schedule", new material is likely to
show up at any time. We will mark such items appropriately in the Table
of Incontinence.
</P>
<P>
F) The characters have taken over. I never had any imaginary friends as a 
child - and precious few real ones. So now I'm talking to the characters
I created for RAH. Some of those crazy wanna-beings just won't take "no" for 
an answer...and at least one of them has a knife.
</P>
<P>
So here we go again. For better or worse, in sickness and in health,
yadda, yadda... the RAH96 boys are back in Cybertown. Hide the caffeine
and the whoopie cushions.

RAH96: Olympic Countdown<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<BR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/torch100.gif" ALT="" HEIGHT="301" WIDTH="192" ALIGN="LEFT">
The Olympic Torch is currently making its way towards Atlanta. The route is
a bit circuitous. So far the torch has passed through the cul-de-sac where
I live three times. As I prepared the take a picture of the scene the first
time the torch came past my house, members of the support team immediately
plastered up sponsor banners behind the torch-bearing runner. It's a federal 
offense to take any Olympic picture without the logos of at least three 
official Olympic sponsors in the background. My neighbors across the street 
have had a tough time removing the banners from the front of their houses.
</P>
<P>
Not that I'm implying that any person or organization is taking undue
advantage of the publicity surrounding the Olympic Flame.  Obviously the 
Space Shuttle launch pad at the Kennedy Space Center, which is located
on an isolated, well-guarded piece of land near the Atlantic Ocean, was
directly on the path between one torch rest stop and another. Perhaps the
reason for the meandering route will be explained when the Flame appears as
a guest on Oprah next week. The topic of the show will be "Great Symbols of
the Human Spirit that have turned to prostitution." 
</P>
<H3>
Olympic Athlete Preparation
</H3>
<P>
Thousands of athletes around the world are preparing to compete in one of
hundreds of Olympic events.  A few great athletes will qualify to compete
in multiple events in their specialties. Rare is the athlete who can qualify
to compete in two different categories of event. American Pete Sampras, the
top ranked tennis player in the world, is attempting to become one of 
those rare athletes.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/psjump0.gif" ALT="" HEIGHT="240" WIDTH="320"><BR>
It is well known that Pete Sampras has been selected to represent his 
country on the U.S. Olympic Tennis Team.  Here Pete is seen on Centre 
Court at Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/psjump1.gif" ALT="" HEIGHT="240" WIDTH="320"><BR>
Less well known is the fact that Sampras is also attempting to qualify
for the U.S. Olympic Furniture Jumping Team.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/psjump2.gif" ALT="" HEIGHT="240" WIDTH="320"><BR>
Here Sampras can be seen training for his best furniture event,
the 11 meter chair hurdles.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/psjump3.gif" ALT="" HEIGHT="240" WIDTH="320"><BR>
Obviously Sampras needs a little work on his style in this event.
</P>
<P>
Sampras didn't fare much better in tennis, at least at Wimbledon.
Pete was eliminated from the men's singles draw in the quarterfinals
by eventual tournament winner Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands.
</P>
<H3>
Olympic Spectator Preparation
</H3>
<P>
Millions of spectators are also preparing to descend on Atlanta. I am one 
of them. Spectator preparation differs from athlete preparation, but only
slightly. The biggest challenge for both groups is arranging for lodging.
Athletes must earn a place on their country's Olympic team in order to
gain a room in the Olympic Village. Attempting to make a reservation in
the larger spectator Olympic Village (read: Georgia) is about as tough
(and slightly more expensive than fielding an Olympic team). 
</P>
<P>
The Atlanta Centennial Olympic Games organizing committee (ACOG) is the 
primary culprit in this fiasco. They forced most hotels and motels in Georgia
to hold at least 50% of their rooms to be booked through the ACOG travel 
agency. The "system" by which ACOG awarded these rooms to ticket holders was 
apparently designed by unemployed Soviet central planners. The system was that
efficient and cost effective.
</P>
<P>
For several months in late 1995 and early 1996 I attempted to book a room
somewhere within a planetary diameter of Atlanta, with no success. My travel
companion and I planned to stay with some of his relatives who live near
Macon, about 60 miles from Atlanta. Suddenly in early June there were
rumblings that many hotel rooms were still available. Apparently the ACOG
travel weenies had released many unsold rooms back to the hotels. 
</P>
<P>
I made contact with a travel agency in Georgia that tried to rip me off
to the tune of $260/night for a standard motel room in a large chain motel
property about 30 miles South of Atlanta.  These clowns wanted me to pay
with a business check because "the consumer protection laws in Georgia
prevented them from charging 'a commission' on hotel room reservations for
individuals."  When I pointed out that it was unfair that they'd book rooms
for businesses and not for individuals, the agent had the audacity to point
out that "you could call every hotel in Georgia, but we know which ones have
rooms available." Charming.
</P>
<P>
I agreed to the deal, grudgingly. The agent's one mistake was in e-mailing
me an invoice with the name and address of the motel where I would be 
getting a room. It occurred to me that the 800-number operators for that 
chain would <i>also know</i> which of their properties in the Atlanta area 
had rooms available. I called them up directly and ended up with a suite in 
Marietta, about 15 miles from downtown Atlanta. The cost of this suite 
(complete with refrigerator and wet bar) was $199/night.  This reservation
was made about one month before the games were scheduled to start! Sometimes
it does pay to procrastinate.
</P>
<H3>
RAH96 Olympic Coverage
</H3>
<P>
So there will be RAH96 coverage of the Atlanta Olympic games. Just don't 
expect it to be available in anything like real time. In fact I expect
to be incommunicado throughout most of my trip, which will last from
Sunday, July 21 through Friday, August 2. Hey, this is my vacation!
I will be keeping notes and will write up a travelogue when I return.
</P>
<P>
By the time I'm ready to post my Olympic travelogue Greg should have
another piece ready for publication. At that point we'll begin the
more or less monthly rotation of material through RAH96. The best of 
RAH96 will be kept online indefinitely on a submenu - much like the one
for the old "Best of RAH" material.
</P>
<P>
I have to go now. The Olympic Flame is scheduled to come through my
cul-de-sac again in a few minutes. I'm gonna go stand in my front yard
with a portable rail gun and make sure nobody posts any banners on the front 
of my house.

The Declaration at 220:<BR>
Those Old Words Still Ring True<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<BR>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/indphall.gif" ALT="" HEIGHT="282" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="LEFT">
PHILADELPHIA, PA. (July 4, 1776) -- <I>When in the Course of human events
it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
connected them with another, and to assume among the powers of the earth, the
separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God
entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they
should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. -- We hold these
truths to be self evident, that all men are created equal, that they are 
endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness. -- That to secure these rights, 
Governments are are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the
consent of the governed,...</I>
</P>
<P>
So begins the single most important political document in human history. 
There have been other such declarations made throughout history, and
many of them have led to wars of independence, successful or not. But 
no other document has had the far reaching effects of the U.S. Declaration 
of Independence. 
</P>
<H3>
18th Century Men With Timeless Ideas
</H3>
<P>
The Declaration of Independence was written and signed by eighteenth century 
men. White men of European origin - not a politically correct thing to be 220 
years later. These same chauvinistic, meat-eating, slave-owning European men 
pledged "their Lives, their Fortunes, and their sacred Honor" to the cause of 
forging a nation which became (and still is, despite popular mythology) the 
financial, creative, technological, and (gasp!) cultural wonder of the world.
</P>
<P>
Americans are a restless people. This is only natural, since most of us
descend from immigrants. We are dreamers, explorers, and inventors. Americans 
are responsible for most of the key inventions of the twentieth century: the 
airplane, the computer, the transistor, the integrated circuit, the Lunar 
Excursion Module, the Pet Rock - the list goes on and on.
</P>
<H3>
Dare to Dream
</H3>
<P>
Of all the qualities commonly attributed to Americans, "dreamer" is the 
most important of all. In the late twentieth century "dreamer" has taken on
negative connotations of laziness and lack of productivity. The truth is that
Americans have always dreamed of ways to make things better for themselves 
and their children, then gone on to turn those dreams into reality (or at 
least a profit). 
</P>
<P>
Those eighteenth century men who started the ball rolling were dreamers on 
a classic scale, who wanted to live in a land where freedom was more than 
just another word for nothing left to lose. Yes, many of those men were 
slave owners. Some of them probably beat their wives, children and servants, 
whether they deserved it or not. A few of them, no doubt, had other disgusting
personal habits which today would not bear discussion outside the confines of 
a television talk show studio. Despite all these failings, the more astute 
among them must have realized that they were taking the first step towards 
emancipation, civil rights, and rap music.
</P>
<P>
Three of the most influential men of the past 220 years were American
dreamers. Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, and Martin Luther King, Jr.
all had dreams they shared with the world as they went about changing
that world. These three great men are gone. But if they were writing this
today they would tell their fellow Americans (and fellow citizens of the 
world) to work together in bringing about their own dreams. We cannot forget
the past, but we must learn to let go of the fear and hatred engendered by 
past tragedies and injustices so that we can work together towards a better 
future.
</P>
<H3>
225 and Beyond
</H3>
<P>
The 225th anniversary of the signing of the U.S. Declaration of Independence
will occur on July 4, 2001, in the first year of the third millennium (*).
Various third world loonies will still be denouncing America as "The Great
Satan," "The Lesser Satan," and "Satan Lite."  Some things never change.
The one thing we must all hope never changes is that Americans will go on 
doing what they do best - being the loudest, rudest, and most effective bunch
of overachieving dreamers and visionaries on the planet. If not, don't worry.
The U.N. will set up a Quality Council to set things right.
</P>
<P>
Happy Birthday, America! And many happy returns!
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
(*) That's right. Do the math, all you weenies who think the millennium 
starts 1/1/2000. When exactly <i>was</i> the year zero? 
<BR>January 1, 2000 is simply the date when every computer on the planet 
will drop dead from 2K disease. (Which is like Dutch Elm disease, only
messier.)

Puritanical Gardens<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This commentary first appeared in the May 1995 issue of <i>Dream Forge</i>
magazine.
</P>
<H3>
Copyright &#169; 1995 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
The Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock in 1620. Although the
Puritans, who called themselves Pilgrims in a vain attempt to conceal
their true motives, weren't the first to land in America, their
influence has been profound. This is rather unfortunate since the
Puritans are the most stuck-up, sexually repressed bunch of stiffs
ever to influence a country. The Puritans came to America to "escape
persecution" in Europe. In truth, the Europeans counted themselves
lucky to be rid of them.
</P>
<P>
Although no longer a recognized group like the Quakers or the
Amish, the Puritan influence is still felt every day. Individuals of
a puritanical nature are commonly found in positions involving thought
control, like television network censors, members of the Federal
Communications Commission, and moderators of online conferences. The
Puritans have been losing ground to the liberals for many years, but
still score the occasional victory.
</P>
<P>
Jocelyn Elders lost her job as Surgeon General of the United States
last year, primarily because she advocated having the schools
teach teenagers to masturbate. The Puritanical element of American
society had a major collective fecal seizure over this proposal. I
agree with those who vehemently oppose such an effort, but not on
moral grounds. I feel it would be a colossal waste of scarce
educational funds. Teaching teenagers to masturbate is about as
necessary as teaching them to breathe. On the other hand, there are 
adults who would pay big money to see a video tape of the proposed 
class, so it might make a good commercial venture. Get Roman Polanski 
to direct it, and you're almost assured of a runaway hit, at least in 
the U.S.
</P>
<P>
The Consumers Union is one of the most conservative groups in the
United States. A nonprofit organization, Consumers Union (CU) conducts
independent testing of the safety and reliability of hundreds of
consumer products. For more than 50 years <i>Consumer Reports</i>, the 
monthly magazine published by CU, has carried test reports on everything 
from new cars to lawn mowers to ice cream. A good example is the May 1995
issue, which features reports on running shoes, sun screens, mutual
funds, clothes dryers, upscale sedans, and condoms. Condoms?
</P>
<P>
It took the AIDS epidemic to overcome America's puritanical
aversion to publicly admitting the existence of condoms, the primary
male birth control method. The condom has moved from behind the
pharmacy counter to the check out aisle of many grocery stores. It
has changed from being an object of embarrassment and ridicule,
especially for teenagers, to being an "impulse purchase" item.
</P>
<P>
Although not an overt bastion of prudity, <i>Consumer Reports</i> figured
to be among the last places to report on sexual health and safety
devices. I, for one, would have wagered that <i>Consumer Reports</i> would
publish test results for automatic assault weapons before it would do
condoms. I don't know which "taboo item" will next be tested for
<i>Consumer Reports</i>, but I suddenly want to volunteer as a product 
tester for Consumers Union. Just don't tell the Puritans.

RAH96 Humor Review: The Dilbert Zone<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
We publish a fair amount of funny stuff here at RAH96, be even we can't 
produce enough humorous material to please (or satiate) everyone on the net.
So one of the missions of RAH96 is to review the best of the other funny 
things in the world, both online and offline. This time we review a web
site called <i>The Dilbert Zone</i>.
</P>
<H3>
A Daily Palette of Life in the 90s
</H3>
<P>
<i>Dilbert</i> is the hottest comic strip of the mid-90s, appearing in
hundreds of newspapers around the world. Scott Adams is the genius behind
<i>Dilbert</i>, inheriting the mantle of "Leading Edge Social Commentator"
from such legends as Berkeley Breathed (<i>Bloom County</i>) and Gary Trudeau
(<i>Doonesbury</i>).
</P>
<P>
One reason for the success of <i>Dilbert</i> is the fact that Scott Adams 
actually shared the general lifestyle and employment of his characters 
throughout most of the strip's lifetime. Until 6/30/95 Adams worked for 
Pacific Bell, one of the Regional Bell Operating Companies (RBOCs), an outfit
firmly in the middle of the communications technology revolution.
</P>
<P>
The technical savvy of Scott Adams is reflected not only in the <i>Dilbert</i>
comic strips, but in Adams' participation in the online world. Adams admits to
getting many of his best ideas from e-mail messages from Dilbert's real-life
counterparts. This fact explains why so many <i>Dilbert</i> strips hit so close
to the insane realities of the 1990s technical workplace. It also promises to
make Adams' reign a long one. Keeping in such close contact with his readers
will prevent Adams from drifting away from the reality of their lives, a fate
which has befallen every cartoonist, no matter how talented, who cloistered
himself away in some studio.
</P>
<H3>
A Fresh Attitude Towards The Online Populace
</H3>
<P>
United Media, the firm that syndicates <i>Dilbert</i>, has taken a giant step
forward in its treatment of the online community. Missing is the paranoia
that marked the reaction of traditional print media syndicates like 
Knight-Ridder, which pulled columns by Dave Barry and Mike Royko off of 
Clarinet (an internet newspaper distributed via newsgroup) after it was found
that people were e-mailing copies of the columns to their friends. 
</P>
<P>
Such e-mailing amounts to technically unlawful use of copyrighted material,
it is true. So does sending columns or comic strips photocopied from newspapers
to one's friends. The difference is that nobody can easily detect the hardcopy
violations, so they are "overlooked." There are those who practice flagrant 
abuse of the copyright laws using computer/online technology. The argument 
that nobody online can be trusted with copyrighted material because of this
fact makes just as little sense as the argument that nobody can be trusted 
with guns since a few maniacs use them to commit murder and mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
United Media makes two weeks worth of <i>Dilbert</i> strips available on
<i>The Dilbert Zone</i>. This archive is delayed by two weeks to allow 
United Media's print clients to get exclusive exposure of the strips in their
outlets prior to electronic publication. Such a plan is similar to the
delayed electronic publication technique used previously with books such as
Bruce Sterling's <i>The Hacker Crackdown</i>. This kind of plan may well
become the standard sequence of publication, at least as long as print 
periodicals continue to exist.
</P>
<H3>
More Than An Archive
</H3>
<P>
<i>The Dilbert Zone</i> is much more than a comic strip archive, however.
The de rigueur Scott Adams childhood picture is there, along with several 
unique features. Among these are the "Sock Puppet" photo collection, 
featuring Scott Adams and several fans. (Don't ask me. I'm not making this 
up - just reporting it.) Adams is currently touring bookstores around the 
U.S. promoting his new book, <i>The Dilbert Principle</i>. His schedule of 
bookstore stops for approximately the next month is available online. 
The site recently ran a <i>Dilbert Principle</i> Trivia Game, and just added 
the <i>Dilbert R&D Lab</i> game, which requires the Shockwave plug-in for 
Netscape.
</P>
<H3>
Dogbert's New Ruling Class
</H3>
<P>
Dogbert is Dilbert's dog, but this mutt is no Snoopy or Farley. Dogbert has 
plans. Big plans. Dogbert plans to rule the world some day. Even Dogbert 
realizes he can't do that alone, so he is enlisting members for his 
organization, Dogbert's New Ruling Class (DNRC). DNRC members can come from 
any area or income level, but they all have one thing in common - they 
understand technology. This distinguishes DNRC members from "induhviduals",
those pathetic goobers who don't know twisted pair cables from Twizzlers.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the opportunity to help rule the world some day and have 
induhviduals act as their domestic servants, DNRC members get to join a 
special DNRC newsletter mailing list. Best of all, DNRC members get to 
register their own official Ministerial title which they will use after the 
revolution. I will be the "Minister of Absolutely Certain Indecisiveness". 
(If you want to know why, <A HREF="/dave/davebio.html">read my bio</A>.)
</P>
<P>
My other official DNRC titles will be:<BR>
<BR>
Intergalactic Grandmaster of Procrastination<BR>
<BR>
Grand High Misplacer of All the Round Tuits<BR>
(and the reason why you can never get one)
</P>
<H3>
Go For It!
</H3>
<P>
<i>The Dilbert Zone</i> plays host to The <i>Dilbert</i> Store, which offers
all kinds of overpriced <i>Dilbert</i> merchandise, but quick delivery. 
Overall the site is well maintained and changes frequently. Stop by often.
That's all I have to say about that. With all the talking completed, the 
time for action has finally arrived:

Editorial - The Virtual Word<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This editorial first appeared in the January 1994 issue of
<i>Random Access Humor</i>.
</P>
<H3>
Copyright &#169; 1994 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
Virtual reality promises to be the hottest technology of 1996.  Don a
pair of goggles and a glove, and you can go anywhere the programmer's
warped imagination can take you.  To jaded generations reared on
television and video games, virtual reality promises the next level
of instant gratification.  Go anywhere: kill anyone or anything. 
</P>
<P>
The real surprise is that this is nothing new.  A special kind of
virtual reality has existed for centuries.  It requires no programs,
no microprocessors, no rubber chickens, nor even any electricity.
The components of this ancient virtual reality machine are the
written word and the human imagination.  
</P>
<P>
This fact first occurred to me during my junior year of college.  My
roommate had been in the U.S. Navy.  He had been to many far corners
of the world that I will likely never see in person.  Despite this,
he once claimed that I was more well travelled than he was.  When
asked to support this preposterous claim, he pointed out that I was
always reading science fiction, fantasy and many other types of
novels (rather than doing my schoolwork, of course).
</P>
<P>
In a way my roommate was right.  I've been to all manner of fantastic
places, met amazing people, seen incredible things.  These tours
started at my convenience, proceeded at my own pace, and broke for
dinner when my mother called.  These excursions were led by legendary
guides such as Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert Heinlein, Anne McCaffrey,
Douglas Adams, and J.R.R. Tolkien. 
</P>
<P>
My roommate was always too busy to read much fiction, although I've
never had the nerve to ask just what was going on over on his side of
the room.  Whatever it was, not reading more fiction was his loss,
but his decision.  Truly tragic are those folks who cannot read at
all, people whose illiteracy bars them forever from the joy, the
splendor of a well crafted story.  These unfortunates can certainly
watch movies or television, but even Hollywood's most spectacular and
expensive special effects pale in comparison to the power of the
written word and the human imagination.
</P>
<P>
Some elements of fiction can never be adequately represented on the
screen, whether the screen is big or small, real or virtual.  For
instance, nobody could ever do complete justice to the scenes
involving the infinite improbability drive on the starship <i>Heart of 
Gold</i> in the <i>Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy</i> books. It just 
can't be done.
</P>
<P>
Computers and high-tech gadgetry promise to raise entertainment to
new levels, but we can't afford to forget how to read and interpret
stories (and information) ourselves.  We laugh at science fiction
tales of computers taking over the world, but if we lose the ability
to think for ourselves they just may do it some day.  If it really
happens, it will be far from funny.
</P>
<P>
As you read these words, rejoice in your ability to do so.  They can
be your passport to any place on Earth, to the stars, and beyond.  No
batteries or assembly required.

Best of RAH:<BR>
Lord of the Pies<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This commentary first appeared in the June 1993 issue of <i>Random
Access Humor</i>. 
</P>

<P>
Throughout recorded history certain people, places and things have
had strange, almost mystical relationships with other people, places
and things.  Joined forever in legend, song and deed, these pairings
have become inseparable: King Arthur and the Holy Grail, Babe Ruth
and the home run, Lizzie Borden and her axe, lemmings and the sea,
computer programmers and pizza.  
</P>
<P>
Anyone who has spent time in a computer center can confirm the last
relationship.  Pizza is the preferred fuel for all night coding and
debugging sessions.  Even the U.S. Commerce Department has noted the
unusually high number of pizza delivery businesses within 5 miles of
every computer center.  In some small college towns, pizza delivery 
now accounts for as much as 71% of all off-campus revenue.
</P>
<P>
Certain cynics have noted that many of these computer centers are
located on college campuses and that the whole campus, not just the
computer center, is responsible for the abnormally high pizza
delivery statistics. These cynics have neglected two factors which
confirm the Commerce Department figures.  The first is the presence
of parking spaces marked for the exclusive use of pizza delivery
drivers right next to the handicapped and campus police spaces in
front of the computer center.  Of course, pizza delivery vehicles are
now recognized as emergency vehicles in 38 states.  This new status
simply confirms the way they were driven all along.  
</P>
<P>
The second factor is the four lane highway being constructed between
pizza delivery row and the computer center on many of these campuses.
Non-essential campus buildings, like the English and Mathematics
departments, have been torn down to make room for these critical
thoroughfares.  
</P>
<P>
The most telling fact is that all pizza delivery drivers working 
within range of any computer center do not need directions or a
specific address to find the place.  Just order "the usual" for the
night shift at XYZ Corporation Computer Center; thirty minutes or
less later a large Greek Pizza with double anchovies will appear in
the terminal room.  Not that computer centers are all that popular
with pizza delivery drivers.  Programmers are notoriously bad
tippers. Most well paid professionals tip like they were still
impoverished college students. 
</P>
<P>
Getting the pies delivered usually turns out to be the easiest part
of pizza acquisition for any group of two or more programmers.  Nasty
arguments are sure to break out before the order is even placed over
such crucial elements as toppings and how many pies of what size to
order.  Vegetarian programmers are an annoyingly large and quite
vocal minority who cause no end of frustration for their carnivorous
brethren.  The Alpha-Vegans are the pickiest eaters of all; they
insist that the pizza crust be made only from grain that voluntarily
threw itself on the special ceremonial scythe.
</P>
<P>
Toppings are not the only bone of contention for pizza ordering mobs
of programmers.  There are now many varieties of pizza available.
There is white pizza without tomato sauce, red pizza with tomato
sauce, green pizza with guacamole sauce, and purple pizza with grape
soda sauce.  Then there is the matter of crust thickness.  Pizza
crust now comes in all sizes from whisper thin phyllo dough crust to 
super industrial strength foot-thick crust, which can double as a 
mattress or life raft.
</P>
<P>
The final decision to be made before any pizza order can be placed is
where the order will be placed.  Pizza brand loyalty is quite strong
for many programmers. Said loyalty can approach cult status with
certain folks. The Dominosians battle the Little Ceasarians, who
battle the Pizza Hutterites. Then there are the favorite locally
owned places, like the omnipresent Luigi's: home of the "Impersonal
Pan Pizza."  Many of these contests take the form of "stick to the
ceiling" cheesiness tests.  These conflicts waste a great of deal of
pizza and are not popular with the computer center custodial staff,
who never get any pizza out of the deal, save what they can scrape
off the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
The real combat begins when the pizza finally arrives and it's time
to decide who pays for it. The pizza is usually stone cold by the
time the finances are settled. Microwave ovens are becoming standard
equipment at most computer centers.
</P>
<P>
The one puzzle still facing researchers delving into the matter of
pizza and programmers is the "mystery of the final slice."  Many
pizza eating groups will fight tooth and nail over the final slice,
whereas other groups will leave the final slice for the vultures.
This last behavior pattern took the experts completely by surprise.
Granted, the final slice is often a sad, undersized specimen, usually
bereft of toppings, or occasionally even cheese itself.  But it still
counts as one of the basic food groups for programmers, along with 
just about anything that can be obtained from a vending machine at
three in the morning.  Pizza behavior scientists at the laboratories
of Industrial Smoke and Mirrors have applied for a $25 million grant
from the government to expand mankind's knowledge in this crucial field.

<P>
People who live in genuine rural areas should probably skip this
article because you won't understand it.   
</P>
<P>
What's that?  You don't know what constitutes a "genuine rural area?"
Alright, if you can pick up the telephone and have a pizza delivered
to your home, you <i>do not</i> live in a genuine rural area. 
</P>
<P>
What kind of definition of genuine rural area is that? An accurate one. I 
grew up in a genuine rural area in northeastern Pennsylvania. The closest 
pizza delivery place would not deliver to our house. They would deliver to 
a parking lot a quarter mile away at the bottom of the hill, but they would 
not set foot (tire, actually) in our village. 
</P>
<P>
Not that it was a dangerous village. It was just that the parking lot at the 
bottom of the hill was the end of their range. The pizza shop was six miles 
away from the parking lot, and six and a quarter miles away from our house.  
Some marketing major at the pizza shop had decided that it made sense to 
extend their delivery range two miles through sparsely populated countryside 
to the entrance to our village, but not another quarter mile <i>into</i> our 
village. So the 300 people of our village had to cool their heels in an empty 
parking lot if they wanted pizza delivered <i>near</i> their homes (the 
parking lot belonged to a defunct business and was typically empty because all
300 people in the village rarely chose to order pizza at the same time).
</P>
<P>
The result of all this was that we always went to pick up the pizza.
We figured that driving six and a quarter miles to pick up the pizza was 
less aggravating than sitting around a cold, dark (but safe) parking lot 
waiting for a pizza delivery person who was always running late. We knew 
for a fact that the person was always late because we occasionally had 
pizza delivered while visiting friends who lived within the magic six mile 
limit.
</P>
<P>
Now, are we clear on who lives in a genuine rural area? Good. Perhaps
we can get on with the point of this story.  
</P>
<P>
Home food delivery is a matter of extreme importance to people living in 
urban and suburban areas. Even realtors have begun to recognize this 
phenomenon. Remember how homes have long been listed in the classified 
"for sale" ads with notations about the wonderful school district which 
serves the area? These days you can find homes expected to attract childless
singles or couples listed with the number and types of home food delivery 
establishments that serve the community. 
</P>
<P>
Now that I live in a major urban area, there are literally dozens of
pizza delivery places competing for my business.  The coupons these
outfits pay students to stick on my car windshield and the front door
of my house each year could paper all the walls in my house several
times over.
</P>
<P>
One of the major factors in the decision to purchase my current home
was the Chinese restaurant a mile away that actually <i>delivers</i>.
Imagine that!  Not just pizza and subs, but food that actually
contains mono sodium glutamate, delivered to my door! 
</P>
<P>
A couple of years ago I found out exactly how useful this kind of
thing can be.  I placed a carry out order with the local Chinese
restaurant, then went to do some shopping.  The plan was to pick up
the food on the way home.  The trouble started when the car wouldn't.
The car wasn't going anywhere, and it was a cold winter night.
</P>
<P>
In a rare moment of inspiration, I carried my groceries one block to the 
Chinese restaurant, walked in, and changed my carry out order to delivery.
If you think ordering without numbers in a Chinese restaurant is an adventure,
you should have seen this attempted conversation. It's a good thing these 
people knew me as a regular customer. Actually, they took it well. They didn't
even call the police. Eventually the game of charades ended when they realized
I didn't have a car. They stuffed me in the aged, rusting econo-box they use 
for deliveries. Amazingly enough, the Szechuan Lo Mein, wonton soup, my 
groceries and I were delivered in good shape. I tipped the driver unusually 
well that night.

Best of RAH:<BR>
Attack Of The X Demographic<BR>
by Dave Bealer

Access Humor</i>.

<P>
Boomers Rule!  Or at least we used to.  As the largest generation in
American history, we Baby Boomers are used to being the center of
attention.  Thousands of brand new schools were built for our
specific use in the 1950s and 1960s, not that we appreciated them all
that much at the time. We had bigger parties than anyone else (e.g.
Woodstock), more drugs, free love, and consequently less surviving
brain cells (on average) than any generation before or since.
</P>
<P>
Things change, however, even for the Boomers.  We took our time about
it, but many of us eventually started raising families.  Frequently we 
skipped the "marry and settle down" prelude, not accustomed to being bound 
by tradition. Still, a peaceful, clean Earth suddenly became less an 
exercise in idealism we desired for ourselves, than something <i>our</i> 
children needed to live long, safe, happy lives.  Never mind that as soon 
as they become teenagers, our kids go off tilting at their own windmills.
At least their windmills are made from recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
Boomers have, on the whole, ended up with more traditional jobs than
they expected.  Geodesic dome installation and repair did not become
the growth industry that had been envisioned.  Neither did commune
planning or wind farm operation (except in the District of Columbia,
where the hot air blowing out of Congress keeps the lights burning 24
hours/day).
</P>
<P>
A disturbing number of Boomers ended up with careers in real estate,
insurance, law enforcement, law evasion, and other traditional
trades/professions.  Someone has to build and install our hot tubs,
decks, satellite dishes, big screen televisions with stereo speakers,
microwave digital toothbrushes, and other non-materialistic
accoutrements.
</P>
<P>
Yep, the Boomers turned into consumers. Not just average consumers,
but the biggest, most gluttonous and short tempered gang of mall lizards 
ever to descend on a rummage sale. The kind of spendthrift group that 
makes the folks who do marketing demographics drool all over their charts 
and graphs. Now, after years of incessant courting by the marketing majors
(and other vile detritus) of the world, we're being dumped like a load of 
week-old mackerel.
</P>
<P>
The problem is we're getting older.  One would think that would be good, 
at least from a marketing perspective.  People in their forties and fifties 
typically hold senior positions in their respective fields, earning more 
than they ever did before. Although the people who market Mercedes-Benzes 
and trusses target the "more mature" demographics, the folks who peddle 
clothing, sunglasses, fast food, music, sunblock, and electronics lust after 
that Holy Grail of marketing, the 18-34 demographic.
</P>
<P>
As one of the youngest members of the Baby Boomers proper, I'm
already three years past that upper range of marketing cool.  Does
that make me a Late Boomer?  I've always been considered a late
bloomer.  In any event, my status was brought home to me recently
when the "classic rock" radio station I've been listening to while
driving to and from work for ten years was suddenly transformed into
a "Generation X" station.  That's right, a whole radio station
dedicated to the so-called music of a generation that refuses to give
out its real name.
</P>
<P>
I decided to give this "X" music a try for a few days.  At least it
didn't include any rap music, which I can't stand.  (The realization
that I was getting old struck home a couple years ago when I caught 
myself saying the exact same things about rap music that my parents 
said about rock music.)  In the long run it was no good.  After so 
many years I needed to hear those soothingly familiar sounds from the
sixties and seventies.
</P>
<P>
Since I'm apparently the last conservative in America who doesn't
listen to talk radio, finding a new music station was mandatory.
Eventually I found an FM station that plays music from the 1970s.
It's not all rock music, but at least it's familiar -- it keeps me
happy as I drive to the mall. I can't afford a Mercedes right now,
so I'm going out to buy a truss.

Some people don't like their own names.  Of all the billions of
problems that can afflict human beings, that has to be one of the
worst.  After all, your name affects the way people view you
throughout your life.  For proof look at the Zappa kids, Dweezil and
Moon Unit. 
</P>
<P>
Of all the millions of problems I've faced in my life, having to deal with 
a dopey name is not one of them. Mine was a narrow escape, though. My mother 
once admitted that she wanted to name me Brighton. Brighton Bealer? Apparently
Mom fell off the same flying saucer as Frank Zappa. Luckily, Dad put a stop 
to that nonsense before it got started and I ended up with the perfectly 
normal name of David. 
</P>
<P>
Mom was the only person I knew well who called me David.  There is
something in the mental makeup of most mothers that forces them to
refer to all their children by their entire first names.  Not that I
minded.  David is an acceptable name -- in Hebrew it means "beloved."
Always short for my age (5' 7" is short for 37, isn't it?), I had to
put up with a few slingshot jokes in school, but it wasn't that bad.
About the only real problem I have with it is due to childhood years
of watching the national television news with my parents.  In the
unlikely event someone says "Good night, David" to me, I have to 
fight down the urge to reply, "Good night, Chet, and good night for
NBC News."
</P>
<P>
Other than David Brinkley, I naturally identify with other famous
Davids and Daves, both real and fictional.  My first memory of this
is from 1968, when I saw the movie <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> with 
some friends. For the next few weeks I had to put up with the little 
creeps answering my every request with their best HAL 9000 impressions, 
"I'm sorry, Dave.  I'm afraid I can't do that."  Even today I occasionally
run into that response from a particularly demented coworker.  
</P>
<P>
It's comforting to know that the last human in the universe will be
named Dave. This according to "Red Dwarf," the British science
fiction situation comedy series. Dave Lister, the last human, is a
chicken soup dispenser repair technician (third class) on the mining
ship <i>Red Dwarf</i>.  Under normal circumstances, Lister ranked below
"the man who changed the bog rolls." (I can readily identify with an
underachiever of that magnitude.) Now, stuck three million years in
the future, Lister has the run of the ship. The problem is that Dave's 
only companions are Rimmer, a hologram of his dead bunk mate (whom Lister 
loathed), a prissy android named Kryten, and Cat, the humanoid descendent 
(that evolved over three million years) of Lister's pet cat. About the only 
thing I really have in common with Lister, besides being an underachiever, 
is that we both like spicy food and hate exercise.
</P>
<P>
Another fictional Dave I have come to like is Glenn Ford's character
from <i>Pocketful of Miracles</i>, Dave "The Dude" Conway.  A gambler, 
bootlegger, and racketeer, this Dave is nobody's chicken soup dispenser 
repairman. Tough and slick on the outside, The Dude turns out, in classic 
movie style, to have a heart of gold.
</P>
<P>
Dave Barry is widely known as the funniest man in America. His reputation is 
well earned. This Pulitzer Prize winning columnist for the <i>Miami Herald</i>
is syndicated in hundreds of newspapers worldwide every weekend. Knight-
Ridder, the company that owns the <i>Herald</i>, withdrew Dave's column from 
ClariNet, the Internet's own newspaper, last year. K-R took this action over 
a flap about the column being redistributed illegally on the net. The illegal 
actions of a few brain-dead yahoos whose rallying cry was "information wants 
to be free" caused those Dave Barry fans who are also legitimate subscribers 
to ClariNet-carrying systems (this writer included) to have to purchase a 
several pound stack of newsprint every Sunday just so we can read the great 
man's words. When are these clowns going to realize that creative people (the 
worthwhile ones) won't work for free, at least forever?  "Dave's World," the 
top ten sitcom based on Dave's columns, stars Harry Anderson as Dave himself.
The show can be seen Monday nights on CBS.
</P>
<P>
Not everything is rosy on the Dave front, I'm sorry to say.  One of
my least favorite television personalities is "Super" Dave Osborne,
of cable infamy.  This guy doesn't have to worry about having his
stuff stolen by net denizens because he's so irretrievably lame.
</P>
<P>
David Letterman inherited Johnny Carson's title as the "King of Late
Night Talk Show Hosts" a few years back when Johnny retired.  The
last time I watched Dave regularly was back in the early eighties
when I was in college -- anything was more fun than doing homework.
No, that's not fair. David Letterman is a funny man. His "stupid pet 
tricks" were a fun innovation.  Still, there was something about
Johnny Carson that nobody else has been able to duplicate. At least
Paul Shaffer is a better bandleader than Doc Severnsen, plus Paul has
a better band.
</P>
<P>
A few years back the U.S. National Weather Service started naming
hurricanes after men as well as women. Color me sexist, but I was a
little incensed when the first truly destructive hurricane given a
masculine name was Hurricane David. We Davids really aren't like that,
unless we have a slingshot.

Best of RAH:
Take Us to the Promised LAN<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This commentary first appeared in the January 1993 issue of <i>Random
Access Humor</i>. The version you are about to read, which was edited for
brevity, was published in the September 1994 issue of <i>Network News</i>.
</P>
<H3>
Copyright &#169; 1993-94 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
Every year since 1985 has been touted by industry pundits as "The
Year of the Network." Now, networks are everywhere. Calling 1994 "The
Year of the Network" is kind of like calling it "The Year of the Automobile."
You've either got one or you wish you did.
</P>
<P>
Everyone today knows that LANs are the solution to everything from payroll 
to the common cold.  What most people don't know is how all this network 
mania started.
</P>
<H3>
The OSI from ISO
</H3>
<P>
Way back in the 1970s the International Sadists Organization (ISO),
located in Paris, France, noticed that it had an image problem. For years
people had gazed in awe at the mighty computing machines run by serious men 
in white laboratory coats.  But suddenly, some upstarts were actually building
"personal computers" in their basements and garages. In response to this 
threat to their technical sovereignty, the ISO formulated the Operational
Sadistic Interface (OSI). Obviously the ISO had a lot to learn about
palindromes.
</P>
<P>
Basically, the OSI was about networks. The theory was that if some twerp 
was going to make computers themselves easy to use, a good way to make 
computers impossible to understand was to make it necessary to hook all the 
computers together. Cleverly avoiding the more simple single-level networks,
the ISO adopted the layer principle, which has worked so well for Betty 
Crocker.
</P>
<P>
The layers of the OSI are as follows: Physical, Data-link, Transport,
Hysterical, Devonian, Triassic and Application.  Geologists search 
through the layers of network sediment to find the fossils buried 
within: Acoustically coupled modems, S-100 computers, CP/M, Ethernet 
(Oops!  Sorry...that one is still alive and kicking), the Timex Sinclair 
and the Apple Lisa.
</P>
<P>
All of these creatures of the computing world failed at networking in
one way or another.  All of them except ethernet, which has been
successful as a species for a long time, even if it hasn't changed
much.  Ethernet is the horseshoe crab of network technology. 
</P>
<H3>
LAN Logic
</H3>
<P>
Three major types of LAN exist: Ethernet, Arcnet and Token Ring.
</P>
<P>
<B>Ethernet.</B> This one almost never got off the ground because users kept
passing out from ether fumes until a reliable method of sealing the cables 
was found. Ethernet has the advantage of having been around forever, so it
has been made to work, however unwillingly, with a wide range of computing 
platforms.
</P>
<P>
<B>Arcnet.</B> This type of network, which is inexpensive and quite 
serviceable for small workgroups, is especially preferred by welders.
</P>
<P>
<B>Token Ring.</B> Token Ring was created by J.R.R. Token, the celebrated 
"Lord of the Ring." A little known, interesting fact is that J.R.R. Token is
the husband of Madeline Token, the Secretary of Vaporware Corp. Token Ring 
is popular with large installations because response time is not significantly
degraded when more stations are added. Of course it couldn't get much slower. 
</P>
<H3>
Let's Get Physical
</H3>
<P>
The signals generated by all logical LAN formats must travel between stations
on the the network by way of cables. Four major types of cabling are used in
LANs, each designed for a specific audience:
</P>
<P>
<b>Coaxial Cable.</b> Coax is familiar to most people as the same kind of
cable which brings Cable TV into their homes.  Coaxial cable creates some
unique opportunities for the future, such as a single coaxial link which
could bring both a network connection and "The Brady Bunch" to a single
high definition monitor. Coax allows fast data transfer and sports shielding,
which reduces interference from other signal sources like coffee makers, sun 
lamps, Game Boys, and other common office equipment. 
</P>
<P>
<b>Unshielded Twisted-pair (UTP).</b> Often mistaken for plain telephone wire
by repair people and for Twizzlers by children, UTP is cheaper than coax but
offers nearly the same data transfer rates. Because it lacks shielding, UTP 
appeals to networkers who like to live dangerously.
</P>
<P>
<b>Shielded Twisted-pair (STP).</b> Similar to UTP but with shielding, STP
is preferred by organizations that practice safe networking.
</P>
<P>
<b>Fiber-optic Cable.</b> The fastest of all cable alternatives, fiber-optic 
cable is sealed so squeamish users won't see the unspeakable things being done
to the light within.
</P>
<H3>
LAN Topologies
</H3>
<P>
The cables which carry the signals in a LAN cannot be randomly laid
out as the network is built, even though that is inevitably the way
it will appear. A lot of agonizing goes into the design of the logical
layout, or topology, of a new network. Some of this agonizing is even 
justified.
</P>
<P>
There are three major network cabling topologies: Star, Daisy-chain
and Bit Bucket. No matter which topology is planned, the network almost 
always ends up with a Bit Bucket topology.
</P>
<H3>
Network Operating Systems
</H3>
<P>
Every LAN requires a network operating system (NOS) in order to
function. Operating systems (OSs) such as MS-DOS and OS/2 (which rarely 
operates) are not able to access devices on another machine in a network --
although they do have the advantage of occasionally accessing data which has 
no origin on Earth.  
</P>
<P>
This is where the NOS comes in. By collaborating with the device drivers for 
the Network Interface Card (NIC) in the user's computer, the NOS tricks the OS
into thinking that the hard disk in Fred's PC down the hall is really the
Q: drive in the user's machine. Of course, PC operating systems are among the 
more gullible pieces of software you will ever encounter. They are quite 
forgetful as well, even to the point of misplacing disk drives that really 
are connected to the machine in which they "operate."
</P>
<H3>
A LAN in Every Pot
</H3>
<P>
So what does the future of networking hold? Will Ethernet survive into the 
true Cyberage? Perhaps one day mankind will network itself into one gigantic,
communal intelligence.  When that happens, we may finally solve one of the 
ancient riddles that has plagued the great thinkers since Socrates: how many 
system administrators can fit on the head of a 24-pin dot matrix printer?

The Truth Behind Protocol Negotiation<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This commentary first appeared in the April 1993 issue of <i>Random
Access Humor</i>. 
</P>

</H3>
<P>
Modern high speed modems are capable of transmitting data at
amazingly fast rates.  The overall efficiency of these transfers is
often less than optimal, especially for small transfers (under 100K).
The reason for this is the time the modems spend negotiating the
link, which must occur before actual data transfer can begin.  In the
case of V.32bis modems, it can actually take longer for the modems to
perform the protocol negotiation than for the file transfer itself to
complete.
</P>
<P>
The technical wizards at Industrial Smoke and Mirrors, Ltd. have developed 
a diagnostic tool which will translate certain types of analog data signals
into something almost, but not quite, resembling English. The following is 
the transcript of an actual protocol negotiation session between two high
speed modems as translated by the new device, the Jabberwonker.
</P>
<P>
On the actual tape produced by the Jabberwonker, the calling modem
sounds like Charles Emerson Winchester III (CEW3) and the answering
modem sounds like Chico Marx (CM).  Dr. Hoo discounts this as
irrelevant.  In any event Random Access Humor is proud to present,
for the first time anywhere, a look into what actually goes on when
two high speed modems negotiate a connection.

CM: Ello?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Hello.  I am here to deliver a letter.
</P>
<P>
CM: A setter?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: No, a letter.
</P>
<P>
CM: What kind of setter?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: No...not a setter.  A letter.
</P>
<P>
CM: Is it an Irish Setter?  We don' allow no pets 'round here.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: It is <i>not</i> a setter.  It is a letter. L, E, T, T...
</P>
<P>
CM: "Tea?  Hang on."  
</P>
<P>
CEW3: This is not about tea.  Sir?  Sir?...
</P>
<P>
CM: To someone else at his end, "You order any tea?"  The 
non-committal honk of a horn can be heard in the background. 
</P>
<P>
CEW3: ...Sir?
</P>
<P>
CM: Nah, we didn't order no tea.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (Beginning to lose his patience): This is not about tea, you
Mediterranean moron!  I am trying to deliver a letter.
</P>
<P>
CM: A letter?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Yes!
</P>
<P>
CM: Well, why you no say so?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: I...
</P>
<P>
CM: It's very confusing when you talk about dogs and tea if you want to 
deliver a letter.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: I never...
</P>
<P>
CM: I don't have time to waste talkin' to you about tea and dogs.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Will you please shut up about the tea and dogs.
</P>
<P>
CM: S'Okay by me.  You the one wanted to talk about tea and dogs.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: I did not!
</P>
<P>
CM: I got no time to waste talkin' about them anyway.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Will you please shut up and take this letter?
</P>
<P>
CM: Oh, I can't take that letter.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Why not?
</P>
<P>
CM: I'm not allowed to take no letters.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: <i>Why not?</i>
</P>
<P>
CM: It's against union rules.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (in exasperation): What union?
</P>
<P>
CM: The Letter Takers Union.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (in utter disbelief): The Letter Takers Union?
</P>
<P>
CM: Yeah, that's right. You no wanna mess with dose guys.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: I am not trying to mess with anyone.  I...
</P>
<P>
CM: Oh...those guys are tough!  You no wanna mess with them.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Will you <i>please</i> listen to me very carefully. I just want to 
deliver a letter. I don't care who takes it.
</P>
<P>
CM: I can't take it. The union guy sittin' here would mess me up if I did that.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Someone from the union is there right now?
</P>
<P>
CM: Yeah. There's always someone from the union here.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: May I speak with him?
</P>
<P>
CM: No.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (incensed): No?
</P>
<P>
CM: No.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (increasingly incensed): Why not?
</P>
<P>
CM: He can no talk.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (stunned): What?
</P>
<P>
CM: I said, "He can no talk." What'sa matter? You got somethin' against 
handicapped people?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: No! I merely...
</P>
<P>
CM: You gonna have trouble with the union if you no respect handicapped people.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Listen. I never said I did not respect handicapped people. I just want 
someone to take...this...stupid...letter so I can go about my business. Can 
the union member there take the letter from me?
</P>
<P>
CM: I dunno.  Let me check.
</P>
<P>
{Muffled talking and honking are heard in the background.}
</P>
<P>
CM: Are you sure you wanna talk to da union member?
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Yes! Well...can he hear?
</P>
<P>
CM: Of course he can hear! What you think, the union is dumb or somethin'?
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (deliberately): In the interest of expediency I'll reserve comment.  
Please put him on the line now.
</P>
<P>
CM: Okay, if you're sure...
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (furiously): Yes!  Put him on the line now, please!
</P>
<P>
CM: Alright, you hang on.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Very well.
</P>
<P>
<several seconds pass>
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Hello?  
</P>
<P>
Honk.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Are you ready to take the letter?
</P>
<P>
Honk.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Does that mean "yes?"
</P>
<P>
Honk.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (slowly, deliberately): Please honk twice if you are ready to take the 
letter.
</P>
<P>
Honk.  Honk.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Good.
</P>
<P>
The sender tries to hand the letter to the union member.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Hey, what is that you put in my hand?
</P>
<P>
The sender tries to hand the letter to the union member.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: What?  Is that your knee?  Stop that!
</P>
<P>
Honk. Honk.
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (infuriated): Will you please stop fooling around and take this letter.
</P>
<P>
Honk. Honk.
</P>
<P>
The sender tries to hand the letter to the union member.
</P>
<P>
The union member takes the letter from the sender.
</P>
<P>
The sender drops the union member's knee in disgust.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: Thank God!  Goodbye.
</P>
<P>
Honk.

No Carrier
</P>
<P>
Perspiring, the sender enters the delivery in his log book.
</P>
<P>
CEW3: What!?  
</P>
<P>
CEW3 (apoplectically): No! I have a package for that address too! Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh!

<P>
Certain respected members of the scientific community remain
skeptical about the validity, usefulness and sanity of both the
Jabberwonker and Dr. Hoo.  Meanwhile the good doctor, in his quiet,
inscrutable way, predicts a bright future for the device.

Best of RAH:<BR>
Oasis of Greed<BR>
by Dave Bealer and Greg Borek
</H2>
<P>
This commentary first appeared in the January 1994 issue of <i>Random
Access Humor</i>. 
</P>
<H3>
Copyright &#169; 1994 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
In November 1993 two members of RAH's intrepid editorial staff journeyed
to the high desert of southern Nevada.  We were there to engage in
statistical research.  The statistical theories we were there to test
mainly involved cards, dice, and roulette wheels.
</P>
<H3>
The Best Laid Plans
</H3>
<P>
The trip had been planned several months in advance.  Our primary
concern had been to avoid being in Las Vegas while COMDEX was in
session.  After all, what possible interest could the world's largest
computer trade show hold for a pair of programmer/journalists?
</P>
<P>
Truthfully, being misanthropes, our main desire was to avoid crowds
(read: people) as much as possible.  We knew that a couple of new
hotels would be opening just a week before our arrival, but this
didn't appear to be a big problem.  Most of the resulting crowds
would be focused on the newcomers themselves.  All we had to do was 
avoid them like the plague and we would be OK.
</P>
<P>
Imagine our chagrin when we found out that there was going to be a
Heavyweight Championship fight in Vegas on the last day of our three
day trip?  This little bombshell was dropped on us at the airport as
we waited for our flight to Vegas.  Of course it was far too late to
cancel or reschedule the trip.
</P>
<H3>
Getting There Is Half The Fun
</H3>
<P>
Our Cattle Car Airways flight was non-stop and, surprisingly, not
full.  Five hours in an upholstered aluminum can hurtling through
space is never a picnic, especially given the usually lousy food.
Greg managed to sleep part of the way (despite having the twit in
the seat in front of him reclined into his lap), Dave did not.
</P>
<P>
We landed at McCarran International just after midnight on Thursday
morning.  Despite the time, the airport was mobbed.  Despite the
crowds, guards insisted on inspecting the claim tickets for every
piece of checked baggage.  Then we had the pleasure of waiting in
line at the rental car counter.
</P>
<P>
Finally we collected our assigned hunk of cheesy Detroit craftsmanship 
and headed for the hotel.  We stayed at the Rio Suite Hotel and Casino, 
a very nice place off the Strip.  Although called suites, the Rio 
features what are really just large rooms.  The living room and bedroom 
are combined into a large common area.  It turns out that there is a 
small window in the shower at head level that looks out into the 
bedroom/living room area.  This is a unique architectural feature that 
neither of us had seen before, in a hotel or any other kind of room.  
Maybe we've just lead sheltered lives.
</P>
<H3>
A Restful Vacation
</H3>
<P>
Since we would be in Las Vegas for less than 72 hours, we decided to
make the most of our time by sleeping as little as possible.  This 
wasn't too difficult the first night since we were all wound up from
the flight.  It became increasingly difficult to stay awake as the
days wore on, so we did lose some time that could have been spent
gambling.
</P>
<P>
We split up during most of the first two days, since (although not
superstitious) we each feel the other has an adverse effect on our
luck while gambling.  At night we would get together for dinner and
discuss our triumphs of the day.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday night we saw Lance Burton's magic show at the Hacienda.
Lance's six-pack of beautiful assistants were the highlight of the
show for us.  We attended the late show since we had it on good
authority that during that show his assistants perform topless.  It's
truly amazing what you can learn by lurking in the FidoNet LV_GAMBLER
echo. 
</P>
<H3>
The Stealth Hotel
</H3>
<P>
Between the Hacienda and the Excalibur is the new Luxor Hotel and
Casino.  The Luxor is a huge pyramid which has been painted flat
black.  In the daylight it looks fascinating, especially sitting next
to the medieval castle shaped Excalibur.  At night the effect is
remarkable.  Rather than throw lights directly at the side of the
building, as with all the other hotels on the Strip, the Luxor
supports a single powerful beacon of light at the pinnacle of the
pyramid.
</P>
<P>
The effect is that the pyramid itself vanishes.  Only the beacon can
be seen.  The side facing the Strip is illuminated by all the lights
hitting the Sphinx which forms the lobby.  Seen from the other three
sides at night, the Luxor is like a stealth hotel.  The only way you
can tell there is a building there is the fact that you can't see
anything behind the Luxor.  There's also the matter of this powerful
beacon which can be seen for miles, and appears to be hanging in
midair. 
</P>
<P>
Even more fascinating is the interior of the Luxor.  In a design that
had to be inspired by Rube Goldberg, the entire outer surface is
taken up by windows to the 2500+ hotel rooms.  Each room therefore
has one diagonal wall which contains a window.  Each level of hotel
rooms has it's own corridor.  The levels are connected by elevators
which move diagonally.  (No, we didn't actually see these elevators
ourselves.  But it's the only reasonable way the hotel room levels
could be connected in a building of this shape.  Besides, someone
told us that's how they work.)  The center of the building holds
offices, restaurants, machinery, and the casino.  Suffice it to say
we're seriously considering staying at the Luxor next time we travel
to Las Vegas.  We may even take some dead batteries along and leave
them in the room to recharge. 
</P>
<H3>
The Real Las Vegas
</H3>
<P>
One refreshing thing about Las Vegas is that it doesn't pretend to be
anything other than what it is.  Many of the casinos, especially ones
off the Strip, advertise special deals for those who cash their 
paychecks at the casino cage.  These free drinks, free lunches (or
whatever) are good deals for those who don't gamble.  Of course, how
many die hard non-gamblers are going to venture into a casino to cash
their paycheck just to get a free drink?
</P>
<P>
Since Dave is asthmatic, he looks for a no-smoking gambling
environment whenever possible.  His favorite place is therefore
Silver City, a small casino just south of the Riviera on the Strip.
The entire Silver City building is no smoking all the time. (Author's
note: As of December 1995 Silver City was no longer a no smoking casino.
So much for that noble experiment.)  The antithesis of this is Arizona 
Charlie's, where they actually have a tray of free cigarettes at each 
blackjack table.
</P>
<H3>
The Fight Card
</H3>
<P>
In addition to the new hotels and the Hollyfield-Bowe fight, there
was also a massive convention going on during the first two days of
our stay.  The Strip was therefore gridlocked the whole time we were
there.  The location of the Rio, behind Caesars at I-15 and Flamingo
Ave., turned into a major asset.  We were able to use the interstate
to avoid travelling on the Strip except when our destination was on
the Strip.  Even then we could get close to our destination before
descending into the gridlock.
</P>
<P>
As with most major American sporting events these days, there was a
blimp in attendance for the Heavyweight fight.  Almost everyone has
a blimp these days.  We had never seen the Trojan blimp before, but
it does have a certain logic to it, given the product - and the town.
A chance to watch the Trojan blimp enter the hangar always draws a
big crowd, usually of envious Democratic legislators.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, the actual day of the fight, we left town and trekked
out across the high desert to the Arizona border.  Neither of us had
seen Hoover Dam before, and it's quite impressive.  Even more
impressive is the utter desolation of the area around the dam.  Only
the small town of Boulder City and the vacation castles of the
wealthy overlooking Lake Meade break up the starkly beautiful
terrain.  After a while you find yourself expecting the "Man With No
Name" to come riding over the horizon.  Of course he's hanging out in
Carmel these days.
</P>
<P>
On the way back to Vegas we stopped off at the world famous Ethel M 
chocolate factory in Henderson.  Our legendary tracking skills had
failed us and we couldn't locate any of the dozens of Ethel M
locations in hotel lobbies on the Strip.  Furthermore we're both
extremely cheap, and figured to get better prices at the factory 
outlet store.
</P>
<H3>
The Final Insult
</H3>
<P>
Finally it was time to get cleaned up, check out of the hotel, and
head back to the airport.  The rental car company managed to rip Dave
off to the tune of $25 for a half-tank of gasoline with their
misleading refueling policy.  We won't mention the name of the
company, but suffice it to say that no matter how much "harder they 
try," they'll never get Dave's business again.
</P>
<P>
The final insult was the fact that the prices at the Ethel M store in
the airport are <i>exactly the same</i> as at the factory outlet store.  In
fact, by making our purchase at the factory, we were cheated out of
the free four-pack of Almond Krisps that the airport store was giving
out with each purchase of $15 or more.  We each spent more than that. 
</P>
<P>
We actually made it home with our bodies intact, if not our minds.
No parachutist landed on top of either of us during the trip.  Of 
course, if the parachutist had been one of Lance Burton's assistants,
we wouldn't really have minded.

The "Give Me A Rock" Problem<BR>
by Greg Borek
</H2>
<P>
This story first appeared in the January 1993 issue of <i>Random Access
Humor</I>. It was Greg's first humor publication, and indicative of the
good things to come.

<P>
Computer programmers have always encountered difficulties trying to
solve real world problems with computers.  Some famous problems like
the "Travelling Salesman" problem model difficult real world events
and are extremely difficult to solve efficiently.  Other problems,
like how to bury as many expenses as possible in the spreadsheet
covering that last business trip or how to get the phone number of
that cute girl that just started in marketing, are very common and
actually not strictly confined to the world of the programmer.
</P>
<P>
One of the more enduring classical problems in computer science is
the "Give me a rock" problem.  Although not as thoroughly discussed
in university courses as some of the other unsolved problems, it is
much more prevalent in industry.
</P>
<P>
The problem is most clearly described by an example.  The following
is an overheard discussion between a user and a programmer: 
(Note: Programmer comments in parenthesis are only thoughts and were
not expressed vocally).
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
Give me a rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
What kind of rock?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
You know, a rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
(This is going to take quite some time).  OK, how about this one?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
No, not that one.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
Well, what's wrong with it?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
It's not the one I wanted.  Give me a rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
How about this one?  Is this the one you want?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
No, that's not it either.  I couldn't possibly use that one.  It's
much too small for one thing.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
(Now we're getting somewhere.)  How big is this rock supposed to be?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
Bigger than that one anyway.  Give me a rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
(Alright, I didn't have anything to do this weekend anyway).  OK,
here's a bigger rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
Boy, are you ever dense.  You don't know the first thing about
rocks, do you?  I couldn't possibly carry that by myself, it won't
fit in my wagon, and, worst of all, it's red.  We've only ever
used big, blue rocks before.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
(...and I went to college for this).  OK, in order to carry it by
yourself I'll get a rock that weighs less than ten pounds, will
fit in your wagon, and is any other color than red.  Is that what
you want?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
Yes, ten pounds sounds about right.  Give me a rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
How about this one?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
Oooh, that's a nice one.  It will never do.  Take it back.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
What's wrong with it?
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
For one thing it's much too wobbly to stand on.  Besides, I saw
somebody with a nice red rock over there in that dump truck.  Why
can't you get me a rock more like that one.  I bet that one isn't
the least bit wobbly.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
(You don't have the faintest idea what you want this rock for, do
you?)  You'll need a dump truck for a rock like that.
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
I don't have money in the budget for a dump truck.  I definitely
need a rock more like that one.  And get one that fits between my
other rocks here.  Now that I think about it, it should be at
least two feet on a side so it doesn't tip over.  And it has to be
portable so it should weigh about three pounds or less.  Give me a
rock.
</P>
<P>
<b>p:</b> 
Where am I going to find a rock like that?  Look, your rock can't
possibly have all of those features at the same time.  I'll do the
best I can to find a rock like that but this may take some time.
</P>
<P>
<b>u:</b> 
Not good enough.  I need a rock now so I can improve my
productivity.  Give me a rock.
</P>
<P>
... and so on.  Note that the programmer had lost a notable amount of
hair while this discussion was occurring.  This presentation of this
famous and unsolved problem is just an example of the perils facing
programmers today.

A Skein Is Only 360 Feet<BR>

</H3>
<P>
Boss!  Hey, boss!  Got a minute?
</P>
<P>
Well, I...
</P>
<P>
That's great, that's great!  Listen to this.  Knock your socks off.
The boys in research were playing around with a "chkdsk" file.  You
know, one of those fruit-loopy "file0000.chk" files chkdsk.com makes
from the lost scraps on a hard disk.  Following?
</P>
<P>
I, uh,...
</P>
<P>
That's great.  Now Binkleman,... you know, Binkleman?  The weird one
Studman hired?  Nothing to look at, but a brilliant, diseased mind.
Anyway Binkleman says he's always suspected that there was some sort
of pattern to these files.  Paranoia in capital letters or what?  So
guess what he does?
</P>
<P>
Did he...
</P>
<P>
No, even worse.  He starts playing around with the bits in the file:
shifting every other character 24 bits left, the other characters 18
bits right, subtracting 27, and passing the result through a
substitution cypher using "peach flavored werewolves" as the key.
Scoobey-do, guess what he comes up with?  Listen:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	Now is the winter of our discontent
	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
	And all the clouds that...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Know what that is?
</P>
<P>
Well that's...
</P>
<P>
Gibberish, I know.  Rechecking his work, he realized he should only
be shifting every other character only 22 bits, not 24.  Wow!  What
a bonehead play!  Guess what he comes up with then?  I'll read it:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	To be, or not to be, that is the question;
	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>
And stuff like that.  It goes on for pages and pages.
</P>
<P>
Why that's...
</P>
<P>
I know, I know...a complete waste of time.  I told him, "Lad, you're
barking."  A bit strong I know, but one must be firm with the young
ones or they don't learn.  He went off and started in a completely
new direction based on...guess what?
</P>
<P>
I couldn't...
</P>
<P>
That's right, a 4th order Bessel function.  Great guess.  Wrong, of
course, but wonderful potential this Binkleman.  Multiplying each
byte by the Permeability of Free Space, 4 * 10e-7 Wb/Am, then
dividing by the speed of light times absolute zero C yielded...guess
what?  Come on, guess?  Listen:
</P>
<PRE>

	2 cups flour			3 egg whites
	6 oz. butter			3-1/2 oz. granulated sugar
	1 pinch salt			1 qt. fresh blueberries
	3 egg yolks

	Preheat the oven to 375.  Mix all the ingredients...

</PRE>
<P>
...and so on, including serving instructions and nutritional
information.  Might as well be a Crime Bill.  Nonsense at it's worse.
What do you make of that, huh?

Quite a...

<P>
Yes, other than a recipe for a rather yummy blueberry pie, complete
gibberish.  Can you believe the things these guys will come up with?

Only a...

<P>
Now don't be to hard on him.  I might have made the same mistake
myself in my younger days on one of those nights when I lost yet
another drinking competition.  But here is where the story gets
interesting.  I got involved.  I knew the answer to this conundrum
was not far off. "Use you brain, not you fingers, Binkleman," I
said.  What would be a likely thing to try next?
</P>
<P>
If you...
</P>
<P>
Calcium tetraborate, CaB4O7!  Yes, that's exactly what I thought at
first, but I made the same mistake.  See it?  No?  Well, when we did
it the wrong way we got:
</P>
<PRE>
  * Children below the age of 7 should use the microwave with a
    supervising person very near to them.  Between the ages of 7
    and 12, the supervising person should be in the same room.

  * The child must be able to reach the oven comfortably; if
    not, he/she should stand on a sturdy stool.

  * At no time should anyone be allowed to lean or swing on the
    oven door....
</PRE>
<P>
See the flaw in the equation?  A square hectometer is only 2.471044
acres US but 2.471058 acres British.  When we put in the correct
value the answer plopped out right in our laps, without so much as a
"By your leave".  We got something clear as the lint in your
bellybutton.  Ready?
</P>
<P>
I could...
</P>
<P>
No, this is really hot!  Listen to this, if you can:
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
	People of Earth.  Your puny planet is about to invaded by the
	infinitely superior forces of the HotCrossedBuns Star Empire.
	Resistance is futile.  Make peace with whatever deity you
	worship.  You have only until February 1, Earth date when
	the first icing and raspberry sauce ships will land in
	Taledo, Ohio, USA,...
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Taledo? I...
</P>
<P>
Damn.  You're right.  Taledo's spelled wrong.  I must have screwed up
the math.  Shit, I thought I rechecked my math.  I must look like a
real Herbert.  Sorry to waste your time like this.
</P>
<P>
No problem.

Contrary to popular opinion, the user support hotline desk at
Kamikaze computer is not a large, spacious room that boasts a window
with a panoramic view of the Pacific Ocean.  The actual conditions,
almost too inhuman to mention, aren't too much unlike life at the
bottom of missile silo: flickering florescent lighting, an extremely
squeaky laser printer, a fax machine that insists on beeping very
loudly to announce its presence at random intervals, coffee that was
specifically mentioned in the Nuremberg war trials, and a smoking
policy that only someone who lives in a chimney would enjoy.
</P>
<P>
Under these adverse conditions, our hero bravely...deals with the
public.  Let's listen in:
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Kamikaze Computer user support hotline, my name is Bob, how
can I help you?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Hello Bob.  I bought a model A6M computer and I am having
some problems with the floppy drive.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Let's see.  The A6M has high density 5.25" floppy drives.
What sort of problems are you having? 
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Well, the drive is awfully slow and really squeaky.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Squeaky...Hmm.  Sounds to me that it needs some lubrication.
I recommend processed american cheese food.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
You want me to feed the mouse cheese?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
No, of course not.  That would be silly.  Take the cheese
out of the wrapper, put it in the disk drive and reboot the machine.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Um...are you sure?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Of course I am.  Only processed american cheese food
contains the correct ratio of dairy and petroleum by-products to
correctly lubricate a disk drive.  When you call back remember to ask
for Bob.  Enjoy your Kamikaze and have a nice day.  <Click>  Kamikaze
Computer user support hotline, my name is Bob, how can I help you?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
My name is Grandpa Jones.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Nice to meet you Mr. Jones.  How can I help you?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
I bought one of your computers and it's a piece of junk.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
That's not fair, Mr. Jones.  What seems to be the matter?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
It doesn't work.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Well, Mr. Jones, could you be more specific?  Did you
assemble the computer yourself?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Assemble?  I took it out of the box and it just sits there.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Did you attach any of the shiny black wires that came with
the computer from the computer to the power outlet on the wall?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Wires?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
How exactly did you expect the computer to work when it
isn't even plugged in?  If you look carefully the box says "Computer"
and not "Fusion Reactor"; it doesn't generate it's own power, you
must do something we technical people call "plugging it in".  On
second thought, I recommend that you don't even assemble your
computer for fear of infecting it with your startling stupidity.  When
you call back remember to ask for Bob.  Have a nice day. <Click>
Kamikaze Computer user support hotline, my name is Bob, how can I
help you?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Hello.  I recently purchased one of your computers through
the mail and I was wondering what FCC class it is.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Which model do you have?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Oh, I'm sorry, I should have said.  Let me see, I have the
documentation right here,...oh, yes, it's a N1K1.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Oh, a top of the line model.  Well, that would be FCC class B.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Class B, huh?  Thank you.  Also, I am concerned about the
computer intefering with the TV and radio reception in my home.  The
question is, what is the best room in the house to put the computer?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
The higher off the ground the better.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Why higher off the ground?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Let me let you in on a not widely known electrical
engineering secret.  It is the little publicized Kirchhoff's Other
Law: The higher off the ground the computer is, the faster it runs.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Really?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Oh, yes.  Have you ever seen a Cray computer?  No, of course
not.  No one has.  Why?  Because they are tied to weather balloons
and kept at very great altitude.  They would use planes to keep them
suspended in midair but they interfere with hard drives.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
I didn't know that.  So where should I put the computer?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
On the roof.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
On the roof?  Isn't it going to get wet up there?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Most likely.
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
I think that it's pretty irresponsible to recommend putting
a computer somewhere it can get wet.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
Not as irresponsible as purchasing several thousand dollars
of computer equipment through the mail, sight unseen.  When you call
back remember to ask for Bob.  Enjoy your Kamikaze and have a nice
day. <Click> Kamikaze Computer user support hotline, my name is Bob,
how can I help you?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
Hi there, Bob.  I was wondering if you could quote me the
prices for several Kamikaze computer models.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
This is the user support hotline.  The sales lines are
available during regular business hours.  What model of computer were
you interested in, anyway?
</P>
<P>
<B>Customer:</B>
I was wondering if you had a 486DX2 at 66 Mhz with over a
500 Meg hard disk, say for under $1000.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
No, you cheap bastard.  What do want us to do just mail you
a computer for free?  When you call back be sure to ask for Bob. <Click>
</P>
<P>
<Another support person enters the office.>
</P>
<P>
<B>New Person:</B>
Hello, Chuck.  How's it going manning the hotline on your
last day?
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
I'll tell you Bob, the phone has been ringing off the hook,
one call right after another.  I don't mind though, keeps me busy.
</P>
<P>
<B>New Person:</B>
Well, Chuck, I'm really sorry to hear about you getting
laid off.  I hope it's not been too rough on you.
</P>
<P>
<B>Support:</B> 
I've learned to deal with it in my own way.  Good luck, Bob.
Have fun on the phones tomorrow night.

Online Song Book: The Twisted Pairs<BR>

This parody first appeared in the December 1992 issue of <i>Random Access

<P>
Almost everyone is familiar with how computers are influencing the
musical arts.  MIDI hardware and software proliferate.  Some it is
even affordable.
</P>
<P>
What many are only now becoming aware of is the influence that
computers are having on the <i>content</i> of song lyrics.  The following
are some lyrics from the increasingly popular folk-rock group, The
Twisted Pairs. 
</P>
<H3>
Online America  <BR>
by the Twisted Pairs
</H3>
<P>
(* Sung to the tune of "America" by Paul Simon. *)
</P>
<P>
Let us be sysops,<BR>
We'll marry our modems together.<BR>
I've got some shareware<BR>
On my C: drive.<BR>
So we bought a pack of floppy disks,<BR>
And Procomm for Windows,<BR>
And logged on<BR>
To Online America.<BR>
"Kathy," I said,<BR>
As we Freq'ed some files from Pittsburgh,<BR>
"BinkleyTerm seems like a dream to me now.<BR>
It took me four tries<BR>
To logon to Maximus.<BR>
Welcome to Online America."
</P>
<P>
Laughing at the twits,<BR>
Playing games in the doors,<BR>
She said the man with 286<BR>
Was a spy.<BR>
I said "Be careful,<BR>
His upload is really a virus".<BR>
"Toss me a floppy disk,<BR>
I think there's one in my raincoat."<BR>
"We filled the last one<BR>
An hour ago."
</P>
<P>
So I looked at the user list,<BR>
She read the system log;<BR>
And a user hacked into our system.<BR>
"Kathy, we're lost," I said,<BR>
And I knew she was weeping.<BR>
"C:'s empty and it's shaking and<BR>
I don't know why."<BR>
Counting the callers<BR>
On the New Jersey Chat Line.<BR>
They've all called <BR>
Online America.<BR>
All called Online America.<BR>
</P>
<H3>
The User<BR>
by the Twisted Pairs
</H3>
<P>
(* Sung to the tune of "The Boxer" by Paul Simon *)
</P>
<P>
I am just a user<BR>
Though my modem seldom works,<BR>
I have squandered my phone bills<BR>
For a hard-drive full of software<BR>
What's this lunacy?<BR>
All games and GIFs,<BR>
Still a man D/Ls what he wants to use,<BR>
And disregards the rest.
</P>
<P>
Ignoring my home<BR>
And my family,<BR>
I am no more than a toy,<BR>
In the clutches of hackers<BR>
In the humming of the carrier<BR>
Running scared,<BR>
Paying tolls,<BR>
Seeking out the multiline boards<BR>
Where the power users go,<BR>
Looking for the systems<BR>
Only they would know.
</P>
<P>
With an earring stands a user,<BR>
And a file-leech by his trade,<BR>
And he carries the reminders<BR>
Of every sysop who twitted him,<BR>
Or cut access till he cried out<BR>
In his anger and his shame,<BR>
"I am starting my own board."<BR>
But the user still remains.<BR>
</P>
<H3>
Bridge Over Troubled Routers<BR>
by The Twisted Pairs
</H3>
<P>
When you're bleary, the net is down.<BR>
When sleep is in your eyes, the pager goes off.<BR>
Who's on your side, when times get tough?<BR>
When backups can't be found,<BR>
Like a bridge over troubled routers<BR>
I will save your butt.<BR>
</P>
<P>
Like a bridge over troubled routers<BR>
I will save your butt.
</P>
<P>
When you're down and out,<BR>
When you're offline,<BR>
When throughput drops so hard<BR>
I will comfort you.<BR>
I'll take your part,<BR>
When downtime comes.
</P>
<P>
When blame is all around,<BR>
Like a bridge over troubled routers<BR>
I will save your butt.
</P>
<P>
That new net version,<BR>
Bring it up,<BR>
Your time has come to shine,<BR>
All your users on their way.<BR>
See how they smile.<BR>
If you need a break<BR>
I'm logging on right now.
</P>
<P>
Like a bridge over troubled routers<BR>
I will save your butt.<BR>
Like a bridge over troubled routers<BR>
I will save your butt.<BR>
</P>
<P>
Of course, most musically aware people remember The Twisted Pairs'
first big hit, the science fiction ballad, "You Can Call Me HAL".

Ten Very Forward<BR>
by Dave Bealer

This parody first appeared in the November 1994<BR> issue of 
<I>Random Access Humor</I>.)
</P>
</CENTER>
<P>
Acting Ensign Leslie Ann Musher was moping.  This was nothing new,
since Leslie was a teenager.  Even worse, he had a name that was
more effeminate than he was (which was not an easy accomplishment).
Gee.  Leslie was bad enough, but Ann?  What had his parents been
thinking?  They probably hadn't been thinking, as usual.  
</P>
<P>
Leslie's father didn't think much any more, being dead these many
years.   He had been killed in the line of duty, attempting to give
his captain's cat a bath.  What a hideous way to go, with your body
covered in wet cat hair.  Leslie hated cats, especially the stupid
one named "Snot" that belonged to the second officer, Lieutenant
Commander Object.
</P>
<P>
Eventually Leslie tired of scrolling through the latest digitally
stored issue of <I>Playbeing</I>, accessed through an account he had
hacked into months before.  Commander Spik'er would probably never
wise up to the increased usage.  The Deltan centerfold was quite
arousing, especially with the new "rub and sniff pheromone
simulation" technology.  Still...Leslie put on a bathing suit and 
skulked off to the Virtual Reality Deck to run his favorite program,
<I>Busty Beach Babes From Bayonne</I>.  He couldn't even remember which
planet Bayonne was on, not that it really mattered.  
</P>
<P>
Thirty minutes later Leslie padded back to his quarters, dripping
water on the deck.  "I thought the Captain warned you about that,
Les."  Leslie wheeled, startled.  The voice was familiar, but seemed
to be coming from behind and above him.
</P>
<P>
"Gordie?  Is that you?"  Leslie scanned the passage behind him, then
noticed an open service panel a few meters back along the ceiling.
</P>
<P>
Leslie's question was answered by a dark blur that dropped from the
open panel and sprawled itself on the deck.  "Uugh," noted Gordie as
he skidded to a stop.  "You were expecting, maybe, X?"  
</P>
<P>
Leslie walked over and offered his friend a hand getting up.  "Don't
even mention that bozo.  I'm so sick of him showing up and comparing
himself to 'the name brand' all-powerful aliens.  Doesn't he know
that stuff went out of style in the 1960s?"
</P>
<P>
Gordie grinned his trademark grin.  "Don't be so hard on him, Les.
At least he always loses to the name brand."  He busied himself with
a rag, removing the water that now streaked the back of his
synthleather jacket while Leslie rolled his eyes and sighed mightily.
Gordie sniffed the rag.  "Sea water?  Hangin' with the beach babes
again, huh, Les?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie blushed from the tips of his toes to the roots of his hair.
"Does everyone on this tub keep track of everything I do?" he whined
petulantly. 
</P>
<P>
"Just the embarrassing stuff."  Gordie chuckled and mussed Leslie's
hair. 
</P>
<P>
Leslie ducked away from Gordie's hand.  "That's not funny," he
muttered bitterly.
</P>
<P>
"Sorry Les."  A concerned look crossed Gordie's face.  Leslie missed
this, since the engineer's face was concealed by the brown paper bag
he customarily wore over his head. "'smatter, your sense of humor on
leave?"
</P>
<P>
"Nah.  I was just thinking..."
</P>
<P>
"About something <I>other</I> than those beach babes?"
</P>
<P>
"Maybe."  Leslie's blush deepened.  Since he had no intention of
telling anyone, even Gordie, what he has just been thinking about, he
decided to change the subject.  "So...what were you doin' up in the
ceiling?  Hiding from Captain Picardo again?"
</P>
<P>
Gordie snorted.  "No way!  We got that ironed out long ago.  That was
a straight medical physical your mother was giving me."
</P>
<P>
"Right!  Just like the ones she gives the captain every night, and
sometimes on Saturday afternoons."
</P>
<P>
"Now Les, nobody is supposed to know about that."
</P>
<P>
It was Leslie's turn to snort.  "Sure.  Anyone who's deaf, dumb and
blind doesn't know about it.  You'd think with all this technology
they could come up with bed frames that don't squeak..." 
</P>
<P>
"Les..."
</P>
<P>
"Forget it!"  Leslie felt suddenly embarrassed by his mother's
extracurricular activities.  "Alright then...what <i>were</i> you doing
up in the ceiling?"
</P>
<P>
"Checking the tachyon dispensers.  Since tachyons are capable of 
solving any problem, we have to make sure they're always available."
</P>
<P>
"But since we're a cruise ship now, why do we need those anyway?"
</P>
<P>
"Space is a dangerous place, Les.  Just because Starfleet sold the
<I>Enterprise</I> to Countess Cruise Lines due to downsizing doesn't 
mean that bad things can't happen to the ship."
</P>
<P>
Leslie was letting himself get agitated now.  "They took out the
photon torpedo bays and replaced them with jacuzzis.  And the phaser
banks are now a skeet shooting range!"
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, and they changed the ship's name from <I>Enterprise</I> to
<I>Ecstasy</I>.  What's your point?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie sighed, and rolled his eyes like he was talking to a small
child.  "The point is, there are now more Virtual Reality decks on
board than laboratories.  The main VR contractor has three
technicians permanently assigned to the ship.  What about our old
mission of exploration and research?"
</P>
<P>
"Wake up and smell the tribbles, Les!  Nobody cares about exploration
anymore.  All people care about is what makes them feel good <I>now</I>.
They don't care about tomorrow.  The pioneer spirit is dead."
</P>
<P>
"That's a pretty selfish attitude.  What about my generation, and
the ones to follow?"
</P>
<P>
"You'll figure out something, Les.  You guys are pretty smart...
not as smart as you think you are, but pretty smart.  Hey, you want 
<I>real</I> smart, check out those Nintendo technicians, they're all 
smart cookies.  That blonde with the spiked hair, what's her name?"
</P>
<P>
"Lisa." 
</P>
<P>
"Right, Lisa.  She may know virtual reality, but I bet she could show
you a thing or two about <I>real</I> reality as well."
</P>
<P>
"Puleease!  She's gotta be at least twenty-five!"
</P>
<P>
Gordie grinned knowingly.  "Older women can be fun, Les.  They know
things..."
</P>
<P>
Suddenly Leslie's communicator beeped.  "Ensign Musher, report to
sick bay, on the double!"
</P>
<P>
Leslie winced at the all-too-familiar voice.  He slapped the device
to enable transmit.  "Coming, mother."  He looked up at his grinning 
friend.  "Go ahead and smirk, LeStudd.  I may just ask Lisa out."
</P>
<P>
"If you won't, I will.  You better run along now..."
</P>
<P>
Leslie checked to make sure no one else was in the corridor, then
stuck his tongue out at Gordie as the engineer climbed back through
the ceiling panel to complete his inspection.  Although Leslie knew
it was an infantile gesture, he didn't particularly care at that
moment.  It made him feel better.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
"I'm waiting for an explanation, Leslie."  Dr. Cleverly Musher was
wearing an impatient expression on her face.  Leslie had categorized
over 300 expressions his mother's face was capable of displaying in
times of stress; everything from 'I am contemplating being mildly
irritated about this situation.' up to 'I am going to hurl you into a
supernova, without a spacesuit, or even sunblock, if you don't stop
that this instant!'.
</P>
<P>
Leslie finally decided this expression was about a 202 on the scale,
which was 'If you think you'll ever hear the end of this from me, you
have another think coming'.  He didn't see what the big deal was.
Those books had long been considered literature.  "I don't see what
the big deal is, Mom.  Those books were considered literature back
when <I>you</I> were sixteen."
</P>
<P>
"That's not the point and you know it.  And another thing, stop
saying 'when <I>I</I> was sixteen' like it was during the Paleolithic
Age."
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Mom.  It was just <I>The Story of O</I> and <I>Exit to Eden</I>.
They're both considered classics."
</P>
<P>
"Classic trash!  You might as well be reading William Burroughs, for
heaven's sake."
</P>
<P>
"I thought you didn't believe in heaven, Mom.  And who's this William
Burroughs?"  Leslie made a mental note to look up the name in <I>Books
Online</I>.
</P>
<P>
"Don't try to change the subject, young man.  We were talking about
these 'interests' you are developing.  As a physician, I know they
are only natural."
</P>
<P>
"So why are you giving me hormone blockers, and why do have I to
sleep in that stupid stasis-sleep box every night."
</P>
<P>
"That's for your own protection, Leslie.  And stop trying to change
the subject!  I thought you had a talk with Lt. Blorf about this last
week.  Didn't the rather spartan Klingon methods of dealing with...
shall we say, frustrations, appeal to you?"
</P>
<P>
"Hah!  Mom, do you know about the Klingon version of a cold shower?
It involves smashing your genitals with a spiked iron club."
</P>
<P>
"Really?  Blorf never would reveal how he received those injuries.
No wonder he's always so cranky.  Alright, that method is definitely
out."
</P>
<P>
Leslie breathed a deep sigh of relief.
</P>
<P>
Cleverly's eyes suddenly lit up.  "What about Counselor d'Troit?  She
might be able to help."
</P>
<P>
Leslie didn't believe that for a nanosecond.  On the other hand, he
never passed up a chance to spend time with the ship's counselor.  Of
course, Leslie was far more interested in her other on-board job than 
in her psychoanalytical abilities.  "Sure, Mom.  Anything you say."
</P>
<P>
Cleverly Musher, M.D. gave her only offspring a suspicious glance.
She wondered why he was suddenly so cooperative.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
Leslie sat in the counselor's waiting room.  He studiously ignored
the collection of paper magazines, most of which dated back to the
20th century, lying on a low table in the center of the small room.
His entire attention was focused on the poster on the opposite wall. 
</P>
<P>
The subject of Leslie's scrutiny was a standard glossy advertising
poster, about a meter high and nearly that wide, bearing words in
several languages and a picture in the center.  The top of the poster
read, 'Helen d'Troit: Enough beauty to launch at least one ship.'
Below the picture appeared the smaller legend, 'Alright, would you
believe a shuttlecraft?'  At the very bottom of the poster appeared
the larger words, 'Appearing nightly in the Lido Lounge, C.C.S.
<I>Ecstasy</I>.'  Leslie already knew these words by heart.  The real
subject of the youth's attention was the full color, tri-d picture of
the ship's counselor, clad only in pasties and a g-string.
</P>
<P>
Leslie shifted his legs uncomfortably.  He wore the most baggy pair
of trousers that could be worn with anything other than clown shoes.
Any other pants became most uncomfortable during his interviews with
Counselor d'Troit.  The worst part was that d'Troit didn't need to
see the state of his trousers to know exactly what he was thinking
every time he was near her.  It was very embarrassing.
</P>
<P>
Leslie's art appreciation was interrupted by the door to d'Troit's
inner office swooshing open.  It was not the counselor that emerged,
however, but Lt. Tar, the ship's chief of security.  The short, but
powerful, blonde officer's left arm was in a sling.  She noticed
Leslie staring at it.  "It's not that bad, Les.  Just a sprain."
</P>
<P>
"How did it happen?"
</P>
<P>
"'My favorite android' and I went slam dancing last night in the
Clapton Memorial Disco.  Object got a little carried away."
</P>
<P>
Leslie smirked, "Looks more like you got carried away, on a
stretcher!"
</P>
<P>
Tar blushed slightly, then laughed despite herself.  "Okay, smart
boy.  I bet you wouldn't be able to take your hands off your lap and
walk into d'Troit's office if you weren't wearing those clown pants."
</P>
<P>
Leslie's grin turned into a blush.  It occurred to him that he'd been
blushing quite a lot lately.  "They're not clown pants," Leslie
mumbled, exhibiting a sudden intense interest in the pattern on
d'Troit's waiting room floor.
</P>
<P>
"Right."  Tar headed for the outer office door.  "Don't worry, kid.
Helen's wearing her uniform today."
</P>
<P>
As the outer door closed behind Lt. Tar, the inner office door opened
again.  Helen d'Troit stood in the doorway and grinned at Leslie, who
had tremendous difficulty forcing himself not to stare at her
cleavage.  "Hello, Ensign Hormone Storm.  Come on in," she suggested 
seductively.  Of course, everything she did seemed seductive to
Leslie.  The furiously blushing youth followed her into the office, 
walking a little oddly despite his clown pants.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
"Everyone treats me like a clown...or maybe a performing dog,"
Leslie muttered to himself as he trudged towards the turbolift an
hour later.  The door swooshed open and he entered the lift, joining
two passengers that were already aboard.  "Bridge," Leslie ordered,
supremely glad that he followed d'Troit's advice and changed into
regular uniform trousers before going to see the captain.
</P>
<P>
The two young men (this was a singles cruise, Leslie remembered) got
off on deck five and immediately headed for unoccupied VR decks, the 
Nintendo logo glistening on their doors.  The turbolift doors closed
again and completed the trip to the bridge.  Leslie always got a lump
in his throat as the lift doors opened on the bridge.  He simply
couldn't shake the memory of his first visit here, when the captain
had nearly torn his head off for daring to enter His bridge.
</P>
<P>
A great deal had changed on the bridge since that fateful day.  The
tactical control station now controlled the hundreds of virtual
reality environments on board the ship.  The science station
controlled the swimming pools, tennis courts, and variable-gravity
sports venues.  
</P>
<P>
Monitors viewed all the action in the ship's casino.  Cheating was
rare considering the fact that Lt. Blorf, the bouncer, would not
hesitate to throw offenders not only out of the casino, but out of
the nearest convenient airlock into deep space.  His crankiness was
legendary among the gamblers of the quadrant.
</P>
<P>
One thing that hadn't changed was the center seat.  Well, it <i>was</i>
covered with sheepskin now - the real deal, too.  None of that
artificial stuff for the captain of Countess Cruise Lines' flagship.
</P>
<P>
Captain Ricardo Picardo hadn't changed that much.  He still exuded a
palpable aura of command that scared the hell out of Leslie.  The
expensive rug that topped his former chrome dome looked good, even if
it looked strange to those who knew him before he took to wearing it.
Leslie descended to the center of the bridge, facing the man in the
center seat.
</P>
<P>
Picardo looked up from the dog-eared Harold Robbins paperback he was
reading.  "Ensign?  What is it?"
</P>
<P>
"A flag flown by ancient maritime vessels, sir.  But that's not
important right now.  May I speak with you in private?"
</P>
<P>
Picardo sighed, but rose.  "Of course, I always have a few moments
for a member of the crew...even one with pimples."
</P>
<P>
Leslie gulped for air like a landed fish.  He soon recovered and
followed Picardo into his ready-or-not room.  Picardo walked over to
the nutrient replicator.  "Sangria, tepid."  The mechanism hummed.
Picardo took the resulting pitcher and sprawled on the lounge chair
behind his falsewood desk.  He filled a crystal glass, from which he
immediately took a big chug.  "Sit down, ensign.  What can I do for
you?" 
</P>
<P>
"I just saw Counselor d'Troit."
</P>
<P>
"In the Lido Lounge?  I thought you knew better than to go in there
again until you're at least eighteen?"
</P>
<P>
"No, sir.  I saw..."
</P>
<P>
"You don't know better?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie noticed a dangerous color building in the captain's face.
"No, sir.  I mean, yes, sir.  I do know better than to go into the
Lido Lounge again.  I saw Counselor d'Troit in her office."
</P>
<P>
Picardo relaxed.  "Well, that's different.  Go on."
</P>
<P>
"Counselor d'Troit gave me this."  Leslie handed the captain a neatly
folded piece of paper.
</P>
<P>
Picardo folded open the paper and read the note.  His eyebrows did a
quick Vulcan science officer impression.  "I take it your mother
doesn't know about this?"
</P>
<P>
"No, sir.  Counselor d'Troit thought it would be best for her not to
know."
</P>
<P>
"Really?"  Picardo's brow knitted in thought as he took another chug
of sangria.  "I suppose there's something to that.  Mothers do tend
to be unreasonable about these things where their sons are concerned.
Fathers, on the other hand, tend to overreact when it comes to their
daughters."
</P>
<P>
Leslie thought that mothers, or at least <i>his</i> mother, tended to be
unreasonable about most everything.  He decided to keep that opinion
to himself, especially considering how close the captain was to his
mother...almost every night.  "Yes, sir."
</P>
<P>
"The question is, do <i>you</i> think you're ready for this, Leslie?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie was momentarily stunned, since the captain had never referred 
to him by his first name before.  As to the question, Leslie had been
ready for this for years.  "Yes, sir!"
</P>
<P>
"Very well, ensign, you have your waiver."  Picardo returned
immediately to formal mode.  He signed the note and returned it the
eager hands of the acting ensign. "Enjoy."
</P>
<P>
"Thank you, sir!" Leslie grabbed the note and had to force himself to
not run from the room.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
Leslie straightened his best uniform tunic for the thousandth time.
He was so on edge that his nerve endings were practically outside his
body.  Destiny was just around the corner.  He steeled himself again
and marched around the corner, directly into the tank-like chest of
Commander Spik'er, the ship's executive officer.
</P>
<P>
"Whoa, Les!  What's the rush?"  Spik'er bent to help Leslie, who had
bounced off his chest and was sprawled on the floor.
</P>
<P>
"No rush, I just wasn't paying attention.  Sorry, sir."  He brushed
himself off and desperately tried to look nonchalant.
</P>
<P>
Spik'er shrugged off the apology.  "No big deal, pal."  He cocked his
head to one side.  "Gee, you're sure spiffed up.  Got a date
tonight?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie unsuccessfully tried to fight off the blush, "No sir, not
exactly." 
</P>
<P>
"Not exactly, eh?  Well...,"  Spik'er started to leave.  Suddenly he
stopped and eyed Leslie suspiciously.  "Wait a minute.  You're not
planning to try getting in there again, are you?"  He gestured
vaguely towards a mahogany covered doorway at the end of the hall.
</P>
<P>
"Well..."
</P>
<P>
"Come off it, Les.  You know that Guyaxy's people will never let you
in.  If you tick her off too badly, she won't let you in even when
you <I>are</I> old enough."
</P>
<P>
Leslie drew himself up to his full height, which came roughly to
Spik'er's sternum.  He offered the note to the Exec.  "This says I'm
old enough now, sir."
</P>
<P>
Spik'er took the paper, glared briefly at Leslie, then unfolded and
read the note.  He grunted.  "Signed by d'Troit and Picardo, eh?  Is
this on the level?"
</P>
<P>
"Yes, sir."  Leslie was becoming concerned that so many people were
finding out about this.
</P>
<P>
"You poor kid.  But do you think Guyaxy will buy this?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie stood with his hands clasped behind his back, poking at
nothing in particular with the toe of his right shoe.  He shrugged.
</P>
<P>
"Alright, come with me," said Spik'er, swaggering down the corridor
towards the ornate door.  He still had Leslie's note in his hand.
</P>
<P>
Leslie launched into his landed fish impression again as he hurried
after Spik'er.  "But sir," he gasped breathlessly, "I can handle this
myself!"
</P>
<P>
Spik'er grinned wickedly, "I thought the whole point of this exercise
was to not have to do that anymore?"
</P>
<P>
"Siirrr!" Leslie spluttered.  
</P>
<P>
"Don't worry, I'll get you in."  Spik'er stopped in front of the
mahogany door.  The genuine wooden covering clashed with the alloy
walls surrounding the portal.  The number "10" was carved into the
upper center of the wood, the numbers embossed in gold.  A brass door
knocker waited a half meter below the numbers.
</P>
<P>
"Sir!  I don't need..."  Leslie's protest was interrupted by Spik'er
firmly applying the brass knocker to the mahogany door.  The youth
began trying to compose himself and furiously straighten all his
clothing. 
</P>
<P>
For a few moments nothing happened.  The nervous youth stood next to
Spik'er, who appeared the be swaggering even while standing still.
Leslie often wondered how he managed to do that.
</P>
<P>
A loud click emanated from the door, which swung in to the left.
This was obviously an old-style, hinged door.  A male Vulcan opened
the door wide, waving the two humans inside.  Leslie was astounded by
the odd furnishings of the room they now entered.  He searched his
memory for a name to attach to the obviously ancient style of
interior decor.
</P>
<P>
Leslie's musings were interrupted by two simultaneous events: he
caught sight of a pair of Borg seated on a frilly couch at the far
end of the room; and the nattily dressed doorbeing, having closed the
antique door, turned and addressed the newcomers.  "Good evening,
gentlemen," the Vulcan politely intoned, "Welcome to Ten Very
Forward, the best little whore house in..."
</P>
<P>
"Wait!" a dignified, authoritarian voice called from across the room.
The two humans turned to face the source of the interruption, an
older Vulcan in a tuxedo who strode purposefully towards them.
</P>
<P>
Spik'er grinned at the approaching Vulcan.  "Saran, good to see you
again..." 
</P>
<P>
"Can the small talk, Spik'er!  You still owe us four month's pay.  I
told you not to show your face here again until your account was
current.  And as a Vulcan, I was not amused by your attempt to get in
here last week wearing a mask!"
</P>
<P>
"Come on, Saran.  A man has needs.  Besides, are you sure all those
charges are really mine?  Someone has been running up my <I>Playbeing</I>
account something awful."  Spik'er was quite vexed.  Leslie's stomach
began doing somersaults, but he kept a neutral expression on his face. 
</P>
<P>
"Your 'needs' could short out all the VR decks on this ship, not to
mention our entire staff.  Our accounting is most meticulous, as you
well know.  Your other problems are strictly your own.  I have no
time for this.  Get out."  The Vulcan's tone was very matter-of-fact.
</P>
<P>
"Hold on, Saran.  As it turns out, I'm not here for me.  My friend
here is the customer tonight."  Spik'er gestured towards Leslie.
</P>
<P>
Saran eyed Leslie narrowly.  "You look a little young.  Let's see
some ID."  Leslie sighed and reached for his ID card.  He was glad
that he didn't look in real life like any of the disguises he had
used in previous attempts to gain entrance to this place.
</P>
<P>
"Hold it, Saran," interrupted Spik'er.  He offered the folded paper
to the Vulcan.  "Take a look at this first."
</P>
<P>
The Vulcan took the paper carefully out of the Spik'er's hand, almost
as if he was expecting the human to be wearing a hand buzzer.  He
quickly read the contents, and his left eyebrow arched in the manner
of his race when showing surprise.  "Is this some kind of trick?"
</P>
<P>
"No tricks, Saran," Spik'er assured him.  "I'll vouch for both those
signatures.  They're genuine."
</P>
<P>
"Very well, I'll take this to Madame.  The decision is hers.  Have a
seat, gentlemen."  Saran turned and exited the room through an ornate
wooden framed passageway.
</P>
<P>
Leslie and Spik'er sat on a pair of overstuffed chairs in the waiting
room.  After a half minute Leslie broke the silence, "that guy is a
little cold."
</P>
<P>
Spik'er chuckled.  "Don't mind Saran, he just gets wrapped up in his
work." 
</P>
<P>
Leslie slumped back in his chair.  Suddenly two questions occurred to
him.  One seemed more urgent, since the subjects were still sitting
patiently across the room.  "Sir, what are Borg doing here?" he
whispered. 
</P>
<P>
Spik'er leaned towards Leslie, covering his mouth and whispering,
"they're flocking here these days.  Guyaxy has the only HP ProbeJet
in the quadrant."
</P>
<P>
"HP ProbeJet?"
</P>
<P>
"Yes."  Spik'er slipped into his best holovid announcer's voice, "The
latest in automata pleasure devices."
</P>
<P>
"I see.  And why are all the employees here Vulcans?  I wouldn't have
expected them to be working in a place like this."
</P>
<P>
"People need jobs, Les.  After the Cardasians started worshipping
Elvis and the Borg went condo, all the interstellar governments
started to downsize their defense fleets.  You remember how 'The Big
E' became a cruise ship?  Well, the Vulcans, despite their peace-
loving reputation, turned out to be the biggest defense contractors 
in the galaxy.  A lot of them are out of work now, so they pop up in 
the strangest places."
</P>
<P>
"Okay," Leslie's brow furrowed.  "But why is Guyaxy hiring them?  I
wouldn't think they'd be that well suited to the work here."
</P>
<P>
Spik'er chuckled again.  "Guyaxy may be dignified and all that, but
she's cheap too.  She only has to give the Vulcans freebies once
every seven years."
</P>
<P>
"Oh, yeah.  I hadn't thought of that."
</P>
<P>
"Guyaxy did.  She never misses a trick."  At that both humans
erupted into such gales of laughter that even the Borg took notice
for a few picoseconds.
</P>
<P>
Eventually Leslie was forced to stop laughing or wet himself. Luckily 
he had the presence of mind to stop laughing.  As he wiped the tears 
from his eyes, he was glad for the release of tension.  Leslie soon
noticed that while he and Spik'er had been immersed in mirth, Saran 
had reentered the room, accompanied by two very large Vulcans.
</P>
<P>
"If you're quite through amusing yourselves," the tuxedo clad Vulcan
began seriously, "we can get on with this."  The two spent humans rose
from their chairs.  "Ensign, you will accompany me.  Madame Guyaxy
wishes to speak with you.  Commander, you will leave.  Now."
</P>
<P>
Leslie watched, speechless, as the two Vulcans with Saran grabbed
Spik'er and bodily threw him, kicking and cursing, out the front
door.  The doorbeing, who had opened that portal in anticipation of
this operation, closed it again, cutting off Spik'er's expression of
outrage.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
"So, ensign, exactly how long has this been going on?"  
</P>
<P>
"Ma'am?"  Leslie was having tremendous trouble looking Guyaxy in the
face.  Not that it was an ugly face, or anything.  It was her eyes.
They seemed to see right through his skin into his soul.  If you
looked directly into them, they seemed to be bottomless wells.  All
the knowledge in the universe, especially erotic knowledge, seemed to
be contained (just barely) in those wells.
</P>
<P>
"How long has your mother been making you sleep in that stasis box?" 
</P>
<P>
"Since I was twelve."  Guyaxy's office fascinated Leslie.  It was
furnished in the same ornate style as the waiting room, with real
wooden furniture that must have cost a bundle.
</P>
<P>
"I see.  And that was how many years ago?"
</P>
<P>
"Six years.  But since I don't age during the eights hours each night
I spend in stasis-sleep, my body has only aged four years."
</P>
<P>
"So your mental age is eighteen, but your physical age is sixteen?"
</P>
<P>
"Yes, ma'am."  Leslie finally remembered the term applied to Ten Very
Forward's style of interior decor.  It was called Victorian.
</P>
<P>
"I understand that the mothers of many races become upset at how
quickly their children grow up.  This is the first case I've seen in
all my long years where a mother has actually taken steps to slow the
process.  How did she get away with it?"
</P>
<P>
Leslie was amused by the question. "Easy, she's the chief surgeon on
a starship.  Plus, she invented the stasis-sleep technology.  She
claimed to be 'testing' it on me all this time."
</P>
<P>
"An interesting situation."  Guyaxy appeared lost in thought, an even
further away look in her eyes, her gloved hands pressed together in
an attitude some beings reserved for prayer.
</P>
<P>
Leslie couldn't help thinking of the rumors that circulated
throughout the ship about this mysterious alien.  Some said Guyaxy
wore clothing that covered everything except her face because she had
a lizard's body.  That didn't make sense to Leslie.  He didn't know
what she really was, but it occurred to him, sitting there in her
presence, that there really <I>were</I> things that people were better
off not knowing.
</P>
<P>
Guyaxy's hands separated.  She seemed to have come to a decision.
"Very well.  I would like to speak with your mother about her new
technology at her earliest convenience.  Meanwhile, since mental
capacity is the most important aspect of consent, you are accepted as
a client of Ten Very Forward."
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
Leslie was as bewildered as he ever hoped to be.  Seated in an ornate
Victorian drawing room nestled deep in Ten Very Forward, he mused
over the events of the past few minutes.  
</P>
<P>
Whisked from Madame Guyaxy's office by Saran, Leslie underwent a
quick, but thorough, medical scan.  "Just to make sure you're
healthy," Saran assured him.  "We can't afford any accidents here."
</P>
<P>
Next came the questions.  Gender?  Species?  Not even race...species?
Leslie fancied himself as having a wild imagination.  There were even
moments when he felt himself to be...perverted.  Leslie was surprised
by these feelings, even though he was intelligent enough to recognize
them as mere alternatives, not as the perversions they were once thought
to be.  Still, the options being offered here boggled Leslie's mind.
</P>
<P>
At least the initial selections were made from holovid recordings.
Saran wanted him to select two or three for the actual interview, but
when he saw her holovid, the choice was clear.  Now Leslie sat
waiting for her, his nerves so brittle he felt like a china doll...
like the slightest touch could cause him to shatter into a hundred
pieces.  
</P>
<P>
A door opened.  Leslie sprang out of his chair like a jack-in-the-
box.  He silently cursed himself for being a childish idiot.  Then he
saw her.  
</P>
<P>
She wore a blue dress that went dreamily with both her spiked blonde
hair and her squash-colored skin.  She closed the door and seemed to
glide across the room.  "Hi there.  I remember seeing you around the
ship."  Her voice was curiously high pitched.
</P>
<P>
Leslie's mouth was suddenly bone dry.  He tried to swallow.  "Hi," he
nearly croaked, "it's good to meet you finally."  What a stupid thing
to say!  "I thought you worked for Nintendo?"  Even better!  Way to
go, genius!
</P>
<P>
Lisa smiled engagingly.  "I do work for 'the big N.'  I just
moonlight here."
</P>
<P>
"I see.  I'm Leslie Musher, by the way."
</P>
<P>
"Lisa Simpson."  She reached out and took Leslie's hand.  He stared
at her hand, surprised at the sensation.  "You ever meet a toon
before, Leslie?"
</P>
<P>
"N..no," Leslie stammered.  "Are you really real?"
</P>
<P>
"Real enough for <i>you</i>, big boy!"  Lisa embraced Leslie and kissed him.
Leslie saw stars.  He couldn't tell if they were toon stars or real
ones.  He decided it didn't matter.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rah96bar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
Late in the ship's night Leslie limped out of Ten Very Forward.  He
headed back to his quarters, exhausted but content.  He softly sang
an old Earth song, "Poor, Poor, Pitiful Me."

A Matter of Life (and Death) Support...<BR>

<P>
Losing anti-matter containment.  Containment field failure in 30 seconds.
</P>
<P>
Any options?
</P>
<P>
No, sir.  We must jettison the warp core.
</P>
<P>
Do it.
</P>
<P>
Core jettisoned, sir.
</P>
<P>
Damage report.
</P>
<P>
Primary power systems inoperative.  Weapons systems inoperative.
Defensive shields inoperative, navigational shields only.  Several
substantial hull breaches.  Only 22% of crew stations reported
personed and ready.  Life support nominal.  Operating on battery
power only.  Communications almost restored.  Slowing to sub-light
speed.
</P>
<P>
Damn. I was hoping we would make it to the starbase.  What is our
ETA?
</P>
<P>
Sir,...
</P>
<P>
Science officer, report.  Everyone on the bridge is a Star Fleet
officer and we can face facts.  What is our ETA?
</P>
<P>
Sir, we have lost all propulsion systems and are travelling on
momentum alone.  Given our current velocity, my calculations place us
at the starbase in approximately 47.242 years.  Life support and all 
power systems will be exhausted in 27.842 years.
</P>
<P>
Hmmm....  Who operates the starbase?
</P>
<P>
The Bureaucrati, sir.
</P>
<P>
Bureaucrati?  I thought they were denied admission into the
Federation.
</P>
<P>
They were, sir.  This starbase was donated to the Federation as an
example of their technological competence.  The base is completely
manned by Bureaucrati.
</P>
<P>
As I recall they were judged as technically competent, but there was
some other reason why they were refused membership.  Any data on
that?
</P>
<P>
No, sir.  Only that all contact teams were required to spend several
months on Eroticon III recovering.  Sir, engineering reports
communications restored. 
</P>
<P>
Thank goodness for that.  Open a channel to the starbase.
</P>
<P>
Open, sir.
</P>
<P>
Bureaucrati Starbase, this the USS Bismarck.  We are heavily damaged
and have lost all propulsion and navigation systems.  We are
proceeding at best speed...
</P>
<P>
[Welcome to the Bureaucrati starbase support line.  We hope that we
can be of assistance to you.]
</P>
<P>
Uh..., thank you.  This is the USS Bismarck.  We have sustained heavy
damage...
</P>
<P>
[If you have opened a channel just to be friendly, press 1 now.  If
you...]
</P>
<P>
What the...?
</P>
<P>
Sir, I believe you are speaking to some sort of recorded message.
</P>
<P>
What the...?  A recorded message?  Who would have a recorded
message...?
</P>
<P>
[...If you need to hear the selections again, press # now.]
</P>
<P>
What?  What was that?  Now we've missed it.  Quiet, everyone.
Communications officer, press #.
</P>
<P>
Aye, sir, # pressed.
</P>
<P>
[If you have opened a channel just to be friendly, press 1 now.  If
you are a Ferengi vessel and are attempting to swindle us out of yet
another starbase, press 2 now.  If you are the Borg and are
attempting to assimilate the known universe, press 3 now.  If you are
a starship that has been heavily damaged press 4 now.  If you are
interested in tourist information for the Gamma quadrant...]
</P>
<P>
Communications officer, press 4.
</P>
<P>
Aye, aye, sir.  4 pressed.
</P>
<P>
[Thank you.  If the entire crew is dead, press 1 now.  If you no
longer have life support, press 2 now.  If the ship has been damaged
because you made Q angry, press 3 now, but we are required by law to
inform you that the nosy, meddlesome busybody will know that you have
called us.  If your ship is currently adrift or you no longer have
navigational control of your vessel, press 4 now.  If your weapon
systems are firing in an indiscriminate manner...]
</P>
<P>
Communications officer, 4 again.
</P>
<P>
Aye, sir, 4 pressed.
</P>
<P>
[Thank you.  All of our emergency ship rescue consultants are busy
right now, but if you please wait, a consultant will be on line as
soon as one is available.  Thank you for your patience.  (William
Shatner's rendition of "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" begins to play
softly in the background.)]
</P>
<P>
<i>What is going on here?</i> Don't they realize how dire our situation is
here?  How long do they think they can keep us on hold like...
</P>
<P>
[We regret any inconvenience caused by this little delay.  We take
pride in our service and realize your time is valuable.  We will
connect you to the next available service consultant.  (Barry
Manilow's "I Write the Songs" begins playing in the background.)]
</P>
<P>
How do we get someone's attention?  We have to break out of this hold
and somehow get someone's attention...
</P>
<P>
[While you are waiting we would like to take this opportunity to make
you aware of some of the fantastic services available at our
starbases throughout this sector.  Consider a Bureaucrati starbase
for your next shore leave.  Holodecks are available, at a minimal
charge, to all...]
</P>
<P>
<i>Aaaah!</i> How long does this go on for?  We only have 27.842 years of
life support left.
</P>
<P>
[...indoor plumbing.  We would also like to take this opportunity to
dissuade any of the more cynical races of the galaxy from thinking
we are deliberately keeping you on hold to advertise our other
services.  We sincerely regret any inconvenience caused by this
delay.  We will be with you shortly.]

<P>
Four TORS and seven Queries ago our programmers brought forth on this
mainframe a new program, conceived in COBOL, and dedicated to the
transaction that all users should be serviced equally. 
</P>
<P>
Now we are engaged in a great regression, testing whether that
program or any program so compiled and so debugged can long process.
We are met on a great SYSUDUMP of that regression.  We have come to
dedicate a portion of that listing, as a final resting place for
those who gave their sanity that that program might run.  It is
altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.
</P>
<P>
But, in a larger partition, we cannot wait, we cannot process, we
cannot swap this address space.  These brave transactions, running
and suspended, who struggled here, have processed it, far beyond our
poor instruction to add or subtract.  The system log will little
note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never abend what
they did here.  It is for us, the raving, rather, to be committed to
an institution while they who watched us are nobly promoted to
management.  It is rather for us to be here dispatched to the active
task remaining in the queue - that from these suspended tasks we take
increased CPU cycles for that task for which they gave the last full
page of real storage - that we here highly resolve that these
suspended shall not have swapped in vain - that this program, under
MVS, shall have a new burst of throughput - and that applications of
the region, by the region, and for the region, shall not abend from
the system.

Welcome to the FidoNet Olympics<BR>
by Dave Bealer<BR>
(formerly 1:261/1129)<BR>
</H2>
<P>
This parody first appeared in the August 10, 1992 issue of <i>FidoNews</i>.
It also appeared in the September 1992 issue of <i>Random Access Humor</i>.
Dave would like to thank Tom Jennings (who was the editor of <i>FidoNews</i>
in 1992) for publishing this article, Dave's very first humor publication.
Dave is less pleased with Tom's decision to cease publishing humor in 
<i>FidoNews</i>. Said decision led Dave to fall into electronic publishing
(backwards, and in a most undignified manner).

<P> 
The echoes are kind of quiet these days.  Maybe everyone is glued
to the Olympics Triplecast.  For those of us who aren't, why not have
our own Olympics on FidoNet?  Here is a summary of suggested events:
</P>
<H3>
Local BBS Events
</H3>
<P>
<b>14.4K Protocol Negotiation</b><BR>
The winner is the first user who can stay awake during the entire 
protocol negotiation sequence between a V.32bis modem and a tin can.
</P>
<P>
<b>110-step Registration Hurdles</B><BR>
The gold medal goes to the user who completes the "simple" 
registration procedure in the shortest time.  Contestants are advised
not to wear glasses or contacts while competing in this event, as
they might interfere with the online laser retina scan.
</P>
<P>
<b>Modern Hexadecimalon</b><br>
Competitors attempt to break 16 different FidoNet policies and/or
draconian local sysop rules in a single logon session.
</P>
<P>
<b>Download Ratio Balance Beam</b><br>
Users attempt daring massive downloads without (hopefully) losing
their download privileges.

RAH Humor Review:<BR>
<i>Last Action Hero</i><BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the September 1994 issue of <i>Random Access
Humor</i>.
</P>
<H3>
Copyright &#169; 1994 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
Here we go again.  What's this guy doing, reviewing a Schwarzenegger
film as humor?  Well, I'll tell you...it's funny!
</P>
<P>
Arnold Schwarzenegger is probably the most successful action movie
star of the past decade.  Body count movies make money, and Arnold's
are arguably among the best of the genre.  In an ideal world Arnold
could go on making these hyper-violent flicks until he ends up old
and in a wheelchair - Ironside with a Austrian accent.  
</P>
<P>
The trouble is the political correction movement.  Liberals are
trying to blame all the world's crime problems on television and
movie violence.  This is complete and utter bovine fecal matter, but
that is a discussion for another article.  The point is that Congress
is putting a great deal of pressure on Hollywood to make less violent
films.  Movie industry executives are making at least a token effort
to tone things down before laws are passed to dictate movie content.
One of the first of these tokens is <i>Last Action Hero</i>.  The bad news
is most of the movies resulting from this trend won't be this good.
</P>
<P>
Directed by John McTiernan, whose previous hits include <i>Die Hard</i>,
this film takes campy movie parodies to a new height.  One of the
reasons is the presence of actual action stars in the movie.  Besides
Arnold himself, the film features cameos by Sly Stallone, Jean-Claude
Vann Damme, Sharon Stone, and Robert Patrick.  Along the way it makes
fun of every action movie from <i>Hamlet</i> to <i>E.T.</i>
</P>
<P>
<i>Last Action Hero</i> subscribes to the theory of fiction having its own
internal reality.  Heinlein fans will recognize this from the science
fiction master's later novels.  Newcomer Austin O'Brien plays eleven-
year-old New Yorker Danny Madigan, who is magically transported to
Los Angeles.  In particular, a Los Angeles that exists only inside
the latest Schwarzenegger film, <i>Jack Slater IV</i>.  Given the fact
that their world is real enough to them, Jack and the other on-screen
cops display superhuman patience with this obviously insane child who
thinks they're in a movie...and knows a shocking amount about their
private lives.
</P>
<P>
People who are allergic to puns will want to avoid this movie like
the plague.  One of the climaxes is triggered by the most horrendous
situational pun ever committed to celluloid.  Most of the other puns
in the movie are on a par with typical Schwarzenegger fare.
</P>
<P>
What really makes this film enjoyable is the way it pokes fun at
movie conventions and unrealities.  Jack's LAPD headquarters features
valet parking and police women in skin-tight latex suits (which are
excellent for sneaking up on bad guys).  This mythical police force
includes Whiskers, an animated cat (with the voice of Danny DeVito),
and "the black and white digitalization of Humphrey Bogart."
</P>
<P>
A 1993 movie that bombed at the box office (due to the experimental
low body count for an "Ahnold" film), <i>Last Action Hero</i> has a witty
screenplay written by Shane Black and David Arnott.  The cast, which
includes F. Murray Abraham (the man who killed "Moe Zart"), Robert
Prosky, Charles Dance, Frank McRae, Mercedes Ruehl, Anthony Quinn,
Art Carney, Professor Toru Tanaka, and Sir Ian McKellen, does an
excellent job.  Anyone who missed this movie because of the bad
reviews made a "big mistake."

RAH Humor Review:<BR>
More Python Alumni Tapes<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the April 1994 issue of <i>Random Access
Humor</i>.
</P>

Apparently someone has figured out that virtually any video tape
featuring one or more of the Monty Python troop is guaranteed to sell
at least 100,000 copies.  Two more such tapes have been acquired by
yours truly in the past month.  After viewing these latest attempts
at squeezing bucks out of any stray scrap of film containing one or
more of the Python boys, I find myself fervently hoping that no
cameras were rolling during Graham Chapman's briss.
</P>
<H3>
The Strange Case of the End of Civilization As We Know It
</H3>
<P>
Featuring John Cleese as Arthur Sherlock Holmes, a bumbling, modern-day 
descendant of the famous detective. Connie Booth plays Mrs. Hudson, and 
several well known performers (e.g. Denholm Elliot) also appear, although 
it's a safe bet none of them list this turkey on their resume. One (sort 
of) redeeming feature: the absolute worse Kojak impression in the history 
of the genre.  "Who loves ya, baby?"  In the case of this tape, precisely 
no one.
</P>
<H3>
Romance With A Double Bass
</H3>
<P>
Based on a short story by Anton Chekhov, this one actually isn't that bad.
John Cleese plays Smichkoff, a double bass player whose clothes are swiped 
while he's skinny dipping. Connie Booth, a princess, suffers the same fate.
The naked Cleese gallantly carries her back to the palace in his double 
bass case.  Major redeeming feature: a couple of full frontal nude shots of 
Connie Booth (circa mid-1970s).  Major drawback: a nude John Cleese. (Feel 
free to reverse these feature/drawback judgments as desired.)  Although 
strained at times, at least this one has an innately funny premise at
its core.
</P>
<P>
Both tapes were released by White Star Films.

RAH Humor Review:<BR>
<i>Robin Hood - Men In Tights</i><BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the August 1993 issue of <i>Random Access
Humor</i>.
</P>

<P>
Scene 1:  (Whitehall, Pennsylvania - Summer 1974)
A pair of high school chess nerds go to the West End Drive-In Theater
to see <i>The Thief Who Came to Dinner</i>, which was supposed to have
chess woven into the plot.  A powerful thunder storm keeps them from
seeing that film.  Their disappointment was considerably reduced by
the fact that they had thoroughly enjoyed the second feature, which
was shown first as per the custom of the time and place.  That second 
feature was <i>Blazing Saddles</i>, the hilarious sendup of Western movies 
by the incomparable Mel Brooks.
</P>
<P>
Scene 2:  (Kansas City, Missouri - Summer 1987)
One of those chess nerds grew up to be a computer nerd and would-be
humorist.  Thirteen years later I have yet to see the entire movie,
<i>The Thief Who Came to Dinner</i>, although I have seen the last few
minutes of it on television.  Conversely, I have seen <i>Blazing
Saddles</i> dozens of times and enjoyed it immensely each time.  The
good news is that I only suffered from an oxygen-deprivation headache
from laughing too hard that first time I saw it.  
</P>
<P>
Oddly, Mel Brooks hit his peak in 1974, the year both his best films
(<i>Blazing Saddles</i> and <i>Young Frankenstein</i>) were released.
Although his films since then are well worth seeing (especially 
<i>History of the World - Part I</i>), he never again achieved the 
inspired lunacy of his two masterworks.  Hope springs eternal, of course, 
especially among the fans of great artists.  We may know that our hero is 
past his prime, but we keep supporting his new stuff anyway in the hope
that he may yet find a way to reach new heights. 
</P>
<P>
So one hot Friday afternoon I ventured into the Crown Center Mall and
caught a matinee of <i>Spaceballs</i>.  Why not?  I can never sleep in the
afternoon before an overnight software install, especially while on
the road.  <i>Spaceballs</i> was definitely not a new height for Mel Brooks.
In fact I was quite disappointed with the movie after that first screening.
The movie has since grown on me (like a tumor) despite the presence
of Rick Moranis, one of my least favorite comedy actors. 
</P>
<P>
Scene 3:  (Pasadena, Maryland - Summer 1993)
The would-be humorist is now a practicing amateur humorist with an
international (and completely demented) following.  He decides it
would be interesting to provide a review of a comedy movie before the
movie closes in first-run theaters.  Selecting the latest work by
his idol, Mel Brooks, our hero ventures into Marley Station Mall to
catch a matinee of <i>Robin Hood: Men in Tights</i>. 
</P>
<P>
This movie is a parody of the Robin Hood movies, which are sort of a
genre all to themselves.  The principal target is Kevin Costner's
recent rendition, which desperately wanted lampooning in any case.
The opening is great, and will be especially appreciated by anyone
who ever wanted to hear the phrase "Hey Nonny, Nonny" in a rap song.
</P>
<P>
Cary Elwes does a creditable job as Robin Hood, but his performance
is just a pale reflection of his work in <i>The Princess Bride</i>.
Elwes seems to do better with subtle humor, which is not a likely part 
of a Mel Brooks movie.
</P>
<P>
Richard Lewis portrays a neurotic Prince John, typecasting if ever
there was such a thing.  My first impression is that this guy does
not have a big future as an actor.
</P>
<P>
Mel Brooks is a scream as Rabbi Tuckman, purveyor of sacramental wine
and circumcisions.  Dom DeLuise has a riotous cameo as Don Giovani,
the godfather associate of the Sheriff of Rottingham.  Of the
newcomers in the cast, the most energetic is Dave Chappelle as
Ahchoo, Robin's Moorish companion and martial arts partner.  Mark
Blankfield has a hilarious turn as Blinkin, Robin's blind servant.
If you want to know the identity of the world famous English actor
who takes the de rigueur cameo as King Richard, you'll just have to
go see the movie.
</P>
<P>
<i>Blazing Saddles</i> it isn't, but it sure beats <i>Spaceballs</i>.

RAH Humor Review:<BR>
The <i>M*A*S*H</i> Novels<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the November 1994 issue of <i>Random Access
Humor</i>.

<P>
In 1968 the United States seemed to be flipping it's collective lid.
It was a year of riots and assassinations at home, meanwhile young
Americans were laying down their lives in the jungles of Southeast
Asia.  In the midst of this insanity came an appropriately insane
novel, one that recalled the exploits of some other young Americans,
from the previous generation, who served in another Asian land war
that wasn't officially a war.
</P>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H</i>, by Richard Hooker, recounts the exploits of the surgeons,
nurses, and support staff of a Mobile Army Surgical Hospital (MASH)
during the Korean War.  The novel was well received, being compared
by reviewers to that classic novel of military insanity, <i>Catch-22</i>.
In fact <i>M*A*S*H</i> would go on to surpass <i>Catch-22</i> in commercial
success, inspiring a hit movie, and even bigger hit television series.
</P>
<P>
The motion picture <i>M*A*S*H</i> was released in 1970, and starred Donald
Sutherland, Elliott Gould, Tom Skerritt, Sally Kellerman, and Robert Duvall. 
I first saw the movie that summer at a drive-in theater with my parents. I 
loved it! It was funny and poked fun at authority; just the kind of thing to 
appeal to a twelve-year-old. My mother was quite upset by the film, although 
she claimed to be more bothered by the blood in the surgical scenes than by 
the dialogue, which included several words I would have been slapped for 
saying myself.
</P>

Within a few years a hit situation comedy based on the novel and
movie was developed by Larry Gelbart.  It ran for eleven years, and
made stars out of Alan Alda, Wayne Rogers, Loretta Swit, Mike
Farrell, David Ogden Stiers, Gary Burghoff, Jamie Farr, and virtually
everyone who landed a major role in the show.  A top-ten rated series
for most of its original run, <i>M*A*S*H</i> is still a popular resident
of syndication, and is well known to most people. 
</P>
<P>
Rather less well known is the fact that Richard Hooker, who did not
participate in the production of either the movie or the TV series,
went on to write several sequels to the original novel.  I found some
of them in used book stores starting in the late 1970s.
</P>
<P>
It should be noted that these books continue the characters as
developed in the original novel, on which the movie was based, and
have nothing whatever to do with the TV series.  This means that if
your only exposure to M*A*S*H has been through the sitcom, you really
need to read the original <i>M*A*S*H</i> novel and <i>M*A*S*H Goes To 
Maine</i> before starting any of the others.  As a single example of the
inconsistencies, the TV Hawkeye was an only child whose father was a
physician.  Hawkeye as presented in these novels is from a large 
family, the brood of a Maine lobsterman.
</P>
<H3>
M*A*S*H Goes To Maine
</H3>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H Goes To Maine</i>, by Richard Hooker, was published in
hardcover by William Morrow in February 1972.  The Pocket Book
paperback reprint came out in January 1973.  This books picks up the
tale of Hawkeye Pierce shortly after his return from Korea.  After
passing his general surgical boards, Hawkeye is persuaded by Trapper
John to move to the New York City area for a couple of years and
complete his residency in thoracic surgery.  Hawkeye turns down an
invitation to become a part of the "Cardia Nostra," the big league of
heart surgeons to which Trapper belongs.  Instead he returns to Maine,
there to reside in Crabapple Cove while becoming the top surgeon in
nearby Spruce Harbor.  By the end of the book Hawkeye manages to lure
the rest of the inmates of "The Swamp" to Spruce Harbor where they
continue their madcap antics.  Oddly, one of the best chapters in
this screwball comedy is the serious, tear-jerking tale of Hawkeye's
attempts to save the life of Jonas "Moose" Lord, a lobsterman who had
been a friend to every kid growing up in Crabapple Cove for years
(including the young Hawkeye). 
</P>
<P>
The rest of these novels were cowritten by Richard Hooker and William
E. Butterworth.  They were published as paperbacks by Pocket Books.
They all have advertising language on their covers relating them to
the M*A*S*H TV series, although (as mentioned) they having nothing to
do with that show.  The sitcom *was* one of the most popular shows on
the air when these novels were published, which explains everything.
</P>
<H3>
M*A*S*H Goes To New Orleans
</H3>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H Goes To New Orleans</i> was released in January 1975. In this
story, Hawkeye is drugged by his loving wife and spirited to New Orleans 
by Trapper John. The idea is to get Hawkeye well out of the way while his 
fourth child is born, since he was driving everyone nuts. While in New 
Orleans, our heroes try desperately to avoid attending any convention 
sessions of the American Tonsil, Adenoid and Vas Deferens Society (Francis 
Burns, M.D. - Public Affairs Vice President). By several extraordinary 
coincidences (read: plot devices), a few other 4077 alumni are staying in 
the same hotel. These include Hot Lips, Father (now Archbishop) John Mulcahy,
and Jean-Pierre "Horsey" de la Chevaux, a former infantry sergeant whose 
leg was once saved at the 4077th MASH. Horsey, now a petroleum millionaire, 
is a regular inhabitant of these novels.  He's usually accompanied by his 
comrades, the drunken members of the Bayou Perdu Council, Knights of Columbus. 
</P>
<H3>
M*A*S*H Goes To Paris
</H3>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H Goes To Paris</i> was also released in January 1975.  The
French government is giving out awards, and the recipients include 
Radar O'Reilly, mid-western fast food tycoon, and Hot Lips, who is
now a religious leader.  A new regular character introduced here is
Boris Korsky-Rimsakov, a world renown opera singer whose life was
once saved at a certain MASH unit in Korea (what a convenient, and
oft used, plot device).
</P>
<H3>
M*A*S*H Goes To London
</H3>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H Goes To London</i> was released in June 1975.  England may
never recover from the visit of the 4077 alumni.  The aristocracy of
two continents are hammered in this book, which features the presence
of a U.S. Secretary of State with a thick German accent.  I wonder who 
that is supposed to be?
</P>
<H3>
M*A*S*H Goes To Las Vegas
</H3>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H Goes To Las Vegas</i> was released in January 1976. This story
revolves around the activities of the mysterious "Matthew Q. Framingham 
Theosophical Foundation," of which Hawkeye Pierce is a long time member.  
It features Radar's wedding at Nero's Villa.
</P>
<H3>
M*A*S*H Goes To Vienna
</H3>
<P>
<i>M*A*S*H Goes To Vienna</i> was released in June 1976.  The Swamp Rats
and a good portion of the new characters from <i>M*A*S*H Goes To London</i> 
descend on the home of wiener schnitzel.  The heavily accented Secretary of 
State makes another appearance.
</P>
<P>
These novels are not, in general, great literature.  They make good
light entertainment, though.  If you like parodies of politicians,
the medical profession, Hollywood, opera, and religion (which is
redundant, given the other items on the list) you should enjoy these
novels.  The above list of M*A*S*H novels is not complete.  These are
the ones I own so far.  I'm still combing used book stores for the
records of the M*A*S*H gang's journeys to: Hollywood, Miami, Texas,
Montreal, Morocco, and San Francisco.

RAH Humor Review:<BR>
<i>The Liar</i><BR>
by Dave Bealer

Stephen Fry is best known as a comic actor.  He appeared as Melchitt in the 
various "Blackadder" series and is half of the popular English comedy team 
of Fry and Laurie. As of 1991 Stephen Fry is also a published novelist. 
<i>The Liar</i> was a #1 bestseller in England but hasn't done as well in 
North America, which is a bit of a shame.
</P>
<P>
One of the reasons for the book's failure over here is it's fairly
bawdy nature.  Even worse, most of the sex is homosexual in nature.
Much of England is still mired in the Victorian era as far as sex
is concerned.  Of course that puts them light-years ahead of the
United States, which is still saddled with the Puritans.
</P>
<P>
<i>The Liar</i> follows the public school (an English euphemism for their
most exclusive private schools) and college career of Adrian Healey, an 
upper middle class English youth who happens to be a pathological liar.  
Anyone who goes into this expecting a Jon Lovitz-like treatment of the 
character type will be bitterly disappointed and more than a little confused.
This is a thoroughly English novel, full of English idioms. Fry's use of
language is reminiscent of Oscar Wilde, and demonstrates yet again that a good 
English writer will always sound "better," or at least more sophisticated, 
than a writer of any other nationality who happens to be writing in English.
</P>
<P>
For those anglophiles who can handle it, this novel provides a biting 
satirical look at several levels of English society as they existed 20 years 
ago. From the meat markets of Piccadilly to Lord's Cricket Ground, Adrian 
Healey gets around...or at least he claims to.
</P>
<P>
<i>The Liar</i> by Stephen Fry.  ISBN: 0-939149-82-6
Published by Soho Press, 853 Broadway, New York, NY. 10003

RAH Humor Review:<BR>
Opus 'N Bill On The Road Again<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the February 1995 issue of <i>Random Access
Humor</i>.
</P>

<P>
Screen savers are big business -- Berkeley Systems made a fortune off
their industry standard After Dark package.  Another Berkeley is now
getting into the act.  Berkeley Breathed is the cartoonist who made
his name in the 1980s with <i>Bloom County</i>.  The second screen saver
featuring Bill the Cat and Opus the Penguin, the twice unsuccessful
Meadow Party presidential ticket and stars of <i>Bloom County</i>, is now
on the shelves of your favorite software retailer.
</P>
<P>
Opus 'N Bill On The Road Again is published by Delrina.  It uses
Delrina's Intermission display engine for Windows.  Systems equipped
with a sound card can produce the sound effects that are available
with most modules.  Intermission also displays After Dark modules for
those who cannot do without their Flying Toasters.  A few O&B modules
display over whatever Windows had on the screen when Intermission
activates.  My favorite in that category is Bill and Opus (in tutus)
skating around the screen.
</P>
<P>
Most of the O&B modules are full screen, replacing whatever was there
before.  A few of the funnier ones are:
</P>
<P>
"Uneasy Riders" - you are in a blue Mercedes tooling down the highway
behind the motorcycle-mounted title characters, Bill (complete with
skull and crossbones helmet) and Opus, who are occasionally accompan-
ied by an insect.  Opus and the insect take turns falling off and
usually end up on your windshield.  When that's not happening Bill is
hawking up hairballs, which always splatter on your windshield too.
This module sets the tone for the classiness of this product.
</P>
<P>
"Butthead Bill" - this ode to flying toasters features flying hearts
(of the valentine variety).  "Buttheaded Bill" and Opus, in the guise
of cupid, share the screen with the hearts.  Opus shoots down a heart
with his bow from time to time.  Opus, who has no visible quiver,
always has another arrow available immediately.  AD&D players may
recognize this syndrome.
</P>
<P>
"Tax This" - shows a jeans-clad Opus walking around on a sheet of
uncut dollar bills.  The wacky penguin draws some graffiti on one of
the bills, moons the viewers, the scampers away as an IRS patrol car
shows up.  The car disgorges two suit-clad, mop wielding Feds, who
clean up the mess.
</P>
<P>
"Pistachios" - our heroes sit watching the tube, Opus munching on
pistachios.  He gives Bill a suspect pistachio to try - Bill's out-
landish reaction confirms the penguin's suspicion.
</P>
<P>
"Dancing Opus" - Opus does his best Fred Astaire impression in an
attempt to cheer up a dejected Bill.
</P>
<P>
"Bugs" - insects have infested your screen.  Our heroes deal with the
problem in their own ways.  Opus uses a swatter, while Bill prefers
to swallow the pests.
</P>
<P>
"Information Highway" - A dazed Bill attempts to cross a multi-lane
highway without being struck by any of the computer equipment cruising
along at different speeds.  The whole thing is reminiscent of the
venerable video arcade game Frogger.  Whenever Bill gets run over, an
ambulance notebook computer scoops him up and rushes him off the screen.
</P>
<P>
"Opus In Space" - really a primitive version of the video game
Defender.  You control Opus's ship as he tries to destroy the
invaders.  I'm as lousy at this game as I was at Defender.  I'd love
to blame my problems on the Pentium processor (not inaccuracies, just
the speed) in my system, but the truth is I'm just a klutz.
</P>
<P>
"Opus Of The Jungle" - finds Opus residing in a thatched hut on a
tree limb far above the jungle floor.  He periodically comes out and,
providing he remembered to wear his loin cloth, starts zooming around
on vines until he smashes into something.  Sometimes Opus has company
- a really stacked human female (obviously a flightless seabird 
fancier).
</P>
<P>
"Hairball" - Bill coughs up a hairball (trust me, it's not nearly as
disgusting as the real thing)  Opus tries to clean it up, but it gets
loose and starts chasing Opus around the screen.
</P>
<P>
The really funny part is how much time I spent sitting in front of my
computer cataloging these silly saver modules.  At least I had the
excuse of having to write a review.  I've seen whole groups of people
sitting around offices watching the antics of a new screen saver.  I
can't wait to read the results of the first serious study (government
funded, no doubt) of how much office productivity is lost while people 
watch their new "Star Wars: Jedi X-Wing Toasters Strike Back" screen 
saver.

<A NAME="EarlyYrs">Dave's Early Years: The Making Of A Lunatic</A>
</H3>
<P>
I was born in Allentown, Pennsylvania on September 11, 1957 as part of
a desperate, highly secret attempt by the U.S. government to stop the
Soviet Union from launching Sputnik 1. The project failed slightly more
than three weeks later, of course, and the fact that it also unleashed me 
on the world makes this project the most disastrous of the Eisenhower
Administration. In an attempt to conceal the extent of the disaster, I was
spirited to the small village of Pennsville, Pennsylvania (about 5 miles 
north of Northampton), there to be raised by a kindly, eccentric, heretofore 
childless, middle-aged couple.
</P>
<P>
The first few years of my life were spent engaged in perfectly normal little
boy behavior: Breaking things, torturing any animals or insects unfortunate
enough to cross my path, trying to set fire to things, and generally being a 
nuisance to every other inhabitant of the planet I came in contact with.
At school they taught us about planets and orbits, but I wasn't buying any
of it. As an only child I was absolutely certain that the entire universe
revolved around me. (This is a certainty that few, if any, only children
ever outgrow.)
</P>
<P>
Just before my fourth birthday I suffered my first asthma attack. Things
went slowly down hill for the next ten years. Between my 13th and 14th
birthdays I spent more than eight months in various hospitals in Pennsylvania 
and New Jersey, coming close to dying on several occasions. The local 
pediatricians said I had the "worse case of asthma they had ever seen." 
The Philadelphia allergy specialist in charge of my case wasn't nearly as 
impressed. You literally had to cough up a lung to get that guy's attention.
</P>
<P>
When I first came down with asthma the doctors told us that I'd probably 
outgrow the disease by the age of 12. They also cautioned us that I had a good 
chance of coming down with hay fever around the same time. They turned out 
to be half right. I came down with hay fever right on schedule, but kept the 
asthma as a bonus. By the age of 14 I was a bitter, sarcastic,
self-dramatizing little creep. No wonder I was so popular in high school!
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="Gutenbug">The Gutenberg Bug</A>
</H3>
<P>
I've wanted to be a writer all my life. Apparently the publishing bug has
also been with me for a long time, although I refused to admit it to 
myself until recently. As an elementary school student I "published" a 
newspaper called <I>The Pennsville Blast</I>, typing two or three copies of 
each issue on a Remington portable electric typewriter. This served as 
my start down the long road to carpal tunnel syndrome.
</P>
<P>
As a teenager I delved into writing poetry, which is to be expected. 
Most of it was purely awful, which is also to be expected. I did have
one poem published, I think. In 1977 a magazine called <I>Teens Today</I> 
paid me the magnificent sum of one U.S. dollar for a poem called
<A HREF="trytobe.html">"Try To Be Me"</A>. I never received my contributor
copy, so I don't know if the poem was ever published. The check did clear,
so it wasn't merely another cruel joke played by an uncaring world on a
hapless, angst-ridden teenager.
</P>
<P>
One odd thing, though. As soon as that one dollar check was cashed I lost 
all interest in writing poetry. It was almost as though I was only doing it 
to prove to myself that I could get published. Once that goal had been 
achieved, the fascination disappeared.  Either that or my angst wandered off 
to ride someone else when I turned 20 a few months later. All I know is that 
I didn't write another line of poetry for 12 years, by which time I was 
safely in my thirties.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="Tween">The Tween Years: False Starts</A>
</H3>
<P>
Dropping out of college in November 1975 after an entire two months of what 
could only laughingly be called "work", I spent my late teens and early 
twenties drifting through life in search of something to really grab my 
attention. My parents, needless to say, were less than pleased with this
turn of events. I worked at a series of minimum wage jobs, endlessly annoyed
that the world failed to recognize my inborn genius and hand me the fame and
fortune I so clearly deserved.
</P>
<P>
As a longtime admirer of Benjamin Franklin, it's just too bad I wasn't
familiar with a certain quotation of his at that early point in my life:
<BR><BR>
<I>Genius without education is like silver in the mine.</I> - Ben Franklin
</P>
<P>
Trying (and failing at) one "get rich quick" scheme after another, I
also spent time exploring educational opportunities. I took some real estate 
courses and became a licensed Realtor Associate in Pennsylvania.
My realty license arrived in the mail during the early summer of 1979, 
the same week the prime rate hit 20%. An exceptionally well-timed career 
move, as usual. 
</P>
<P>
Working part-time for a Century 21 office in Allentown, PA., I spent my 
summer evenings wandering around that steaming subject of a Billy Joel song 
with an experienced Realtor. We were trying to convert FSBOs ("For Sale By 
Owners") into listings for our firm. People would look out their windows, 
see us coming up the walk in our gold blazers, and not even bother to answer 
the door. At best we'd hear them yell through the open windows, "Go away, 
we're not interested!" They knew what we wanted, since we were probably the
212th and 213th realtors to visit them that day, all for the same purpose.
Why any of us were bothering is beyond me, since nobody could afford to
buy a house at the mortgage rates being quoted at the time. That ridiculous 
gold blazer may still be stashed away in a closet somewhere. I look stupid
in gold.
</P>
<P>
When I wasn't working on some failing way to make more money, I played 
tournament chess, a game I took up seriously in high school. Too lazy to 
master the game, I helped organize tournaments and mostly tried to overlook 
the extent to which I found life one big continuum of tedium. While bumming 
around the Allentown Chess Club I met a rather odd teenager by the name of 
Greg Borek. We eventually discovered that we had a frightening number of 
things in common and became close friends.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="Almach">Sir Almach The Indecisive</A>
</H3>
<P>
Greg's friendship has had a profound influence on my life. For one thing,
he introduced me to another game which became more important to me over 
the years (at least from an artistic viewpoint) than chess ever was.
Greg's older brother Teddy belonged to a newly-forming fantasy roleplaying 
group.  Greg became involved, and one day in September 1979 I was invited  
over to the Borek manse to try my hand at something called Advanced Dungeons 
& Dragons. 
</P>
<P>
Enter the hapless Almach. The AD&D party I joined needed another cleric,
so a more experienced player helped me roll up just such a character. His 
highest score, 13, was placed on wisdom. Throwing a first time AD&D player 
right into playing a spellcaster is cruel, but I didn't know any better. 
Since all the players in the group were relative novices, neither did anyone
else.
</P>
<P>
Almach really symbolized my life at that time. He was a person with some 
potential who blundered around with no bearings or landmarks, never quite 
knowing what to do about the crazy situations in which he found himself.
He was so focused on making the correct decision that he would often fail to 
make any decision at all. None of this is too surprising, since AD&D 
characters always share a large measure of the personality of the player 
running the character (unless the player happens to be a great actor, which 
was never a danger in this case).
</P>
<P>
Eventually the members of the party attained knighthoods, through some bit of 
chicanery or another, and we all had to come up with noble names, like "Sir
Salazar the Vindicator" or some such malarky. True to my nature (and Almach
to his), I couldn't decide on a noble name. So I settled for "Sir Almach the 
Indecisive". The joke quickly wore thin, but it didn't matter much. Shortly
thereafter, just after reaching 5th level in his profession, Almach became 
a late night snack for an owlbear.
</P>
<P>
Even more important than the game itself, which was fascinating enough, was 
the group of real people I was playing AD&D with. The group included several 
fine actors (most notably Bruce Balliet and Greg Borek), and featured a 
brilliant actor/storyteller, Todd Furler, as our primary dungeon master. 
These people, who I am proud to count as friends, taught me as much about 
characterization and storytelling in a few years of fantasy roleplaying as
I've learned from a lifetime of reading great (and not so great) literature.
</P>
<P>
Did I say a "few years" of fantasy roleplaying? We still get together to
play games once or twice a year, although these days the game is more likely 
to be Torg or Illuminati. Some of us have families now, and all of us have 
adult responsibilities. Our old AD&D group may contain a diverse range of
personalities but we all have two things in common. We are all non-smokers,
and we all went into computers as a profession.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="Computes">Something Finally Computes</A>
</H3>
<P>
I gave up school again for a couple of years after the real estate fiasco. 
In the summer of 1981, however, I made a decision which was to completely
change my life. I signed up for two computer courses during the Fall 1981
semester at Northampton County Area Community College (NCACC). It's a 
damned good thing I took both courses, as it turns out.
</P>
<P>
The first course was "Introduction to Data Processing", and was one of the
most boring classes I've ever had the misfortune to sit through. The problem
was not so much the course material as the instructor. (Doesn't it always
seem to come down to that?) This guy was a DP "professional", a systems
analyst with a major local corporation. He was friendly enough, but his
teaching "technique" consisted of reading out loud in class the chapters
of the textbook <i>we had been assigned to read in preparation for that
class session</i>. Just a little bit of that goes a long, long way...
mostly towards making my teeth ache.
</P>
<P>
Mercifully the other course was "Programming I", which allowed me, for
the first time ever, to get my hands on a computer. It was a DEC PDP 11/70
minicomputer running UNIX and a Pascal compiler written by a member of the 
faculty. By the second week of the semester it was clear that something 
special was happening to me. This stuff was fascinating! I was jumping way 
ahead in the textbook, my mind awhirl with the logical possibilities of the
new language I was learning.
</P>
<P>
A whole new world was literally opening up before me. And this was a world 
that I could understand. (At long last!) By the time we were given userids 
and taught how to logon to UNIX and navigate through the system (3rd or 4th 
week of the semester) I had coded a Pascal program to calculate changes in 
my United States Chess Federation (USCF) rating. As soon as I learned how 
to use the UNIX text editor I eagerly typed in the hand-written code of my 
program and ran it through the Pascal compiler. Tingling with excitement, 
I checked the output of my first ever program compilation. <i>Every single 
line in the program was flagged with a syntax error.</i>
</P>
<P>
What the hell? I knew I was jumping way ahead of the lesson plan (we were 
officially coding the old "Hello World!" program), but I couldn't have 
misunderstood this stuff that badly! How could I mess up the #$%@# "PROGRAM"
statement? I wanted ever so desperately to ask the instructor about my 
program, but didn't want to rock the boat. This instructor was more than 
competent, even to the point of being somewhat inspiring (He told us that
"Lazy people make good programmers because they always find the shortest 
way of doing things. In computers, the shortest way is usually the best way." 
Go, team!), but he was a stickler for "keeping to the schedule" and not 
jumping ahead. Aaarrgggh!
</P>
<P>
Stretching my minuscule patience level well beyond the breaking point,
I hung on until it came time to actually type in our first official
program. At this point the instructor announced that although our textbook
showed all the Pascal reserved words in upper case, the home grown Pascal 
compiler we would be using actually required all Pascal reserved words to be 
typed in <i>lower case</i>. Aaarrgggh, indeed!!
</P>
<P>
After class I took a couple of minutes to actually type in and compile
my "Hello World" program, just to see what successful compilation output
looked like. Then I went crazy re-typing all the Pascal reserved words
in my rating program in lower case. Another compile...just three or four
errors! Within a few more minutes I had my program running, a program far
more complex than any official program I was asked to code during my first
two semesters of programming classes.
</P>
<P>
By February 1982 it was clear to me that I had finally found the
profession I wanted to pursue. I spoke to my parents about going back
to college full time starting in Fall 1982. They could tell that I was 
really pumped up about this programming stuff, but they had seen me that 
way before. They agreed to help as much as possible, but they approached 
the whole situation with an "Oh, no. Here we go again!" attitude.
</P>
<H3>
<A NAME="LionsCC">Lions and Calculus and Coeds, Oh My!</A>
</H3>
<P>
The Pennsylvania State University demonstrated that it was on a definite 
downward slope academically when it granted me admission as an 
undergraduate computer science major for the Fall 1982 trimester.
I entered with about a half-year's worth of transfer credits. (Why those
real estate courses weren't accepted for credit towards a computer science 
degree is beyond me.) The plan was to attend the Allentown branch campus of 
Penn State for a year to pick up some general education courses, then head 
for the main campus at State College for the last two or so years.
</P>
<P>
The first thing I discovered was that classes at a major research university 
aren't nearly as easy as classes at a community college. The second thing I 
discovered was that I was allergic to calculus. This allergy proved to be a 
major problem. I studied calculus like mad, even to the detriment of my 
work in other courses. My parents hired a tutor for me, and Greg (a wizard
at math) helped whenever possible. (Greg was going to school in Pittsburgh
by this time, so he wasn't around all that much). Even with all my work and
all this help, I only managed a "C" in that first semester of calculus. It
wasn't even a solid "C", but a sickly, hanging on by its fingernails kind
of "C". (I was used to cruising my way to straight "A"s at NCACC.)
</P>
<P>
Penn State requires computer science degree candidates to complete four
or five courses in advanced math, including 3 calculus courses, differential
equations, and linear algebra. A <i>barely squeaking by "C"</i> in Calculus 
101 did not bode well for my chances of getting through this program. I was 
going quite insane during that trimester break. Here I was, finally knowing 
precisely what I wanted to do with the rest of my life, and my utter 
inability to handle advanced math was going to wreck the whole thing! I 
started talking about changing my major to psychology, and my parents began 
chanting, "Oh no. Here we go again!"
</P>
<P>
Fortunately I found a flyer from the Capitol Campus of Penn State in 
Middletown, PA. laying around my room at this time. I had picked up the 
flyer from their display in the Penn State/Allentown Campus lobby when they 
came around recruiting for their programs. Most Penn State branch campus
students automatically head for the University Park campus in State College 
for the last two years of their bachelor's degree programs. The two other
four year degree-granting campuses of Penn State, Capitol Campus and
Behrend College, have to actively recruit students from the branch campuses
and community colleges in the state. It just so happened that Capitol Campus
offered a "Computer Applications" major as part of their Bachelor of Business
Administration degree program. Interesting. Even more interesting was the
fact that their BBA program required only 3 credits of calculus. I already
had that! Sold! I changed my major to business within the first week of the
Winter 1983 trimester.
</P>
<P>
The next two and a half years were a blur of classrooms, libraries, 
computer centers, exams, all-nighters, and 7-11 hot dogs at 3 AM.
Along the way I managed to fall in love with a young lady who eventually
married my roommate, so I was keeping busy. In late May, 1985 I put 
on a cap and gown for commencement from Penn State/Capitol Campus. I 
would have preferred to give the whole thing a miss and get my degree in 
the mail, but my parents insisted. Their chanting days were over at last!

<P>
<B>...But I do want to make one point perfectly clear... I've been a
mainframe systems programmer for about eleven years now. In all those
years of installing operating systems, coding assembler programs, and 
monitoring critical online systems, not once has it been necessary for 
me to resort to calculus! So all I have to say to the math geeks running 
the PSU Computer Science Department is, "Nyah...nyah.nyah.nyah..nyah!"</B>

Here are a few of Dave's favorite things in various areas of interest.

Dave holds Rascal, a 12 year old male orange and white tabby cat.
Dave adopted Rascal in 1991, soon after moving into his current home.
Rascal is a real slut for attention and loves to be held. Rascal enjoys
food almost as much as Dave does. They're both getting grumpier in 
their old age, as well.

Velvet

</CENTER>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/davelvt1.gif" align="left" width="320" height="240">
Dave holds Velvet, a four year old female black tabby cat. Velvet has
very fine red tabby markings visible in her fur, although they'd never
show up in any picture resolution available online.  She also has a 
small white diamond on her throat. Velvet was adopted as a kitten in
late 1991 to keep Rascal company while Dave is at work. Velvet was found 
abandoned as a very young kitten, and she may never recover fully from 
that ordeal. Greg has affectionately nicknamed her "The Demon from Hell" 
because of her sudden, insanely violent tendencies.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/davelvt2.gif" align="right" width="320" height="240">
Dave holds Velvet in one of her rare calmer moments. This moment lasted
several nanoseconds before Velvet tired of it and started violently
scrambling to get away. Velvet can be very affectionate when <i>she</i>
is ready. In fact, she curled up at Dave's feet purring while he grabbed
these frames from the videotape.

The Dream Is On Life Support<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This commentary first appeared in the August 1994 issue of <i>Rune's Rag</i>. 
</P>
<H3>

</H3>
<P>
In May 1961 John F. Kennedy was just four months into his presidency.  
A cold war was raging, and a new race with the Soviets was getting into 
full swing.  The Soviets were ahead in the race for space.  In the face 
of all this Kennedy, who is best known for the Bay of Pigs, the Cuban 
Missile Crisis, and his own gory death in Dallas, made his greatest 
contribution to history.  He pledged that the United States would work 
to send a man to the moon and return him safely to Earth by the end of 
the decade.
</P>
<P>
Kennedy's pledge set in motion the most exciting and productive feat 
of science and engineering ever accomplished by mankind.  In only 98 
months his will was carried out, although he never lived to see it.  
In July 1969, with 17 months to spare, Neil Armstrong uttered the most 
famous words in history as he set foot on the moon, "that's one small 
step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
</P>
<P>
The hearts and spirits of people all over the Earth (including a 
certain 11-year-old boy in Pennsylvania who was up *way* past his 
bedtime) soared as Armstrong took that first human step on a celestial 
body other than Earth.  For a few hours all mankind was truly united, 
in thought if not in deed or action.  Tranquility Base promised to be 
the first step in the long march of human space exploration, and possibly 
a first step towards a united Earth.
</P>
<P>
Alas, the bean counters got involved and mucked up the whole thing.  
They pointed out that spending billions of dollars to bring back a few 
moon rocks wasn't very cost effective.  We had "won" the race to the moon, 
what else did we need to prove?  Plus the U.S. was still in a nuclear arms 
race with the Soviets, not to mention a shooting war in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
On top of the financial considerations, humans once again displayed 
their peculiar fascination with "firsts."  Nobody remembers the 
name of the second man to sail to the New World.  Nor do they 
remember the name of the second man to fly across the Atlantic.
History will remember the names Armstong and Aldrin.  Can you 
remember the names of the Apollo 12 astronauts who walked on the
moon?
</P>
<P>
Even quicker than it began, human fascination with space travel faded.
Only the crisis of Apollo 13 and the Challenger disaster garnered 
headlines.  In December 1972 astronaut Gene Cernan became the last human 
being to set foot on the moon.  As much as I hope that last sentence is 
not the final word on the matter for all time, it certainly appears final 
for this century.
</P>
<P>
Many Americans seem dead set against the idea of further space travel and 
research.  More immediate problems of pressing social, political, and 
medical crises take all the publicity and the money. Nearly everyone forgets 
the amazing number of new technologies that have come from basic research 
for the space program.  New materials, new processes, and new medicines have 
all resulted from space research.   
</P>
<P>
Many people might change their minds about the utility of the space program 
if they were aware of all the useful developments that have resulted from it,
one of which may some day save their life, or the life of a loved one.  My 
own father's life was extended several years by a cardiac pacemaker, one 
result of research for the space program.  To me, at least, that justifies 
every penny spent on space research in the past 35 years.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/rocket3.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="102">
Those of us who were eleven (or thereabouts) when Neil Armstrong took that 
giant step into history expected to see interplanetary space travel, and 
possibly even interstellar travel, during our lifetimes.  Many of us expected 
to be among the first to make such voyages.  The future espoused by Star Trek
seemed close enough to touch.  Now it appears that greedy, shortsighted 
people, working through even more greedy and shortsighted politicians, have 
traded that glorious future for a few crumbs and bandaids today. We don't 
need nationalized health care.  We need another Kennedy to lead us into space 
- to keep the dream alive.

Book Review: IF YOU'RE FAT, IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT

Book Review: <I>If You're Fat, It's Not Your Fault</I><BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
Diet books have been one of the fastest growing segments of
the book publishing market for the last decade or so. Two of 
the more popular diets have been the Scarsdale Diet, which was 
to die for, and the Rotation Diet, which tended to make people
dizzy if they went too fast. One of the most fad-laden segments
of a fad-driven society, the diet industry seems to benefit
everyone except the customers. All that is about to change.
</P>
<P>
<I>If You're Fat, It's Not Your Fault</I> by Paul Rivas, MD. and
E.A. Tremblay is a revolutionary weight loss book. Instead of 
placing the blame for obesity solely on the "weakness" or "lack 
of will power" of the patient, this book (and the medical weight 
loss program it describes) recognizes that obesity is a disease.
</P>
<P>
Paul Rivas, M.D. is a board certified internist who 
specializes in bariatric medicine (the treatment of obesity).
During the first ten years of his practice Rivas treated his 
patients using the tried and true method of sticking the poor
suckers on a diet and then sternly admonishing them when they
failed to lose weight as expected. The good doctor bought into
the standard belief that all it took to lose weight was a little
willpower. Everyone knew that, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
Of course a century ago everyone knew that man would never
find a way to achieve powered flight. All it took was a couple 
of bicycle mechanics from Ohio to prove everyone wrong. In the 
case of proving that obesity was actually a chronic medical 
disorder that could be treated with medication the breakthrough
was not nearly so obvious or dramatic as the <I>Wright Flyer</I>
soaring over the sands of Kitty Hawk.
</P>
<P>
Eventually one of Dr. Rivas' patients, who was certain that 
his intense cravings for Italian food were not caused by any 
lack of willpower, gave Rivas a copy of a research report by Dr. 
Michael Weintraub of the University of Rochester.  The report
described Weintraub's four year study of two new appetite
suppressants, phentermine and fenfluramine.  Rivas was interest-
ed, but still cautious.  Eventually he prescribed very low doses 
of the drugs for this patient.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Rivas consulted all the medical literature 
available on the new drugs.  For years virtually all appetite 
suppressants were amphetamines.  Those drugs work, but they are 
also dangerous and addictive.  Phentermine and fenfluramine are
not amphetamines.  More important, the new drugs don't just 
suppress the patient's appetite, they moderate the level of 
serotonin in the brain.  
</P>
<P>
Serotonin is a prime suspect as the cause of Obsessive-
Compulsive Disorder (OCD).  It is known that OCD patients have
an underlying biochemical abnormality which may or may not
involve serotonin.  Doctors do know that OCD can be success-
fully treated with serotonin modifying drugs like Prozac.  
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rivas began to understand that overweight people, at 
least those who suffer from irresistible food cravings, seem to 
be exhibiting a very specialized form of obsessive-compulsive
behavior.  Every study Rivas consulted showed impressive weight 
loss from the new drugs along with no major side effects and no 
addiction.  The clincher was that it worked for his patient.  
Then it worked for another patient, and another.
</P>
<P>
Eventually this reviewer became one of those patients.  I
will now describe my own personal experience with this system.
</P>
<P>
<IMG SRC="/grph/davewbar.gif" ALT="______________________________">
</P>
<P>
It was Sunday, September 10, 1995, the day before my 38th
birthday.  At well over 350 lbs (the highest weight I could
find a scale to measure), I weighed more than at any time in 
my life.  Recently I had started taking ibuprofen to kill the
pain in my worn-out knees just so that I could walk.  Not that
I could walk very far before my heart started pounding like a
jackhammer and my breath came in gasps.
</P>
<P>
It had been apparent for some time that this situation was
unsupportable.  Unless something was done - immediately - I
would probably not live to see my 40th birthday, and surely
not my 50th.  I began to consider liposuction as a means of 
getting the load off my knees and my heart.  Of course I knew 
that surgery wouldn't solve the long term problem.  I was just 
looking to buy some time in which to find a solution to my 
lifelong cravings for food.
</P>
<P>
I grew up in a Pennsylvania Dutch household in Pennsville,
a village about 15 miles north of Allentown, where I was born.
Food is very important in Pennsylvania Dutch culture.  In fact
food represents hospitality and even love in that culture.
</P>
<P>
The last time I weighed a normal amount for my height was 
a month before my 14th birthday.  I had just gotten out of a 
rehabilitation hospital after a six month stay for severe 
asthma (which had nearly ended my life several times in the 
previous year).  I was 4'10" tall and weighed about 100 lbs 
(the result of six months on a hospital diet - and let's face 
it, hospital food is nasty even if you're <i>not</i> on a diet).  
</P>
<P>
My parents got me home, took a look at their only child, 
and said, "you're so skinny!"  They proceeded to stuff me like 
a goose until I regained the rotund (and no doubt healthy, at 
least to their eyes) shape they were used to seeing.  Needless 
to say both my parents were overweight as well.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-four years and numerous failed diet attempts later 
I found myself with a rapidly disintegrating body.  As I read
the Sunday <i>Baltimore Sun</i> that September day I happened upon 
a special medical advertising supplement.  It occurred to me 
that I might do better finding a plastic surgeon from that
supplement than from Yellow Pages ads (sorry, Mr. Jones).
</P>
<P>
The supplement did contain an ad from a plastic surgeon,
but it contained something even better.  Dr. Paul Rivas had
an ad that described his medical plan that treated "obesity
as a chronic biochemical problem".  Well, now.  This guy sure
sounded more sensible than any other doctor I had discussed my
weight problem with.
</P>
<P>
I had long suspected my problem was a lot more complicated
than a simple matter of "willpower".  For one thing, I'm one
of the most stubborn and willful people on the planet.  If I
really set my sights on something, I rarely fail to achieve my 
goal.  In fact weight loss was the only thing in my life I had
tried repeatedly and always failed to accomplish.
</P>
<P>
For another thing, I'm not stupid.  I knew intellectually 
that my eating habits were killing me.  I said that to myself 
time and time again as I raised another piece of pastry to my 
lips. "This thing will kill me."  Gulp.  Something just didn't 
add up.
</P>
<P>
Since about the age of six I've been a card carrying cynic,
so I realized that the Rivas ad could be another come on.  But 
I was getting desperate, and this WAS the first explanation of 
obesity I had seen that even came close to the way I felt about 
my problem.  I decided it was worth a look.
</P>
<P>
My "scam detector" went to yellow alert when the staff
person who gave me my initial appointment over the phone made 
a big deal about how much the first visit would cost and what 
forms of payment they accepted.  I kept the appointment anyway.
</P>
<P>
As soon as I opened the door to Dr. Rivas' office on 
Tuesday, October 12, 1995 I was slapped in the face by large 
signs proclaiming the "rate schedule" for various stages of the 
program and the "returned check fees" in effect.  Red alert!  
Still, I had come this far, and I remained desperate.  I might 
as well try the plan, or at least hear what the doctor had to 
say.  Even if this plan didn't work for me I might learn 
something which could be useful later.
</P>
<P>
So I spent half an hour filling out a thick sheaf of forms
detailing my medical history and promising not to hold Dr. 
Rivas personally responsible if the Washington Monument ever
caught fire.  Then came the moment of truth.  I weighed in at 
360.5 pounds according to their electronic scale.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Rivas spent about five minutes with me that day and
basically told me, "You need to lose that weight."  Duh.  I 
sure wish I had gone to medical school so that I could have 
figured that out!  Eventually I paid my money and received
two weeks worth of medication.
</P>
<P>
What the heck?  If the medication actually worked, the
rest of the nonsense wouldn't matter.  I waited until I was
safely at work before taking my first dose of medication.  It
had been decades since I last took prescription medication and
I didn't want to experience an adverse reaction while driving
on the Baltimore Beltway, the amateur demolition derby venue
which surrounds the city.
</P>
<P>
Phentermine and fenfluramine (commonly referred to as Phen/Fen) may 
not be amphetamines, but they sure speeded up my metabolism that night 
(I work evenings). A physical wreck, exhaustion had forced me to take a 
short nap at my desk nearly every night.  Not that night!  I was wide
awake, more so than I had been in a long time.  One interesting
thing, though - I made it through the entire evening without
hearing the siren call of the snack vending machines in the 
corner of the building.  It had been even longer since that had 
happened.
</P>
<P>
Sure enough, the blasted pills worked!  By following a low
fat diet and staying on the medication, I began to lose weight.
Sure, there were lapses, especially on my trip to Las Vegas 
and over the holidays.  But aside from those extra special
temptations, my weight was going down.  I didn't feel so tired
all the time, but I could go to sleep at the normal time every
night.  Side effects were limited to dry mouth, which I've 
always had anyway, so the added effect quickly faded into the 
background.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, April 16, 1996 I saw Dr. Rivas for my six
month checkup (I had seen nurse practitioners at a clinic
of the Rivas Weight Loss Program located much nearer my place
of employment during the intervening period).  I weighed in at
313.5 lbs, a loss of 47 pounds in six months.  I was off the
ibuprofen and my knees were healing.  I could walk around at
a normal pace without becoming winded after 50 feet.
</P>
<P>
I have dieted this long and this effectively before.  The
difference is in how I feel.  By the six month mark of previous
diets I was feeling good physically, but lousy mentally.  The
stress of resisting the constant urges to eat the wrong things,
in huge quantities, was getting to me.  Eventually I would eat
something I really shouldn't have.  Then my shattered willpower 
would collapse completely and it was off to the races (and the 
bakery) again.
</P>
<P>
Being a fallible human, I sometimes eat things I shouldn't while on 
this plan.  The difference is that I never even consider giving up.
I simply tell myself that I shouldn't do that again and keep right on
going with the plan.  Notice that I have never referred to the
Rivas plan as a diet.  That's because I don't even think of it
that way.  The medications I'm taking have allowed me to change 
my basic eating habits.  Quite frankly I eat nearly as much 
food as I did before (not counting the binges, of course).  I 
simply eat low fat food now, and I'm not left with the residual 
cravings for "bad food" that such actions saddled me with before 
starting on the medication.
</P>
<P>
Whenever someone notices you're losing weight they ask you
"what is your goal?"  This question confused me, and I wasn't
sure why.  Then it struck me - my goal is to make sure I don't
go back to the way I was!  I'm eating correctly, probably for
the first time in my life.  I will eventually lose the other
130 lbs or so I need to shed to reach a "normal weight" for my
height (5'7").  (Update: As of June 11, 1996 I was down to 300.5 lbs, 
for a loss of 60 lbs in 8 months.)
</P>
<P>
I'm not terribly concerned with how long all this takes, since I know 
that I'll get there eventually.  The critical thing is that I already 
feel good about myself in a way I never have.  The monkey is finally 
off my back, and in my case it was more like a gorilla.
</P>
<P>

<i>All The Trouble In The World</i><BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the April 1995 issue of <i>Dream Forge</i> 
magazine.
</P>
<H3>

</H3>
<P>
Repent, the end of the world is near! You'd think it was
inevitable, what with all the (very fashionable) worrying about
famine, plague, overpopulation, racial hatred, and environmental
catastrophe. Doomsday myths have always been popular, but modern
pseudo-science gives them an air of authenticity that is very
seductive, even to the modern skeptical mind, unless you happen
to have the actual facts.
</P>
<P>
P.J. O'Rourke has been poking holes in over-inflated egos and
debunking popular myths since the 1960s. A former editor of the
<i>National Lampoon</i>, these days he writes for <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and
certainly gathers no moss, seeking out assignments as a correspondent
that allow him to travel where the action is around the world. Unlike
most popular economic/political commentators, O'Rourke has actually
been to places like Bangladesh, Somalia, Bosnia, and Vietnam. He
makes the most of these experiences, using them as the basis of his
latest best seller, <i>All The Trouble In The World: The Lighter Side
of Overpopulation, Famine, Ecological Disaster, Ethnic Hatred, Plague,
and Poverty.</i>
</P>
<P>
In the section on overpopulation, O'Rourke points out that
Fremont, California, a tony city located on San Francisco Bay, has
the exact same population density as Bangladesh. Even the worst
doomsday predictions would leave the planet with the same population
density as the State of Pennsylvania. Anyone who has driven Interstate
80 through north central Pennsylvania can assure you that even in the
worst case scenario, there will still be plenty of desolate places
where people can "get away from it all."
</P>
<P>
O'Rourke landed an assignment in Somalia, where he investigated
famine. P.J. discovered that there is really plenty of food in
Somalia. You don't even need food stamps to get it, just an AK-47.
Statistics prove that the modern world grows a lot more food, feeds
a lot more people than ever before, yet suffers from more famine.
O'Rourke notes that "This would seem to defy physical law . . .
When a thing defies physical law, there's usually politics involved."
</P>
<P>
  A long time commentator on American cultural eccentricities,
O'Rourke is really in his element when he gets going on the shambles
that is the American environmental movement. Starting off with the
U.S. Government's horrendous record as a steward of the environment,
he finishes with a summary of his attendance at the 1992 Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro. Along the way, he takes well deserved swipes at
such noted environmental "thinkers" as Henry David Thoreau and
Roderick Nash.
</P>
<P>
  O'Rourke sums up his treatise on global suffering with a
chapter on Economic Justice, subtitled: "The Hell with Everything,
Let's Get Rich." As an example he uses the Republic of Vietnam.
Although still a communist dictatorship, the citizens of Vietnam
"have let go of Marx with both hands." Everyone in the country is
hustling, making things or providing services on the side, in
addition to whatever "official" job they might have. O'Rourke notes
that "You can do pretty much what you want to do in Vietnam. You are
not, however, supposed to have opinions about doing it." To give you
an idea how well the country is doing, just 20 years after the last
helicopter lifted off the roof of the U.S. Embassy in Saigon --
Vietnam is sending food aid to the former Soviet Union.

Movie Review:<BR>
<i>Dracula - Dead And Loving It</i><BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<P>
This review first appeared in the January 1996 issue of <i>Dream Forge</i> 
magazine.
</P>
<H3>

</H3>
<P>
In December 1974 Mel Brooks was at the top of his form. That summer 
<i>Blazing Saddles</i> had become Mel's first smash hit, making him 
a "name" movie director. Before the year was out <i>Young Frankenstein</i> 
followed "Saddles" into the theaters and the fans went wild . . . 
again. In one year Mel Brooks released two of the funniest movies 
of all time, not to mention inventing a whole new class of comedy 
motion picture, the genre parody, in the process. 
</P>
<P>
On top of the world in the mid-1970s, Mel Brooks had his pick 
of major stars willing to do cameos in his films for peanuts. But 
it eventually became apparent that Mel would never produce another 
film to match his two 1974 masterpieces. Although Mel's place in 
cinema history was already secure, others began to eclipse the 
master at his own genre. 
</P>
<P>
Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker, the loons responsible for the
<i>Airplane</i> movies and the <i>Police Squad/Naked Gun</i> insanity, 
took the Brooks recipe a step further. This mad trio managed to cram 
more jokes into each minute of celluloid than Brooks had in any given
scene. While none of their individual jokes were as good as the best 
Mel Brooks fare, the cumulative effect was astounding.
</P>
<P>
Mel Brooks continued to direct, producing a series of mediocre 
to good films, bottoming out with his 1987 turkey, <i>Spaceballs</i>.
Two years ago Brooks was back, with <i>Robin Hood - Men In Tights</i>. 
This parody of the "steal from the rich, give to the poor" genre was
hardly brilliant, and less convincing than the liberal democrats 
in Congress. "Men in Tights" was, however, the best Mel Brooks 
film since his 1981 effort, <i>History Of The World - Part I</i>.
</P>
<P>
Christmas weekend 1995 brings us to the latest Mel Brooks
offering. <i>Dracula - Dead And Loving It</i> stars Leslie Nielsen as 
Count Drebin, Detective Vampire, Transylvania Police Squad . . . 
or so it seems. The clothes and dental work are fancier, but it 
still adds up to classic slapstick Drebin. Brooks apparently 
decided that if he couldn't be as good as the Zuckers, he could 
at least "borrow" the biggest star in their universe, and have 
Nielsen recreate the wackiest cop ever to scarf down a doughnut. 
Nielsen really sinks his teeth into the task of playing Drebin-
as-Dracula, although even he seems to be getting a bit tired of 
the repetition. 
</P>
<P>
Not all the problems with <i>Dracula</i> stem from the Mel Brooks 
writing and directing. The supporting cast does a mediocre job 
overall, which seems to be a common problem with later Brooks 
films.
</P>
<P>
Peter MacNichol plays mousey London barrister Thomas Renfield,
the first victim of Dracula, doomed to be the vampire's idiotic 
henchman. MacNichol did a great job with this type of character 
in <i>Dragonslayer</i>, the wimpey assistant who eventually saves the 
day. His performance here will leave true Mel Brooks fans wishing 
that Marty Feldman was alive to reprise his I-gor role from <i>Young
Frankenstein</i>. (By the by, has it occurred to anyone else that the 
bad guys would do a lot better in movies if their henchmen weren't 
all blithering idiots?)
</P>
<P>
Harvey Korman can be absolutely hilarious, a fact he proved time after 
time as a cast member of the <i>Carol Burnett Show</i> back in the 1960s. 
Korman also did excellent work as a member of the classic Mel Brooks 
repertory company of the 1970s and 80s. In 1995 the man looks burned out.
Rather than having the good sense to retire, Korman plays Doctor Seward, 
a psychiatrist with an enema fixation (denizens of the relevant alt.sex.* 
newsgroups take note).
</P>
<P>
Lysette Anthony plays Mina Seward, the daughter of the good 
doctor, and the apple of Dracula's eye. Anthony does a decent job, 
although her performance doesn't quite come up to the level of her 
previous work, such as her turn as the fake Leslie Giles in 
<i>Without A Clue</i>.
</P>
<P>
Why Mel Brooks continues to insist on acting in his own films 
remains a mystery. His last really good performance was in his 
various roles in <i>History Of The World - Part I</i>. The problem is 
that his performances tend to be inconsistent. They range from sheer 
genius as the idiotic horney governor and the Yiddish-spouting 
Sioux chieftain in <i>Blazing Saddles</i> to his pathetic turn as the 
President in <i>Spaceballs</i>. Brooks' other big problem (although 
this can occasionally be an asset in comedy) is that he's the second 
ugliest actor/director working today. The ugliest actor/director 
is, of course, Terry Gilliam of Monty Python fame.
</P>
<P>
Despite all this, Brooks does a credible job in the role of 
Dr. Abraham Van Helsing, ace vampire hunter. Van Helsing's dialogue 
with Dracula is the source of the best running gag in the film. Van 
Helsing knows that "location is one of the most important things in 
life," which may well be the main lesson this flick has to offer.
</P>
<P>
To sum up -- no, it's not <i>Young Frankenstein</i>, but it does 
beat <i>Spaceballs</i>, and probably <i>Robin Hood - Men In Tights</i>.
(At least Brooks refrained from including his trademark "Wink, wink, 
we're inside a movie" references in every other scene like he did 
in the latter work.) This film will appeal primarily to die hard 
Mel Brooks fans and to followers of the <i>Naked Gun</i> movies. No, 
it doesn't have O.J. in it, but it does have plenty of blood.

Music Review:<BR>
Kansas/Styx Summer Tour 1996<BR>
by Dave Bealer
</H2>
<H3>
Copyright &#169; 1996 Dave Bealer, All Rights Reserved.
</H3>
<P>
Just a few words about the Kansas/Styx tour taking place this summer.
Greg Borek and I attended the concert at the Merriweather Post Pavilion in
Columbia, Maryland on Sunday, June 2, 1996.
</P>
<H3>
Kansas: Kerry, We Miss You
</H3>
<P>
The first time we saw Kansas perform in concert was in 1980, during the 
<i>Audio-Visions</i> tour. That was the last tour to feature all the original
members of the band. Sixteen years later Kansas is touring again, albeit with
only three members of the original lineup. 
</P>
<P>
Steve Walsh is the voice of Kansas. We missed him during his absence, and
welcome him back. Steve still sounds great, and jumps around on stage during 
the songs as much now as in 1980, although his middle-age is obvious. One 
puzzling thing is why Steve dances with his back to the audience so much. 
It's hard to tell if he loves looking at drummer Phil Ehart, or if he's 
simply proud of his ass, and wants the audience to have a really good look 
at it.
</P>
<P>
Rich Williams remains Kansas' lead guitarist, although he apparently spent 
most of the intervening 16 years eating. A bear of a man in the first place, 
Williams has really porked out. If anyone who knows Rich personally reads
this, please tell him about the Fen/Phen medical weight loss system that has 
worked so well for so many people (including this writer - see my 
<A HREF="ifyrfat.html">review of the system</a>). Despite the fact that Rich 
looks like he can barely reach his guitar, he still plays with joyful power.
It would be a tragedy to lose him needlessly.
</P>
<P>
Drummer Phil Ehart has always provided the driving beat behind the magical
Kansas songs. It's hard to tell how the years have treated Phil, since he 
spent the entire set hidden behind his drum set. Those drum sticks can still 
be seen to fly around with gusto, and the beat sounds great. Dare we ask for 
more?
</P>
<P>
Of the Kansas replacements, David Ragsdale is the most important. After all,
what would Kansas be without the violin? David manages to sound hauntingly
like Robbie Steinhardt. I can't imagine that playing rock violin is easy, 
so Ragsdale must just be that good. 
</P>
<P>
Billy Greer replaces Dave Hope on bass and backing vocals.  He also plays
acoustic guitar on softer songs like "Dust In The Wind", filling in for
part of the job once done by Kerry Livgren. Suffice it to say there is no 
deficiency in the bass department.
</P>
<P>
It has been said that a Kansas performance consists of "a blend of six 
separate performances." If the Kansas of 1996 has a weak link, it is Greg 
Robert, the keyboard player who replaced Kerry Livgren. In all fairness, 
Mr. Robert may have been having a bad night musically or technically, but
he was most certainly not adding much to the blend on June 2nd.
</P>
<P>
Kerry Livgren is sorely missed. Along with Steve Walsh, Kerry formed the
musical core of Kansas. Working together to produce such classics as 
"Questions Of My Childhood", "Portrait (He Knew)", "Closet Chronicles", 
and my all-time personal favorite, "The Wall", Steve and Kerry will always 
be remembered as a team. Alas, they have not performed together with Kansas 
since the <i>Audio-Visions</i> tour of 1980. Whatever the cause of this split,
it is a great misfortune for Kansas fans everywhere. We can only hope that 
they find it in themselves and each other to get back together some day.
</P>
<P>
As to the actual performance, it had its ups and downs. Starting off with
"I Can Fly" from <i>Freaks Of Nature</i>, surely the most un-musical song
that Kansas has ever recorded, they went on to perform classics like "Song
For America", "Lonely Wind", and "People Of The South Wind". The crowd was 
enthusiastic and responded early, shouting the question "How long?" back to 
the stage during "Point Of Know Return". 
</P>
<P>
The good news was that Kansas only performed two songs from <i>Freaks
Of Nature</i> ("Hope Once Again" being the second). Much of the set was
comprised of songs from their two classic albums, <i>Leftoverture</i>
and <i>Point Of Know Return</i>. The final encore was, of course, "Carry
On Wayward Son", which really got the joint rockin' (and brought out the
lighters in force).
</P>
<H3>
Styx: The Timeless Illusion
</H3>
<P>
As much as Kansas has changed over the years, Styx seems to remain the
same. Whether these guys are just lucky, or whether they did a deal with the 
proprietor of the place their namesake river flows past, is anyone's guess.
In any event, Styx is touring with their original crew, save for drummer
John Panozzo.
</P>
<P>
The headliners in this pairing, Styx plays last, and makes use of more props,
lights and other gimmicks. In Columbia they started off with "Rockin' The
Paradise", complete with a flashy reproduction of the marquee from the
cover of the <i>Paradise Theater</i> album.
</P>
<P>
As a group who hasn't recorded together (at least with this lineup) for
over a decade, Styx was free to concentrate on their hits from the 1970s.
So the procession of songs from <i>Equinox</i>, <i>The Grand Illusion</i>,
and <i>Pieces Of Eight</i> was nearly uninterrupted.
</P>
<P>
Dennis DeYoung, the keyboard player and main songwriter for Styx, gave a
little introductory talk for two of his best songs, "The Grand Illusion"
and "Come Sail Away" (both from the 1977 Styx magnum opus, <i>The Grand
Illusion</i>).  Although "Come Sail Away" is the most well known Styx song,
at least in North America, "The Grand Illusion" is at least as meaningful,
especially at a time when so many people seem to believe that the world
"owes them" the things they see on the television and movie screen.
DeYoung himself observed, speaking of fame and fortune, "It's all just
bullshit."
</P>
<P>
Kansas and Styx are two of the three rock groups whose music has most
influenced my life (Boston being the third, since I know <i>someone</i>
will ask). Seeing them perform now, when my life is going through some 
profound changes (not the least of which is the swift approach of middle
age), was truly magical. If either or both of these groups held any 
meaning for you in your youth, my advice would be go see them this
summer if you can. You won't regret it. (See them outdoors if possible,
your ears will thank you for that.)
</P>

This schedule is copied from the back of the Kansas t-shirt I purchased
at the concert on June 2, 1996. I presume it was accurate as of when the
shirt was created. Obviously there are no guarantees. Check with ticket
outlets in your area before making specific plans.

Author's Addendum (July 18, 1996):<BR>
This review has garnered more feedback than any piece I've written 
in my career (which spans only four years, but I'm still amazed). 
Apparently more folks are interested in classic rock than I imagined.
I would like to publicly answer the main points that correspondents
have raised in e-mail:
<UL>
<LI>Apparently Rich Williams, the lead guitarist for Kansas, <i>is</i>
losing weight. This is excellent news!
<LI>It was not my intention to denigrate the violin playing of David
Ragsdale. The paragraph about Mr. Ragsdale still reads (to me) as a 
positive statement on his playing, which was intended. I love Robbie 
Steinhardt's playing, and basically equate Mr. Ragsdale's playing to
Robbie's.
<LI>No, I didn't care for Greg Robert's keyboard work on June 2nd. I 
did point out that what I heard may not represent the peak of his 
ability. One can only hope it doesn't. In any case his fans were most
eloquent in his defense, especially the gentleman who pointed out that 
Mr. Robert's keyboards are always "turned way down" in the studio and 
stage mix. I'm no musician, but this doesn't sound like the most
ringing testimonial for the man's contribution to the Kansas sound.
<LI>For those who think that classic rock fans are "wasting our time"
with "burned out artists" who are only "in it for the money" - why 
did you read this review in the first place? Allow those of us who
find meaning in old time rock to have our fun. Save your pity for
those people who haven't found any meaning in their lives. Sheesh!
</UL>

Silly Parties<BR>

This article first appeared in the July 1995 issue of <i>Dream Forge</i> 
magazine.

Summer has arrived - the time for picnics and parties.  These
gatherings can range from serious to silly, it mostly depends on
who is invited.  Even parties/picnics that will me more or less
subdued affairs (i.e they're not BYOL (Bring Your Own Lampshade))
can get a little kick from certain elements, starting with the
invitations.
</P>
<H3>
Silly Invitations
</H3>
<P>
  A co-worker once gave me an invitation to a party.  It
  contained a great extension on the typical "map to the
  party site" ploy.  The map on this invitation contained
  several segments.  It began with a picture of the Milky Way
  Galaxy with an arrow pointing to the approximate position of
  the Sol System.  The next segment was an actual wire-frame
  map of the Solar system, indicating the third planet out as
  the destination.  Then came a map of North America, with an
  arrow indicating the Baltimore area.  Finally, there was a
  map of the particular section of Baltimore City where my
  friend resides, pointing out his house.
</P>
<P>
  Word silliness.  I had a picnic for some coworkers last
  summer.  Not being an artist, I decided to go for verbal
  insanity in my invitation.  Besides, most of my invitees
  had already been recipients of the Galactic invitation
  described above, so a fresh approach was required.  Here
  is the result:
</P>
<PRE>

       [   ]  Yes, we will be there.  There will probably be

       [   ]  Maybe we can make it, provided we don't get a
              better offer, like having root canal work done.
              If we show, there will probably be ______ guests
              in our party.

       [   ]  No thanks.  Either we have other plans, or we'd rather
              have our fingernails pulled out than see you when
              we're not getting paid by the hour.  (This will be
              considered the default response if you don't reply.)

<P>
This fit on a single 8 1/2 x 11 sheet of paper.  The picnic turned
out okay, with about 2/3 of those promising to attend actually
showing up despite torrential downpours in the area at the official
picnic start time.  The sun did put in an appearance later on in 
the afternoon.
</P>
<H3>
Theme Parties
</H3>
<P>
  A few years ago I hosted a Monty Python Party and Film Festival
  for a few demented friends and coworkers.  The entertainment
  consisted of all three Python feature films, the MP Live at the
  Hollywood Bowl tape, an interview with John Cleese taped off of
  PBS, and selected episodes from the original television series.
  Food included Spam (there was a can on the table, but nobody had
  the guts to open it), various exotic cheeses (all mentioned in
  the cheese shop sketch), and vegetables stir-fried in my semi-
  famous Lemon Curry sauce, which I invented especially for this
  event.  Beverages included Foster's Lager and Watney's Red
  Barrel, an English beer which is available in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
  The Python party is the only theme party I've hosted to date,
  but there is plenty of material available for others.  Here are
  a few suggested examples:
</P>
<P>
<B>Red Dwarf Theme Party</B><BR>
featured food: various vindaloos, pot noodle, fried calamari<BR>
featured drinks: lager, beer milkshakes<BR>
special gimmick: guests should arrive alone
</P>
<P>
<B>M*A*S*H Theme Party</B><BR>
featured food: creamed chipped beef, c-rations<BR>
featured drinks: home distilled gin<BR>
special gimmick: guests should wear operating room gowns
</P>
<P>
<B>Simpsons Theme Party</B><BR>
featured food: pork chops, doughnuts<BR>
featured drinks: whatever that drink was that Homer invented<BR>
(Hey!  You can't expect me to remember everything!)<BR>
special gimmick: guests must be animated characters
</P>
<P>
<B>Indiana Jones Theme Party</B><BR>
featured food: live insects, dates (preferably not poisoned)<BR>
featured drinks: French wine, whiskey (straight from the bottle)<BR>
special gimmick: conduct an actual archaeological dig during the
party.  Note that this could cause your downstairs neighbors
to complain if you live in an apartment.
</P>
<P>
So, there you have them.  Ideas for something other than your
ordinary, everyday, humdrum picnic or party.  Have a great summer.

Nothing is Sacred Here!

<P>
The only sacred cows you'll find here are roasting over a nice fire made
from real wood. If your mind can't digest meaty subjects, especially those
presented in an acid fashion, use the <I>back</I> facility on your browser now.

<H3>
We're Not Radicals...
</H3>
<P>
We don't advocate racism, holes in the ozone, holes in human bodies
(made by bullets, knives, or other things), animal abuse, child abuse,
mother-in-law abuse, drunk driving, homophobia, or any of the plethora
of other things that are so popular to be <I>concerned about</I> these days.
</P>
<H3>
We're Willing To Laugh At Anything!
</H3>
<P>
But we don't run screaming from these topics either, at least if we
think we can make them funny. Everyone's sense of humor is different,
of course, so your mileage may vary. Simply realize that the publisher
of this site thinks everything here is funny. Or at least he thought
all these items were funny when he posted them. Even though he is male, 
he reserves the right to change his mind.
</P>
<H3>
No Offense Intended
</H3>
<P>
If you don't like humor out on the edge of good taste (and sometimes
over it), then you should go back from whence you came. There are plenty
of boring, predictable, <I>concerned</I> sites out there from which to
choose.
</P>
<P>
Although this site is not obscene, and should be legal in most 
jurisdictions on Planet Earth, it does contain some harsh language. If 
you're offended by <EM>bad words</EM> you may be happier elsewhere.<BR>
