<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-11-211.</H1>
1-11-211.  Contests for district attorneys. The district court of the
judicial district in which the contest for the office of district attorney
arises has jurisdiction for the adjudication of contests for the office of
district attorney.  No district judge who is a contestor in any election
contest shall be permitted to hear and determine the matter.  In that case, the
supreme court shall appoint a district judge to hear and decide the contest.

<H1>ANNOTATION</H1>
Source: L. 92:  Entire article R &amp  RE, p. 790,  14, effective January 1,
1993.
<P>I.  General Consideration.
<P>II.  Trial.
<P>III.  Appeal.
<P>I. GENERAL CONSIDERATION.
<P>Cross references.  As to judgments, see  1-11-213. As to depositions, see
Rules 26 through 37, C.R.C.P.  As to trial of contested elections, see Rule
100(b), C.R.C.P.
<P>Am. Jur.2d.  See 26 Am. Jur.2d, Elections,   350, 358-362.
<P>Annotator's note.  The following annotations are taken from cases decided
under former provisions similar to this section.
<P>II. TRIAL.
<P>Purpose of fixing day for trial.  This section requiring a judge, in an
election contest case, to fix a day for trial not more than twenty days after
the issue is joined is for the purpose of enabling a speedy trial and is for
the benefit of both parties. Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P.202
(1900).
<P>But this requirement may be waived by both parties consenting to fixing
the date of trial at a later date.  Nicholls v. Barrick, 27 Colo. 432, 62 P.
202 (1900).
<P>However, there is no specific provision for a change of the place of
trial.  Nordloh v. Packard, 45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).
<P>Nor is there a provision for an application for calling in another judge
to try the case upon the ground of prejudice or partiality of the presiding
judge. Nordloh v. Packard, 45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).
<P>And so, in the absence of any such authority, the rules of civil procedure
should be followed.  Nordloh v. Packard, 45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).
<P>Under the rules, a party has not the absolute right to have his cause
tried by a judge other than the regularly elected and presiding judge of the
court on the alleged ground of the latter's prejudice.  The matter lies in the
sound discretion of the judge to whom the application is made, and his decision
is not reviewable unless an abuse of discretion is shown.  Nordloh v. Packard,
45 Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).  See Doll v. Stewart, 30 Colo. 320, 70 P. 326
(1902); People ex rel. Lindsley v. District Court, 30 Colo. 488, 71 P. 388
(1903).
<P>Furthermore, an election contest may be tried notwithstanding a change of
judges after its commencement, though the successor must conduct the trial de
novo.  Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890); Nordloh v. Packard, 45
Colo. 515, 101 P. 787 (1909).
<P>And by the words "other cases" must be understood ordinary civil
actions.  Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).
<P>But it is not "according to the rules and practice" in the trial of
ordinary civil actions for one judge to hear the evidence, or a part thereof,
orally, and then for another judge to render a finding and judgment upon such
evidence, however perfectly the same may have been preserved.  Clanton v. Ryan,
14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (1890).
<P>As the object of requiring testimony to be preserved is for convenient
reference afterwards, or for use on appeal, or as a deposition in case a second
trial should be had when witnesses should have died or removed from the county.
Clanton v. Ryan, 14 Colo. 419, 24 P. 258 (l890).
<P>Where an election contest is dismissed by contestant, over the objection
of the contestee, after answer and replication are filed, such dismissal is not
a bar to another contest depending on the same facts.  Vigil v. Garcia,  36
Colo. 430, 87 P. 543 (1906).  See Freas v. Engelbrecht, 3 Colo. 377 (1877);
Hallack v. Loft, 19 Colo. 74, 34 P. 568 (1893); Martin v. McCarthy, 3 Colo.
App. 37, 32 P. 551 (1893); Denver &amp  R. G. R. R. v. Iles, 25 Colo. 19, 53 P. 222
(1898); Board of Comm'rs v. Schradsky, 31 Colo. 178, 71 P. 1104 (1903).
<P>III. APPEAL.
<P>Limitation upon appeals not repealed by provision for review.  Provision
that writs of error (now writs on appeal) to any inferior tribunal shall be the
only method for review by the supreme court of any action or proceeding, and
repealing all statutes providing any other method or procedure for review, did
not repeal the 20-day limitation upon appeals of election contest decisions.
Sitler v. Brians, 126 Colo. 370, 251 P.2d 319 (1952).
<P>Hence, the attempted review of an action to contest election not docketed
in the supreme court within 20 days from the date of judgment is not sought in
apt time and a motion to dismiss should be granted.  Sitler v. Brians, 126
Colo. 370, 251 P.2d 319 (1952).
<P>Moreover, an application to advance a cause to the head of the calendar in
the supreme court will not be considered until the abstract and all the briefs
have been filed in accordance with the rule of court, and the case is ready for
submission.  Dickinson v. Freed, 24 Colo. 483, 52 P.209 (1898).
<P>And objections of contestor not presented by the verified statement of
contest cannot be considered on review. Israel v. Wood, 98 Colo. 495, 56 P.2d
1324 (1936).
<P>When dismissal judgment must be affirmed. If the dismissal of an election
contest is proper upon any ground, whether or not the trial court relied
thereon, the judgment must be affirmed.  Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo. 309, 228
P.2d 969 (1951).
<P>And the reason assigned by the trial court may in itself be insufficient
to warrant the judgment, but if upon other grounds the judgment is correct, it
will not be reversed because of faulty reasoning.  Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo.
309, 228 P.2d 969 (1951).
<P>Thus if a statement of contest is insufficient to justify further
proceedings, then the judgment of the court dismissing the action should be
affirmed, notwithstanding the fact that no motion was presented in the trial
court challenging the sufficiency of said statement and no specification of
points with relation thereto appears in the record.  Graham v. Swift, 123 Colo.
309, 228 P.2d 969 (195l).

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-45-123.</H1>
1-45-123.  Contributions to members of general assembly and governor
during consideration of legislation. (1)  No professional lobbyist, volunteer
lobbyist, or principal of a professional lobbyist or volunteer lobbyist shall
make or promise to make a contribution or contribution in kind to, or solicit
or promise to solicit a contribution or contribution in kind for:
<P>(a)  A member of the general assembly or a candidate for the general
assembly, when the general assembly is in regular session;
<P>(b)  The governor or a candidate for governor, when the general assembly
is in regular session or when any measure adopted by the general assembly in a
regular session is pending before the governor for approval or disapproval.
<P>(2)  As used in this section:
<P>(a)  "Principal" means any person that employs, retains, engages, or uses,
with or without compensation, a professional lobbyist or volunteer lobbyist.
One does not become a principal nor may one be considered a principal merely by
belonging to an organization or owning stock in a corporation which employs a
lobbyist.
<P>(b)  The terms "professional lobbyist" and "volunteer lobbyist" shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in section 24-6-301, C.R.S.
<P>(3)  Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit
lobbyists and their principals from raising moneys when the general assembly is
in regular session or when regular session legislation is pending before the
governor, except as specifically prohibited in subsection (1) of this section.
Nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit a lobbyist or
a principal of a lobbyist from participating in a fund-raising event of a
political party, as defined in section 1-1-104 (25), when the general assembly
is in regular session or when regular session legislation is pending before the
governor, so long as the purpose of the event is not to raise moneys for
specifically designated members of the general assembly, specifically
designated candidates for the general assembly, the governor, or specifically
designated candidates for governor.

be heard in reply.
<P>(e)  After the arguments by the parties are completed, any member of the
joint session may offer the reasons for the member's intended vote.  The
session may limit the time for argument and debate.

proceedings.  The decision shall be taken by a call of the members, and a
majority of all the votes given shall prevail.

<HR>
<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-9-101.</H1>
1-9-101.  Challenge of illegal or fraudulent registration. (1) (a)  Any
registered elector may, by written challenge, protest against the registration
of any person whose name appears in a registration book. The written challenge
shall state the precinct number, the name of the challenged  registrant, the
basis for such challenge, the facts supporting the challenge,  and some
documentary evidence to support the basis for the challenge, and shall bear the
signature and address of the challenger.  The written challenge and supporting
evidence shall be filed with the county clerk and recorder not less than
forty-five days before any election.  The county clerk and recorder shall
notify the registrant of the challenge and shall set a time and place for a
hearing to be held not later than fifteen days after the filing of the
challenge, at which hearing the challenged registrant shall have the
opportunity to appear. The person challenging the registration shall appear and
shall bear the burden of proof of the allegations in the challenge.  The county
clerk and recorder shall conduct the hearing and receive testimony and
evidence, shall render a decision in accordance with paragraph (b) of this
subsection (1) within five days thereafter, and shall notify both parties of
the decision.
<P>(b)  In rendering a decision, the county clerk and recorder shall have the
following options:
<P>(I)  If the county clerk and recorder finds sufficient evidence to support
the allegations in the challenge, the registered elector's name shall be
canceled from the registration book;
<P>(II)  If the county clerk and recorder finds some evidence but not
sufficient evidence to support the allegations in the challenge, the
registration record of the elector may be marked with the word "Inactive", and
the procedures of section 1-2-224 in regard to registered electors who fail to
vote in a general election shall apply; or
<P>(III)  If the county clerk and recorder finds no evidence to support the
allegations in the challenge, the challenge to cancel the registered elector's
name from the registration book shall be denied.
<P>(2)  All appeals from the decision of the county clerk and recorder shall
be to the district court within three days after the decision is issued. The
appellant shall file in the district court a verified petition setting forth
the facts presented at the hearing, the decision of the county clerk and
recorder, and the basis for the appeal.  Within twenty-four hours, the clerk of
the district court shall mail to the other party a notice of the appeal and the
time set for hearing, which shall be not less than three days nor more than
five days after the date of filing.
<P>(3)  The court shall hear the testimony and other evidence and investigate
summarily and, within forty-eight hours after the close of the evidence,
determine whether or not the charges are sustained.  Only competent legal
evidence shall be received at the hearing or considered by the court, and no
name registered in accordance with law shall be canceled from the registration
book unless it is proven that the challenged person does not reside at the
address provided by the person at the time of registration.  No presumption
shall be made against any person whose registration is challenged merely
because of the failure of that person to attend the hearing. The court shall
have the power to subpoena any person as a witness at the hearing and make any
necessary investigation to ascertain the truth of any of the charges in the
petition if the method of the investigation does not cause unnecessary delay or
interfere with the final disposition of the cause within the time provided for
in this section.  The hearing on any petition shall be summary and final and
shall not be subject to delay.  At the close of the hearing, the court shall
announce the names in the petition as to which the charges have been sustained
and shall direct the clerk of the court to certify forthwith to the county
clerk and recorder the lists of names of those persons, with their addresses,
arranged alphabetically and according to precinct. The county clerk and
recorder, upon receipt of the list from the court, shall forthwith cancel those
names from the registration book for the proper precinct with the notation that
the names were canceled pursuant to court order, giving the date of the order.
The decision of the court is final, and no appeal shall lie to any other court;
except that the supreme court, in the exercise of its discretion, may review
any such proceedings in a summary way.

<H1>Colorado State Statute 1-1-113.</H1>
1-1-113.  Neglect of duty and wrongful acts. (1)  When any controversy
arises between any official charged with any duty or function under this code
and any candidate, or any officers or representatives of a political party, or
any persons who have made nominations or when any eligible elector files a
verified petition in a district court of competent jurisdiction alleging that a
person charged with a duty under this code has committed or is about to commit
a breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act, after notice to the official
which includes an opportunity to be heard, upon a finding of good cause, the
district court shall issue an order requiring substantial compliance with the
provisions of this code.  The order shall require the person charged to
forthwith perform the duty or to desist from the wrongful act or to forthwith
show cause why the order should not be obeyed.  The burden of proof is on the
petitioner.
<P>(2)  The petitioner shall be required to deposit in court the statutory
witness fees pursuant to section 13-33-102, C.R.S., for each person cited or
summoned into court as a party or a witness, to be paid to the party or witness
if the charge is not sustained.  The money so deposited shall be returned to
the party depositing it if any of the charges are sustained.
<P>(3)  The proceedings may be reviewed and finally adjudicated by the
supreme court of this state, if either party makes application to the supreme
court within three days after the district court proceedings are terminated,
unless the supreme court, in its discretion, declines jurisdiction of the case.
<P>(4)  Except as otherwise provided in this part 1, the procedure specified
in this section shall be the exclusive method for the adjudication of
controversies arising from a breach or neglect of duty or other wrongful act
that occurs prior to the day of an election.

<P>Annotator's note. Since  1-1-113 is similar to  1-1-112 as it existed
prior to the 1992 repeal and reenactment of article 1 of this title, a relevant
case construing that provision has been included in the annotations to this
section.
<P>Authority of courts to determine election controversies when no candidate
declared duly elected.  State constitutional provisions and statutes permitting
general assembly to judge election of members does not limit subject matter
jurisdiction of district court to hear controversies related to elections where
no candidate is yet declared duly elected by secretary of state.  Meyer v.
Lamm, 846 P.2d 862 (Colo. 1993) (decided under former  1-1-112).
