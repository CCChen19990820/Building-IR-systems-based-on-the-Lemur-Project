<h1>Tilting at Windmills</h1>

<strong><em>by Zlatko Dukic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 4/11/96</h2>

During the last weekend in March, personalities from the parties and
associations and organizations from almost all parts of the territory
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, met in Tuzla and not for the first time; this 
association has been known for a while under the name of the Democratic 
Alternative.  Specifically, we have in mind the representatives of the
both Social Democratic parties in Bosnia-Hercegovina, SDP and UBSD, then
the representatives of the opposition parties from the Serb entity and
the representatives of various associations similar to Circle 99 from
Sarajevo and Civic Forum from Tuzla.  The topic for discussion  at the meeting
was "Democratic and free elections, the precondition for the lasting and stable
peace."  On its second day the conference tackled "the role of media
in the reintegration of the country."<P>

Summarizing the achievements, the leader of the Tuzla Civic Forum, Vehid Sehic,
claimed that the people from the Democratic Alternative had realized a long
time ago that the Dayton Agreement hadn't brought real peace but only a 
ceasefire.  For this we should "thank" the ruling oligarchies which,
exactly because they accepted under the pressure a difficult and hurtful
compromise, have practically lost the legitimacy of the peace builders.  This
can be easily demonstrated on the example of the Federation: the ruling
duet is the greatest opposition to each other; therefore it would be the
most democratic and honorable if they would give up their places to those 
who can, know how and are willing to make democratic steps without
"spicing them up" with fervent nationalism.<P>

<strong>Democracy or a stable</strong>: On this occasion, in one place it 
was possible to find several opposition leaders, for example Bogic Bogicevic,
Vlatko Dolocek, Neda Milicevic, Sejfudin Tokic, Boro Bjelobrk, from the
federal side and Miodrag Zivanovic, Milorad Dodik or Brano Miljus from the
Serb entity side; this demonstrates that the aforementioned conclusion is not
simply a private nor exceptional opinion.  Especially after some illustrations about the transformation of the
public opinion, frequently illustrated with lively and exotic details, which demonstrate
that the psychological framework which has ruled over the last four years is slowly 
changing.  In connection with that, especially captivating was the story told
by Zivanovic about how at the session of the Banja Luka city council a fat 
representative used "facts" in order to explain why it was necessary to change
the name of Rudi Cajavec street: "I've heard that he was a pilot, that he did
a heroic deed of some kind...  However, we must find out with what intentions
and why he did that heroic deed; until we find out, no street in Banja Luka 
should be named after him!"<P>

If there are still those, more-or-less cautious, who have an inclination to ask
why the opposition (or "opposition") hadn't appeared in Pale before the last
year of the war, in order to "shine" in the middle of 1995 when a meeting
with our opposition representatives took place in Perugia [in Italy] (since
then a number of similar meetings has taken place), we should respond that
after all, talk is cheap and doesn't hurt.  Even those who were cautious
at the start have found out that this was true.  Simply they didn't not trust
the leaders of the opposition from the other side - Dodik and Zivanovic.  Now
after Dayton, the situation seems different.  And leaves increasingly less
reason for doubt.<P>

<strong>Secret dinners</strong>: This was especially obvious in Tuzla, although
at times the participants allowed themselves generalizations such as "all three sides
are equally to blame for this war."  Disagreement with this statement does not
influence the overall impression and the united position of the Democratic
Alternative of Bosnia-Hercegovina, which, in the common statement at the end
of the Tuzla session, repeated its demand to the international community to
pressure the ruling structures in order to force them to spend more time 
worrying about the implementation of the Dayton Agreement and less on mutual
(mis)trust and suspicions.  Another point: this should be done through the
existing institutions and not in the top party leadership, "secret dinners"
and secret planning meetings.<P>

One need not be extremely well informed and clever to realize that if the IFOR troops depart from our territory after only one year, a spark of new
war could immediately turn into a new conflagration. Sejfudin Tokic is already
blaming ruling national oligarchies for that: they hadn't asked the people
for anything and haven't so far done anything against the "federal mafia"
which is still influential, powerful and rich.<P>

The leader of Banja Luka liberals, Miodrag Zivanovic, goes even further, wondering
whether and who will (if the Dayton Agreement was put together for the state
of Bosnia-Hercegovina) block the crucial influence and open meddling into Bosnian
affairs by "the fascist regime of Franjo Tudman and the police-party regime
of Slobodan Milosevic, both of whom support the political and ethnic division
of Bosnia-Hercegovina?"<P>

That ruling teams do not care a lot about their peoples, although we should stay
away from drawing false parallels, was known before the meeting in Tuzla.  
Nevertheless, that knowledge now presupposes even more open and concrete
discussion of the facts which demonstrate that the rulers care about their own 
interests and not the interests of the others.  That is the reality.  As is
reality, according to Milorad Dodik, that Serbs are afraid of SDA and Alija 
Izetbegovic, as well as the Bosniaks are afraid of Krajisnik, Koljevic and 
the company.  Mutual fear feeds the rulers; on the balance of fear they maintain
their systems and further their interests.<P>

<strong>Tuzla model</strong>: "We must offer the Tuzla model to the whole of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, since that model is the affirmation of civic principles,
tolerance, coexistence, understanding and cooperation, which are the only
perspective of Bosnia-Hercegovina."<P>

These Dodik's words at this time give an impression of a persistent, but slow,
approach towards an utopian goal.  Maybe that's not true.  Nevertheless, from 
the current perspective, the Tuzla meeting hasn't received good reviews from
the passionate apologists of the national oligarchies; furthermore, even the 
decisions and the agreements from Tuzla were sharply criticized, including 
the decision to hold the next meeting of the Democratic Alternative, if
possible and safe, in Banja Luka.<P>

It is possible to get an idea of how realistic and achievable these goals are
from the commentary of Jasminko Hodzic, the young editor-in-chief of the news
program on the Television of Tuzla-Podrinje canton, which is the official
media outlet and pet of the canton government and the canton SDA organization.
The editor's commentary, after all, boiled down to these "democratic" and 
"antifascist" words:<P>

"We will achieve democracy in Bosnia-Hercegovina when we do the same thing 
Americans did a long time ago: when we put our reds into reservations!"<P>

<h1> Another President</h1><p>

<hr>

Speaking on behalf of the president of the republic, his envoy emphasized that there were three leading ideas shared by all antifascists: "Never forget, never forgive and never again allow the repetition of the horrors which occured in the fascist camps."  He said these words at the commemoration of the 50 years since the prisoner break out from the Ustashe concentration camp in Jasenovac, organized  last Thursday by the Association of Antifascist Veterans.  After extending the president's greetings to the audience, his envoy emphasized that the commemorations like that one and the common effort in building of the united Europe urge new generations to never forget the fascist crimes.  Together with the envoy of the president of the republic, a high ranking officer also attended the ceremony as a military representative.<P>

The name of the president who devoted so much attention to the commemoration of the Ustashe victims held in Zagreb is <strong>Bill Clinton</strong>, and the republic whose leader he is is the United States of America;  the envoy who sharply denounced fascism is the American ambassador [in Croatia],<strong>Peter Galbraight</strong>, and the officer was the American military attache in Croatia.<p>

The president of the Association of Antifascist Veterans <strong>Ivan Fumic</strong>,
Jewish community president, Dr. <strong>Ognjen Kraus</strong> and the president of the Union of Roma <strong>Vid Bogdan</strong> also spoke at the commemoration.  Dr. <strong>Franjo Tudman</strong> didn't send his envoy; the Croatian Army neither.  Croatian president is certainly preoccupied with the preparations for the trip to London to the celebration of the 50th anniversary of victory against fascism.  <em>Glede & unatoc</em>, that is only a sign of his consistency.  Yes to antifascism, but only abroad.  At home, it is another story... <P>

<h1>Dossier: <a NAME="pakrackapoljana">Pakracka Poljana, Part 1</a></h1>

<h2><i> Viktor Ivancic <br>  Feral Tribune, 8/21/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

<strong><em>Feral</em> has recently obtained original documents which were submitted as the incriminating evidence together with the indictment against Tomislav Mercep and the members of the reserve Police unit under his command; the indictment mentions a number of murders and other criminal acts committed in Pakracka Poljana at the end of '91 and the beginning of '92.  The official report made by investigating detectives from the Zagreb Police Department (PD), compiled after the end of the investigation, contains unequivocal confessions of the accused as well as the testimony given by those who were brutally assaulted in Poljana.  These papers disappeared in darkness as the result of a signal from above.  Now when the Croatian justice system has cynically rattled its chain of absurd events, there are many more than 130,000 reasons for exposing these documents to  public scrutiny.</strong><P>

<hr> 

"Croatia is today an independent country; human rights and civic freedoms are fully respected; but we shall never allow that someone has more rights than us [Croatians] ourselves."<P>

These were the words of the Croatian knight <strong>Tomislav Mercep</strong> in July 1994, at the opening of a UHDDR [Association of the Croatian Volunteers from the Patriotic War] branch in Pula.  A year later, it turned out that his observations about the respect of civic freedoms and the surplus of rights for "us ourselves" were accurate.  The district Court in Zagreb awarded to Mercep 130,000 kuna [Croatian currency] for "the severity of experienced pain"  caused by the article "Killing Fields in Pakracka Poljana" (<em>Feral Tribune</em>, issue 433).  The article very delicately and cautiously treats the murders and crimes committed by the members of the the reserve police unit under command of Tomislav Mercep.<P>

The court in Zagreb passed the verdict based on the plaintiff's testimony "in which the court has complete confidence," because it was "delivered with confidence and clarity."  The verdict also says the following:" It is undeniable that the plaintiff has never been sentenced for a criminal act related to a murder of a robbery; hence it cannot be imputed that the unit under his command committed any crimes or robberies, as is claimed in the article in question."  Therefore, it was concluded that in the <em>Feral</em> article, "the plaintiff's dignity, honor and stature are severely offended and that his morality, and his reputation of a man and a veteran from the Patriotic war, who has been decorated several times for his successes in war operations, are questioned."<P>

<h2>Invisible Corpses</h2>

"Dossier Pakracka Poljana", full of violence, fear and blood, was closed and put away in the central <em>catacombs</em> of Croatian jurisprudence more than three years ago.  That, so far the most perverted act of debauchery against the rule of law, a game in which  honorable politicians, judges, patriots and warriors took part, was performed quietly but efficiently;  after confessing their crimes, the criminals were released; some of them achieved prominence in politics, others were decorated by the head of the state " for courageous acts performed in the war" and some, with a bag full of "donated" kunas are getting ready for a plastic operation in order to give facelift to their flabby "morality and reputation of a man and a veteran from the Patriotic war."<P>

<h2>Seks in Ambush</h2>

In June 1994, <strong>Milan Vukovic</strong>, at the time the Supreme Court president and the president of the commission for war crimes, said that the chain of murders and violence in Pakracka Poljana was a fabrication.  He concluded that war crimes had not been committed by the Croatian side - at least that "he doesn't know for a single court case of that kind".  Then he added: "A mass grave with supposedly 200 killed persons was found in the Pakrac area last year.  The exhumation found only 18 corpses.  I was present when Mr. <strong>Sharif Bassiouni</strong>, the president of the international Commission of Experts, said that all corpses had been examined and that all were victims of fighting; there were no traces of violence."<P>

After shameful cover up of crimes, Pakracka Poljana was turned into a test for detection of the freshest enemies of the state, those who - by poking through the epic war journey of Tomislav Mercep and his golden boys - "persistently insist on alleged crimes of Croatian warriors."  A certain paramilitary weekly then accused <em>Feral</em> of trying to "turn Tomislav Mercep and his unit, all heros of the Patriotic war, into cruel murderers"; all that was "an attempt to undermine the Croatian state," meaning that "the ultimate goal of that project is disappearance of Croatia in its present constitutional shape"!<P>

Former State prosecutor <strong>Vladimir Seks</strong> assessed that the casting of a moral shadow on the so-called Mercep's unit aims to "soil the whole patriotic war, especially volunteers."  Those who do that "are trying to soil their honor and to portray their leaders as ordinary criminals," and "attempt to claim that the Croatian state policy has, at least, tolerated war crimes." Finally the enemy payed the price; with that punishment all more visible factors were satisfied: Tomislav Mercep received 130,000 Kunas, patriotic war a cleaning fluid  and Croatian state policy Vladimir Seks' reserve honor.<P>

<h2>Deaf and Dumb</h2>

What happened with the crimes?  Indictment against Tomislav Mercep and the members of the reserve police unit under his command was filed in February 1992, because of the series of murders and other criminal acts committed in Pakracka Poljana at the end of '91 and the beginning of '92.  <em>Feral</em> obtained the original documents which were submitted as the incriminating evidence with the indictment: the official report of Zagreb PD inspectors made after the conclusion of the investigation, contains unequivocal confessions of the accused as well as the testimony of the victims of brutal violence in Pakracka Poljana. These papers disappeared in darkness as the result of a signal from above.  Now when the Croatian justice system has cynically rattled its chain of absurd events, there are many more than 130,000 reasons for exposing  these documents to public scrutiny.<P>

Several testimonies, which we are publishing in this <em>Dossier</em>, are only a small part of the voluminous police documentation about the crimes of the so-called Mercep's unit; this part is just sufficient to give an idea of the atmosphere in which this wild cordon of death acted. However, it is only a small part of the whole truth about the events in Pakracka Poljana.  Serial executions, kidnappings, torture of prisoners in the Pakrac jail, blackmail and banditry...  Due to the hellish conspiracy of political and judicial power brokers these crimes remain unpunished.  Probably the moral is that in the state of Croatia it is not that important that the justice is blind as much as it is important that everyone else is deaf and dumb.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Assembly Line of Death</h2>

Department for suppression of ordinary crimes in the Zagreb PD, submitted to the district court judge on 2/3/1992 an indictment against 16 members of the reserve police unit in Pakracka Poljana; among them was the commander of the unit, <strong>Tomislav Mercep</strong>.  "An unknown number of unidentified persons," from the same unit who had taken part in the crimes were also indicted.  Police knew some of them only by their nicknames: <strong>Bego, Mika, Zuti, Glava, Celo...</strong><P>

The indictment, signed by the head of the department, <strong>Ante Gugic</strong>, states that the members of the unit under command of Tomislav Mercep, the accused <Strong>Miroslav Bajramovic</strong>, <strong>Stjepan Mandarelo</strong> and a few others, on 10/31/1991 following the orders of their commander <strong>Zvonimir Trusic</strong> abducted <strong>Milos Ivosevic</strong>, <strong>Rade Paic</strong> and <strong>Marko Gruic</strong> at the building site of Ivosevic's house in Zagreb (81 Rudeska cesta).  They took them to Pakracka Poljana and handed them over to <strong>Branko Saric</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Kosa</strong>, the headquarters commander at the time, who kept them imprisoned for 10 days.<P>

"During that time, the accused <strong>Mijo Jajic</strong> and other members of the unit physically mistreated the victims (beatings, electric shocks and other)".  During the night between 11/11 and 11/12 the three victims, together with nine other unidentified prisoners, were taken to the village of Bujavica near Pakrac and massacred in the cellar of a family house.<P>

The indictment also states that, following the orders of <strong>Tomislav Mercep</strong> and <strong>Zvonimir Trusic</strong>, <strong>Igor Mikola</strong> and <strong>Sinisa Rimac</strong> abducted <strong>Ina Zoricic-Nuic</strong> a.k.a. <strong>Marina</strong>, who was a member of the crisis headquarters in the borough of Kraljevica near the city of Rijeka, from the burial of <strong>Pavo Mlinaric</strong> (also a member of the Mercep's unit) at the Mirogoj cemetery in Zagreb. After interrogation at the Zagreb fair grounds they drove her toward the locality known as Janja Lipa, about half a mile from Pakracka Poljana, where the accused <strong>Antun Jurgec</strong> executed the victim.<P> 

At the same spot, in November 1991, Igor Mikola and <strong>Munib Suljic</strong> executed <strong>Aleksandar Antic</strong>, a.k.a. <strong>Sasa</strong>, also a member of the reserve police unit;  according to the indictment, all that happened "according to the orders of and in collaboration between commanders Tomislav Mercep, Zvonimir Trusic, <strong>Demal Palos</strong> and <strong>Zvonimir Zakosek</strong>."<P>

<strong>Stevan Brajenovic's</strong> case is also mentioned in the indictment.  Stevan Brajenovic, a customs officer from Zagreb, was arrested on 12/8/1991; then, Munib Suljic took him to the jail in Pakracka Poljana.  "On 11/11/1991, around 6 a.m., Brajenovic tried to grab a rifle which had been set aside in the room in which he was together with <strong>Boris Tucman</strong> and <strong>Zoran Karlovic</strong>.  The accused Karlovic shot Brajenovic from a hand gun and inflicted a serious abdominal wound, after which Brajenovic was taken to a hospital;  his car is still in Pakracka Poljana while the accused <strong>Tucman</strong>, <strong>Bajramovic</strong>, "Glava" and "Zuti" gave the money taken from Brajenovic (DEM 9,700) to the unit commander Demal Palos."<P>

Zagreb PD submitted as evidence for these accusations, among other, testimonies and confessions of the accused, almost all of whom (all except for Tomislav Mercep) were in the District Court jail in Zagreb at the time.<P>

However, the indictment covers only a part of the bloody events in Pakracka Poljana.  According to the investigation of Helsinki Watch, for example, it can be proven that the following persons lost their lives in the jail in Pakracka Poljana: <strong>Mirko Cicvara</strong> director of "Ribnicarstvo", <strong>Blagoje Zabrdac</strong> accountant in "Ribnicarstvo", <strong>Duro Brkanjac</strong> pensioner from Kukunjevci, <strong>Pero Rajcevic</strong> head of the Bjelovarska Bank branch in Pakrac, <strong>Veljko Stojakovic</strong>, a worker in Kutina based company Petrokemija, <strong>Ivan Drekovic</strong> from Antunovac, <strong>Nada Radakovic</strong> and <strong>Milan Jerinic</strong> from Bujavica.  Helsinki Watch report also has a list of a pretty large group of the murdered villagers from the village of Kip, which is located half way between Pakrac and Daruvar.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Branko Velagic:"Tomi" does that with a knife</h2>

When one adds everything up, the members of the Mercep's unit from Pakracka Poljana stole from <strong>Branko Velagic</strong>, a Serb, a truck, a car (Mercedes),a motorcycle (Japanese JAWA), a tractor, a television set, a video recorder and a pound of golden jewelry;  the value of stolen goods is estimated at DEM 200,000.  During his stay in the jail in Pakracka Poljana, Branko Velagic was tortured several times.  The torture is described in the official report based on the statement given by Velagic to the PD Zagreb inspector, <strong>Damir Kukavica</strong>:<P>

"They ordered him to take his clothes off and beat him all over the body with a 'police baton' made from an electric cable.  At one point the forementioned man with moustache pushed the 'baton' into Velagic's large intestine; this was very painful.  Besides the 'baton' they beat him with their fists and kicked him with their feet.  Beatings like that one occured almost daily.  All of the above mentioned persons took part in the beatings; besides Velagic all other persons jailed in Pakracka Poljana suffered from the same kind of treatment.<P>

On one occasion, about 10 days ago, between 2 and 3 a.m., the previously described man, called 'Tomi' ('short, heavy built, about 30 years old; he always wore a black barret and fatigues') entered the room in which Velagic was held,  together with a few other persons.  They took him out of that room and led him to another one.  Immediately, they started beating him and 'Tomi' delivered a strong blow to his face, which broke Velagic's jawbone.  After that they took his t-shirt off and, while the others were holding Velagic, 'Tomi' took a knife and cut Velagic several times around his armpits.  The wounds were surface wounds, deep enough to cause a bleeding."<P>

Branko Velagic said in his statement that during the time spent in Pakracka Poljana he was taken outside the jail only once.  That night "a man wearing fatigues, whom others called Igor" came for Velagic.  The record continues:<P>

"That evening Igor and another man in fatigues (whom Velagic neither remembers nor can describe) led Velagic and Nikola Peles out of the building and pushed them in a car, a compact Japanese model, and drove them to a meadow.  There, they took them out of the car and forced them to dig a grave.  When Velagic and Peles finished, two other men in uniform arrived in a car and brought another prisoner.  Velagic cannot now describe neither those two men nor the prisoner, because it was already dark and Velagic was afraid for his life and didn't look around too much.  One of the men in fatigues pulled out a gun, aimed it at Velagic and said that he would kill them all.  Suddenly he heard the shots; Velagic at first thought they were shooting at him.  However he didn't feel any impact or pain; he only saw that the prisoner fell in the grave."<P>

<h2>Igor Mikola: I Killed a Friend</h2>

War path of <strong>Igor Mikola</strong> from Vukovar starts in September 1991 in Gospic where he, together with <strong>Nebojsa Hodak</strong>, <strong>Sinisa Rimac</strong> and others fought against the enemy, occupied army barracks etc.  According to the official report signed by <strong>Gojko Markovic</strong> as an authorized person, Mikola "didn't notice that in Gospic some of the Croatian fighters were abducting or mistreating civilians.  Before an action, the orders were usually, 'no prisoners' and 'burn everything'.  He claims that the orders applied to every person encountered during military operations, even women and children.  As far as he knows such ugly events didn't occur with women and children because all villagers managed to flee before the cleansing.  He remembers that when they were in Pocitelj a man remained in a village; then when they started to approach him, he ran away; however, he was killed from a machine gun mounted on an armored vehicle.  Only one house was burned in that village."<P>

Mikola thinks that <strong>Pavo Mlinaric</strong> was executing people even before Mikola and the friends arrived in Pakracka Poljana.  Mikola remembers that a German whom they called Sasa and a Bosniac who lived in Germany beat on prisoners and pierced their ears with knifes ("every single one talked after that"); in this way they obtained names of other persons who might be 'interesting'.  "That way they formed a list of persons which would be submitted to <strong>Tomislav Mercep</strong>." Mikola stated that himself,  <strong>Miro </strong> and  <strong>Pika </strong> took a man dressed in a military uniform who had a gun and two hand grenades to a meadow where they shot at him.  "Tomica Mercep and  <strong>Zvonko Trusic </strong> knew about this execution;  it is assumed that the guys who interrogated the victim also knew about the execution.  Mikola believes that the order for execution was given by Mercep or Trusic.  The murdered man was found a day later by some villagers from a nearby Croatian village.  He believes that they informed someone about this and were told to remove the body.  He is certain that the body was buried, but he doesn't know where.  By the way, he was rarely present during interrogations.  As he says 'our duty was to take people away and kill them, nothing else'."<P>

During the conversation in Zagreb PD Mikola remembered an eighty year old man who looked "as if he popped out of a movie: he had a beard, a fur hat and  opanci [peasant shoes]".  Mikola believed that the man had been captured by Guardsmen because he had been "their [Serb] boss in Lovska".  The man was killed by  <strong>Sasa Antic </strong>: he shot the man in the head from a machine gun from about three feet away.  By the way, Mikola said this about Sasa:" he was taking risks, he wanted to become someone, he was the boss after Pavo died."  Mikola remembered that Pavo liked "to do it" (carry out executions), and added that Pavo was "a legend".  Before executions Pavo would talk to the victims, allow them to have a last cigarette and fulfill their last wishes.<P>

The report based on Miksa's statement also says the following: "Pavo never told him how many people he had executed.  Mikula personally remembers killing 5-6 prisoners.  All together, including combat, he thinks that he has killed about 15 persons.  He doesn't remember the date on which the executions took place.  He thinks that this took place during the last 10 days.  He doesn't know the names of the victims nor can he describe them.  Their age was different, usually ranging from 30 to 50 years.  All executions were done according to the orders.  Nothing could be done without 'a green light'.  He remembers how on one occasion Pavo showed self initiative by killing a prisoner; after that Tomica [Mercep] screamed at him and sent him home for a few days.  Executions always happened during the night.  However, he has heard that Pavo and Sasa would sometimes kill during the day.  The prisoners would usually dig graves for those who were supposed to be killed.  This was done by two or three captives.  He has visited the jail from time to time and once saw a large number of people there; he thinks that the people he saw on that occasion were 11 persons who were later killed in a cellar in the village of Bujavica.  These people were killed by <strong>Miro Barisevac</strong>, Piko, Sasa Antic and <strong>Tonci Jurgec</strong>.  They shot at the victims from a 'scorpio', 'pumperica' and a machine gun.  He couldn't show the place where these people were killed.<P>

He was one of the people who carried out executions; the order for an execution could have been received by anyone serving with the unit in Pakracka Poljana.  When Mikula, Rimac, Brisevac, Hodak, Suljic and Sasa were not around, the commander would find  someone else to carry out an execution.  Normally, Mikula was not present when others were executing people; hence he doesn't know the number of people murdered by others."<P>

According to the Mikula's statement, the meeting [domjenak] in the Zagreb restaurant "Trnjanka" which was attended by Mercep, <strong>Branimir Glavas</strong>, Stipe Spajic, Zvonko Trusic and Miro Brisevac had the crucial role in the death of Sasa Antic.  <strong>Munib Suljic</strong> brought Sasa in a blue Volkswagen Rabbit, with police markings.  Sasa was disarmed at the fairgrounds; when Trusic passed by, he said:" What is he doing here; don't do that here, take him away."  Sasa was taken handcuffed to Pakracka Poljana; there two prisoners were picked out and they dug a hole at a meadow.  Sasa told Mikola: "You should kill me, but quickly." Mikola responded:" Don't be afraid." Sasa turned and asked him: "How do you want me to stand?" He told him to kneel.  When Sasa knelt, Mikola shot him from a hand gun in the back of the head.  He thought that he shot from a "zbrojovka" which he usually carried with him.  When the dead man fell in the hole he fired another bullet, into his heart.  After that the two prisoners buried the corpse.  Rimac and Suljic were also present at that execution.  The report also says this:"  He remembers that he was a good friend of Sasa.  Sasa even gave him a sweat shirt as a present in Osijek and also gave him a gun.  The day before the execution they went for a walk around the city [Zagreb] and had fun.  He thinks that Sasa's murder was a test, the purpose of which was to check how obedient he was and whether he was ready to follow any orders.  He believes that he would have been next if he refused to obey that order."<P>

Mikola also stated that he thought that people from Zagreb were also brought to Poljana.  He remembered that on one occasion Mlinaric together with Tonci went to Istria [peninsula in the far west of Croatia, several hundreds of miles from Pakracka Poljana and Zagreb], but he didn't know if they were supposed to pick someone up or whether Pavo simply wanted to visit a woman who lived there.  As he said:" People could be brought from anywhere."  Mikola said that he often went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to see "Tomica [Mercep] and Kvaternik." "He was allowed to visit whenever he wanted.  He remembers that on one occasion he was in front of the minister's office while Tomica was talking to the minister.  He heard that the minister was telling Tomica that some guys had 'screwed up' in Gospic."<P>

<h1>A Chronicle of Violence</h1>

<strong><em>by Viktor Ivancic and Srdan Kaic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, December 29 1995</h2>

A huge Split Bloody bacchanalia began as early as 1992; its epicenter was in Lora, 
a war harbor of the late Yugoslav War Navy, which had been just liberated by
the Croatian Army.  People from Split had been taken handcuffed to Lora to leave 
the base dead or severely beaten.
<ul>
<li>The murder of <strong>Dalibor Srdelic</strong>, which took place on August 20
1992, made quite a stir in the city.  Unfortunate Srdelic was unlucky to pick
a verbal fight with a group of Split Military Police officers.  He was arrested 
and taken to Lora where he was beaten to death.  Srdelic was from Split
and a Croat; consequently his friends organized demonstrations and a petition
drive.  All without results, although Military Police head, brigadier
<strong>Mate Lausic</strong> stated on September 17, 1992, the following for 
<em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>:

<em> I ordered the suspension of the 72nd Bojna [military unit] commander; also, all officers 
and soldiers from that unit who took part in that event or failed to prevent
the event were also suspended.  All culprits were made available to to military
judges and investigators, and you know that four members of that unit have 
been detained.</em><P>

This was said in September 1992.  By the end of December, 1995, nothing has been
done regarding the case.  Srdelic is dead and his murderers free.<P>

<li>Two months before Srdelic's murder, on June 14 1992, Military Police
broke into the <strong>Bulovic</strong> family Split apartment and arrested
brothers <strong>Ugljesa and Gojko</strong> because of the "suspicion that
they took part in the armed rebellion against Croatia."  The interrogation of
the rebels in Lora was "spiced up" with a brutal beating, which resulted in the 
death of Gojko Bulovic.  Ugljesa was released several days after Gojko's 
death; his "participation in the armed rebellion" had not been proved.  Gojko's
murderer (murderers?) has never got even close to a trial.<P>

<li> <strong>Nenad Knezevic</strong> was murdered a month later, in July 1992.
Like the Bulovic brothers, he was accused of taking part in the armed rebellion 
against Croatia.  The official version goes like this: he was killed during an
attempt to escape from the jail.  Still, an autopsy showed that Knezevic
had not been killed by a bullet;  he had been beaten to death.  His entrails had 
been turned into pulp.  Nothing is known about his murderers.<P>

<li>One of the first murders was that of the <strong>Gasparovic</strong> family.
Although they were Croats, they had been receiving threats for several months
because they were supposedly Serbs.  Enraged greater Croats dressed in fatigues,
broke into the Gasparevic family apartment in February 1992.  They abducted 
the Gasparevics, <strong>Dorde and Vesna</strong> and disappeared.  The bodies
were found lated on a garbage dump in Zrnovnica near Split.  Is it necessary
to add that the murderers remain anonymous until today?<P>

<li>At the end of August, 1992, a group of Military policemen broke into the 
Split apartment belonging to <strong>Dorde Katic</strong>, under suspicion
for collaboration with the enemy.  Katic was taken to Lora and released 
five days later as if nothing had happened in the meantime.  That case 
(known in Split as "the case of citizen D.K.") opened a lot of eyes and clearly
demonstrated what had been happening in the Military Police jail during those months.
Actually, Katic was the only victim which summoned enough courage to publicize
the story about his suffering: about daily beatings, torture with electricity,
about being forced to sleep in a dog kennel and bark like a dog, about the 
mistreatment of his wife and daughter, intimidation...<P>

<li> Year 1992 was very fruitful for the Military police 72 Bojna stationed in
Lora.  During that summer many Split inhabitants were taken to jail, beaten
and released.  Public knows about a case of a Split physician who was arrested
at a bus stop, mistreated and beaten in order to sign an empty peace of paper,
on which the police would later, perhaps, write his confession.  He refused
to sign; consequently, after two days spent in jail, he spent another ten
days in a hospital.<P>

<strong>After a series of murders and beatings in 1992, the following two 
years were marked with the smell of gunpowder.  One by one, night club
"Hollywood Dream" (end of 1992), restaurant "Stefanel" (Summer 1993),
the building of the Civil engineering institute in Zrnovnica near Split 
(Summer 1994) and a whole series of shops, cafes, houses and office 
buildings have been blown up.  All these incidents have something in common:
they were carried out so expertly that there is no doubt regarding 
the perpetrator.  The amount of explosive used in each incident was 
proportional to the desired effect.</strong><P>

<li>At the start of September 1994, a strong explosion shook all of Zrnovnica.
Once the dust settled down, shocked locals saw the demolished annex of 
the Split Civil Engineering Institute building.  The annex was razed to 
the ground while the building was almost untouched by the explosion.
The professional execution of the explosion demonstrates that the 
perpetrators were the masters of their calling and that they were employed
by the Croatian army.<P>

The mentioned building in Zrnovnica was supposed to serve as the premises
of the first Split independent daily paper.  It was supposed to be started 
by the dissidents from the privatized <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> and a
wealthy sponsor from Split.  However, his desire to invest in a daily paper
suddenly disappeared after the explosion in Zrnovnica.  The perpetrators of that
terrorist act  remain unknown until today.<P>

<li> On April 27 1994, a group of Police Special forces officers blocked
all access routes to Split night club "Mississippi".  The club was razed
to the ground and the officers also abducted one of the people who had 
been guarding the club.  After he was beaten in "Villa Dalmatia" which 
in those days doubled as the Special forces headquarters, he was dumped
from a car.<P> 

Because of that case which stirred public anger, [Police] minister 
<strong>Ivan Jarnjak</strong> arrived to Split and immediately promised
that "the authorities will show no mercy toward the perpetrators."
The result was an indictment "against unknown perpetrators"; a little later
Jarnjak put a foot in his own mouth: Police ministry made a deal with the 
owner of "Mississippi".  The owner dropped the case in return for 
a payment.  Vandals in police uniforms were not punished, and the price of
their barbarity was covered by the taxpayers.<P>

<li>Croatian Army members immediately realized that vandalism pays. 
Unsanctioned, two weeks later they broke in cafe "Song", had a
drink on the house, threw out the customers and demolished the interior 
of the cafe.  They slowly left the scene of the crime, got into 
cars and drove off in an unknown direction.  Military Police, which
showed up an hour later, was only capable of noting down that "Song"
didn't exist any more.<P>
</ul><P>

This chronicle is only a smaller part of the Split war without a war,
but it is sufficiently impressive and bloody.  The beginning of a 
new chapter of these leaden years is a direct attack 
on the city nervous system which is, under the influence of terror 
from the previous period, extremely
sensitive.<P>

<h1>Ethnic Cleansing in <a HREF="http://www.acs.supernet.net/maps/090.htm">Imotska Krajina</a>: The Explosion of Cooexistence</h1>

<strong><em>by Petar Doric</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 3/11 1996</h2>

During the last four years at least 50 percent of inhabitants with Serb nationality has left the territory of Imotska Krajina; about 500 persons have been forced, exclusively because of their "wrong" nationality, to leave and get as far as possible from Imotsko.  The exact number is not known since the number of those who were expelled from this region, which hadn't experienced fighting in this war, has never been tracked, and the authorities are trying to hide the fact that the number of persons still living in the area is significantly smaller.  Demolished, burned and thoroughly looted houses are a "taboo" topic in conversations with "the rest of the world".  Empty stare and automatic turning of the head are the only "replies" the locals can offer to the reporter's questions: who, when, why...?<P>

Overgrown dirt roads leading to particular villages, far away from larger roads, hide the consequences of the persecution of the minority population.  Villages and hamlets of Nebrizevac, Dragutinovici, Crnogorci, Kamenmost, Glavina, Ninkovici..., judging by the ruins, look as if they were on a front line, while in the village of Kraljevici no one is left.  All together, more than 100 village houses have been blown up.<P>

<h2>Training Grounds for the Warriors</h2>

"What can I tell you?" says one of the rare remaining 40 year olds in the village of Crnogorci.  "It's good now, we have the freedom of movement," he adds while we are walking towards the village church which was in 1992 "demolished from inside by a bomb".  The explosive device spared only the outside support walls.  "I have a family and a job, which I want to keep.  Let the bygones be bygones...  neither myself nor you journalists can change anything any more!  I will give you my name only if you promise to publish a picture under which you'll put my name and my statement that here everything is fine and beautiful... And that I adore the government.  Deal?"  So we closed a "deal" with <strong>I. Mandic</strong> who has so far talked many times to the police inspectors about explosives; he has lost the count of how many.  After every new explosion in one of the houses in the neighborhood, in the conversation with his family he has concluded that they had nowhere to go since all their relatives were from this area and that they had to stay in the village until someone blows up the house under them!<P>

"My son, we the Orthodox have lived here for 300 years... We were like "finger and flesh" with the village of Cujici (nearest Croatian village, auth. remark), but what can you do...  The peoples started a fight and we both went our own ways...  It's neither good for us nor for them!" says 70 years old Anica Mandic, the only person in the village of Crnogorci who, probably because of her age, doesn't think it is dangerous to talk to the journalists.<P>

There were no war operation in Imotsko and the surrounding area; however, numerous conscripted and volunteer warriors tested their explosives and ammunition on the villages with majority Serb population.<P>

"Look, I'm not trying to justify all those explosions, but the Serbs were, even before "Plitvice action" [one of the first clashes between Serbs and Croats], getting organized and provoked the Croats with arms, " says Slavko Cujic.  "There were a few good guys among them; they joined the Croatian national Guard with us.  The Serbs demolished a car which belonged to one of them and threatened his family.  You know what Imocani are like, they have a quick temper...  So, when that madness started, who could have prevented that?  During the operation "Storm" four men from Crnogorci were caught as members of Martic's Army [the Army of the now non-existent Republic of Srpska Krajina], all youngsters have left the villages long time ago...  They say that the youngsters have all left for Germany, but they cannot all be there.<P>

It is hard to justify the situation in the hamlet of Kraljevici, near Runovici, with somebody's "quick temper".  Several hundred meters of now overgrown dirt road leads to twenty totally deserted and demolished houses.  Eerily empty houses, garages, pantries, one almost untouched facade with a gaping hope in place of a roof, remnants of refrigerators, mattresses, piles of roof tiles and bricks...  As if the whole village of Kraljevici was blown up at once, then burned and deserted.  There are no people here.  No witnesses.  Exactly like in the villages of central Bosnia [where Croats were expelled by Muslims from their homes], except, there was no fighting here.<P>

<h2>Explosive in a Church</h2>

"You know, I suffer from kidneys and was in the Split hospital at the time...  I really don't know why this house was blown up," says one of the owners of "Serb" houses in Pejanovici looking at a ruin in the plot next to his.<P>

"We don't care about politics here," "adds" his wife.<P>

"Listen, if we were in Split, I could tell you some things," says one of the passerbys, " but it is probably better to wait for now.  You know, it's dangerous!"<P>

"Take a picture of the church in Glavina Donja!" adds another man.<P>

The [Serb] Orthodox church of the Resurrection of the Mother of God in Glavina Donja was built in 1772.  Its inside is totally demolished.  All valuable icons, church documents, decorations are missing.  Destroyed furniture and the remnants of the altar are covered by plaster.  The same church was recently shown on HTV [State-controlled Croatian TV] as "absolutely untouched".  Of course, it was shot from the outside since only the stone walls had survived the explosive which had been set off inside the church.  Consequently, the Church of the Resurrection of the Mother of God was turned into the church of St. Potemkin.<P>

<TITLE>Interview With Zlatko Lagumdzija, Leader of the Bosnian Opposition United List</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h1>Lagumdzija</h1>

<strong><em>by Vlastimir Mijovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 9/12/96</h2>

In all (post) war opinion polls Professor Zlatko Lagumdzija has been highly
rated, both when he was a state official and when he insisted on the opposition
policy of his Social Democratic Party (SDP BiH).  He is an intelligent and eloquent
man, with clear political philosophy and almost bottomless reserve of political and human
energy.  Dr. Lagumdzija is rightfully at the top of list of candidates of the opposition United 
List in the elections for the union of Bosnia-Hercegovina parliament.  During the
last month he has somewhat neglected his obligations at the Economics and Electrical
Engineering faculties in Sarajevo, in order to respond to huge responsibilities
which follow the election campaign.  Fortunately, Dr. Lagumdzija is known as
a man who successfully combines his academic and political careers.<P>

<strong>Both you and the United Opposition List were unpleasantly surprised by
OSCE; OSCE disqualified a number of candidates from your list, only to reinstate
them in the last moment.  Do you think that this "affair" was the consequence of
OSCE's fumbling or do you think that it is the result of certain political 
manipulations?</strong><P>

I am still at the top of the United Opposition List, although it was much easier
to notice that I was disqualified for a while, according to our state-controlled media 
who couldn't hide their glee at the fact that OSCE had disqualified myself and
a number of other honorable people who carry the image of the United List,
for example Bogic Bogicevic, Nijaz Skenderagic, Ivan Lovrenovic, Stanko Sliskovic.
Them and a huge number of people who are the essence of the United List.<P>

Because of that affair I became newsworthy for the TV news programs.  The last time I made
the news was on May 22, 1993, when I was wounded.  I was told that in 1993
one couldn't see happiness on the faces of announcers.  I suppose they
were ashamed to show it.  Because, at the time, I represented this state.
In any case, this affair is the result of combined influence of people who 
demonstrated their inaptitude and those who demonstrated their dishonesty.<P>

OSCE administration has made a huge mistake on this occasion.  I knew that
Bosnia is a miracle, but I didn't know that I was a miracle of nature, that
I was 340 years old, still alive and kicking, as their computer program 
said...  That sort of procedure is unacceptable whichever way one looks at it.<P>

<strong>Obviously, you were upset by the whole thing.  The whole United List
election campaign has been followed by incidents and accusations.  Starting
with the attack on your activist in Cazin and ending with the disruption of your
rally in Gradacac.  Has the goal been achieved?  Have you been prevented from
conducting the election campaign as you would have liked to?</strong><P>

Quite the opposite.  I think that they did us a big favor.  We, in the United List,
gathered around a single idea, the idea of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  Not any kind
of Bosnia-Hercegovina, but Bosnia-Hercegovina as a united state, democratic
all over its territory, prosperous country in which live people who get their
passports in order to travel abroad and not to flee from their own country.
We are honorable people.  I do not want to speak about myself; I will tell you
about Bogic Bogicevic, a man who persisted in the defence of the Bosniak nation before
a huge number of newly composed muslims, or these running on batteries, decided
to defend its own people.  While Bogicevic defended  Bosniak people, these
"muslims"  were trying to figure our how to win favor of those who were pressuring
Bogicevic to step on the neck of the Bosniak people.  We have one Stjepan Kljuic,
who has spent all of this war in Sarajevo, and shared the fate of thousands
of his compatriots.  Or, for example, Selim Beslagic, who has done a lot for Tuzla;
I do not hesitate to say that he was the leader of the patriotic movement which 
defended Tuzla and the surrounding area in the best possible way.  As they say:
in the Tuzlan way.  By defending Tuzla in the Tuzlan way, they defended the idea
of Bosnia-Hercegovina too.<P>

On the other side are people who volunteer to their aunts and uncles to go
serve in embassies abroad or, although lousy students, suddenly become advisers
for economic problems while world class managers go as volunteers to defend
Sarajevo.  Therefore, while some were volunteers, through SDA, in Washington, the 
others as volunteers broke into houses in Vozuca [recaptured Serb majority 
town in north central Bosnia] so that they can live there.
(...) We are ready for a tough battle if someone wants a battle.  First, we are 
offering a discussion about real problems.<P>

Take Gradacac as an example.  The aim of the incident was to intimidate people 
at the start and prevent the United List parties to organize.  I was in Gradacac 
in 1992 as the vice-president in the Government.  The first person to show up in
Gradacac as the representative of the Bosnian state.  I went over the territory
then controlled by "Herceg-Bosna" and refused to ask for a "Herceg-Bosna" 
pass from [Mate] Boban; I went as a vice-president of Bosnia-Hercegovina, 
dressed in a camouflage uniform posing as a pilot who was going to Dubrave
[airport near Tuzla] through the territory controlled by our coalition partner.
I was in Gradacac on the same day when others were in Bosanski Brod.  Gradacac
stayed in one peace after my return from there.  On the other hand, Bosanski Brod
fell soon afterwards because our coalition partner who was in Zagreb at the
time sold the town together with its people, Posavljaci.<P>

<strong>Has anyone of your candidates withdrawn his or hers name from the list 
after these attacks?</strong><P>

No, not one person has given up.  Many have told us that they had accepted to
be on our list because they considered our list to be the list of honor.  When
this is over, a month or a year from now, these people can with pride say that
in the 1996 elections they were on the only list which supported a new Bosnia-
Hercegovina, the only one which has a future.  Moreover, many of them accepted 
to be on the list to express their support, since they are not interested in 
politics;  after the incidents these people would come to our headquarters and
demand to have as many campaign appearances as possible.  Therefore those attacks
were counterproductive.<P>

<strong>How does the election campaign terror fit in with the extremely undemocratic
behavior of the "main" political parties in other parts of Bosnia-Hercegovina?</strong><P>

In reality, there are three separate territories in Bosnia-Hercegovina, three
police forces, three armies and three psychological territories.  On the territory
under the control of Mladic's Army we couldn't find people who would be willing
to run on our list, for any one of the parties (SDP, HSS, MBO or the Republican party)
, and remain living in that territory.  Large number of people called to express
their support but they couldn't publicly express that support because they live
under a criminal regime which would probably execute those people, either after
or before a trial.  Nevertheless, we formed lists of candidates 
, mostly with people who had escaped from those territories.<P>

On the other hand, there is the territory under the control of HVO.  The conditions
there differ from one place to another.  In some places we managed to get organized.
For example, in Livno.  However, when we arrived to Livno, our meeting was interrupted
because of a bomb threat.  Unfortunately, in other places the situation is much
more difficult; in those places no one dared to run as a candidate on our list,
even the people who live abroad.  As we have been told, in case they did run
on our list, there were two possible outcomes: the better one was that their
house would be blown up and the worse one that they would be blown up together
with the house.<P>

Then, there is the territory controlled by the Bosnian Army.  There, nobody's
house has been blown up, nor has anyone been killed but there are other methods
for pressure.  Take Bihac and the arrest of our fliers as an example.  Obviously,
we are dealing with people who joined the ruling party because they wanted to
substitute one single-party state with another one which is divided in three ethnic
single party states; to them it must seem natural to ban an opposition party flier
because it attacks the ruling party, as was written in the warrant.  This demonstrates
the unmodified mode of thinking combined with the primitivism which has 
always been there.  The flier on which was written that "peace demands new people"
was declared an attack on the ruling party.  It is interesting that they
copied the flier as "peace demands people" instead of "new people".
Even that was incriminated as an attack on the ruling party.<P>

<strong>SDP and the United List have taken a clear position with respect to the
claim that SDA is behind everything good and bad in this country.  You were
wounded on your official function; as a professional you could have stayed abroad
once you recovered, but you came back.  Do you find it personally offensive
when president [Izetbegovic] claims that only SDA worked for the defense and good
of this country?</strong><P>

I can understand if the president said this because of the election campaign
euphoria.  Maybe because he thinks that it is permissible to offend others during
an election campaign.  I must admit that I was hurt.<P>

I was especially hurt because this came from the president who knows very well
that the people from the United List have done a lot for this country and for 
its survival.  They cannot fool anyone with the story that SDA saved the people 
and the country, that it organized the Army.  This is simply not true and
everyone knows that.<P>

I'll remind you of the case of Hakija Turajlic, who was killed on official duty.
I was with him in the government, when he was the acting president of the
first and the only patriotic government in Bosnia-Hercegovina during this war.
He was murdered.  It is my duty to state this, because it hurt so much: he
is the example of how people are easily forgotten.  Especially those who didn't
promote the ruling party.  Hakija Turajlic was a man who represented a new
Bosnia at the time of hopelessness, a man who built bridges towards all sides
of the world: Islamic world, America, Europe and Russia.  He was murdered because
he represented a new Bosnia.  It is well known that he was murdered by the chetniks.
But the way in which he was treated shows clearly that his co-workers have treated
him unfairly and are now unfairly treating his family.<P>

I was hit by a grenade soon after that.  When that happened, I said to myself that
if I survived no peasant was going to force me out of this city.  Because
they don't have a right to do that, they don't understand this city, nor this
country.  These people think that they can only take, steal, from a city,
country or people, grab as much as possible and expel all those who have a 
different vision.<P>

All my property was on the chetnik side.  I didn't worry about that because I knew
that my most valuable property was in my head.  That's why I, as well as a number of
others, feel humiliated and offended when I hear that everything good or
bad in Bosnia today is due to SDA.  Of course, the bad is "the result of objective
circumstances".  This tells us that in SDA there are a lot of former Communist 
Party members.  They used to speak like that: "results of objective circumstances".<P>

<strong>How do you assess the contribution of SDA since 1990?</strong><P>

It is true that all that is good in Bosnia is not due to SDA, but due to the Bosnian
people, patriots, those people who sent their children to defend their lives,
families , honor and Bosnia-Hercegovina with their bare hands.  Four years ago,
SDA didn't call its members to join the Army; they called on all citizens.
When they founded the patriotic government, they didn't rely on their members, but
on all citizens.  On the other hand, it is true that SDA is behind everything
bad in this country.<P>

This country was defended with a heart.  I sincerely hope that we are entering
a period in which this country will be defended and built with a brain.  It
is easy to defend Sarajevo with other people's children, and to conquer 
Sorbonne and Harvard with one's own children.  Today, the most talented
children should defend this country by studying hard at Sorbonne and Harvard.<P>

<strong>I know that the people from the United List were optimists before the 
start of the election campaign.  Am I wrong when I sense that that optimism
is even stronger today, after a series of very well attended rallies?</strong><P>

That is correct.  I was present at a rally where a young man from Tuzla concluded 
his speech by saying: "We will certainly win, because we have nothing to loose!"<P>

<strong>Isn't that political minimalism?</strong><P>

No, not at all.  Minimalism is me saying that we have won by overcoming fear
from support for a seemingly utopian idea.<P>

I've been pleasantly surprised by the results of public opinion polls since
April.  The United List appeared at the right moment.  Had we appeared earlier,
we would have been accused of being political opportunists.  We simply wanted
to see whether we could unite;  if we could do that, then we could unite the 
country as well.  It was more difficult to unite these five parties than to
unite HDZ, SDS and SDA.  They can't do it, but we can.<P>

Had the United List appeared later, it would have been too late.  I've noticed
in the polls that the number of our supporters has increased twofold since
April.  Maybe that makes sense, since in April the number of those who didn't
intend to vote was very large.  Now those undecided voters have found a party 
they can vote for.  This list has also been crucial for me because I've realized
that the idea which we support is exactly the same idea which I supported
before the elections in 1990 and during the war: the idea of Bosnia-Hercegovina
as a normal, European, democratic and prosperous state.  I've been searching for
a political force which can articulate this idea and offer it to Bosnia-Hercegovina.<P>

I don't expect spectacular election results, I don't expect our triumph, simply
because I think that the ideas of the United List will fare differently in different parts
of Bosnia-Hercegovina because of our inability to reach our supporters, 
their fear and because we haven't received sufficient support from the media.<P>

<strong>It was to be expected that the state-controlled media would not assist
your promotion, but we were promised the assistance from the media supported
by the international community.  That project is rather late.  Your comment?</strong><P>

The international community has shamefully failed in its support for the independent
media.  That is inexcusable.  Horrible.  They've been saying that they would
establish an independent media network for nine months now.  In nine months anyone
can at least make a child, and they were not capable, although they had large
resources, to solve that problem.  Support for the independent media is also
miserable as far as the international factor is concerned, especially when
one has in mind how much is spent for other things.  I hope that people from
NGOs, various alternative parliaments and institutions won't be offended, but 
there was enough money to build and launch a satellite and buy satellite antennas
for everyone with a TV.<P>

<strong>How much will the lack of opportunities for public promotion affect
the final election results?</strong><P>

Significantly, but we don't find that discouraging.  By providing an opportunity
to vote for the United List and for the idea supported by the United List we
are getting closer to the idea of normal and prosperous Bosnia.  If that idea 
doesn't win today, it will win tomorrow.  It will win in the future.  Only then
will Bosnia-Hercegovina get on the road to prosperity.  Those people who 
today vote for that idea will know that all that is good in this country is
due to the ideas supported by the United List and that all that is bad happens
because of those people who have abused their authority.<P>

<strong>The ruling parties keep trying to divide their political plans into two 
parts: supposedly, now they are working on the establishment of nations and, once that
is finished, they will try to improve the living conditions of the people who
make up those nations.  What do you think about this approach?</strong><P>

This is a false dilemma.  At the time there was another false dilemma: whether
to save Bosnia or Bosniaks?  There is no Bosnia without Bosniaks.  They are
doomed if separated. (...)<P>

<strong>Before the elections in 1990, many publicly proclaimed that they would
vote for civic parties, but when left alone in front of a ballot box they
gave their votes to national parties.  Will this be repeated in this 
elections?</strong><P>

I think that many from the ruling parties will be unpleasantly surprised,
because they will be the victims of this trend.  We received messages from
a lot of places, asking us not to campaign there because of fear and 
intimidation, but to wait for the results on the election day.<P>

What is going on?  They've become "communists", they have a totalitarian
party and a state; this is a key difference.  People are afraid of them,
afraid to express their opinions publicly, but in front of a ballot box, 
when the big brother cannot see them, they will vote for someone else.
Because of that, I am an optimist and expect that the United List will
achieve good results in the forthcoming elections.<P>

<h1>Croatian Exercise in Grassroots Democracy</h1>
 
<strong><em>by Alija Behram</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 2/15 1996</h2>

During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, Mostar inhabitants hardly had any sleep; many of them got up with blood shot eyes.  The city greeted the dawn covered with snow, but its whiteness couldn't hide a sad and ugly blemish on the face of Mostar.  This unfortunate place reached again, as many times before during the year and a half of the cold war situation on the shores of the Neretva, the verge of violence and aggression.  Only a little was needed to restart the flames of war.<P>

The wave of violence started when a group of militant supporters of the tired "Herceg-Bosna" listened in Hotel for retired persons (where the EU city administration headquarters is located) to Koschnick's decisions concerning his arbitration on the territorial-legal project for the city of Mostar.  Mladen Misic and a handful of his bojovnici [soldiers] were dominant among the extremists gathered next to a bar.  Koschnick was holding a press conference for about 100 journalists in the hotel lobby and had to ask several times for the intervention of the European police in order to reduce the noise coming from the bar.<P>

When Koschnik revealed that both himself and Europe (including all mentors of the Muslim-Croatian federation, especially the USA) demand unification of the city, with single police force and the right of return for all expelled persons, the group of extremists walked out of the hotel.  It wasn't hard to predict the further scenario for the Croatian exercise in grassroots democracy.  As soon as the journalists hurried outside to send the first reports out to the world, the seat of the EU city administration was surrounded by a group of several hundred demonstrators.  "Mostar is a Croatian city!"..."This is Croatia"..."Koschnick go home".. are only a few of the "messages" that came from the unhappy crowd.<P>

<strong>Humiliating Experience</strong>: The demonstrators were soon joined by a new group, mostly women and children, gathered in the middle of a school lesson.  All this happened at the time when Koschnick decided to attend the opening of the restored Hercegovina Archive building, on the eastern shore of the Neretva.  A crowd of extremists surrounded Koschnick's car (which has bulletproof windows).  "That was a humiliating, terrifying experience,"  Koschnick would state later to the foreign correspondents who had a difficult task to witness and tape a wave of protest which was slowly turning into destruction and aggression.  A ZDF journalist found himself facing a Croatian extremist who threatened to shoot the journalist unless he stopped taping the events.  Fortunately he shot twice into the air.  All this time, Koschnick quietly sat at the rear seat of the car which was pushed by several muscular youngsters who wanted to flip the car over and throw the European administrator into mud.  They were swearing at him, demanding that he resign, calling him a terrorist and a Muslim conspirator...  Several men were jumping on the roof of the car while others were beating the windows and the trunk with wooden clubs.<P>

<strong>Mass Escape</strong>: The crowd broke into the hotel lobby and then "captured" the second floor on which the European administration offices were located.  Dumbfounded and terrified officials ran from one office to another searching for a way out.  A 70-years-old Bosniak, a high official in the European administration, almost didn't manage to get out through the side corridors; he jumped out to the hotel garden and sneaked over to the eastern shore. A few officials managed to escape together with him.  Journalists from several Bosnian media managed to escape at the last moment.  They were picked up by a European administration car which fortunately managed to get away from the angry crowd.  The crowd vented its rage on several (Bosniak) passerbys.  Among them was an old lady who was by chance passing from the western blocks across the boulevard.  Sky-news recorded as she was beaten on her head.  The most fervent demonstrators were until recently soldiers in the HVO [Bosnian Croat militia].  They were shouting: "Za dom spremni" [ready for the homeland, Croatian fascist salute during WWII], and the crowd replied "This is Croatia, this is Croatia"...<P>

European police was totally surprised and unprepared to react.  The policeman silently watched while the extremists were beating two members of the European police.  Nobody dared to confront the violence.  Koschnick was saved with help of IFOR.  He was transfered to a more peaceful wing of the European police building.  He stayed there until the following morning when he returned to his cabinet in the Hotel for retired persons ("Ero").<P>

Mostar inhabitants are wondering: who were the demonstrators?  It was obvious that there were not many urbanized Mostar Croats.  They were, they say on the eastern shore, usurpers of the Bosniak and Serb property, people who used the war for plunder; they obtained other people's apartments, garages, cafes, restaurants cars and other property.  Now they want to keep the fruit of their labor!  Among the extremists were certainly those who cannot get over the disappearance of "Herceg-Bosna"; someone from Zagreb has been fiercely saying to them: Croatian border is in Mostar, for now on the Boulevard...<P>

At the time when this article is sent into print, we have received the following message from the Koschnick's office:" I do not intend to step back nor to resign.  There is no reason to change anything in my decree!"<P>

That is what Hans Koschnick is saying.  The real Mostar inhabitants wish that Europe and the United States enable him to implement his decision.<P>

<h1> Budak in a Zrakomlat [air-beater = helicopter]</h1><p>

<strong>Cro. Writ. against Ust. Crim. </strong><P>

<hr>

According to the list published in <em>Vjesnik</em> on 9/17, the 26th electoral district includes a township named after <strong>Mile Budak</strong> <p>

The section of the Zagreb and Croatian public who still remembers how the Zagreb City Council at the beginning of 1993 denied the information published in the daily press that the Council had changed the name of the Duro Salaj street to Mile Budak street, was probably surprised to find out that despite the renunciation of the Mile Budak street, a township which prides itself with a name of the Ustashe doglavnik still exists somewhere in Zagreb.  This is even more surprising since the elementary school in the township, which has until recently proudly born a name of the author of the Nazi racial laws, has also recently been renamed.<P>

Although the name of Mile Budak is still very present in the street toponymy of the Croatian cities, his appearance in the list of the Croatian electoral districts seemed, apparently, inopportune to some influential factors, so they - judging by the list of the electoral districts published in <em>Vjesnik</em> on 9/30 - performed a small intervention: instead of the township of Mile Budak a township of Cro. Writ. Mile Budak appeared on the list.<P>

The idea that the addition of "cro. writ.", can be used to push, actually keep. Mile Budak in the names of the Zagreb institutions and streets was considered two years ago as well, but it didn't pass.  Today, after the doglavnik has suddenly been resurrected on the list of the electoral districts, the idea has obviously been embraced, if not as a brilliant solution then at least as the necessary way out.  Besides, as wise Nedeljko Mihanovic said paraphrasing one of the great masters of propaganda from the thirties and the forties, that zrakomlat, provided the word was pronounced 5-6 times, would sound just fine, it is probably expected that the frequent emphasis on cro. writ. Mile Budak will push into oblivion ust. crim. of Mile Budak.<P>

It is only surprising that this suddenly awoken love for the literature of Mile Budak <em>glede & unatoc<em> hasn't been confirmed neither in the book stores nor on the stage.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><strong>Death Squads Go on a Rampage Through Krajina </strong><P>

<hr>

It turns out that the cruel crime in Varivode was only a link in a bloody chain: seven elderly persons from the village of Gosic, hamlet of  Borak, located four kilometers west from Devrsak, were murdered in the early afternoon hours on 8/27/95. <strong>Sava, Marija, Grozdana, Vasilj, Kosa, Dusan </strong> and <strong>Milan Borak</strong> were, on average, 70 years old.<p>

There are no living creatures left in the hamlet of Borak .  Only a strong, unpleasant stench of the decomposing bodies of dead animals and inside houses old traces serve as a "reminder" of a drama:  blood stains on kitchen tiles, bullet holes in the walls, opened portion from the humanitarian assistance package on the table, two pairs of glasses, rotten tomatoes, <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em> from August 26...<P>

"On the day that happened I was taking food to the village," stated for <em>Feral</em> one of the indirect witnesses, who because of fear wanted to remain anonymous.  "I went to finish some business in the neighboring village and upon my return, about half an hour later, I found that the  elderly inhabitants of the village had been massacred.  They had been shot through their heads.  They lay on the thresholds of their houses, sometimes 2-3 of them together;  body of one of the elderly women was in a chair...  I was terrified and frightened...  On my way out of the village I passed an all-terrain vehicle in which there were people in camouflage uniforms..."<P>

Another witness said that the bodies of the victims had been transported to Knin in two police helicopters.  Allegedly, minister [of internal affairs] <strong> Ivan Jarnjak</strong> and his deputy <strong>Josko Moric</strong> appeared on the spot.  However, it is still not known how far the Croatian police investigation of these crimes has gone and whether the police has continued the investigation after all.  The victims of the crime in Gosic received at least a bit of Christian respect: they were buried at the Knin cemetery; crosses with numbers 543 to 550 were placed on their graves.<P>

<IMG SRC="/home/marko/public_html/pictures/feral12b.gif" WIDTH=446 HIGHT=298><P> <STRONG> Graves of murdered inhabitants of Gosic at the Knin cemetery</strong><P>

<em>Feral's</em> reporter was, on Friday, present when the corpse of 84-year-old <strong>Dusan Saric</strong> was found in Kakanj, a village 4 kilometers from Varivode.  His corpse had been floating in a well located next to his house.  Dusan Saric was seen alive for the last time when the activists from the International Red Cross delivered regular humanitarian assistance on 9/18/95.<P>

<IMG SRC="/home/marko/public_html/pictures/feral12a.gif" WIDTH=399 HIGHT=294> <P><STRONG> Body of 84-years-old Dusan Saric has been found recently floating in a well.</strong><P>

Krajina stinks of crimes committed by death squads.  In the village of Oton, near Knin, <strong>R.K.</strong> (initials arbitrary) is still in a state of shock.  He described a tragedy to the <em>Feral's</em> reporter: Croatian soldiers demanded that he slaughter a calf for them.  While he was doing that, he heard shots from an automatic rifle from a nearby meadow.  They killed his mother.  He buried her at the place of the crime.  She was born in 1906.<P>

"I was sitting in the kitchen and my son was asleep.  Then a four of them barged into the house.  They asked where our identification cards and domovnice [a document which proves Croatian citizenship]  were.  My son got up and they started to search through the house; they were pulling out drawers and smashing things.  Then one of them picked up a gun, put the barrel on my son's neck and took him away."  This is the testimony of an elderly woman from the village of Zrmanja Vrelo.  Her 50-year-old son was killed in a nearby forest on 9/29/95 at 5 p.m.; four bullets were fired at his chest.  The body was in the forest for two nights until the investigators arrived.  "The locals covered the body and guarded it lest someone took it away; they also wanted to protect it from animals."<P>

Commander of the former Sector South, <strong>Alain Forand</strong> has stated that the civilian UN police had found 128 corpses of the serb civilians who had been killed after the end of war operations in Krajina;  they gave all the available data to Croatian authorities but haven't received any information from the authorities regarding the investigations.  Croatian Helsinki Committee [HHO, Hrvatski Helsinski Odbor], after checking, branded as false " inaccurate reports that the Croatian authorities have arrested certain citizens of the Republic of Croatia because of the committed crimes."<P>

In Croatia, the emphasis this Fall is on the new democratic elections.<P></FONT>

<h1>Drafters of the Borders of Hate</h1>

<h2><i> Drago Hedl <br>  Feral Tribune, 8/21/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

<h2>Slavko Perovic, the president of the opposition Liberal Association of Montenegro</h2>

<strong>After everything that has happened in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina, do you think that a "peaceful divorce" of Montenegro and Serbia is possible, taking into account Serbia's strategic interests, namely, access to the Adriatic Sea?</strong><P>


That is a really difficult question, since behind it is the evaluation of the military factor.  But, we reply to that question by asking Belgrade: what are we going to do with that sea?  Are we going to pump it out, move somewhere?  The sea stays where it is.  But we would have to agree on the principles of payment for that.  On the other hand, FR Yugoslavia isn't going to be able to play the card of its military might for much longer: all the states coming out of the breakup of the former Yugoslavia will be relatively small, maybe even too sovereign;  the result of this will be the formation of pure local oligarchies which will be hard to replace through democratic means; I am afraid that all of us will somehow remain small, next to the big, united Europe.<P>

<strong>Let us return to "the evaluation of the military factor" which you have just mentioned.</strong><P>

As far as the sea and the fleet, which once upon a time defended an almost 1000 kilometers long coast line, are concerned, the forces which have been brought to the Boka Kotorska Bay have no strategic or military importance.  And now they want to take away the most beautiful part of the Montenegrin coast, Valdanos inlet near Ulcinj, a protected environment, designated as a zone for elite tourism, with more than 80,000 olive trees.  With that in mind, we asked a question in the Parliament: should Montenegro really defend itself with ships when the Montenegrin coast is, from the strategic point of view, ideally suited to construction of coastal defenses, like on the island of Malta for example?  It may be that the military leadership believes and quietly accepts the theory that Montenegro is already moving toward independence; therefore they might be preparing the fleet to turn its gun barrels on its own coast?<P> 

<hr>

<h2>Festival of Horrors</h2>

<strong>Taking into account the liberation of Knin and the part of Croatia known as "Krajina", do you think that these events will lead to the faster end of the war or to its intensification in the territory of the former Yugoslavia?</strong><P>

Milosevic will answer to that question and decide about [the war].  If he, more specifically the company which calls itself FR Yugoslavia, enters the war, that will be horror, a festival well worth seeing.  However, our assessment is that he cannot win that war.  He would experience a military defeat and we hope that he understands that.  Internal situation, both military and political, will force him to that conclusion; in spite of everything one cannot deny his cruel and pragmatic approach to politics.<P>

<strong>I have noticed that you are wearing a t-shirt with a logo saying "State of Montenegro".  Will you live long enough to experience the independence?</strong><P>

I hope I will.  People support us and because of that I am an optimist; I firmly believe that the people will get a chance to decide their own destiny.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Authorities Obsessed With Force</h2>

<strong>You are, therefore, firm in the conclusion that Montenegro doesn't stand a chance within FR Yugoslavia?</strong><P>

In that Yugoslavia, with Serbia, we don't have a chance.  That Yugoslavia will have huge problems because all this will last for a long time.  After Bosnia, it will be Kosovo's turn; after Kosovo, it will be Sandzak's turn, than Vojvodina's.  FR Yugoslavia is a state which wants to base itself on ethnic foundations but refuses to understand that it has more than 32% on non Serb population.  The ruling team bases its policy on the authoritarian , anachronistic political consciousness, which thinks that force resolves everything.<P>

<strong>Is the Montenegrin national consciousness so strong that the Montenegrin people sees its future only in its own state?</strong><p>

There is a sufficient will and energy in Montenegro to take that state out of Yugoslavia.  We are convinced that the sovereign Montenegro project is so advanced that it has been transformed in a wide and powerful river which Belgrade must take into account.<P>

<strong>What are the basic complaints about the relations between the federation and Montenegro?</strong><P>

Elementary understanding of things brings to a conclusion that something making up 95% of a whole cannot be equal with something making up only 5% of the same whole.  With that in mind, Belgrade's behavior with respect to Montenegro is natural, in a way; the power ratio is too one sided for that 5% to have any equality in the state sense.  Secondly, Montenegro's Mediterranean position is different from that of Serbia.  They have changed our orientation and want to turn Montenegro into a continental state.  Also, there is that old story about how Serbia subsidizes Montenegro.  But that is a big lie and a whole structure of political consciousness in Belgrade is built on that taboo topic.  Montenegro has always supported itself, one way or another; our economics experts claim that even in these conditions Montenegro would in a short time and relatively painlessly (since it is a small state with a small number of inhabitants and with a well educated work force) in about ten years, become a place for a decent life on the Mediterranean.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Fateful Division</h2>

<strong>Your party supports preservation of unitary Bosnia.  Taking into account the latest events, is the preservation of multiethnic and multicultural Bosnia  possible at all?</strong><P>

I must admit that with every passing day there is less and less chance for that.  Actual events reveal the monstrous plan whose goal is a tripartite division of Bosnia.  But those who want the division of Bosnia do not understand that that division will be fateful for this whole area.  In the divided Bosnia, someone will always be unhappy, and those people will be manipulated from two centers, either Zagreb or Belgrade.  War euphoria will pass and the three-part Bosnia will be the defeat of everything  noble that has existed in this space.  In that combination all of this area, including Montenegro, will be written off by the democratic world.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Montenegrin War Shame</h2>

<strong>But that won't happen without improved relations with neighbors.</strong><P>

We support Mediterranean integrations, since Montenegro has a Mediterranean orientation; therefore we would like to have excellent relations with all neighbors.<P>

<strong>Could you be a bit more specific regarding the relations with Croatia?</strong><P>

As far as Croatia and the Montenegrin attack on Dubrovnik are concerned, the attack had a hidden message:  for the first time a wall of hate was established between the two people; two people who have never fought; the wall was established especially towards the parts of population living in Konavle and Dubrovnik.  You remember that Dubrovnik and Herceg Novi were almost a single city; they made up a single tourist region in which there were a lot of friendships and interethnic marriages.  However, when the war started, we warned that Prevlaka is only a bait for an average Montenegrin citizen who had accepted the war campaign.  On the other hand, I personally know tens and even hundreds of people who refused to accept a gun and fight in that war.<P>

<strong>What about Prevlaka?</strong><P>

As far as Prevlaka is concerned, it is clear that it was a sham.  In the strategic sense, Prevlaka would have be interesting if we were living in 1850, for example.  However, today, with existence of rocket launchers, those 2.5 square kilometers of area don't mean anything to anyone.  From the very beginning we were proposing that Prevlaka becomes a demilitarized zone, that Boka [Bay of Kotor] and the whole Montenegrin coats become a demilitarized zone and that in the end, Croatia and Montenegro together modify Austrian fortifications on Prevlaka.  This war is the worst shame in the Montenegrin history.<P>

<strong>Is there support for your policies in Serbian opposition parties?</strong><P>

General opinion is that in a certain democratic sense, Serbian opposition doesn't exist at all.  We have relations with Vesna Pesic's Citizen Association [Gradanski Savez, GS], with Nenad Canak and Dragan Veselinov.  We have good political communications and an understanding with these people.  We also have relations with Vuk Draskovic [the president of one of the largest Serbian opposition parties, the Serbian Renewal Movement, SPO] but not as often or as cordially as with others.<P>

<h2>Serb Court Intrigues</h2>

<strong>How come you are close to Vuk Draskovic?</strong><P>

We believe that Vuk Draskovic has evolved in his thinking.  His SPO made a catastrophic error by making an attempt to compete with Milosevic over who is a greater Serb.  The fundamental problem in Serbia is not the national problem but democracy.  However, they were not prepared to accept that game.<P>

<strong>Having in mind the state of political consciousness of the strongest part of Serbian opposition, especially the part led by Seselj [leader of the Serbian Radical Party, SRS], Kostunica [leader of the Democratic Party of Serbia, DSS] and Dindic [leader of the Democratic Party, DS], and the new role of Milosevic, who isn't any more "the biggest serb nationalist", do you think that linking of that group with Karadzic could lead to a political instability in Serbia and even to a civil war as is predicted in certain places?</strong><P>

I could not agree that a civil war is possible in Serbia, since I think that there is no energy for something like that.  When I say a war, I mean a conflict between Serbs and Serbs.  In any case, horrendous and serious conflicts of a court character, with a lot of dirty tricks and a decorum which is customary for that sort of fights are likely to happen.  However, I think that Milosevic has enough strength and self confidence to use this situation as a factor for consolidation of his position.  He can only come out of this situation stronger than before.<P>

<h1>Peace Under Guard</h1>

<em><strong>by Gojko Beric</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, May 2 1996</h2>

Media reports of the current state of peace in Bosnia are more and more filled with developments of the kind which preceded the recently finished war.  Again, we are witnessing the "grass-roots democracy", an infamous Serb political invention.  There is shooting, beatings and stoning.  Victims are people who are trying to visit the homes from which they have been expelled and the graves of the loved ones.  As at the beginning of the war, groups of extremists are in charge of lynch and intimidation, while the local police ignores their actions aware that the incident has been planned by the authorities.<P>

A larger group of Bosniaks and Croats was stoned during their attempt to enter Doboj, although they had a permission from the Serb authorities and were escorted by IFOR troops.  Witnesses claim that the Serb thugs were led by Chetniks from the Ozren mountain who now live in the best Bosniak and Croat houses in Doboj.  IFOR soldiers had  shoot in the air in order to prevent a bloodbath.  Frustrated General Mladic who tries to fend away fear by claiming that his head is too expensive, threatened IFOR by saying that "a spontaneous revenge of the Serb people" was inevitable if a similar event happens again.  Therefore, if IFOR keeps preventing Serb thugs, Serb people will apply the tactics of revenge since the war has been lost already.<P>

Only a few days later, Serb extremists repeated their achievement.  This time they beat up with wooden clubs ten, out of about 300 Croat civilians from Tramosnica near Gradacac who had come to visit the village from which they had been expelled in 1992.  Then Croats took care that Serbs are not left without anything to complain about and prevented 600 refugees from visiting their homes and family graves in Glamoc.  Croatian authorities had previously approved this visit, but the number of refugees was supposed to be smaller.<P>

These incidents indicate that refugees are a detonator which can incite new explosions in Bosnia.  Their attempts to return to their homes, as is stipulated in the Dayton agreement, so far are taking shape of a war of nerves which can one day transform itself into a real war.  Return of refugees, even in a limited numbers, would signify the defeat of all extremists, especially the Serb and Croat ones. Of course, one can argue whether it is realistic to expect the return. Nationalistic leaders make the return conditional on purported reciprocity while in fact they try to prevent it with all their might; otherwise
their adventure in Bosnia would collapse.  They favor the situation which will
separate the nations all the way to the last individual, complicate their lives and turn them into apathetic, timid and servile subjects.  Although they are 
the signatories of the federal agreement, Croats and Bosniaks, are making
lives difficult for each other.  Evidence can be found in Stolac and Capljina
on one and Bugojno on the other side.  What can one then expect from Karadzic
Serbs.<P>

Belgrade and Zagreb have been collaborating in the business of the total ethnic 
division of Bosnia since the meeting in Karadordevo. The latest example is
Mostar.  Milosevic has recently prevented a group of Serb refugees from Mostar to travel to Mostar to assess the chances for return in order not 
to aggrieve Tudman.  Because, if Serbs were to return to Mostar, the situation in that city would change significantly.  But, in that case Tudman would also have his claims from Milosevic in [northern] Bosnia.  And in their game of political chess a draw, at least as far as Bosnia is concerned, has been agreed a long time ago.  Epidemics of hate is still going strong.  All of its departments are
still working, from media to the hitmen who intimidate the persons from the "other" nation.  The whole life has been infected by hate.  The members of the Sarajevo band, "Zabranjeno Pusenje" [No Smoking] were assaulted during their concert in the Zagreb club "Best".  The assault began when the Sarajevo boys started the song "Fato Mori Dusmanke," which reminded angry Croat patriots of Serbs.  The boys probably know that in World War II, Americans and Germans fought to the finish, but they obviously have no idea that American soldiers liked to listen to "Lilly Marlen" and German soldiers to jazz.<P>

Here, hate, regardless whether we speak about the beating of refugees 
or musicians, is the engine of a political project whose goal is the
division and the disappearance of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  But, the historic
drama of Bosnia-Hercegovina is that it cannot be divided.  The present
division was carried out with force and mass crimes against Bosniaks.
The peace is at the moment under the guard of IFOR, the strongest of
the four armies based in Bosnia.  But, the present peace will eventually become unbearable.  Two million people are still displaced.  This energy can decisively influence the reintegration
of Bosnia but, likewise, it can push it into a new war.<P>

<h1>Tiger Ate a Penguin</h1>

<strong><em>by Dejan Anastasijevic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 3/23/96</h2>

This week, another Belgrade radio station with the word "independent" in its name, found a new owner and lost its independence.  "There are no independent media today," said the new editor-in-chief about the new editorial policy which will exclude politics and concentrate on music and entertainment.  However, this event didn't provoke reactions of the European Union, State Department, Committee for the Protection of Journalists, not even Serbian opposition parties.  In fact, even the employees had nothing against the change.  They are used to having much worse experiences at their work places.  Of course, we are talking about the former "independent Radio Penguin" (frequency 90.9MHz) which, since Monday, March 3, bears the name "Radio Tiger".  That radio station crossed from the hands of a local businessman Giovanni Di Stefano to the hands of another businessman, Zeljko Raznatovic Arkan.  Both businessmen have an enviable international reputation: they have been sentenced, both here and abroad, for numerous criminal actions; some countries still have warrants for their arrest.  The history of the station, which has changed three owners in six months is also interesting.<P>

"Radio Penguin" was founded in 1990 by late Radojica Nikcevic, Montenegrin businessman, as "the first private and independent" radio station in Belgrade (Radio B92 existed at the time but was still officially a "socially owned" company).  From the start, "Radio Penguin" was an absolutely apolitical station, whose program boiled down to music and entertainment (mostly listener phone-in) programs.  Nikcevic gathered around this station a large number of young people who were tired of their fruitless attempts to brake through the ossified structures of state-controlled radio stations and were waiting for a chance to prove themselves.  "We were all full of energy and enthusiasm," remembers Darko Kocijan, first editor-in-chief in "Penguin".  However, some things were  unclear: for example, where did Nikcevic find money for the equipment and offices, how did he manage to secure in a very short time frequencies and permits which are very hard to obtain in this state (Radio B92 is still waiting for most of those permits).  Nikcevic shed some light on that mystery boasting while tipsy that he didn't know for which state's intelligence service he worked: federal, Serbian or Montenegrin.  Still, nobody had a problem with that: as we mentioned, the program was apolitical and fun, while the salaries were good.<P>

<strong>MURDER:</strong>  First scandal with connection to "Radio Penguin" (true, only to a certain extent) happened on October 7, 1993, when Radojica Nikcevic was murdered at the parking lot in front of his other company, Building Co-op "Sumadija", in Vase Pelagic street.  The murder was carried out very professionally and hasn't been solved until today.  The investigation never progressed from the two bullet cartridges, caliber 0.44 found next to the corpse and the witness testimony which stated that Nikcevic was approached by two men in worker suits while getting out of his car; the men shot him in the head.  The murder revealed two more things, until then hidden from the public: first, that Nikcevic, besides "Sumadija" and "Penguin" also had a business partner, Giovanni Di Stefano; second, that a short time before his death Nikcevic traveled with Di Stefano to Columbia.  This information was also interesting because several months later several foreign agencies that fight against international drug trade made discrete inquiries in Belgrade regarding Di Stefano and his connections with drug cartel from Medellin in Columbia.<P>

However, Di Stefano has always denied any involvement in drug trade and in the death of his business partner; after inheriting his companies, Di Stefano appropriately grieved for Nikcevic and only had good things to say about his partner (Di Stefano still keeps Nikcevic's photo on his desk).<P>

The takeover of "Penguin" opened another channel for Di Stefano's self promotion, something for which he had shown a lot of inclination since his arrival to Belgrade in 1992.  This Italian from the Pescara region, who hardly knows any Italian but speaks fluent English with [London] cockney accent, at first (falsely) introduced himself as the main owner of the American film company "Metro Goldwin Mayer" (and a dozen of less known companies); he was drawn to Yugoslavia by his great love for Serbs and everything Serbian.  More likely, Di Stefano sensed fantastic business opportunities in the country under international sanctions, whose government urgently needed services in the field of illegal financial transactions.<P>

In that sense, Di Stefano was, without a doubt, a great expert who paid for his education with a jail sentence which he had served in England (he tried to establish a bank without capital) and trials in many other countries, including France and the United States of America.  Like Nikcevic, he had a talent for breaking of bureaucratic barriers: for example he obtained a Yugoslav passport with the address in the immediate Milosevic's neighborhood in the extremely short time.<P>

However, something went wrong in his relations with the local authorities in April 1994, when he was arrested.  He was soon released but the DM 70,000 bail bond was never paid back to him.  That case did not affect "Penguin" at all: the station continued to broadcast good music and good entertainment programs, although the salaries were not as good as at the beginning.<P>

<strong>DISMISSAL:</strong>  The next scandal occured on April 27, 1995.  On that day, certain Mijo Medak, a driver in "Radio Penguin" was accidentally shot and wounded by one of Di Stefano's body guards.  For the majority of journalists who were incensed by extremely arrogant behavior of the station's owner and ever more infrequent and smaller pay checks this was the last straw.  In protest, fifty two of them resigned.  Nevertheless, some remained, and with assistance of newly employed underqualified personnel, the program continued.  Out of the better known journalists only Marko Jankovic, former star D.J. from "Studio B" remained; today he is the deputy editor-in-chief at "Radio Penguin".<P>

We can only speculate why Di Stefano decided to pass the station to Raznatovic.  Di Stefano is Arkan's old friend: at the time he (allegedly) financed Arkan's and Ceca's wedding, which was worth some DM 300,000 and besides that he used to boast that he was a general in Arkan's guard (although he has never been seen on the front).  Taking into account an old Di Stefano's statement that he "owes his life to Arkan", it is clear that if Zeljko desired "Penguin", this was an offer Di Stefano couldn't refuse.  Besides, he has been, for a while now, slowly moving the center of his activities to Italy where he is currently based as one of the 100,000 individuals running for office in the forthcoming elections.  In addition to that, after the suspension of sanctions it is uncertain whether anyone here will need Di Stefano's services in the future.  The jarring absence of prominent official figures at Di Stefano's wedding in June, 1995, is another indication that this might be the case.<P>

It is another question why Arkan, who directly or indirectly controls three illustrated magazines ("Srpsko Jedinstvo" [Serb Unity], "Metak" [Bullet] and "Ring"), would need a radio station.  Furthermore, according to Borislav Prelevic, Arkan's deputy and current editor-in-chief of former "Penguin", "'Tiger' will not rest until we get the permit for the broadcast of TV program."  In that way, former criminal, then the leader of soccer fans, baker, patriot and a businessmen will become a media tycoon.<P>

"Radio Tiger" like "Radio Penguin" will exclusively broadcast music and entertainment programs.  Prelevic promised to distribute long overdue pay checks, and a neon penguin with a top hat is still showing off on the facade of the April 11 sport center building on Bezanijska Kosa.  He will probably soon be replaced by a less likeable, but more dangerous animal from the genus of     large cats.<P>

<h2>And the music played on...</h2>

<strong><em>by Teofil Pancic</em></strong><P>

<em>Who are the owners of Belgrade radio stations</em><P>

Local authorities are very sensitive when it comes to claims that in Serbia, especially when electronic media are concerned, there is not enough media freedom and variety; although they do not tolerate spontaneous pluralism (the left of that kind has always been afraid of "uncontrolled developments in the society"), our authorities have nothing against organized, almost directed media pluralism.  On the contrary: whenever possible (and it is always possible), the ruling party and its trustworthy people, including those who "let us be clear are not the members of any party" establish a new radio or TV station.  This strategy is as simple as it is efficient: classical state-controlled media (Serbian TV and its subsidiaries) are used for ideological awakening of the masses, while "commercial" and "private" media are there to make sure that everything besides news programs passes by in the perpetual "Time for sport and fun"[well known radio program].  In this way, today every Serbian town  has a radio and/or TV station which serves to divert the population which has definitively had enough of politics.  All sorts of music tastes are covered, from turbo folk and astrological mumbo-jumbo, over easy listening to grateful teenage audience.  Because of unidentified reasons, the personnel of the radio stations, including editors and management usually refuses to talk to journalists about the ownership of the media house they work for.<P>

In the office of <strong>Radio Roda</strong> [Stork] our early morning call was taken by a young colleague who politely responded that as far as she knew, "unless something has changed in the meantime", Radio Roda belonged to Cukarica county.<P>

It seems that the employees in <strong>Radio Golf</strong> try not to talk about such a sensitive (?) topic while their bosses are away; they asked us to call later.  Later, a surprised voice responded to our question with another question: why does it matter?  To our conciliatory reply that maybe it doesn't matter, but hopefully is not a secret, the voice said that "Golf has several owners, and all of them are businessmen who invest their money in different projects.  You know we are totally apolitical radio station, we only play music (Vreme: "I know, I know, I listen to your station a lot...").  And your paper is very political, isn't it?  Anyway, you could be anyone.  Leave me your number and I will have the editor-in-chief call you when he comes to work."  We are still waiting.<P>

<strong>Radio Kosava</strong>:  In the most windy Belgrade radio station, a secretary responds to our naive question regarding the identity of the station's owner: "I could give you that information, but it depends on what you intend to do with it."  Since, it seems, I wasn't convincing enough regarding my intentions, the secretary finally responded: "you should call our marketing director around 11 o'clock."  The gentlemen didn't show up on time.  Nor did he show up by twelve.  Nor one.  As far as I am concerned, he hasn't shown up until today.<P>

<strong>Radio S</strong>: a secretary sounded as if she just got back from a briefing with the colleague from Kosava Radio: I don't know, I'm not from here, it's only us chicken here; leave me your number and I will have the editor-in-chief call you when he comes to work.  We established without any doubt that the editor's name is Godot.  By the way, it is known that the station used to be owned by the company "Genes S" (director Zoran Andelkovic-Baki), which is on the other hand owned by the Serbian Socialist Party [ruling party in Serbia] but the last fall, according to our source at the radio, Baki resigned in order to get out of the unenviable situation in which the radio was at the time.  Then he informed employees that "Genes S" had nothing to do with Radio S and that the program (introduced a while ago as a program with a lot of "cultural and amusement content") would have to finance itself and even pay a debt to Andelkovic's company.  Another source claims that Andelkovic and "Genes S" still own the station.  Whoever is the nominal owner of the station, the whole affair never left the family circle.<P>

Although peace has no alternative in Serbia likeable penguins are turning into blood-thirsty tigers, without any excitement.  It seems that the public has finally accepted the motto of the reserve state-controlled media: let us be happy!  Until we all become a part of the animal kingdom.<P>

A new conjugate gradient constant modulus adaptive processor is proposed and 
studied.  For the generalized sidelobe canceler signal processing 
configuration, this algorithm, called the CGGSC for Conjugate Gradient 
adaptive algorithm as applied to the Generalized Sidelobe Canceler, 
exhibits improved convergence over existing methods.  Theoretical expressions 
are presented for convergence and weight update of the linearly constrained 
constant modulus generalized sidelobe canceler.  Theoretical  expressions 
are then derived for the conjugate direction vectors.  These vectors are used 
to update the filter weights for a conjugate gradient adaptation rule.  A 
simulation study of the new conjugate adaptation rule reveals an increase 
in convergence rate for the generalized sidelobe canceler.  Performance 
comparisons of the CGGSC and the first-order gradient GSC for a BPSK 
signal with multipath and white noise interference  indicate that the CGGSC 
adaptation rule not only increases convergence by a factor of five 
compared to the first-order gradient GSC, but in some instances improves 
the bit error rate of the demodulated BPSK signal.

Dr. Nedjeljko Mihanovic in an interview given to <a HREF="/info/students/marko/cropat.html">Vjesnik</a>:<P>

In the same way that Kurds, Vlachs, Anatolis, Armenians, Bulgarians, Greeks and Serbs came to Croatia 300 years ago, as fugitives fleeing the Turks, they are now leaving, as fugitives, but now of their own will.<P>

They chose to flee Croatia.  They voluntarily  decided to leave Croatia en masse.  I would tolerate that act, because I consider that every person should have a right to freely decide where they want to live.  It is important that they were not coerced by our side.<P>

Because, you know, we cannot now send envoys to change already formed attitudes of the rebel Serbs.  Let them live where they feel happier.  Why make them unhappy?  It would be like applying pressure to Croatian immigrants all over to world to return in order to improve demographic picture of Croatia.<P>

The operation [Storm} was conducted in the most civilized manner.  We let the Serbian population make its choice.  They chose to emigrate.  Now, we shouldn't force them to return.<P>

It is not impossible that they would return as well trained terrorists who would act as a fifth column.<P>

Those who want to return in a good natured and conciliatory way should return, but, I repeat, we must be cautious not to permit return of those who would sow chaos and terror.<P>

We must not blame only two or three war criminals for everything that happened during the last five years.  Without support from the majority, they alone could not have done all those terrible things: killed, looted, destroyed and burned.<P>

We must not influence the psychological state of those people in the amount that we are doing now.  If they hate Croatian state, why expose them to psychological terrorism?<P>

If Gradisce Croats cannot achieve equality in Austria, they can move to Croatia, but they cannot demand to have their official language, their own judicial system, currency and education.<P>

However, as can be seen on this photo, published in <em>Feral</em>, the documents were stamped with a stamp which had three letters in latin script (INI), normally used by the Croats, instead of cyrillic script, normally used by the Serbs.

To accuse Croatia of inciting the Serbian exodus based on the three latin letters, after everything seen during the last four years and in the final stretch during the Storm, is a malicious imputation, if not the active waging of a special [propaganda] war against Croatia.<P>
As easily as Veselin Pejanovic, who accuses Political Department of the Croatian Ministry of Defense of clumsy propaganda which even breaks certain war conventions, we can counter with a question: isn't it possible that the above mentioned stamp with three latin letters came out of a shop on the Serbian side with the aim of waging a special war against Croatia?!<P>

<h1>Symbiosis</h1>

<strong><em>by Vlastimir Milovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 5/30/96</h2>

The elections may or may not take place in September, as planned, but, whenever
they finally take place, the advantage will be on the side of the currently
ruling, national parties.  Civic option has achieved a lot by managing to survive
in the nationalist storm of the war.  Therefore, it keeps open a chance for
its recovery, although not in a near future, as its supporters might wish.
The circumstances favor so called war parties, actually national movements
which in the Bosnian war storm became the representatives of the people, whether 
that people wanted that or not.<P>

On the territory under the control of the young men who wear uniforms with the Bosnian
insignia the Party of Democratic Action is undisputed favourite to win the
forthcoming elections.  The main reason for that is the merger between the leading
Bosniak party and the state.<P>

The Party of Democratic Action has grown so close to the state that it is impossible
to distinguish between the two.  If during the war and the resistance to the
merciless aggression one could find justification for unity, this peace,
no matter how uncertain it may seem, sets the obligation of respect for the true
democratic principles.  Those who remind that the process of the separation
of the party and state structure requires at least as much time as was
necessary for the merger of the two structures have a point.  Those who claim
that this separation will not occur without outside pressure do not lack arguments:
they point out that this symbiosis of the ruling party and the state will
defend its monopoly with all available means.<P>

Monopolies and privilege are multiplying progressively.  Those who have good memory
remember well how that process developed in socialism: how the Communist League
merged with the state and how the political monopoly of that party turned into
the monopoly and privilege of its members.  Membership in the ruling socialist
party was the precondition for any sort of political, social and economic 
success.  The state had a clear communist party infrastructure, almost identical
to the one we have today, but in the Party for Democratic Action version.  As in the
past all directors of larger state-controlled companies were members of the League
of Communists, today all directors of larger state-controlled companies
are members of the Party for Democratic Action.<P>

A great purge has been conducted during the last five years; it was based on the 
party membership;  it seems that it still goes on.  People whose good will we 
shouldn't doubt (although we can doubt their sources, since they are foreigners)
recently warned about this trend.  Still, the analysts of the OSCE, in charge
of the pre-election process in Bosnia, do not have to offer new evidence for
the claim that SDA, "especially in the provinces", applies pressure to other 
parties and independents.  It has been a public secret that the members of
the ruling party have taken all important positions in political, social and
economic leadership.  They utilize their positions in two ways: to perpetuate
their power and to induce independent voters to "make the right choice".
In such a way, they essentially use non-political methods to strengthen their 
power and the primacy of the ruling party.<P>

Politicians view elections as a kind of a war.  As there is a dirty war, as we
learned from the Serb-Montenegrin variety, there are also dirty elections.  
If something doesn't significantly change in the meantime, we will experience
dirty elections as well.  That is the essence of the warning issued
by the OSCE mission for Bosnia-Hercegovina, that the elections should be
as honest as possible, although this warning is only a version of an old and
worn out song.  Still these warnings used to come from the opposition parties
which in Bosnia haven't been treated adequately; therefore their warnings haven't
had desired effects.  European warning might fare better, since in this 
country we habitually pay more attention to anything coming from abroad than
to our own people, public, and political parties.<P>

The key problems in connection with the forthcoming Bosnian elections are
the consequences of some bad solutions from the Dayton Agreement, and the
lack of determination in the world community, and the guarantors
of the peace agreement, to help eliminate some results of the war, above all
the results of ethnic cleansing.  This topic is as old as the electoral rules
imposed on Bosnia-Hercegovina by the foreigners, the electoral rules to which 
anyone sane and honest has a lot of objections because of the aforementioned 
reasons.  However, in the obsession with, we must emphasize, the most
important defects of the election rules and pre-election situation, the problem
of party fair play has been undeservedly marginalized.  And this problem doesn't
only exist in Sarajevo, as the OSCE mission reaction indicated.  This problem is
even more pronounced in Pale [Bosnian Serb capital] and Grude [Bosnian Croat capital]
where the Serbian Democratic Party and the Croatian Democratic Community control
everything.  There, membership in other parties is dangerous for one's life.
>From that stems the need to, whenever elections take place, develop a situation
in which all parties and their members will be treated equally.  Absolute
equality, due to current circumstances, cannot be promoted at the moment,
but every new building, including the erection of the modern democratic
infrastructure in Bosnia-Hercegovina, starts from the foundation.<P>

<h1>A Burst of Conscience</h1>

<strong><em>by Boban Tomic (Radio Bajina Basta journalist)</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 8/7 1995</h2>

During the last week of July, the number of crossings of Muslims from Srebrenica and Zepa to FR Yugoslavia increased in the border area near Bajina Basta which shares a 120km long border with Bosnia-Hercegovina.  From reliable sources we found out that these people sought salvation over the Drina river coming from three directions.  The first one is in the south and leads over the mountains Tara and Zlatibor and further towards Sandzak.  The largest number of people have so far been caught in that corridor.  The second one is in the east and goes from Bajina Basta towards Cacak or Uzice and finally Macedonia.  The third escape route for the Bosnian Muslims leads from Bajina Basta and Ljubovija north, over Valjevo, to Belgrade and Vojvodina.  Not even an approximate statistics exists which could tell us how many people managed to breach the first control line along the Drina, but it is not secret that over 1,000 people from Zepa and Srebrenica have already passed through Serbia following these corridors.<P>

It is definitely known here that Bosnian Serb authorities have prepared a scenario according to which the Srebrenica inhabitants would be "sent" to Serbia.  With that in mind, just before the beginning of the attack on Srebrenica, local population was directed in fliers and instructions played through loudspeakers to seek safety either by surrendering in Bratunac, fleeing towards Tuzla and Kladanj or by crossing the Drina, for which, supposedly, the safety was guaranteed to all innocent civilians.<P>

The speed of reaction on the right shore of the Drina indicates that some of this is true:  border units of the Yugoslav Army received in mid-July special  instructions and warnings about future crossings.  First groups which crossed the Drina were detected in three ways: some of them voluntarily surrendered to the Yugoslav Army and police in Serbia, some of them called the Army from the Bosnian shore and some were arrested in Cacak, Pozega, Valjevo and Uzice.  The crossings extended through the second half of July and were especially frequent during the last week of the month.  When the news about these events spread, the border authorities in collaboration with the police department for illegal crossings organized the evacuation of the Bosnian refugees.  There are no reliable informations about where those who crossed into Serbia between 20 and 30 July had been evacuated; it is estimated that there were more than 120 of them.  It is assumed that they were deported to the Republic Srpska since the local [Bosnian Serb] authorities had expressed a lot of interest and veritable hunger for the refugees from Srebrenica and Zepa.<P>

The last wave of crossings over the Drina occured in the night between Sunday and Monday, July 31.  Then, in groups of 5 to 20 people, 501 Muslim civilians (until the writing of this article) crossed over to Serbia.  They were in a terrible condition, tired and exhausted.  For a few weeks, before they headed for the Drina, they had wondered through the forests around Zepa and Srebrenica.  Most of them swam over the Drina between Zepa and the village of Jagostica on the Serbian side.  The border Army units and the police questioned them and sent them to one of the objects reserved for the group accommodation.  Until Tuesday (August 1) it wasn't expected that the invasion of the refugees will be of that extent; on Tuesday, the number of refugees reached 500.<P>

On Tuesday, a political delegation and a Serbian TV team reached the secluded village of Jagostica in a helicopter.  Muslim refugees were visited by Serbian commissioner for refugees, Bratislava Morina, escorted by the Minister of Health and the representatives of the international Red Cross.  This delegation "carried out" the promotional visit to the refugees in Mitrovac on the Tara mountain where, in front of the Serbian TV cameras the statements of the "misguided Alija's soldiers who trust Serbia and its authorities" were recorded.  At the same time the work and movement of journalists were strictly forbidden in this region.<P>

Until the completion of this article (Wednesday 5:30 p.m.) we have received the information that Bosnian refugees were taken to the objects reserved for the group accommodation in Branesko Polje near Uzice and that all of them are "under protection" of the Serbian police.<P>

<h1>Gudelj Fired, But the Others Aimed!</h1>

<h2><i> By Goran Flauder, Feral Tribune, 11/27/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

email:FERAL_TRIBUNE@ZAMIR-ZG.ztn.apc.org<p>

<hr>
[Josip Riehl-Kir was a police chief in Osijek in the eastern Croatia in 1991, at the beginning of the war.  Through his contacts on the Serb side he has managed to defuse a large number of potentially dangerous situations and preserve relative peace during the Spring and Summer of 1991.  He was assassinated by a Croatian militia man with links to the extremist elements in the ruling Croatian nationalist party, HDZ.  Some claim that his murder was one of the sparks which ignited the wider conflict in eastern Croatia.  Mr. Kir's murderer was arrested in November, 1995 in Germany.]<P>

Justice needed almost four and a half years to catch up with <strong>Anton Gudelj</strong>, the man who murdered <strong>Josip Reihl-Kir</strong>, a head of the Osijek Police Department (PD), <strong>Goran Zobundzija</strong>, vice president of the local government, and <strong>Milan Knezevic</strong>, a local government representative in Osijek at the time.  During all that time, Gudelj has been known, both at home and abroad, as the Kir's murderer, since all facts indicate that Kir was Gudelj's target and that the others perished because they unfortunately happened to be close to Kir. In Osijek, however, the authorities have commemorated the third anniversary of the murder as the murder of Zobundzija, on whose grave they had laid a wreath.<P>

Due to the exceptional support of the president of the local government in Osijek, <a HREF="http://intac.com/PubService/human_rights/RADIOPANIK/croatjour.html"><strong>Branimir Glavas</strong></a>, although the initiative for changes of the street names in the city had already been concluded, a township has been named after Zobundzija; the township used to bear the name of <strong>Prokopije Uzelac</strong>, a great Osijek benefactor and a physician who had saved thousands of lives of his fellow citizens.  Although the inhabitants of the township were unhappy because of such removal of a memory of a man who had obliged the city, this didn't affect Glavas, since Prokopije was, after all, only Prokopije [a Serb], and not, for example, Branimir.<P>

Glavas has later demonstrated, on several occasions, how much he cared about the name; speaking about his future heirs, he said that they can do whatever they like as long as they didn't change the name of the township of Goran Zobundzija.  To our journalist's question, about why a street in Osijek hasn't been named after Kir as well, Glavas replied that Kir was originally from Dakovo, so that they should name a street after him.  Dakovo is today a part of Glavas' zupanija [the largest territorial unit in Croatia], but his team, although prone to parading, has never laid a wreath on Kir's grave, nor has anything been named after him in Dakovo.<P>

<h2>Rude Policemen</h2>

Brass plate with the name "Josip Reihl-Kir" is still attached to the entrance door of a beautiful family home which had just been completed by Josip and <strong>Jadranka Reihl-Kir</strong> [before Kir's murder].  Electricity bills are still addressed to his name and the same was, until recently, true of phone bills; however, HPT [Croatian Post and telephones] finally demanded that the name be changed.  A grandfather clock in the living room is showing the time when the deadly bullets were fired by Gudelj;  Josip's personal belongings are displayed on a side table and his photos hang on the walls.  The clock shows 1:20 p.m., 7/1/1991.  At that moment, half of his spouse's life also stopped.<P>

<strong>How did you receive the news about the arrest of Anton Gudelj at the airport in Frankfurt [in Germany]?</strong><P>

I was rather disturbed, because the moment I've been waiting for all this years has finally come.  I've forced myself to quit smoking, eat only healthy food and drink fruit juices, just to live long enough to see the justice done.  Gudelj is not that interesting in this case.  I don't expect a lot from him. But there is always a hope that his conscience will wake up, if he has it, and that he will say something new about the case during the trial.  It won't be easy to face him, but that's what the sedatives are for.<P>

<hr>

<h2>I listened to Tubic</h2>

I had a chance recently to see Mirko Tubic on TV Beli Manastir [a town on the territory occupied by Serbs] and hear from a witness how it all happened; he was the only survivor in the car.  I was looking for a channel with a movie, because I had had enough of politics, when a saw a man, talking.  It seemed like it might have been interesting, so I kept watching.  At one point he started talking about it [the murder]: "Someone said - this one's going to shoot; he had started to shoot at us before we managed to stop the car.  I hid behind Kir's seat."  At that point I realized that that was Tubic.  He was wounded and, when the door on his side opened, he fell out of the car.  Then, he was approached by others and they started to kick him and hit him with rifle butts, swearing at him because he was the only survivor.  Later, he was driven to a hospital in Osijek, escorted by two policemen who were supposed to guard him 24 hours a day, but he managed to escape.  Supposedly he was helped by a nurse who invited the guards to a cup of coffee, so that he managed to get out of the hospital and escape in a car which had been sent for him from a nearby army barracks.  Doesn't this also indicate that everything was organized?<P>

When Tubic's wife saw him, she said that she couldn't have recognized him.  Later, he was treated at the Military Clinical Center in Belgrade, but his kidneys were permanently damaged during that beating so he has to go to a dialysis twice a day.<P>


<hr>

<h2>A Chance for Peace</h2>

<strong>Gudelj has been sentenced to 20 years in jail in absentia.  Are you satisfied with the performance of the court so far?</strong><P>

I am disappointed!  I haven't even received invitations to all hearings and the judge <strong>Ruzica Samota</strong> refused to summon several witnesses who might have been able to throw more light on the events.  I was especially disappointed by the attitude of Josip's former policemen who appeared as witnesses.  First, they all looked as their chief was murdered and none of them reacted, tried to prevent the murder or catch the murderer.  He [the murderer] was undisturbed while he reloaded his rifle and walked away to a village.  None of them was reprimanded after that.  They were very rude at the trial, as if they were forced to appear.  One of them was in a hurry, so he came in in the middle of a hearing and demanded to give a statement, without any respect, as if the trial didn't have to do anything with his chief.  Commander of the road block [at which the murder occurred] "was on a coffee break" and didn't see what was going on; when he was summoned back he checked Josip's pulse and, he said, couldn't believe it.  Who were they guarding there after all?  So much negligence and no one was punished...<P>

<strong>Why do you think that Gudelj only fired the shots, and that someone else "aimed for him"?</strong><P>

If the whole thing wasn't set up and planned in advance, how could it happen that the murdered simply strolled away, took care of his family and left the village in the presence of so many policemen?  How could he have hidden afterwards for three days at his brother's place in Osijek, then traveled to Zagreb and finally left Croatia without any problems?  I want that cleared up and that is the justice I am waiting for and which is my goal.<P>

<strong>Your late husband...</strong><P>

Please, don't say that in front of me.  He is still alive for me and I consider myself to be a married woman.<P>

<strong>I am Sorry.  Your husband, had been saying for weeks before his last mission that he was in danger of being assassinated; he told that to minister [of Internal Affairs], Josip Boljkovac.  What was the source of danger, according to him?</strong><P>

I don't want to accuse anyone before the facts are established at the trial.  But it is a fact that Josip had a lot of problems with armed HDZ [ruling nationalist party in Croatia] members; because of them he was unable to disarm Serb villages in the surrounding area.  They [Serbs] promised to disarm as soon as police disarmed HDZ members.  Unfortunately this chance for peace wasn't taken advantage of; instead Josip became a target of suspicions because Serbs trusted him.  And why shouldn't they trust him when he always went to negotiations alone with his driver <strong>Miljenko</strong> and he always unbuttoned his jacket to show that he was unarmed.  Even Serbian papers reported about this; they found this unbelievable.  On one occasion, Josip told Miljenko that he wasn't sure if they would come back alive; Miljenko asked him to sign his retirement certificate, because he didn't want to drive anyone after Josip.  And those negotiations were almost always successful and the peace held; unfortunately whatever Josip would build during the day, others would destroy during the following night, by attacking [Serb] village guards.  Now those others, who were never peacemakers, would like to continue where Josip stopped.<P>

<h2>How to Escape Assassins</h2>

<strong>Minister Boljkovac took account of Josip's warning and transferred him to a new position in Zagreb.  Why hasn't he left as soon as possible?</strong><P>

He wanted to help solve the problems around Tenja [a village near Osijek].  I hardly saw him those days.  On Wednesday, he placed police protection around our house, since he was concerned for our safety.  He even switched official cars on the way home, in order to confuse potential assassins.  Since Wednesday, until Monday, when the murder happened I saw him only once, on Sunday morning, asleep in the living room.  Immediately, a phone rang and he had to go to negotiate in Bijelo Brdo.  He said that he would resolve that quickly and come back.  He resolved the problem but he didn't come back.  He phoned me for the last time on Monday, July 1, in the morning and told me not to worry, because, "starting today everything will be different."  He was probably thinking that we would finally leave for Zagreb, where he was supposed to start working as a head of a police academy; but the events were completely different.  Indeed, since that day everything has been different.  He didn't even tell me about Zagreb.  He only said that to Barbara, our daughter, because he knew that it would be hard for me to leave Dakovo.<P>

<strong>Mr. Glavas places responsibility on former Minister Boljkovac, because he didn't give a public statement about the threats and start an investigation against those whom Kir had pointed out.</strong><P>

Until that [the murder] happened, there was no evidence that an assassination was being prepared.  Immediately afterwards, the following day, Boljkovac was dismissed and couldn't do anything.<P>

<h2>Confession for BBC</h2>

<strong>During an interview for the BBC documentary "The Death of Yugoslavia" you spoke about events surrounding an attack on the barricades in Borovo Naselje in which your husband was also involved.  How did that happen?</strong><P>

As a man who fought for peace with all his strength, Josip was especially shaken when on one occasion Glavas, Vukojevic and Susak [Croatian Minister of Defense] came to him and demanded that he drive them to the entrance to Borovo Selo; they wanted to see the barricades.  There, they saw a tractor trailer placed in the middle of the road; they stopped the car, and then the three of them came out of the car, took armbrusts [hand held rocket launcher] out of the trunk and fired three grenades.  One grenade hit the barricade, the second one a house and the third one fell in a field.  Myself and Mr. Boljkovac told about that event in front of the BBC cameras for the documentary "The Death of Yugoslavia", which has been aired around the world.  You can draw your own conclusion about how this might have affected Josip's standing with all those people who wanted peace.<P>

<strong>Gudelj's attorney, Nediljko Resetar, said that he would base his defense on the fact that his client didn't know that Kir and Zobundzija were also in the car.  Do you think that he might succeed with this approach?</strong><P>

Mr. Resetar at first wanted to prove that Gudelj was mentally incompetent at that moment, but that didn't work.  Now, supposedly, he didn't know who was in the car?!  And only a few minutes earlier, the four of them passed in that car towards Osijek, and stopped at that road block and talked to Gudelj...  There was no other traffic on that road, neither at the time of the murder or later.<P>

<strong>You keep his things on several locations in the house...</strong><P>

When they sent his personal belongings, that was a great shock for me.  Namely, the things arrived in a plastic bag and everything was bloody.  A watch that I had given him, his check book, wallet, key chain, all bloody.  They told me that they hadn't wanted to touch his things and that's why they hadn't washed them.<P>

<h1>Neither to Priboj, nor to Rudo, nowhere</h1>

<strong><em>by Dragan Todorovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vreme, Belgrade, FR Yugoslavia, 3/2 1996</h2>

President of the Priboj county has stated that a certain number of Muslims had left this county (<em>Vreme</em>, issue 277).  Mr. Popovic was clear: some had left because of political, some because of economic reasons, but nobody under pressure.  As Priboj county borders Republic Srpska, president Popovic allowed that some Muslims, especially those from the border areas, villages of Kukurovici, Strmac and Sjeverin, had fled out of fear of war actions in the neighborhood.  However, the reasons for fear in this ares were clearly identifiable.  Actually, two thirds of the county (the villages from which the Muslims have fled en masse are in this territory) can be reached from the town of Priboj only through the Bosnian Serb territory. Then, on October 22, 1992, a group of Muslims from Sjeverin was kidnaped in Bosnian Serb controlled territory from a bus traveling to Priboj.  Both the kidnapers and the destiny of the victims are still unknown.<P>

After this event, probably in order to "protect" the Muslims, Bosnian Serbs banned Muslims from the only road to Priboj (and further).  Thus, the Muslims remained in their reservation, facing a real danger of death if they dared to leave it.  The Muslims organized demonstrations on several occasions; former Prime minister Panic's Minister for human rights, Momcilo Grubac, visited Sjeverin, a commission whose purpose was to prevent imminent resettlement was formed; however, besides verbal assurances, the Muslims didn't receive those guarantees that would have kept them in their homes.<P>

It is true that, besides other "armies", regular units of the Uzice Corps had arrived to Sjeverin, but they incited rather than stopped the exodus.  When soon after, at the end of February 1993, a group of <a HREF="/info/students/marko/vreme/vreme1.html">Muslims was abducted from a train at the train station in Strpci</a> (also located in the Bosnian Serb territory), it became obvious that official assurances only guarantee emigration.  It was interesting that the refugees fled from Serbia to Serbia.  Before the war, there were more than 500 Muslims in Sjeverin; today only about ten remain.  At the moment, the only passable road is out-of-bounds for Muslims as well as officials, humanitarian organizations and journalists.  This reporter is the first journalist to visit Sjeverin after the abduction of its inhabitants from the bus to Priboj, almost two and a half years ago.<P>

<strong>ROUND UP TO TWENTY</strong>:  Several buses travel daily between Priboj and Rudo (which is located two kilometers [1.2 miles] from Sjeverin).  Immediately after leaving Priboj one reaches the border in Uvac.  A Serbian policeman enters the bus and, standing next to a driver, with an experienced eye checks the national composition of the "baggage".  We cross over to the Republic Srpska territory.  Ten kilometers further down the road we reach border crossing Prelac and again enter Serbia.  After Sjeverin lies Rudo and, definitely, Republic Srpska.  In Sjeverin some of the houses belonging to Muslims are located next to the road; several almost completed Muslim houses have more than one floor.  Quite a few houses are deserted; there are a few broken windows and doors.  No signs of burning and destruction...  A month ago, two years after the Muslims had left, police sealed the houses (a nail next to the door tied to a doorknob with a piece of wire).  If the "seal" seems flimsy, there are numerous policemen who, in "Zastava" cars and "Lada" jeeps, certainly do not chase speeding cars.  There is also a border post in a Muslim house; the soldiers say that the house has been rented.

We encounter several locals in the village convenience store.  We ask them what has happened to the Muslims?  They reply that there were two deaths, one before and the other one after the abduction.  "There was another one, round up to twenty," says a guy behind the counter.  They demonstrated and then left, with bundles.  Ten hours on foot.  On village trails, via Zivinice, Sastavak, Kasidol and the mountain of Bic, they went down to Priboj.  Some stayed in Priboj, while others continued for Sweden, Germany, Austria...<P>

We go though the village with Ljubinko Dukic, a local, and the SPO representative in the Priboj local government.  "It happened, I don't know what to say," says Ljubinko.  Muslims still live in five houses, four elderly couples and the Agovic family.  The Agovic family lives in a one-floor house a bit further up the hill.  Inside we meet Salih, head of the household, his wife Hatidza, son Idriz and daughter-in-law Stana.  The Agovic family is one of the oldest in the village.  At the end of 1992, son Erid, together with his family, moved to Turkey; another son Jusuf is a professor in Priboj, one son is in Sarajevo and a daughter escaped from Sarajevo to Berlin.  "How are you doing?" we ask.  "Neither to Priboj, nor to Rudo, nowhere," responds Salih.  After the abduction in Strpci, when the last group of Muslims left the village, the whole family, except for Salih, escaped to Priboj.  Salih did not want to leave the house.  When Idriz came back he met the last departing Muslims; Stana and Hatidza came back later.<P>

Why did the Mulslims leave the village? "You know, people got scared.  A man was killed here, several were taken away from a bus; people were afraid that there will be more and fled the village," Hatidza explains slowly.  What is their life like?  Idriz used to work in a truck factory in Priboj, but cannot go to work anymore, "closed road"; he is an upholsterer but cannot work, "no material," he explains.  The problem is that they cannot sell anything: "closed road".  They are making ends meet with help from neighbors and from Priboj.  Daughter-in-law Stana, a Serb from Sehovici, has been able and is still able to travel without problems.  When it was hardest she was bringing medications and food.  Had the neighbors who left told them to keep an eye on their houses?  "We were hardly able to take care of our house, let alone others'," they respond.  "The authorities are now sealing the houses, but they should have done that earlier," Stana adds.  Problems?  The phone lines of all Muslims who remain in the village have been cut off; they cannot sell anything and the state asks for taxes and electricity payments.  They haven't seen a physician since 1992.  Stana says that they would have been dead long time ago if they relied on the state authorities.<P>

<strong>WHO IS SCARING WHOM?</strong>:  Idriz had a work injury.  True, an ambulance came from Priboj but he had to walk back to the village.  In the nearby village of Zivinice, there are a lot of Muslims; they don't have a physician, don't receive humanitarian aid, their children cannot attend school, "closed road".  A Muslim Yugoslav army conscript from this village had to walk to Priboj in order to report for duty.  Are they going to stay in the village?  "We don't feel a need to leave.  We didn't leave when the situation was most difficult.  Our gratitude to neighbors, some of them were good people; I don't want to talk about that, if we live long enough, it'll come out," says Stana.  "Those who left can't wait to come back; they would come to put plastic sheeting on windows, but won't come back until they get safety guarantees," says Hatidza.  Salih jumps in: "People came from Sarajevo; they wanted to exchange houses.  People would leave for Sarajevo if they could."  "We are not going anywhere.  Only if the great powers come and order - you must leave," his wife contradicts.  "Only, there should be no fear."  "There you go, some people use that and try to scare people," responds Salih.  "There was a lot of soldiers, we had to stay out of the way a bit," Hatidza concludes this dialogue.<P>

We go down with Ljubinko towards the center of the village.  We come to a Muslim house to which a Serb has moved in.  "That's the only one," says Ljubinko.  It is a two-floor house in the center of the village.  We encounter Slavko Vilaret, from Grbavica, on the stairs.  He left Sarajevo with his wife and child in July 1992, "somewhere behind Tuzla, I do not know how."  He left with what he could carry; an apartment and two cars were left behind.  At first he lived with his family in Lajkovac and then came here;  his birthplace is seven kilometers up the mountain.  There's nothing there, he says, it's all overgrown.  He's been in Sjeverin since January 1993.  When he showed up, the house owner, Safik Strojil, offered him the keys.  They had known each other from before.  They went to Priboj and made an official contract according to which Slavko is to remain in the house until Sefik comes back.  Has he heard from Sefik?  Slavko says that Sefik was in Macedonia for a while; he is not sure whether Sefik has come back to Priboj, he hasn't heard from him for a while.  Slavko is unemployed and picks up humanitarian aid in Priboj.  He speaks about "living in somebody else's house" with some confusion.  To this one can add problems with the villagers who object that he didn't stay in Bosnia to fight.  "I suppose I can decide myself about my own destiny, I'm not underaged," he asks.  Fortunately, he hasn't had problems with the authorities.  He tries to keep quiet and survive.  He says that's enough.  Future?  "I don't know."<P>

While we are waiting for the bus to Priboj, we are joined by two Serbs from Pribojska Banja.  They came to check if they could buy some hay.  They went to see Salih as well.  They'll be back, they say.  The road is not "closed" for them.<P>

<strong>A BOAR IN A HOUSE</strong>: We couldn't find the owner of the house in which Slavko Vilaret lives in Priboj.  In Priboj, according to the "Merhamet" [Muslim humanitarian organization], there are still several hundred Muslims from the border villages.  Those who had worked in FAP [a truck factory] and managed to make it to Priboj have the only "advantage": they managed to keep their jobs.  Rifat Sarak lives with his mother Remiza in a rented apartment.  His brother, with his family, lives in another house.  Rifat left Sjeverin in November 1992.  Behind he left a house in Sjeverin and his parents' house in the nearby village of Jelovik.  They were neither mistreated nor forced to leave.  What made them decide to leave?  "Reservists, kokarde, Chetnik songs, uncontrolled shooting, provocations: all that did not guarantee a peaceful life," says Rifat.  Reservists and volunteers forced them to leave; nobody came from the Bosnian side, adds one of the present men from Sjeverin.  They suffered worst mistreatment from the Serbian reserve police.  They set off over the hills; on the way they encountered patrols and checkpoints; some were even beaten up.  They went back during the first year, completed the field work with help of neighbors; and that was it.  Even now they sometimes sneak back to the village.  Rifat has recently been back.  The house had been untouched for two years.  Now there's nothing; what hasn't been looted, has been destroyed, "as if a boar was in the house."  "In some cases," says Rifat, "Serb neighbors took care of the houses".  But, everything had been looted.  He doesn't think that the neighbors were involved.  "If they didn't help, they didn't do harm either," he says with confidence.  "Even the electricity meters were taken from the house.  The electricity comes from Bosnia, so they probably thought the meters should also be there," Rifat says excitedly.  Will he return?  Where, when there's nothing in the house.  The others, who are visiting his apartment, do not agree.  If they are given a safe corridor to the village, even via Pljevlja, they will all return.  They ask Serbia, whose citizens they are: how is it that the Serbs from Bosnia can enter Serbia without problems, while they cannot travel from Serbia to their villages, which are also in Serbia?  So far, Serbia hasn't responded.<P>

<TITLE> Murders in Varivode</TITLE>

used without permission, for ``fair use" only
<hr>


<h1> Patriotic Crimes</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Petar Doric <br>  Feral Tribune, 10/9/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>

<hr>

<strong>Varivode: from murders of the elderly to the rape of facts </strong><P>

<hr>

Despite frequent statements from the Ministry of Internal affairs which try to convince the public in the thoroughness of the investigation of the massacre in Varivode, this massacre of 9 elderly persons from the territory of Krajina for now is being "shed light on" only through sound bites released to the media.  "Slander of Croatian soldiers and civilian authorities", "<strong>Cicak</strong> and HHO spread lies", "biased foreign journalists" .. are actually the only practical results of the investigation; it is actually hard to believe that the investigation is actually conducted by the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA). <p>

While the CNN has been playing <strong>Christiane Amanpour's</strong> report in which there is more blood on the screen than collocutors, in the MIA they are still writing statements such as: "Croatian authorities immediately started the investigation of all circumstances..."  It seems that the real situation is completely different and that the MIA is trying to cover up as much as possible all crimes committed during the "Storm." <P>

Two persons related to the victims of the massacre in Varivode, who were at the place of the massacre on Friday 9/29/95, when the mass execution of the villagers occurred, told <em>Feral</em> about their encounter with the "enlightening investigation."  For obvious reasons we agreed not to reveal their identity.<P>

<h2>Village as  military training grounds</h2>

"They told me that I couldn't go to the village because of the police exercise," said J.B. (initials have been changed, real name known to <em>Feral</em>) ," and that it would be best for me to go home.  I was glad to finally encounter police in Varivode since I had expected to see them earlier because of frequent looting and "scavenging" of the houses; however, the 'exercise' business seemed a bit strange.  I turned the car around and try to get into the village from the other side, where there weren't any policemen.  Already next to the first house it seemed to me that there was a human body covered with a bed sheet;  a little further away, a group of policemen was standing next to a woman from the village who was staring vacantly in front of herself.  While I was thinking whether to approach the group, a policeman startled me from behind and started shouting.  He screamed at me, asking whether I had gone  inside the house next to the covered body and whether I had touched anything...  They shooed me out of the village with curse words."<P>

" I was told ironically that the food I was taking to the elderly villagers," said S.Z. (initials have also been changed), "wouldn't possibly be delivered 'neither a little later, nor tomorrow, nor ever again'.  It was suggested that I should leave since 'there was nothing for me to do'.  I saw an elderly woman with the policemen; she had been hurt with a knife  by looters seven days before, so I thought that the worst had happened and turned the car and headed away from Varivode.  I went to Tonci Majic from the Dalmatian Committee for Protection of Human Rights and made a list of all people who had lived in Varivode during my previous visit to the village."<P>

The MIA stories about "timely informations given to the public" are therefore inaccurate, since the story about the murders in Varivode became public already on Friday 9/29/95, when the above mentioned list was forwarded to the Croatian Helsiki Committee (CHC) and the president of one of the parties represented in the parliament;  the party president the following day requested information from the minister Ivan Jarnjak. The MIA's first press release about the massacre in Varivode, made public on 10/2/95, was preceded by the CHC's report and the beginning of the investigation by the civilian UHPF [United Nations Protection Force] police.  In the early morning hours on Monday 10/2/95, MIA patrol cars were passing through Varivode while the reporters from <em>Feral</em> and <em>Associated Press</em>, escorted by the UNPF were taking pictures of the traces of the massacre in the village houses.  Croatian civilian police wasn't trying to intervene, but seeing that there was no point in trying to hide the massacre, issued a press release ten hours later.<P>

<h2>Chosen witness</h2>

In its first report the MIA didn't reveal where the bodies of the victims were, although one couldn't call that an unimportant detail.  UNPF reported "nine fresh graves" at the Knin cemetery on Tuesday, a day after the MIA report.  Since the reporters from <em>Feral</em> and the activists from CHC and Dalmatian Solidarity Committee, photographed those nine graves in which the people from Varivode had been buried on Monday, it was obvious that the MIA didn't care about "the details of the investigation".  Besides trying to hide some of the details the MIA also made public some false informations although this couldn't have been done in 'the interest of the investigation'.<P>
 
<em>Feral's</em> collocutors J.B. and S.Z. claimed that after numerous conversations over the phone with the remaining relatives of the massacred villagers from Varivode, they managed to reconstruct a part of what had happened
 immediately after the massacre.  Contrary to the MIA's report, the civilian police wasn't informed about the massacre by Bojanka Milosevic but by 70-years-old Mara Dukic, who at the time of the massacre was in Varivode.  She, therefore, as <em>Feral's</em> collocutors stated, had heard the shots in the neighborhood; she sneaked out of her house, spent the night in a forest and the following morning stopped the first civilian car and informed the police about everything.  After that, she didn't wait for an inspector on duty but contacted her relatives and found refuge in "one of the larger Croatian cities".<P>

On the other hand, our sources mentioned that Bojanka Milosevic, described by the police as "the person who informed the authorities about the murders" had left the village several years before the Serb occupation of Krajina and has been living elsewhere since then.  She was found in Varivode only after the end of the "Storm".<P>

S.Z. said that she is a widow of one of the soldiers of the self-proclaimed Republic of Srpska Krajina, who had been attacked with a knife and lightly wounded a week before the massacre  by a group of looters of abandoned and not abandoned serb houses.  One shouldn't be surprised that the MIA "chose" this person, who can "easily be discredited" (it is not necessary to comment the current social climate) for the main witness for the public.  Bojanka Milosevic stated in <em>Slobodna Dalmacija</em>: "Police was very helpful; they were protecting me the whole night and gave me chocolate."<P>

<h2> Obvious Motive</h2>

"The real" witness it seems exists after all, although he has so far only been mentioned by Miso Rogosic from the CHC.  The aforementioned activist for protection of human rights claims that the relatives of Spiro Dobrijevic have informed him that Spiro, also an elderly man, has been kept in the Sibenik military police station.  The CHC is still trying to confirm this information, so it should be taken with some reservations;  the information has been passed on to the UNPF civilian police which is currently conducting its own investigation.  Spiro Dobrijevic also appears on the list made by S.Z. and his name hasn't been found on the Knin cemetery.  MIA hasn't mentioned Spiro Dobrijevic so far in its reports, while the UNPF police lists him as one of "the disappeared".  If Spiro Dobrijevic is really in the Sibenik military police station, the MIA wouldn't necessarily know about him due to different jurisdictions of the military and civilian authorities.  Here we encounter the necessity of deciphering the motive for the crime; behind this problem is the greatest "swindle" of all police reports about the non-existent MIA investigation.<P>

The village of Varivode was as the rest of the territory of Krajina, completely looted at least three to four weeks before the mass murder of the elderly villagers.  On the day on which the crime occured, hardly anything of value could have been found in the village to back up the MIA's claim that the motive for the crime was "most likely greed."<P>

<h2> Suspicious Army</h2>

"On Tuesday 9/26/95, passing next to Varivode with a journalist, Ann Marie Bostrom, working for the Swedish Broadcasting Corporation, who is also a member of the Swedish Helsinki Committee," said Miso Rogosic from the CHC, " we saw a truck full of soldiers in black uniforms in the area.  Somewhat later, that same day, one of the soldiers was standing at the entrance into the village of Varivode armed with an automatic gun, I think an <em>Uzi</em>.  We weren't going to Varivode on that day because the activists from the Dalmatian Solidarity Committee already had written a report which stated that everything from the village had been looted and torched.  Therefore we believed that it was unlikely that another human rights violation would occur in Varivode.  If we were to check what was going on maybe the murders wouldn't have happened."<P>

Indeed, what if the crime in Varivode was committed by the members of the Croatian Army (or the Croatian Defense Council [Bosnian Croat militia])?  In case that the crime was committed by one of the "out of control" units, the MIA could indeed persistently keep repeating that it has done "everything in its power", or "everything it is competent to do".  The Ministry of Defense hasn't been mentioned so far in this case, so they haven't shamed themselves with public statements like the MIA.<P>

Be as it may, the fact remains that nine absolutely innocent people were killed.  Anyway, UNPF keeps insisting on "at least" nine; everything happened in the territory full of military and civilian policemen, who are still assiduously stopping all "unusual" vehicles, meaning those with valid civilian number plates, even if they don't have a "press" sign.<P>

<TITLE>Mostar Elections</TITLE>

<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h1>Two Mostars - Three Bosnias</h1>

<strong><em>by Alija Behram</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 6/13/96</h2>

On June 30 the citizens of Mostar will make a fateful decision which will
 certainly define the political future of the city for years to come.
The threat of division hangs over the Neretva.  At the time, immediately
after the bloody and tragic conflicts besides the Neretva, the Bosniak side 
approached the negotiations with the motto: "two Mostars = three Bosnias"
(or "One Mostar - peaceful Bosnia") trying to warn that the ethnic divisions
could only be the introduction to the definitive dissolution
of Bosnia.<P>

Many in Mostar are aware that the inhabitants are facing the following question:
will the June elections be simply the election for the local authorities or the
elections for the democratic concept of Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The great majority
of inhabitants hopes that the idea of the future unification of their city
will prevail at the election.<P>

<strong>POLITICAL SCENE</strong>: Mostar awaits these elections physically divided;
However, those experts who warn that more worrisome is the psychological division 
of the city, numerous blockades, denials and violations of human rights and freedoms,
hit the heart of the problem.  At work is the unbelievable intransigency which
tries to defend the unnatural situation besides the Neretva which had been achieved 
by force.  Exactly because of that, about a month ago, the idea of "the list for Mostar" initiated by the mayor
of the eastern half of the city, Safet Orucevic, was received with hope and understandable emotions.  Its goal was to activate
a pro-Bosnian front for the unification of the city.<P>

The coalition of six political parties of Bosnian orientation was interpreted
in the Bosnian public as a welcome sign of the readiness to push the narrow
political interests aside in this crucial moment for the future of Mostar and
emphasize the common goal of the integral Bosnia whose chances are being tested
in Mostar.<P>

"The elections in Mostar are the chance to forge a Bosnian front in order to
try to realize here all those ideas which are shared by the ruling party as 
well as the opposition parties," said Safet Orucevic.<P>

However, in Mostar, they are not hiding the unacceptable attitude of some circles
in the ruling SDA who would rather see the victory over the opposition than 
the united victory against the extremists which support the ethnic division of the
city.<P> 

Still, in Mostar, nothing has been lost.  On the contrary.  Many here believe
that the most important political and diplomatic battle had already been won
since all the citizens of Mostar will be allowed to vote in the election, wherever they
live today.  The Election results will hardly affect the changes of the county
statute, which ensured the equality of all citizens in the City council and
another six municipal councils.  The most important thing, according to Orucevic, 
is that  the citizens of Mostar were given a chance to be heard, to say that
they are alive and that they belong to this city and that this city belongs
to them; to condemn the crimes and criminals because of whom they had had to 
escape from the city.<P>

<strong>ENIGMA SILAJDZIC</strong>: Many in Mostar wonder how the Party
for Bosnia-Hercegovina, led by the former prime minister dr. Haris Silajdzic, will
treat Mostar.  "Mostar is a special sort of challenge," Silajdzic has told
this journalist; he assessed that the best solution for Mostar was a common
list of all the parties from this region and that the victory was less important
compared with the future of the city.  Of course, Mostar as a multinational
center of the region.  It remains to be seen whether Silajdzic will contest the 
election with the list of the opposition parties or together with Orucevic,
as he had promised earlier.<P>

The press has already registered that Dr. Durakovic's statements regarding
the possible coalition of the Party for Bosnia-Hercegovina and the list
of five opposition parties were interpreted in the cabinet of Dr. Silajdzic
as Dr. Durakovic's attempt to "assume the position of a spokesperson for the 
party for Bosnia-Hercegovina".  Therefore, it seems more likely that Silajdzic,
together with some other parties which are "checking out" the situation in 
Mostar, might stay in coalition with SDA; also, he might decide to enter the
elections besides the Neretva on his own.  Ilija Simic, vicepresident of
Croatian Peasant Party (HSS) says that that party has decided to enter a coalition
in Mostar, but that doesn't mean that they will contest the forthcoming
Bosnia-wide elections within the same coalition.  The Republicans, according to
Stjepan Kljuic, will also enter a coalition with other opposition parties
since their motto is "the preservation of secular and multiethnic Bosnia,"
and that is what they want to achieve in Mostar.  Muja Kafedzic, from the
Muslim Bosniak Organization (MBO) believes that in this case it is important
to demonstrate common support for the reintegration of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
"Our programs are mostly similar and we want to unite people regardless of 
their nationality," says Kafedzic.<P>

<strong>SERBS WILL(NOT) VOTE</strong>:  Local Serbs will also get the chance
to vote in the local elections.  However, the member of the advisory council of the EU
Mostar administration, Obren Lozo is bitter because of the fact that the agreement
on the conduct of the local elections in this city (signed by Rajko Gatalo,
as a member of the Serb community in the same council) rejected the idea that
Mostar Serbs vote in some locations in Nevesinje and Belgrade, where the 
majority of them lives today.  Lozo emphasizes that very few of them will
come to Mostar to vote.  It was necessary to allow the Serbs to vote in those
cities.  However, Lozo doesn't know how it was possible that Rajko Gatalo
"on behalf of Serbs" signed such a document.  "I do know that this kind of
voting procedure discriminates against Serbs; that is not correct and we
will protest because of that," concludes Obren Lozo.<P>

Serb Civic Council (SGV) from Sarajevo also issued a statement regarding the 
election in Mostar.  "If the EU does not accept the SGV demand to open two
voting stations in Belgrade in Nevesinje, than it will be responsible for
discriminating against one of the ethnic groups in Mostar, this time
against Serbs; by doing so the EU will prevent Serbs from taking part
in a democratic process and making decision about theirs and the future of
Mostar," were the words of Mirko Pejanovic, the president of SGV of 
Bosnia-Hercegovina.  SGV has sent letters to the Italian Foreign Minister, 
Lamberto Dini, German Foreign Minister, Klaus Kinkel and the chiefs of OSCE,
ambassadors of the USA and Great Britain, demanding that the EU administration
in Mostar provide two voting stations for Mostar Serbs living in 
Nevesinje in Belgrade.<P>

The musings of the current local HDZ chief in Mostar, Jadranko Topic, are 
also interesting.  He has stated for the Agence France-Presse that "the 
elections are simply a chance for the population to have some fun." In the 
end, he predicted, Mostar would be divided by Croatia and Serbia.  To 
journalist's remark that Tudman had had to give in in Mostar because of
the EU pressure, Topic responded: "Every president Tudman's decision  is
acceptable for us.  It is high time to understand that only Croatian leadership
can debate and make decisions about Croatian lands."  He also added:<P>

"The elections will confirm the struggle of the Croatian people in this region,
but also the divisions among the Muslim people, as in 1990...  This elections
must demonstrate what has been agreed about Mostar.  That there are three
Muslim and three Croat municipalities in the city.  The Federation will also
have to be divided in that manner; it will consist of Croatian and Muslim
municipalities, cantons and regions..."<P>

The refugees will vote in Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and Germany.  There
are rumors that the Serbs might get their way and that they will be allowed
to vote in the Italian embassy in Belgrade.  Will Milosevic [Serbian president]
agree with that?<P>

"We will shortly provide the text of the amendments which will regulate all the
remaining points," says Ricardo Peres-Casado, the administrator of Mostar.
Political parties are going through the last preparations for the election campaign.
First signs of election platforms which will be offered to Mostar inhabitants
can already be discerned.  It remains to be seen whether the citizens of Mostar 
will recognize the best option.<P>

<TITLE>Serb Spies Trial</TITLE>

 <h1>Sean-yo [Chicken] Connery</h1>

<strong><em>by Zoran Daskalovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 3/18 1996</h2> 

Last week's start of the trial to the group of spies accused for spying for the para-army of "Krajina" and its boss, the Yugoslav Army, was the subject of various assessments and commentaries.  One of them, coming from the legal-observer circles, can be summarized like this:  Balkan spies who drink brandy in pubs while exchanging secret and "secret" information and receive for their service about DM 100, organized and led by the officers from the former Yugoslav Peoples Army who in their escape from the attack of the Croatian Army leave behind the complete documentation about their intelligence network and its activities, only deserve to end up in Balkan fashion: used in the election campaign and at a trial which serves to demonstrate to the public absolute and lasting endangerment of the Croatian state and efficiency and irreplaceable character of the present authorities in its defense.  According to that opinion, if Croatia is a serious state and if it wants to smoothly pull out of that Balkan-spying spoof, than the best solution would be to apply the amnesty law instead of the organization of a spectacular trial and simply sweep the Balkan rubbish under the carpet of the Croatian legal practice.<P>

<h2>Spies From a Filing Cabinet</h2>

On the other hand, in the same circles one can hear the opinion that the trial at the Zagreb Military Court, taking into account that the indictment is mostly based on the documentation found in the intelligence center based in the liberated Knin, documents which can be authentic but could also be forgeries, could be the introduction into the practice of bringing people to trial and sentencing them because someone in intelligence and secret police services had written documents based on actual or fabricated conversations, facts and in that way collected evidence for prosecution.<P>

Regardless of these opinions, the post-Storm spy affair is following, it seems, the usual official procedures.  Last week, fifteen out of eighteen accused Serb spies, who had been caught in the operation "Zenit" in October 1995, found themselves in the courtroom of the Military Court in Zagreb.  Unlike "Labrador" the first large spying ring, which was broken in Croatia at the beginning of the war and whose members were soon after the capture exchanged or released.  Also, as the "Labradors" were discovered after the capture of the then Yugoslav Peoples Army's Fifth Region Air force command building,  Croatian intelligence services got hold of an even larger group of accused spies in the operation "Zenit" after the liberation of Knin where they found documents with the data about the spying network and its activities, most of them well organized in three filing cabinets.<P>

Last fall, the news about the arrest of the spies flooded the media at the start of the election campaign.  Their hometowns, occupations and professions made the impression that the spies were everywhere around us, that they had penetrated Croatia and were present in police, army, parliament, courts, all the way to schools, factories and pensioner meeting places.  For example, several accused were arrested in Zagreb: an advisor in the Croatian Parliament (<strong>Nikola Ivancevic</strong>), a policemen in the special unit of the Zagreb police district (<strong>Mile Cika</strong>), a policeman from the prison hospital (<strong>Dusan Tarbuk</strong>), retired criminal justice expert (<strong>Ivica Perner</strong>); in Delnice the police arrested retired forestry technician (<strong>Jovan Vuckovic</strong>); in Rijeka, an office worker, employed by Trans-Adria company (<strong>Milan Supica</strong>) and unemployed chemistry technician (<Strong>Savo Tepsa</strong>); in Veliko Lijesce on Zumberak a machine technician (<strong>Niko Drakulic</strong>); In Karlovac, a high school teacher (<strong>Irena Predovic</strong>); in Koprivnica an economist from "Podravka" (<strong>Dusan Dulikravic</strong>); in Pakrac (actually Daruvar) a judge from the Pakrac county court (<strong>Vojin Mrzic</strong>); in Pula a professor (<strong>Dorde Vrcelj</strong>); in Split a pensioner (<strong>Ilija Vrcelj</strong>) and finally on the island of Vir, in his summer home, a Slovenian policeman who works at the Krsko nuclear power plant (<strong>Rajko Beric</strong>). <a HREF="/info/students/marko/vreme/vreme9.html"> <strong>Rajko Jovic</strong></a>, unemployed lawyer and the former judge of the court in Glina, who lived during the war in "Krajina" and from time to time participated in meetings of various governmental and non-governmental organizations, was later added to the group.  He was arrested while returning from a meeting of non-governmental organizations which had taken place in Tuzla [in Bosnia-Hercegovina].<P>

<h2>Silent Defense</h2>

Three of the accused, colonel of the former Yugoslav Peoples Army (<strong>Mihajlo Knezevic</strong>), retired Zagreb policeman (<strong>Mirko Vuletic</strong>) and a man from Plasko (<strong>Mile Kosanovic</strong>), who, according to the indictment, organized and led the spying ring remain at large and are tried in absentia.<P>

In the part of the indictment which gives a detailed description of the criminal act of spying, it says that "all guises of the criminal act of spying are premeditated". Defense's opening statements from last week indicate that the proof of "premeditation" will be the center of the trial, both for the prosecution and for the defense.  Last week, Nikola Ivancevic, Mile  Cika and Dusan Tarbuk gave the opening statements in their defense in front of the three judge panel of the Military Court in Zagreb.  Nikola Ivancevic, who pleaded not guilty, decided to, until further notice, defend himself by silence since he still hasn't had a chance to read the 1400 page indictment and doesn't know what evidence it provides for his guilt.  In addition, because of the way in which he was arrested, he doubts that some of the evidence could have been planted by the police; until he can verify that this wasn't the case he will defend himself with silence.<P>

<h2>"Secrets" in <em>Vecernji List</em></h2>

Mile Cika, special unit policeman from Zagreb also claims that he is innocent.  He only admits that, as is stated in the indictment, he has known "since birth" the accused Mirko Vuletic who, according to the indictment, is one of the three organizers of the spy ring and who, among other, has "led" Cika and sent the secret data provided by Cika to Knin.  While the prosecutor tried to prove with additional questioning that the informations for which Vuletic had claimed to had been provided by Cika were correct, his defense attorney, <strong>Ranko Radovic</strong>, during his questioning attacked the authenticity of the documents and the "quality" of the information.<P>

For example, in one of the prosecution documents, Vuletic claimed that Cika had given him the analysis of the situation in the Croatian Army, done by the International Institute for Strategic Research from London, which had allegedly been published in the special police publication available only to a narrow circle of officials in the Croatian police.  To Radovic's questions, Cika replied that he didn't know about any top secret publication in which he could have read the analysis of the London institute.  Then, Radovic submitted to the Judges a photocopy of a page in <em>Vecernji List</em> with the analysis of the London Institute from which, taking into account that it was correct, the information had probably been copied.<P>

The same was repeated with the alleged Cika's informations about the number of aircraft and helicopters used by the Croatian Air force, and the transfer of the factories "Jedinstvo" and "Prvomajska" to war production.  Those informations were also published in <em>Vecernji List</em> and other Croatian papers.  Also, Vuletic's report to the bosses in Knin, that he on one occasion visited Cika in his apartment where he was with his wife and children, according to Cika's replies couldn't be correct, since at the time of the Vuletic's visit Cika didn't live with his wife and children but with his present common law wife and her child.<P>

<h2>(In)correct Documents</h2>

Some informations from the documents submitted as part of the indictment against prison policeman Dusan Tarbuk also demonstrate that the documents found in Knin were full if incorrect informations.  For example, according to Tarbuk, he was at work in Zagreb prison hospital on the day when he supposedly met his contact in Subotica; Tarbuk's statement can easily be checked in the prison work log.  On the other hand a few of the accused have admitted being contact with one of the accused and giving them some of the informations quoted in Knin reports.<P>

Nevertheless, defense attorney Ranko Radovic has already brought up the questioning of Mirko Vuletic which was carried out by the police in June 1995; Vuletic was released after the questioning.  Since, in the meantime, Vuletic was arrested in Belgrade and accused of being a Croatian spy, defense attorneys for other accused, whose connection he allegedly was, will also insist on uncertainty of his true role and the authenticity of the documents written on the bases of his reports in Knin.  It seems that Vuletic's spy "handwriting" has contributed to the assessment from the beginning of this article that these spies are above all Balkan spies involved in Balkan spy games.<P>

<h1>Trade with Abortions</h1>

<strong><em>by Damir Pilic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Feral Tribune, Split, Croatia, 1/8 1996</h2>

<em>Good evening, I'd like to have an abortion, so I'm interested in finding out...<P>

I'm sorry, we don't perform abortions here any more.  Our physicians have stopped performing abortions a few months ago; we'll do it only in emergency situations, if the mother's life is in danger.<P>

So what can I do?<P>

You'll have to contact a private practice.</em><P>

Clinical Hospital Split, 1/2 1996 about 6p.m.<P>

<em>Hello, I'd like to have an abortion, so I'm interested if I can have that done at your hospital?<P>

Of course.<P>

What is the waiting period, what do I need to bring and how much is the operation?<P>

There's no waiting period; just bring a referral from a gynecologist and 450 Kunas.</em><P>

Clinical Hospital Split, 1/3 1996 about 10a.m.<P>

<CENTER>***</CENTER>

The opposite and contradictory answers obtained by two  <em>Feral's</em> collaborators within the space of several hours clearly reflect the situation in the Gynecological department of the Clinical Hospital Split.  Even after several days of systematic research, <em>Feral's</em> reporters couldn't get a clear and definite reply to the question whether abortions are performed in this Split hospital.<P>

Instead, we encountered the silence of physicians and nurses, explained with the absence of the department head Dr. <strong>Ivo Banovic</strong> who was on a vacation ("I'm sorry we cannot do anything in his absence").  Only one of the physicians, after we guaranteed not to reveal his name, managed to say more or less this:<P>

<em>Here, at our department, women used to stay for a day or two; in private practices the whole operation takes an hour.  That shouldn't be like that, since it increases the likelihood that complications will occur.  I believe that abortions should be performed in a hospital.<P>

Well, are they performed here?<P>

I cannot say.</em><P>

<h2>We'll check that</h2>

Still, many details point towards the conclusion that the Split physicians have joined their colleagues from Zadar who, in the Spring of 1995, "broke the ice" by publicly proclaiming that their "conscience does not allow them to perform abortions."  While the Zadar case was resolved through a bizarre compromise (abortions are performed by junior doctors and interns under supervision of experienced gynecologists who "have problems with conscience"!), in the Split case the situation is apparently somewhat different.<P>

Rumors which are circulating through the city claim that the whole business is a subtle self-promotional trick of the gynecology practitioners who eagerly receive in the afternoon and evening in private offices the same women whom they  rejected in the morning at the hospital, using the "conscience" excuse.  if you thought that the reason for this is that Split doctors want to offer their patients better quality care, we'll have to disappoint you: in private practice, this intervention costs about 1000 Kunas [Croatian currency], which is more than twice as much as in the hospital.<P>

Dr. <strong>Mihovil Biocic</strong>, the head of the Split hospital, did not deny stories and speculations which had spread through the city.  He stated the following for <em>Feral</em>:<P>

<em>If it is true, as is written in the papers and talked about, that my doctors refuse to perform abortions at the hospital while they perform them in the afternoon in private practices, that is insupportable.  I will investigate that, but cannot tell you anything until the head of the department, Dr. Banovic, comes back.<P>

Can you tell us whether the abortions are performed at the hospital or not?  You are the head of the hospital after all, aren't you?<P>

I'm sorry, I can't do anything in Dr. Banovic's absence!</em><P>

<h2>Women in Hiding</h2>

Only five physicians in Split have permits for private gynecological practice: Dr. <strong>Andelka Juric</strong>, Dr. <strong>Tomislav Buljan</strong>, Dr. <strong>Sasenko Cercuk</strong> and Drs. <strong>Nikola Ruzic</strong> and <strong>Tihomir Busic</strong> who work together.  All other gynecologists work illegally, after their hospital shifts.<P>

<em>That's a total chaos!</em>, says Dr. Busic.  <em>Supposedly, they don't dare do it, and a X-ray specialist starts his own practice and employs a gynecologist for two hours a week.  Those two hours are a formality; actually they work longer hours.</em><P>

It is interesting that Drs. Busic and Ruzic, as they claim, don't perform abortions although they have a permit.  Neither does Dr. Andelka Juric the only female gynecologist in Split.<P>

<em>I don't perform abortions</em>, says Dr. Juric. <em>I specialize in fertility problems.  I always warn women, especially the younger ones, that every abortion carries a 30% chance for the future sterility.  Nevertheless, it would be a catastrophe if women were denied their legal right to have an  abortion.  I think that abortions should be performed at the hospital, not illegally.</em><P>

Since the remaining two private gynecologists in Split, Dr. Cecuk and Dr. Buljan, in their own words, perform abortions very rarely, it seems that the overwhelming majority of women in Split, in spite of their legal right to an abortion are forced to have them illegally.<P>

The statement of a respected Split gynecologist, who demanded to stay anonymous, that about 15 gynecologists employed at the Hospital "Firule", who show one face to pregnant Split women in the morning and a different one in the evening, fits in this depressing picture of the attitude toward this sensitive and vital question for women.<P>

<h2>Rent-A-Conscience</h2>

Starting from these informations, it is easy to calculate the value of that recently awakened "conscience".  In Split the price is a little bit more that 1000 Kunas or DM 300.<P>

With that the conscience is classified as every other commodity: for example as a cheaper cassette player or an expensive perfume, 100 kilograms of cabbage, about fifteen rolls of "grass" or 10 square centimeters of living space (which, multiplied by a number of women who seek gynecological services every year rapidly transform into square meters and even larger measurement units).<P>

We should add that this sophisticated approach of the highly educated Split experts is simply a non-humorous copy of Strikan and Netjak's "Hick's bluff" [Strikan and Netjak are characters from a well known TV series, "Malo Misto", written by a recently deceased <em>Feral's</em> collaborator, Miljenko Smoje] - let the opponents win the first game (which is played for wine) in order to win the second one (which is played for a lamb).  The difference is that Strikan and Netjak were, in their own way, real sportsmen and respected fair-play, while the Split gynecologists prefer money-play.<P>

All this is done in spite of the Public Health Law which defines the obligation to provide of all medical services, including an abortion, as well as the Abortion law which was enacted in Croatia in 1978 and is respected in all European countries except for Poland and the Republic of Ireland.  Let's not mention the Hippocratic oath.  It is obvious that the Health ministry, lead by the Minister for Health, Dr. <strong>Andrija Hebrang</strong>, consciously ignores the situation and quietly condones the existing practice.  In the Zadar "conscience mutiny" case everything finished with Minister's verbal threats, but the announced procedure against the gynecologists was never initiated.<P>

<h2>Money and Donkeys</h2>

Ideological statements about "the right for life" and care for the future of the population turn out to be a simple mask.  It is obvious that in this case, yet again, a tendency very popular in Croatia these days, to make money on somebody else's suffering and to turn it into a profitable business, is demonstrated.<P>

In one of his books, <strong>Gabriel Garcia Marques</strong> famous Columbian writer said the following through one of his characters:<P>

<em>I am telling you: there is no wealth in this country behind which you cannot find a donkey.</em><P>

Who is a fool here, dear readers, you should judge yourself.  It seems to me, although I'm not a woman, that my ears are getting longer and longer...<P>

<hr>

<h2>Hebrang and Friends</h2>

We phoned the Croatian Minister for Health, Dr. Andrija Hebrang and asked him for a statement regarding the case in Split hospital where women cannot any more realize their right on an abortion.  We also wanted to ask him for a comment regarding the outcome of the "Zadar case", in which Dr. Hebrang personally threatened to discipline the gynecologists who refused to perform abortions in the Zadar hospital; the case was later hushed down and "forgotten".<P>

The Minister was however, firm. He wouldn't say anything for <em>Feral</em> because <em>Feral</em> was a "continuation of the anti-Croatian tradition."  The Minister then concluded: "In this moment, you are the greatest enemies of Croatia! Click."<P>

Why doesn't the Croatian Minister think in the following way: if the Croatian women were given their right to an abortion, so many enemies of Croatia wouldn't be born?

<hr>

<h2>Interns in Action</h2>

April events in Zadar hospital were the first case of gynecological "conscientious objection" which was reported in the media.  Zadar physicians, on their own initiative and in violation of the existing law decided to stop performing abortions at the Zadar hospital. The attention which this incident has thrown on a clash between the law, according to which a woman still has a right to an abortion, and the "conscientious objection" has forced the Health Minister, <em>Andrija Hebrang</em> to formally, although not definitely, back up the law.  The Ministry of Health devised a way for gynecologists to respect their conscience while allowing the hospitals to keep providing abortions.<P>

Gynecologists became assistants, while interns actually performed abortions.  Many Zadar women did not like the approach of the Zadar hospital and some of them obtained their legal rights at the Split hospital.  Until recently, when the Split clinical center decided to show a "STOP sign" to abortions, and a majority of Zadar gynecologists has opened a private practice.  In spite of their conscience.<P>

<hr>

<h2>Interview with Dafinka Vecerina, a human and women rights lawyer from Zagreb</h2>

<strong><em>conducted by Ivica Buljan</em></strong><P>

<strong>According to the law, who is allowed to perform abortions in Croatia?</strong><P>

Every hospital with suitable conditions is obliged to provide abortions.  If they refuse to do so, the physicians are breaking the law.  The first case in which the law was broken occured in 1991 when, due to the request of the director, the gynecologists in the "Sisters of Mercy" hospital in Zagreb stopped performing abortions.  However, the women protested and the decision was later suspended.  The case in Zadar hospital is similar, since the gynecologists there also refuse to perform abortions and fulfill their legal obligations.<P>    

<strong>Women cannot obtain abortions in the Zadar hospital and now the same is happening in the Split hospital.  What are the consequences of a ban on abortions in hospitals?</strong><P>

If abortions cannot be performed in the best possible conditions, the number of illegal abortions and, consequently, deaths caused by unprofessionally conducted interventions which affect the psychological health of a woman, increases.  Furthermore, the refusal of the hospital gynecologists to perform abortions enables greedy and ruthless gynecologists to illegally earn large sums of money on women.<P>

<strong>A very strong ideological movement in Croatia which supports not only the ban on abortions but also a ban on contraception also helps the alleged conscience objection of Zadar and, it seems, Split gynecologists?</strong><P>

Yes.  Certain demagogues, in Croatia try to address with their speeches the uneducated population segments and successfully influence their emotions and will.  Some of them use lies in their fight against abortions.  For example, don <strong>Ante Bakovic</strong> claims that the current abortion law is a Stalinist law.  As if he didn't know that Stalin actually banned abortions as well as did all other dictators, Hitler, Musolini and Ceausescu, who in Romania not only banned abortions but also formed a gynecological police which cruised through the country controlling the most intimate human affairs.  The group of people who are agitating for a ban on abortions in Croatia is very loud and well organized.  Unfortunately, authorities are certainly tolerating their activities.<P>

<h2>Croatian gynecologists violate womens rights</h2>

<h3>BABE_ZG@ZAMIR-ZG.ZTN.APC.ORG (B.a.B.e.) </h3>
Mon, 08 Jan 1996 <p>

B.a.B.e, Women's Human Rights Group, has learned that a Split hospital  
violates Croatian law and womens human rights by rejecting to perform  
abortions.<P>

The Split magazine DAN published on 31.12.95 an article ("Hypocritical  
Gynecologists") about a woman who went to Split's Clinical Hospital to  
have an abortion.  The gynecologist rejected to perform the abortion  
calling on his conscientiousness reasons.  The woman then went to a  
private practice to have the abortion done.  There she met the very same  
gynecologists who performed the abortion for a charge of 1.000 kuna (app.  
DEM 300), which is almost an average salary for women in Croatia.  The  
director of the hospital, Mihovil Biocic, was not available to journalists  
for further comments.<P>

The hospital has taken the law in its own hands by internally voting not  
to perform abortions.  Although such decision violates the present law, it   
anticipates the "spirit" of a new proposed abortion law, which has not yet  
been proceeded in the Parliament. According to the new proposal doctors  
can make moral decisions not to perform abortions.  This law supports  
doctors "conscientiousness" but does not secure women their reproductive  
rights.  In May '95, when the new law was proposed, B.a.B.e and other  
womens  groups collected throughout Croatia 20.000 signatures in support  
of womens reproductive rights and to keep abortion legal and safe in  
Croatia.<P>

This is not the first time incidents like this happen in Croatia. B.a.B.e  
has already warned that the new proposed abortion law, in addition to  
grossly violate womens reproductive rights, also supports existing double  
morality and legalizes the profit oriented doctors "conscientiousness".<P>


We call upon all women and men to support Croatian women in the fight for  
their reproductive rights!<P>

<h1>Fatal Delay</h1>

<strong><em>by Gojko Beric</em></strong><P>

<h2>Oslobodenje-Svijet, Sarajevo-Ljubljana, Bosnia-Hercegovina, 4/4/96</h2>

The latest <a HREF="/info/students/marko/ljiljan3.html">interview of president 
Alija Izetbegovic</a> to <em>Ljiljan</em> was shockingly refreshing to all
those who follow president's public appearances and statements.  Interview
was conducted by  Izetbegovic's close friend and the SDA ideologist, Dzemaludin 
Latic and the dialog had more resemblance to a family quarrel than to a conversation
among the two men coming from the same political party.  In the interview,
Izetbegovic almost nervously contradicted a local stereotype  which states
that the whole world has been plotting against Bosnia-Hercegovina and the 
Bosniaks, and emphasized that we had made some mistakes as well.<P>  

He mentioned the media who are falling head over heels trying
to prove that the multinational Bosnia is not possible; he used <em>Ljiljan</em> 
as an example.   He admitted that the fact that near Fojnica,
even after the signing of the Dayton Agreement, there was a base for the 
training of commandos was a "huge mistake".<P>

Recognizing in Latic's question the thesis that America is the enemy of Bosnia,
Izetbegovic almost quipped at Latic: "Let me ask you this: would Bosnia be
more secure if we found out that America and with it another 10 most important
countries in the world were all our enemies.  I don't think that America is our 
enemy, but we can make an enemy out of it...  Iran proved during the war that
it is a true friend, but Iran is far and our enemies are close."<P>

The analysis of this, as well as several other recent public appearances of
president Izetbegovic, lead to the conclusion that he has changed his political
tactics.  This change was forced by the grey perspective for Bosnia, the
situation in the ruling party and the latest pressure from the American government, 
which believes that it has been lenient towards Izetbegovic long enough.<P>

Izetbegovic is probably aware that there is little he can do for the future of 
Bosnia. Even if everything depended on his skill and will there is no time 
left for that deed.  On the other hand he cares about what he will leave behind.
During his stay in a hospital, he addressed the public twice.  On the Statehood 
day he appealed that "all of us, in the future, behave less like Bosniaks,
Croats, Serbs, Jews... and more like the citizens of Bosnia-Hercegovina."
Izetbegovic sees in the symbiosis of ethnic and national identity the way
to cure the wounds of this war and to avoid the repetition of the tragedy.<P>

In some better times, when no one sensed the horror lurking behind the hill,
this message would have had the value of a true political program.  Unfortunately
it is coming to us with a fatal delay.  We can only talk about its usefulness
in the context of the forthcoming elections.  Today, Izetbegovic has serious
difficulties with his political philosophy, which can be condensed in the 
analysis of religion and ethnicity.  From the very start, due to Izetbegovic's 
influence, SDA has had the character of a political and religious movement. 
At the time when the Bosniak people had already had a knife on its throat,
that orientation had some practical sense, but in the meantime it has become
harmful.  SDA today functions as a conservative political party, with religion
in place of ideology, which objectively excludes it from the club of modern
European parties.  However, the main problem is in its wrong policy, which
superficially appears as a pure dilettantism.  No one knows what the SDA national
and religious programs are; if they exist they are essentially contradictory.<P>

Izetbegovic knows that the political restoration of SDA is necessary, but he
is not sure how far he can go in that.  The party compass is still in his hands.
However, isn't a sudden change in direction dangerous for him as well?  There
are also other troubles.  The latest assessments show that the split with
Silajdzic may be more dangerous than it seemed at first.  Silajdzic is
reserving ever more stronger criticism for his former party because of the
misuse of religion in politics (this is the program of the extreme wing of SDA).
Controversy arising from the split between Silajdzic and Izetbegovic is somewhat
paradoxical since one has an impression that the two of them essentially
share the same political views...  If he starts an open showdown with the
extremists of the politically religious orientation, who dangerously complicate
the Bosnian position in the eyes of the West, that would mean that Izetbegovic
was trying to liberalize his party and at the same time to diminish the importance
of the split with the former Prime Minister, who had for a long time been 
his right hand.  Izetbegovic's fear that the liberal wing of SDA could join Silajdzic's new party has some basis in reality.<P>

Both domestic and foreign affairs limit the time in which Izetbegovic has to
make up his mind about what he really wants.  That is a new factor for all 
those trying to divine whether Bosnia is moving toward reintegration or toward
the tragic dawn of its dissolution.<P>

<h1>A CHRONOOGY OF OPERATION "STORM": 84 HOURS OF WAR</h1>

<h2>Slobodna Dalmacija, Split, Croatia, August 5 1996</h2>


<h3>Friday 4th August 1995</h3>


5:00 - Croatian armed forces launch a military operation to liberate the
occupied territories of Knin, Gracac, Lapac, Korenica, Slunja, Glina, Dvor,
and Petrinja, with the aim of returning these areas to the constitutional
control of the Republic of Croatia. In only the first clash, the rebel
Serbs' lines are pierced in thirty places, in the municipalities of
Bjelovar, Zagreb, Karlovac, Gospic, and Split, with Croatian forces
penetrating up to 15 kilometres into enemy-held territory. Operation "Storm"
is now under way and events continue to unfold at lightning speed.<P>

Meanwhile, Croatian radio broadcasts a message by the Croatian president,
Dr. Franjo Tudjman, in which the president calls on Croatian citizens of
Serbian ethnicity in the occipied territories to remain in their homes and
not to fear the Croatian authorities, which will respect their minority
rights.<P>

The Fourth and Seventh brigades of the Croatian army go into action to
liberate Knin. North of the city, they launch a swift attack in the
direction of Polygon "Crvena zemlja". After a 9-hour battle, the first
Chetnik lines are broken and Knin is practically on the verge of falling. In
only the first day of the operation, it becomes just a question of hours
when the Croatian forces will enter the town itself. Meanwhile, in the
former sector North, the Croatian army, from the direction of Sunja and
Jasenovac, launches an attack to liberate Dubica, and special forces of the
Interior Ministry, from the direction of the Velebit mountains, launch an
attack to liberate Gracac and Lika. Air-raid sirens are sounded at 5:05 in
Sibenik, at 5:15 in Zadar and Sisak, at 5:30 in Novska, and at 7:00 in
Dubrovnik.<P>

19:00 - Two NATO war planes, which take off from the air carrier Theodor
Rooselvalt in the Adriatic Sea, attack Serbian rocket positions near Knin.<P>

<h2>Sinisa Rimac: A Bullet for a Disabled Man</h2>

<strong>Sinisa Rimac</strong>, born in 1973 in Vukovar, interrupted his vocational school after the massacre in Borovo Selo and, together with <strong>Igor Mikola</strong>, <strong>Nebojsa Hodak</strong>,<strong> Pavo Mlinaric</strong> and others started a sentry duty.  Immediately after his arrival to Gospic, Rimac and the friends completed several actions in which they removed barricades from the streets and captured a military warehouse and 18 members of the so-called JNA [Yugoslav Peoples Army].  They took part in several pursuit actions against Chetniks in the area around Gospic.  They found out from <strong>Zvonko Trusic</strong> and <strong>Stipe Mandarel</strong> in the Zagreb cafe "Stil '92" that <strong>Mercep</strong> was about to open a new front in Pakrac; hence they also headed that way.<P>

In Pakracka Poljana, Rimac saw a prisoner, <strong>Milan</strong>, who "came looking for his brother who had been mobilized; he  thought that he had found a chetnik headquarters."  Rimac beat up another three prisoners in military uniforms on one occasion.  He also knew about a few more cases in which Guardsmen and people from his unit had brought people from Kutina or from the Novska area [towns near Pakrac].  Rimac hasn't spent a lot of time in Poljana (he was coming from and going to Zagreb, Kutina and on one occasion he traveled to Osijek planning to go with 400 volunteers as a reinforcement to Vukovar), but he has heard that 11 people had been found in the village of Bujavica; some of them were Chetniks. "He heard that they had been thrown in a cellar and killed."<P>

<strong>Sasa Antic</strong> seemed suspicious to Rimac, because "he had some lists with photos and resumes; he could get hold of everything he needed and no one knew where he was getting it from.  As far as Sinisa knows, Sasa was abducting people, interrogating prisoners, driving a different car every few days and doing a bit of everything;  Tomica thought that Sasa should be sent to Serbia to carry out bombings and sow panic among people."  Rimac became suspicious of Sasa "after a young man was abducted and beaten up and the result of his interrogation was the abduction of a director of a company from Kutina who wasn't guilty of anything.  After that Sinisa talked to the beaten youngster and he told Sinisa that he had made up the story about the director in order to save himself."  In connection with Antic's execution, Rimac also stated that he had asked Sasa, when they had been standing next to the grave, whether he had worked for the Yugoslav counterintelligence service and about sixty reserve police identification cards which had disappeared from Mercep's car.  Sasa replied that he had nothing to do with the documents.<P>

To the question about <strong>Marina's</strong> execution, Rimac replied that Mercep ordered her arrest.  He has heard that she was supposed to kill Mercep.  When she appeared at Mlinaric's funeral, Rimac, Mikola, <strong>Suljic</strong> and Hodak caught her, took away the documents she had with her, among which were at least 500 addresses, HOS [Croatian fascist paramilitary organization] badge, a gun and a pen.  She was interrogated at the Zagreb fairgrounds by <strong>Demo (Palos)</strong>, Rimac, Hodak and Suljic, after which Demo said that Tomica (Mercep) had ordered to take her to Poljana where "this should be sorted out".  Three prisoners dug out a grave on a meadow, " and then <strong>Tonci</strong> asked Sinisa to do it himself;  Sinisa let him carry out the execution and Tonci shot and killed Marina from an automatic rifle.  Sinisa remembers that Tonci said after the execution: 'thank you, Rimac for letting me shoot.'  Because the execution was carried out at night, Sinisa doesn't know the exact place where Marina was killed, but knows that this happened on a meadow surrounded by forest, about 300 meters from the jail in Poljana."<P>

He didn't remember the exact date, but Rimac knew that a reserve soldier and a civilian on crutches were brought to Poljana on one occasion.  "Sinisa and Sasa went to pick up that man and brought him to the jail in Poljana where he was interrogated after which someone said that they should execute the man.  He doesn't know whether someone issued orders saying which persons should be killed, but on this occasion Sinisa, <strong>Nikola</strong> and <strong>Brisevac</strong> carried out this execution; they took a truck and also brought along two other prisoners.  They carried out this execution during the day in a forest far away from the prison; the prisoners dug a hole and then the man with a crutch was killed from a small caliber rifle while Sinisa killed the man in the military uniform (he was a reserve soldier, about 30 to 32 years old) from a hand gun.  After the execution, the prisoners filled in the grave and then returned to the prison."  All this was recorded on 12/31/1991 in the Zagreb PD Department for suppression of common crime and signed by <strong>Nikola Jambrek</strong>, the authorized official.<P>

<h2><a NAME="hodak">Nebojsa Hodak: Kill Me Instead</a></h2>

<strong>Nebojsa Hodak</strong>, from Vukovar, was born in 1966, completed primary school at the age of 17, after which he spent two years in Borovo doing nothing, apart from a little gambling and getting in trouble with law from time to time.  He met <strong>Mercep</strong> at that time and helped during the construction of his house.  After finishing his [mandatory] military service, according to his statement given to the Zagreb PD, Hodak spent some time robbing Italian, German, Czechoslovak, Swiss and Hungarian houses and shops.  His guide in those very untourist-like trips was <strong>Pavo Mlinaric</strong> who left the country in 1981 in order to avoid spending 5 years in jail.  At the time of the massacre in Borovo Selo, Hodak was in Munich on a shop lifting trip with his colleague <strong>Milos Savic</strong>.  When Hodak heard about the massacre, he immediately returned to Vukovar and joined the Mercep's unit as a volunteer; <strong>Mikola</strong> and <strong>Rimac</strong> were also members of that unit.<P>

Hodak said that, after spending maybe two months on barricades, i.e. sentry duty, he and Mikola on their own accord arrested his neighbor <strong>Milenko Cukanovic</strong>, in whose apartment they allegedly found a Serbian Democratic Party (SDS) membership card, a hat with a nationalist insignia [kokarda] and several bottles with molotov cocktail.  Cukanovic was interrogated and killed by Mlinaric and a certain Zagorac [a man from Zagorje, an area near Zagreb].  Cukanovic's <a HREF="/info/students/marko/vukovar2.html">corpse was found in Danube several days later, near Novi Sad...</a>  Since Cukanovic's mother <strong>Tonka</strong> inquired with Mercep about her son, Hodak, following a Mercep's order, had to write a report about the arrest, in which he stated that he had brought Cukanovic to the Territorial Defense headquarters and that he didn't know what happened to him after that.  That report was signed by Mercep and Hodak, and Hodak gave one copy to Cukanovic's mother, Tonka.<P>

As far as Hodak knew, 5-6 persons were brought for interrogation from Borovo.  Executions were carried out by Mlinaric, <strong>Amerikanac</strong> and <strong>Zagorac</strong>.  Mlinaric was a member of an active National Guard unit, and before his arrival to Vukovar, he was in a jail in Slavonska Pozega.  He was supposed to serve 4 months but was "pulled out" by a certain <strong>Mr. Babic</strong> from the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  "Mlinaric has," it says in the official police report, "shown a lot of courage in actions of that sort ( executions, <em>Feral's</em> remark) and, besides that, he terribly hated Chetniks , but not Serbs; at least not all of them since his wife was originally from Kolasin [town in Montenegro].  Mlinaric was very difficult when he drank a lot; he would behave as if he were mad."<P>

Hodak stated in the interrogation that he didn't know who had put Mlinaric in charge; "he only knows that Mlinaric was interrogating prisoners in the cellar of the Territorial Defense building and that no one from other units was allowed to be there during interrogations."  During an interrogation, "with use of beatings and electric shocks (from an inductive telephone set)," Mlinaric was "in charge," and his collaborators were <strong>Jozo Smuk</strong>, Zagorac from Zabok and "a young man from Chicago, whom they called Amerikanac [an American], and who is now (December 1991, <em>Feral's</em> remark) in Kumrovec undergoing  training in a special forces unit."  Hodak met that man, over 6 feet tall, with tattoos on both arms, black hair, and about 20 years old, in a disco in Zagreb, immediately before the interrogation in Zagreb PD.  Amerikanac, who also has a brother undergoing training in Kumrovec, told Hodak that he would like to return to the Mercep's unit.<P>

Hodak who, after two months spent on barricades, became a member of a group whose duty was terrain cleansing (persons who were members of SDS or for whom they had information that they had taken part in operations against the Republic of Croatia were brought to the Territorial Defense building), left with the friends for Gospic where their task to remove barricades from streets, hunt snipers etc.  He personally took part in the capture of a warehouse in which some twenty soldiers were taken prisoner.  After that, Hodak fought in Ceric, Nustar and Marinci and when he and his group arrived to Pakracka Poljana, a group of four prisoners was already there.<P>

One of them was called <strong>Milan</strong>; supposedly he had come from abroad looking for a brother who had been mobilized to a Territorial Defense unit.  "That guy said that he was a thief and that he had been stealing everywhere, in Italy and Switzerland; he had been arrested about ten days before they arrived to Poljana and after their departure, Pavo led him around everywhere dressed in a sajkaca [traditional Serbian hat] and wrapped in a Yugoslav flag."  Hodak didn't know why the other three men had been arrested; supposedly, one of them, a veterinary from Pakracka Poljana, had had on himself artillery coordinates.  The painter <strong>Milan</strong>, also known as <strong>Rus</strong> [a Russian], trained the prisoners to jump on their feet and shout "Za dom spremni" [greeting used by fascist Croatian regime during the WWII, roughly equivalent to "heil Hitler"; literal translation is 'ready for homeland'] every time he opened a door.  Hodak stated:" these four prisoners were killed and it is known that <strong>Tonci</strong> killed Milan; Mikola and Rimac and also others told me about that; Tonci had to kill Milan because Pavo couldn't; he had become friends with Milan."  The other three were killed by <strong>"Svabo"</strong> [a German], twenty year old man who hardly knew any Croatian.  Hodak also remembered that "Svabo" during an interrogation pierced an ear of a prisoner and pushed a bullet through the wound.<P>

Later, in the village of Kukunjevci, they caught a man who had two hand grenades and a PAP rifle.  He told them that he had received the arms from the JNA; after that Hodak, Mikola and Miro drove the man in a van to a corn field and there all three of them shot at him: Hodak from a "scorpio", Mikola from an "uzi" and Miro from a "pumperica".  Hodak remembered that the man had been wearing a grey jacket and grey trousers.  Here's more from Hodak, from the report:" Quite a lot of people were brought in by <strong>'Pop'</strong>, that is <strong>Nikola Rukavina</strong> who had been in Pakracka Poljana before their arrival; he would bring people in for executions, and as he himself said, sometimes he wouldn't bother to bring them to Pakracka Poljana, but would execute them somewhere else.  'Pop' was acting alone and was visiting villages in the area with his people; Hodak remembers that Pop has brought in the veterinarian.  Suljo was also bringing people, but only from Pakracka Poljana.  All those brought in by 'Pop' and 'Suljo'  were executed later; during 15 days which Hodak spent in Pakracka Poljana, about 10 people were executed."  The names of new prisoners were obtained during interrogations in the prison in Pakracka Poljana.  Hodak said that the prisoners were not immediately killed, but were kept around for several days to clean, wash, unload ammunition etc.<P>

The official report, signed by <strong>Esad Paratusic</strong> also mentions that Hodak has heard from Rimac that Mercep and <strong>Zvonko</strong> had ordered Rimac and Mikola to kill <strong>Sasa</strong>;  Rimac was against this and only wanted to drive Sasa away from Poljana.  In the end it says: "Anyone 'working' in Pakracka Poljana, had to write reports during interrogation, and these reports were submitted to Mercep and Zvonko, who owned the cafe 'Stil';  the two of them were sitting in the headquarters, reading those reports and deciding what would happen to the prisoners."<P>

<h2>Munib Suljic: "Daddy" Sent Them to Poljana</h2>

<strong>Munib Suljic's</strong> story, signed by <strong>Esad Paratusic</strong>, begins in the early fall of 1991.  From Zagretje (Zabok municipality), Soljic went to the Ministry of Internal Affairs to find out where the volunteers should report.  He was directed to the second floor, to <strong>Tomislav Mercep's</strong> office.  After a short training he left with a group of volunteers for Pakracka Poljana.  The evening when <strong>Rimac</strong> and the friends arrived, <strong>Pavo Mlinaric</strong> was killed in Zagreb; <strong>Branko Saric</strong>, a.k.a. <strong>Kosa</strong> and <strong>Demo Palos</strong>, a.k.a. <strong>Kobra</strong> were appointed to his position.  Later Suljic heard that Palos had ordered the execution of all prisoners, and, according to the rumors in the headquarters, the executions were carried out by <strong>Miro Brisevac</strong>, a man with a nickname <strong>Tonci</strong> (<strong>Antun Jurgec</strong>), <strong>Miljenko Zadro</strong>, a.k.a. <strong>Pika</strong> and a man whose nickname was <strong>Bego</strong>.  Allegedly, on that occasion, about 12 persons were executed in the village of Bujavici.<P>

Suljic stated that he didn't know anything about the abductions of people from the Zagreb area, and added that "all orders in connection with apartment checks, confiscation of arms and abductions of people from apartments in the Zagreb area were issued by <strong>Zvonko Trusic</strong>; he would leave peaces of paper with data in an office inside pavilion number 22 at the Zagreb fairgrounds; whoever was first to arrive to the office would get that piece of paper and had to carry out the checks that were demanded by Trusic."  Suljic emphasized that he never went alone to carry out checks and apartment searches, but that everything was done based on the orders of Trusic, Mercep, or <strong>Stjepan Mandarelo</strong>.  On one occasion Suljic received from Trusic  a business card belonging to <strong>Borislav Ostojic</strong>, from Rijeka.  He was told to bring that man to Zagreb together with general <strong>Uzelac's </strong> brother.  Suljic also said that, according to a Mercep's order, <strong>Sinisa Rimac, Igor Mikola, Nebojsa Hodak, Castimir Maric, Zeljko Basic</strong> and Suljic himself were supposed to travel abroad "in order to carry out checks of people on a certain list of people working against the Croatian authorities."<P>

He also witnessed <strong>Sasa's</strong> (<strong>Aleksandar Antic</strong>) murder.  Mikola and Rimac had told him that several id's disappeared from Mercep's BMW and that Sasa was a suspect.  He remembered that before they left the Zagreb fairground, Mikola had had a private conversation with Tusic; hence he supposed that during that conversation Tusic had told Mikola what to do with Sasa.<P>

Mercep and Tusic issued an order to arrest <strong>Marina</strong> from Rijeka, provided she turned up at Pavo Mlinaric's funeral.  She came to the funeral; Mikola and Rimac caught her, disarmed her and drove her to the Zagreb fairgrounds where she was interrogated by <strong>Demal Palos</strong>.  After interrogation, Palos said in front of everyone: "Daddy (Mercep) has ordered - straight for Poljana."  Suljic stated that he had later heard that Marina had been killed from a machine gun by Tonci.  "He doesn't know why Marina was executed, but he stated that he had heard rumors that Marina's father was a member of KOS [Yugoslav couterintelligence service] and that because of that it was necessary to kill her."  This was written at the end of the Suljic's interrogation at the Zagreb PD.<P>

<h2>Miroslav Brisevac: Massacre in a Cellar</h2>

"They took the prisoners from a van two by two, brought them to the cellar door and shot them."  This is written in the report made on 12/23/1991 by <strong>Ilija Zolota</strong>, a Zagreb PD detective, based on the statement given by <strong>Miroslav Brisevac</strong>. Brisevac was born in 1967; he was a member of the so-called Mercep's unit in Pakracka Poljana.  In his confession, Brisevac gives a detailed description of the execution of 12 males in the village of Bujavica, near Pakrac, which most probably occured during the night between 12/11 and 12/12, 1991 in the cellar of a family house.  All the victims were brought from the jail in Pakracka Poljana, and only three corpses have been positively identified since then.  The report states the following:<P>

"First <strong>Tonci</strong> and <strong>Bego</strong> led two of them towards the cellar; as Brisevac was standing next to the van, he heard that a lot of shots were fired from a 'scorpio' and 'pumperica' as well as a hand gun.  Next, <strong>Sasa</strong> and <strong>Miljenko Zadro</strong> led away another two prisoners and again he heard shooting and a few cries, while the prisoners in the van were quiet.  He doesn't remember how exactly it went from there, but about half way through it he went together with  Zadro to the cellar door; two persons were already there - the prisoners; he shot one of them from a 'TT', caliber 7.62mm; three or four bullets; the man he shot had his back towards Brisevac.  Immediately after the two men fell in the cellar, he went back to the courtyard because he sensed a strange smell and was feeling sick.  At the very end, when there was no one left in the van, he went with Zadro and Bego back to the cellar door, where another three prisoners were standing and shot at them.  He was shooting from a 'TT', Zadro from a machine gun and Bego, as far as Brisevac remembers,  from a hand gun.  After the shooting and after these three men fell in the cellar, Miljenko Zadro fired into the cellar, at the bodies, about 30-40 bullets from a machine gun; Brisevac warned him not to do it, since one of the bullets could ricochet and hurt them.<P>

After all this shooting, Sasa threw a hand grenade into the cellar, and immediately afterwards, Bego asked him if he could throw in another one and, since Sasa said that he could, Bego threw another grenade into the cellar."<P>

After that, the house was destroyed with plastic explosives.  Brisevac, in his statement said that " he does not know who the victims were; he claims that he doesn't know their identities and says that he didn't look at their faces;  however, since they were in jail, he supposes that they were Chetniks."  He also said that at the spot nobody issued a specific order to execute the prisoners: "it was presumed; he saw what the others were doing and joined in in order not to be left out; he believes that if he stayed on the side that might have been bad for his life."<P>

According to the official report, Miroslav Brisevac admitted being an accomplice to the murders of two prisoners ("who were, before the execution, interrogated with the help of an inductive telephone set") at the time while the so-called Mercep's unit was in the Gospic area:<P>

"After the interrogation, the two prisoners were placed in a van and all of us (<strong>Jozo, Igor, 'Ceno', Zadro, Madarevic, Scmuch</strong> and Brisevac) went with them on the road between Gospic and Ostarje; about half way between Gospic and Ostarje we stopped the van at a rest stop; an abyss was on the other side of the road.  At the mentioned rest stop, they took out the younger prisoner, led him to the other side of the road and, all together, shot at him; as he fell down at the edge of the abyss, they had to push him over the edge.  After that they carried the older prisoner out of the van, because he was unable to walk due to the beating he had received earlier; they shot him and pushed him into the abyss."<P>

The report also contains the following description of the execution of two prisoners in the village of Janja Lipa, near Pakracka Poljana; the execution was carried out at the edge of a grave dug out by another three prisoners.  Besides Brisevac, <strong>Igor Mikola</strong> and <strong>Sinisa Rimac</strong> also took part in the execution.<P>

"After the shooting was finished, Igor Mikola ordered the other three prisoners, whom he called 'official personnel' to drag the corpse to the grave; they obeyed his order.<P>

After that the 'official personnel' stepped aside and Rimac said not to shoot at the other prisoner, because he was 'his'.  Rimac pulled him out of a truck and led him to the grave; while he was doing that he was also swearing at the prisoner saying 'why are you limping, you mother fucker?'.<P>

At the grave, the prisoner was made to face the already dead victim and then Rimac took out a hand gun and shot the prisoner in the back of the head; the victim fell next to the grave, beside a tree; then Mikola and Brusevac came closer and both fired several bullets into the body; he remembers that he fired 2-3 bullets.  After that, the 'official personnel' dragged the other victim to the grave and Mikola told them to cover the bodies.  While the prisoners were covering the bodies the three of them (Mikola, Brisevac and Rimac) were standing next to the grave.  He thinks that the prisoner with a ski hat lost the hat, so that someone picked it up and threw it in the grave."<P>

<h2>Tomislav Mercep: I Didn't Want To Betray Them</h2>

In the official report made on 1/2/1992, <strong>Tomislav Mercep</strong> stated that the boys he had known from Vukovar would, "when they were free, do a lot of stupid things and get in trouble," around Gospic, in Karlobag, Crikvenica and other towns.  When he found out about the problems he didn't approve but tried to protect them, because he knew that many of them had lost their families and that during the time spent in Vukovar, "they simply went nuts."  They distinguished themselves in all actions; hence Mercep "tried to protect them by not doing anything once he found out about their mischiefs, like stealing cars and similar."<P>

He didn't know that they had been executing people and stealing their money, "but even if he were to find out that they killed a Chetnik or two, he wouldn't blame them, but would try to protect them."  Mercep took part in the interrogation of five-six officers captured during the take over of the barracks "Stanko Opsenica"; he beat up a certain <strong>Dotlic</strong> and hit the officer <strong>Strpac</strong> but he didn't know what happened to those two and the rest of them afterwards.<P>

In October, Mercep's unit liberated Kukunjevac, Toranj and other villages in the Pakrac area; Mercep was wounded in fighting near Lovska.  <strong>Nikola Rukavina</strong> a.k.a. <strong>"Pop"</strong> who imposed himself, <strong>Zvonko Trusic</strong> and <strong>Branko Saric Kosa</strong> (Mercep emphasized that he had appointed only Saric) took over the command of the unit; finally, <strong>Demo Palos</strong> took over the command; "he is the person who knows the most about the events in Pakracka Poljana."<P>

After the unit's arrival to Pakracka Poljana, continued Mercep, he heard that a certain <strong>Sasa (Aleksandar Antic)</strong> was there; "an amiable man who knew how to get under everyone's skin."  Mercep didn't like the fact that Sasa was in the headquarters:  a Serb should not be more than a soldier.  But, once he heard that Sasa was competent and capable of everything, he thought about sending him to Serbia to carry out terrorist attacks.  Sasa accepted that task.  Mercep had Sasa take his car to a wash on one occasion; several days later he noticed that some 50-60 reserve police identification cards were missing.  Sasa denied any connection with their disappearance; Mercep told him to stay out of Poljana and wait to be sent to Serbia.  After that, according to Mercep's version, Sasa simply disappeared.  Only later, Mercep found out that Demo had become suspicious of Sasa; Demo ordered that Sasa be caught, interrogated and executed;  Mercep didn't know who had carried out the execution.<P>

To the question whether he knew anything about the executions in the village of Bujavica, Mercep replied that he had seen the action of cleansing of that village, but that he didn't know anything about executions of Chetniks or any other persons.  His answer regarding <strong>Stipe Mandarelo</strong>, was similar; Mercep had met Mandarelo on the Zagreb fairgrounds; Mandarelo had been a commander of one of the units in Poljana. Mercep had heard that Mandarelo, in order to settle some old accounts, was abducting customs officers and detaining them in Pakracka Poljana.  Later, Mercep heard that Mandarelo was some kind of a buffoon, "that's how he looked too," and that he joined the whole thing for his own interest and personal profit.<P>

Mercep depicted <strong>Marina</strong>, i.e. <strong>Ina Zoricic</strong> as a sick person who had an affair with Nikola Rukavina.  Marina's husband <strong>Sanjin</strong> even demanded through Mercep that Rukavina, a.k.a. Pop returns his wife.  Pop, who like the other boys from Vukovar "has gone nuts", on one occasion brought to Mercep, to a hospital, a hand gun and said that Marina was supposed to kill Mercep with that hand gun.  Mercep didn't take that seriously.  At the funeral of <strong>Pavo Mlinaric</strong>, a man he had known from Vukovar and for whom he could say that he had been a good fighter, Mercep saw Marina for the first time.<P>

In the police report, signed by <STRONG>Nikola Jambrek</strong>, we can read:" On that occasion he didn't order anything regarding Marina to anyone of the present men; several days after the funeral, Rimac and the others told him that Marina had 'swam away';  he was revolted by that and told them everything, because he was of the opinion that it was a sin to kill such a sick person and that she was harmless;  she only talked a lot because she was sick and a female.  Although he knew what happened and that the culprits were the boys from Vukovar, Tomislav didn't do anything in particular trying to justify their act and decided not to betray them.  He later found out from the same boys that the order for Marina's execution was given by Demo."<P>

Mercep was very angry when he realized that Poljana was actually "a brothel" (he had  said a long time ago that women should be chased away from there) and that things "were not done properly", but he didn't want to stress too much about that.  By the way, it is stated in the official report "he doesn't know that there was a jail in Poljana nor that some people were keeping detained there for a long time; he only knows that three men were imprisoned there according to the orders of <strong>Vlada Delac</strong>; one of them had a big head.  When he found out about those people, Tomo reacted immediately and demanded that those men be released, if they were not guilty, and if they were, that they be moved somewhere else because there was no reason to keep them and feed them in Pakracka Poljana."<P>

Here is the end of the report made after the interrogation in the Ministry of Internal Affairs of the republic of Croatia, where Mercep is an adviser:" Tomislav adds that he realizes his responsibility for the actions of the group of people from Vukovar, but that their actions and behavior can be explained by all the traumas they have been trough since the beginning of this war as well as the loss of their dearest.  Because each one of them has lost someone from the closest family and because they were essentially good people, Tomislav was always ready to back them up and protect them, although he has heard that they were doing stupid and illegal things.  All of them, except for Rimac, yearned for an easy and luxurious life, which they were unable to achieve; because of that, carried away by events, they probably did things which were not in order.  He tried to keep them together and protect them because they didn't have anyone else who would take care of them.  However, because of his obligations in the Ministry of Internal Affairs and on the front, he lost control of a good deal of things.  It is possible that certain events mentioned in this conversation have occured, but he certainly was not in the position to prevent them since, because of other obligations, he failed to control people with whom he worked and, mostly, trusted.  He also mentions that he has heard for the butcher Zec only after his murder and that he is bothered in that whole case by the fact that the boys had killed a child, although one should suspend the final judgment until the motive for the act is known."<P>

<h1>Stipe Mesic Evicted</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Danica Juricic</em>, Slobodna Dalmacija, Split, Croatia, 9/14/95</h2>

ZAGREB: President of HDN [Croatian Independent Democrats, party founded by Stipe Mesic (former Croatian parliament president  and a close friend of Franjo Tudman) and Josip Manolic after their split from the ruling party, HDZ, Croatian Democratic Union], Stipe Mesic, held on Wednesday, in the center of the city, in Miskecov Prolaz, an unofficial press conference with journalists who happened to be there; the subject of the conference was the process in which Stipe Mesic was being evicted from the apartment which had been put aside for his use by the government a while ago.<P>

"This is a result of a capricious decision made by president Tudman; this process has nothing to do with the rule of law!  I am experiencing this for a second time in my life; only now it is worse than in 1971 [year of so called "Croatian spring" during which a Croatian independence/separatist movement peaked in strength and was consequently suppressed by Tito].  Then, two policemen and citizens were present as witnesses and now there are 11 policemen in the apartment.  This event is a proof that we can forget all illusions about the rule of law in Croatia; if I can be unconstitutionally thrown out of an apartment, although I have an immunity as a member of the Croatian parliament, then plain mortals are without protection!  This state will move towards democracy when those who intend to steel from the state decide to protect their loot; then, we will get the rule of law.  Who can I complain to?  I have immunity.  I guess, the only thing left for them is to arrest me.  The government doesn't govern; Nikica [Valentic, prime minister] doesn't represent anyone; he hasn't even informed me.  I've told Tudman that I'm more dangerous for him dead then alive; I am waiting for an assassination!" Mesic fumed in front of the gathered people.<P>

To the question whether he had the legal right to use the apartment from which he had to move out within 24 hours, Mesic replied that the apartment had been set aside for his official use two years ago when he had been a president of Sabor [Croatian parliament]. The government provided the furniture and, according to Mesic, Mesic himself has been paying the rent and other expenses.  When he resigned his presidency, Mesic intended to move out of the apartment; however, because of the public works on Ilica, he was unable to move into the apartment owned by his wife.  "The government has never asked me to move out of the apartment in Miskecov Prolaz and I was waiting for the work on Ilica to end.  The apartment is the property of the city of Zagreb, which gave it to the government and the government to me.  Now, Branko Miksa is evicting me from the apartment on behalf of the city of Zagreb; however, I have nothing to do with the city, only with the government.  Police tried to force me out of the apartment yesterday, but I used my immunity and they gave up.  Today, 11 policemen arrived with an eviction notice; they told me that they had received the notice from the highest levels of the Croatian state authorities; now the process of the eviction from the apartment has started.  The government representative, Mladen Martinic, appeared only this morning in order to repossess the government property. All this could have been solved differently," Mesic was scathing in front of the journalists.<P>

Slowly, the eviction from the apartment in Miskecov Prolaz was turning into a rally in support of opposition.  Several HND members also appeared.  Slavko Degoricija stated:" This has nothing to do with Stipe Mesic; this is an attack on the president of HND and a dictatorship which wants to intimidate opposition and cause confusion in HND.  HDZ was unable to buy off HND's representatives in the parliament;  they even made up a story according to which 38 HND members switched over to HDZ in Pakrac [town in western Slavonia, east from Zagreb]; we don't even have a local party organization in Pakrac!  They blew up a restaurant owned by our man in Kutjevo and told him that they would repair everything if he returned to HDZ; otherwise, they would finish the job.  In the election pilot project in Orahovica, opposition parties won 56% of votes.  That is why they are introducing measures whose purpose is  to cause pre-election fear in the opposition; it is even possible that the opposition will boycott these elections."<P>

Marko Veselica also showed up in Miskecov Prolaz; he stated that acts like these worsen the atmosphere before elections and that he was also considering boycott of the election.  Marko Veselica called the eviction of Stipe Mesic criminal.  Dr. Zvonimir Separovic emphasized that he had come to raise his voice against an open, brutal and totalitarian act. "It makes no sense to provide an alibi for any kind of democracy; just read the election laws and the government controlled press.  Let the opposition show its power, protect its member and boycott the election!  I am ashamed to live in a state in which not even a shred of the rule of law remains.  The world will find out about this, because members of HND have already informed all embassies.  This is the end of world for Croatian democracy," said Separovic; then, with sympathy, facetiously he asked Mesic:" Tell me Stipe, did they beat you? Seriously."  Stipe Mesic forcefully denied that and headed for the parliament, certain that his immunity was not so much in question that he wouldn't be allowed to enter the parliament building. <P>

<TITLE>Foreign Media and the Freedom of Press in Croatia</TITLE>

<h1>Envious Hissings</h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Branimir Luksic</em>, Slobodna Dalmacija, Split, Croatia, 9/14/95</h2>

I have just read a report written by a student from Berlin University in which he concludes that, according to the data he has been able to obtain from the "secondary sources", there is no freedom of press in Croatia, or at least that it is endangered; he also states that there are only two independent papers in Croatia.  One of them is <em><a HREF="/info/students/marko/croind.html">Feral Tribune</a></em> and the other one, probably, <em>Novi List</em> from Rijeka.  The report of this young man, who has otherwise shown good will towards Croatia, has scientific aspirations, since it had to consider historical, legal and political factors.<P>

The "secondary sources" which the author has used consist, mainly, of the articles by Slavenka Drakulic, Vesna Kesic and Dubravka Ugresic published in German papers and the reports on <em>Feral Tribune</em> in Tagesspiel and Tageszeitung.  Author also quotes the article by our well known journalist, Danko Plevnik, published on 3/19/93 in Frankfunter Rundschau, in which Plevnik stated that the struggle for freedom of press had been lost in Split after the resistance of the journalists against the power of Franjo Tudman over Croatian media had been crushed.  The answer to the reader's question about why the author didn't also use "primary sources", about which he strives to make a judgment, is that he doesn't speak Croatian and didn't use translator's services.  The author's logical abilities probably aren't particularly strong, since he claims that in a certain country there is no freedom of press because, supposedly, only two papers are independent of the state censorship.<P>

<center><h2>Examples</h2></center>

The surprise of that young man during his recent visit to Croatia reached heights of religious doubt when he was presented with several translated recent articles from the Croatian papers; articles about Croatian government written according to the Ante Markovic's recipe, about why Croatia hasn't yet been admitted into the Council of Europe, about the beaten up refugee family from Vukovar, literal translations of articles from foreign papers critical of Croatia, then statements of Croatian politicians from the far right to the far left ends of the political spectrum; finally he was told that Danko Plevnik had continued writing for <a HREF="/info/students/marko/SD.html">Slobodna Dalmacija</a> and that he was still a social and political critic.<P>

In the program, "Europe today", which BBC broadcasted on 8/22 in English throughout the world, the editor interviewed Drago Hedl, who was introduced as a former editor of the satirical paper <em>Feral Tribune</em>.  On that occasion, Hedl stated that in Croatia, radio and TV were controlled by the state, that there was no freedom of press, with few exceptions, among which <em>Feral Tribune</em> was the most important;  he also stated that the continuation of the triumphalism in connection with the success of the operation "Storm" could lead to the oppression of the non-Croatian population, and that even the most important opposition party [HSLS, Croatian Liberals] was forced to applaud the operation "storm" and say that the operation was a "big" victory since otherwise that party would have been proclaimed to be traitorous; finally he claimed that the Croatian government obstructed the return of Serbs to Croatia.  BBC considered the interview so interesting that it rebroadcasted the interview the following morning.<P>

I don't intend to say that in Croatia the freedom of media, especially television, is always on the level of the rights proclaimed in the constitution, that the editors and correspondents sometimes don't succumb to the well known self defense mechanism of autocensorship and that the owners of the papers don't try to give the general direction to the editorial policy of their papers, sometimes because of the political poltroonery, but mostly because of their party affiliations.  But that is nothing new; this is done in other democratic countries, somewhere with more and somewhere with less success.  Just try to publish an anti-Semitic article in Der Spiegel or try to criticize Churchill in Daily Telegraph!<P>

<center><h2>Slander</h2></center>

However, after almost half of a century of following English, German and French press I am completely convinced that one can find in the Croatian wartime press more examples of free criticism of authorities, irresponsible slandering of this and that, and, not seldom, more examples of obscene, anarchic and destructive criticism than in the foreign peacetime press.  Should we, therefore, be surprised when foreigners, because of lack of knowledge of our language and complicated political past in this area, take personal envy of former members of red nomenklatura or vain egoists, especially when this envy is presented in foreign media by the anticroatian lobby, for a well-founded democratic criticism of Croatia?  If BBC did inform its listeners that Drago Hedl was during the communist division on  suitable and unsuitable a communist party member and a pro-yugoslav oriented journalist working for the [communist] regime, the evaluation of his statements would have been more complete.<P>

How can our young student from Berlin and other foreign readers know that a good part of slanderers of everything Croatian abroad are former udbasi [UDBA, Yugoslav counterintelligence service], yugomaniacs, people who spied on their colleagues, communist politician's lackeys, salon callporters of "humanist marxism" who, because of their political "shouting" led comfortable lives and traveled on state expense to congresses and summer schools, great committee inquisitors, bull terriers and a few members of the former regime scum?<P>

The majority of those simply cannot stand anything Croatian, so that even a mention of a word Croat gives them hepatitis.  They don't care that Croatia was during both Yugoslavias [royalist Yugoslavia, 1918-1941, and Communist Yugoslavia, 1945-1990], according to Krleza [Miroslav Krleza, greatest contemporary Croatian writer], "an annexed western province, object and a sphere of interest of Serbian business" ["prisajedinjena precanska provincija, objekt i interesna sfera carsije"].  It never occured to these todays lyricists of Tito's Yugoslavia, to raise their voice in defense of human rights of those who couldn't perform any more important state function, from a judge to a paper editor and even a president of a hunting society, only because they attended church.  Not knowing these personal data, foreigners, obviously cannot distinguish between envious hissings of these spiritual monsters who in the former regime lived of the blood taxes of the second rate citizens and acquired jobs and positions of power by denouncing their more honest and qualified colleagues, and justified criticism by those whose lives during the communist regime were a reprimand to the authorities and who continue today to point out that the change of the state coat of arms doesn't automatically change people.<P>

<center><h2>Task</h2></center>

Nations without a state often experience that a part of their people enters the  service of a highest foreign bidder.  Those mercenaries are then usually the most loyal servants of their masters and the loudest critics of their own people.  This tradition, unfortunately, also exists among the Croats.  Therefore, today, when Croats have their own state, we should much more seriously strive that our state is objectively and comprehensively presented abroad.  We shouldn't be afraid of the truth because Croatian people, with its generosity in forgiveness, patience in suffering and perseverance and industriousness, can easily compete with other European peoples.  However, Croatian diplomatic and consular offices abroad usually stay out of the local media and academic circles and at home we don't have a single serious foreign language paper which would present significant events from the political and cultural life of the country and its economy.<P>

It is time to give this task to capable and honorable people, who, thank God, can be found among Croats, both in Croatia and abroad, instead of giving it to the incapable political servants without knowledge.<P>

<h1>We Will Defend Blaskic</h1>

<strong><em> by Dr. Slobodan Lang</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nedjeljna Dalmacija, Februrary 1, 1996</h2>

<h3>Tuesday, January 23, 1996</h3>

      I  met with the Bishop on my way back from Banja Luka.
We   talked   about  the  individuals  who  were   arrested,
especially  those  arrested  by General  Sumanovac  and  don
Matanovic.   We also asked about the Jewish community;  they
are  only  in  Doboj.  We even spoke with Serbs who  escaped
from  Croatia about the universally important issue of human
rights.  The mass in Banja Luka was magnificent.  The Bishop
was  surrounded by children, and on that very same  spot  we
participated  in  the  prayer to which  we  invited  all  of
Croatia  to a year ago.  Today you cannot say that  you  did
not  know;  from  today  on  you are  responsible  for  your
thoughts, words, actions and failures to act.  We  left  the
cathedral  to  attend the mass given at  Petricavac  by  the
Franciscans.  We delivered the message from the President of
the  Republic  of Croatia to the assembly of  Croatians  and
while  surrounded by the Serbian militia, we told them  that
the  state of Croatia exists, that it is strong and that  it
will  help  them, and that the Croatians in Banja  Luka  are
waiting for them.  One by one, they are waiting for Croatia.
Someone is waiting for medicine, someone else is waiting for
a job, a third person is waiting for a school book, a fourth
person is in jail, a fifth has lost all of his dignity,  and
they  are  all looking towards Zagreb, towards Croatia,  and
they   are  hoping  that  we  will  forget  about  our   own
disagreements  and  problems and  remember  the  Banja  Luka
exists.   That there are Croatians in Banja Luka.   And  the
commitments to them.<P>
     I am speaking with Granic, both of them.  I am thinking
about  the  brothers.  I have learned from my own experience
that  conflicts between brothers have always existed in this
region.   Politics  is  always  attempting  to  thwart   the
brothers.   This  time the brothers have defeated  politics.
Raise  a  glass to the brothers' victory over politics.   We
have  completed the first action evidencing the rescuing  of
old people in liberated regions, we are saving lives.  There
is no man left here.  I hope that the program against social
collapse will help others as well.<P>
      I  am speaking with Blaskic over the phone. I am proud
to walk the streets of Zagreb with General Blaskic.  He is a
young man who applied his military knowledge to the survival
of  the  Croatian people.  At the time of the Serbian attack
on  Slovenia  he  refused to participate in  aggression  and
abandoned  the  attacking army.  He went to central  Bosnia.
They gathered their people to strive towards their survival.
In ninety-two against the Serbian army, and in 93 while they
were  surrounded there was conflict between the  Croats  and
Moslems.  Ninety-four and 95, together with the army of  BiH
he  participated  and  commanded the liberation  of  Kupres.
This  was  the  basis for the liberation  of  the  whole  of
Croatia.  Baskic was indicted for war crimes.  If the Croats
of  central Bosnia are war criminals then that can  only  be
because they exist.  The Croats from central Bosnia are  the
strongest  force of Bosnia and Herzegovina.   They  are  the
only ones who are working towards the total unity of Croats.
The Tribunal at the Hague is financed by the world, presided
over  by  judges from South Africa, and Croats from  central
Bosnia  should  be the first to be tried.   I'm  asking  and
accusing  - isn't a person innocent until he/she  is  proven
guilty?   Don't  Zagreb and Croatia have  an  obligation  to
offer the possibility of innocence to those accused of being
guilty for having defended the Croatian people.  Who are  we
if  we  label our own people as guilty as soon as  they  are
accused?  When will this inquisition of our leaders end  and
when will it cease to be called moral.<P>

<h3>Wednesday, January 24</h3>

      Here comes Marko Stekic, a Franciscan from Tuzla.   He
is  very  satisfied  with  the  Dayton  Agreements,  and  he
believes that it offers them lots of opportunities.  When  I
see father Mark, I'm reminded of Nova Bila in the winter  of
1992.  October 30, 1992, the exit from Jajce, Podmilacje,  I
still haven't been there.<P>
      We  are  seeing to the first humanitarian coordination
with  Damir  Zoric.  Kostovic is speaking.  It is  extremely
important  to increase the coordination between humanitarian
organizations.  After the coordination I met with Damir  and
people  from  Posavina.   We arranged  to  meet  at  Damir's
regularly.   We  agreed  that  Damir  would  help  with  his
international connections.  Lets not forget that  there  are
many   more  refugees  from  Posavina  than  from   Croatian
Podunavlje.   I  left that same night to visit  the  British
Ambassador.   I  informed him about the situation  in  Banja
Luka.  This is his area of responsibility.  I asked him that
all  Croats and Moslems be listed.  I do not wish to  defend
human rights after someone has been hurt.  I wish to prevent
it.   Don't we know how many of our people are still  living
there (and there are about 7000 people).<P>

<h3>Thursday, January 25</h3>

      The Bishop from Banja Luka writes.  He is accusing the
Croatian Defense Council of forcing people from Majdan.   As
soon  as the newspapers began writing about it, I knew  that
we  knew nothing about it.  I knew  the information  in  the
newspapers   was   not  correct.   I've  never   found   any
information of any value greater that to motivate you to  go
see for yourself.  Majdan began to occupy my thoughts.  What
is  oMaydanoe?   Here  comes Olga Papac.   From  women,  from
mothers, disappeared and taken away by force.  We are seeing
what  we have accomplished.  What has been done to find  our
missing  and  those who were taken away?   These  women  are
willing  to  continue trying to find out, to  the  point  of
exhaustion.  Every official gets nervous when approached  by
them.  What can a Croatian man do to made Milosevic  release
the  people who are missing and those who were carried away.
He  cannot  do anything.  He can only swallow his pride  and
tears.   Americans should be obliged to do this.  It is  the
personal  responsibility of the American president.   It  is
unacceptable that the Red Cross be a medium by which  people
disappear,  and  a form of euthanasia for their  own  shame.
For  our own sake, for their sake, for the sake of today and
tomorrow,  it  is important to find those who  are  missing.
There  cannot  be any peace without it.  It is  possible  to
quiet  the  weapons for the time being, but it is impossible
to  build a peace.  Olga Kruhinja is coming to visit me from
Osijek.   She wants to influence the establishment of  peace
in eastern Slavonia and Croatian Podunavlje.  She has a very
good  relationship  with international  organizations.   She
wishes   to   rebuild  the  peace  among   people   of   all
nationalities successfully or unsuccessfully,  honorably  or
shamefully,  long-term or short-term, in a any way  at  all.
She  asks  whether there is place for such people.   Is  she
excessive?  There are no excessive people.We are holding the
first  coordinating meeting for human rights with the  vice-
president  Hodak-Mintas.  It was very useful and successful.
Human  rights are the hygiene of the 20th and 21st  century.
This  is  not  an inquisition into our people to  purge  the
devil, but an opportunity for good.  That night I was  going
to  meet with a group of Croatians from Srijem.  They  speak
of Srijem, in the past and in the present.  But they wish to
talk  about future wishes, they want to be connected to  it.
They  were  ustashas, but they are all in  mixed  marriages.
They  wanted to be friends with everyone, while being a part
of  Croatia.   Now  they simply wish to be  a  part  of  the
Croatian society and Croatian culture.  They are looking for
and thinking about rebuilding bridges.<P>


<h3>Friday, January 26</h3>

     I am speaking with Dr. Anicic, the Vicar of Banja Luka,
Doris  Pack from the European Parliament. Javornik from  the
Red  Cross, Granic and Soljic.  The conversation turned onto
the topic of Majdan.  We should go to Majdan.  I arranged to
go  to  Vienna with Bekic on the 31st.   Friends are calling
me from America.  I asked some Jewish lawyers about Blaskic.
If  Croatian intellectuals are going to be reserved, then it
is  the  responsibility of the Jews to stand up for Blaskic.
Think  about it.  I meet with the mothers again and we  make
plans  for  next  week.  I have Boris from  Split  over  for
dinner.  We talk about relatives, family, blood and killing.
Mostly about the sons.  They are studying, both of them  are
o.k.<P>

<h3>
Saturday, January 27<br>
Sunday, January 28</h3>

      In  the  morning, Branko Culo, Beri, Boris and  I  got
going  on  our  trip.   That true road Zagreb-Split  with  a
coffee  at Plitvice and at Knin.  We are approaching  Trilj,
and we agree on dinner plans.  There is no better hotel than
the Sveti Mihovil in Trilj.  One hasn't been in a good hotel
until  they have been in this hotel.  All the Sheratons  put
together  don't add up to Sveti Mihovil.  If IFOR finds  out
about  it  they will never leave here.  At five  o'clock  we
meet  with Mirkovic from Croatian Radio-Television,  Vidovic
from  the  Red  Cross of Bosnia and Herzegovina,  and  Ignac
Kostroman from the political office of the Croatian  Defense
Council.   Not a bad score.  The Croatian meetings in  every
direction  in Kupres.  We arrived at six and met an  endless
crowd  of  people.  Father Visaticki, a Pole,  three  Polish
brothers,  priests  from the Croatian area  around  Mrkonjic
Grad,  Majdan and the surrounding area maintaining the unity
of  the  people.  They have gone through so  much  that  you
would advise journalists to only speak with them.  I meet  a
Croat  who  was in Manjaca, but he does not speak  much  for
obvious reasons.  And then there is the Kovcalija family.  I
met  them for the first time in Dalj on the Dunav in  August
of  91 when their father was killed and their mother and two
year-old  daughter stayed behind with the remaining  Croats,
waiting to leave Dalj.  I wanted to take this little girl to
live with me and I could not get ever the fact that she  was
not  mine.   Throughout the war I thought of her every  day.
And,  she  went  from  Dalj, in war-torn  Slavonia  and  the
Croatian  Podunavlje,  to search for peace  in  Majdan  near
Jajce.  I am now after five years in Majdan.  And her  uncle
and her mother are leaving the village, a place where Croats
have  lived  since  the  12th century.   A  place  that  was
conquered  by  the Croatian army, liberated from  terror,  a
government  in which even the doctors where criminals.   And
now that human rights are being protected Majdan has to once
again be under Serb authority, and the representatives  from
these  human rights organizations, civil administration  did
not  even  come to tell these people what their rights  are,
what  can  be  done,  how can they be protected from  future
persecution.   The  only  man  who  came  was  the  man  who
persecuted  them during the war returned to tell  them  that
they would once again answer to him, and from the other side
came the Croats from the Croatian Army to catch them.<P>

<h3>Monday, January 29</h3>

I  spend some time in Jajce, I talk to some people from  the
municipal   council.   A  thousand  people   returned,   the
wonderful town of Vrbas, Pliva, next to a huge lake.  One of
the  most beautiful towns I have ever seen. Many people have
returned and they want to create a city, but its realization
would  take  the support of all of Croatia.  One  must  know
that the big hospital that used to be staffed by 105 doctors
now  has  only four.  Hebrang should come here.  A  hospital
project  is  necessary in Jajce.  We go to Podmilacje,  near
Sveti  Ivo.  We meet father Peter at the ruins of the  erect
Croatian  sanctuary, the largest sanctuary in  Bosnia.   And
the  Podmilacje ruins call every man and every Croat to come
to  Podmilacje and to commit himself to building his country
and  himself.  While I am there I learn from the radio  that
there  has  been an exchange of prisoners and that  at  that
very moment 11 Croatian prisoners had just arrived in Jajce.
Man would let himself be overcome with happiness, but then I
look   at   and  read  about  the  suffering,  the   crimes.
Unbelievable  crimes.  I don't even want to talk  about  it.
Pain.   We have to carry the ruins within us and around  us.
In Dubrovnik I said "let them knock down the walls, a people
will  rise."  Are we still willing to grow as people in  our
souls, around us, in all of Croatia?<P>
      The post war era has begun.  We are creating tomorrow.
I  have  to go to Mostar, at 6 o'clock I am on the tribunal
at  the  Franciscans' in the destroyed church at the wounded
Christ.   When the church was burned, the Christ was  burned
but  the wood inside was untouched by the flames.  The  city
is  destroyed, wounded body, and saved soul.  The message in
1992 was clear, we are protecting the soul.  Everything else
can be sacrified.<P>

<h1> Press Conference at the U.N. Headquarters in Zagreb: Accusations From a Secret Document</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by B.Lopandic<br>  Slobodna Dalmacija, 5/6/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

ZAGREB - Extremely disturbing news arrived on Thursday night.  According to those informations, the Croatian Army was grossly violating human rights of the surrounded Serbs, both civilians and soldiers.  Further, drunk Croatian Army members began an organized looting in the area of Okucani [town in Western Slavonia].  Because of these reports, a Security Council statement which condemns the violations of human rights has been issued.  Christopher Gunness, a U.N. spokesperson, started with these statements a press conference on Friday, in Zagreb. <p>

Croatian Army members forcibly separated soldiers from civilians as well as males, women and children, which is a human rights violation.  The agreement stipulated a demobilization and a free passage, not a capture.  To the journalist's question about the sources of UNCRO information (since many journalists had been in the area and had not seen any traces of what Gunness was talking about) Gunness replied: a report by the EU observers who were on the spot!  To the demands that he read the document, if it exists, in its entirety and out loud, Gunness responded that he was in possession of the document but couldn't read it because it was a secret document.  "How can you talk about the organized looting by drunk and unrestrained soldiers?  How can drunk soldiers be organized?" asked the journalists.  However, they did not get an answer.  Instead, the spokesperson Gunness repeatedly referred to the breaking of the agreement by the Croatian forces.  According to the U.N. informations the units of the Croatian Army fired more than 19 shells on the territory on which the Serbs were located.  Nevertheless, at the press conference, Colonel Walt Natynczyk stated that it was not known who fired first 6 shells, after which a fierce shelling started;  however, it is known for sure that those 17 shells were fired by the Croats.  U.N. functionaries did not want to speculate about why the Croatian Army fired those shells or whether the Serbs had started first with provocations, giving the lack of informations as a reason.  On frequent journalist's queries on why about some things they [U.N.] know everything and about others nothing, Gunness kept replying by referring to the "secret report" by the EU monitors.<p> 

Because of the U.N.'s extreme concern regarding the civilians who had been taken to different cities, UNCRO was trying to carefully monitor their movement in order to ascertain they were not being mistreated.  "We must say that the Croatian Army treats them correctly; they were given necessary aid and we are not aware of any cases of mistreatment," said Gunness, adding that they were concerned because the Serbs had been taken away.  Trying to explain the chain of events, Col. Natynczyk said that the shelling had started when everything about the evacuation of the Serbs across the river Save had been agreed.  He refused to comment the news about a division in the Serb group, saying that he had no information about that; he also could not say why Dzakula [one of the local Serb leaders] surrendered and had not accepted to be evacuated across the Sava.  "I guess because of those 17 shells," flippantly responded Natynczyk.  After the journalists insisted that this was a serious question, Natynczyk replied that he did not know what Dzakula had been thinking, but that he had been surprised when Dzakula had been brought in handcuffs by the Croatian forces.<p>

It was also reported at the press conference that it was tense in other sectors where the Croatian Army had entered the zones of separation and was bringing in reinforcements and digging in heavy weapons.  Regarding the Croatian Army artillery attack in the Sector West, the journalists wanted to know whether it had occured due to weak coordination or disobedience.  "Military headquarters make decisions about an artillery attack," said Natynczyk, stating that it was worrying that on many spots in all sectors the Croatian Army claimed it could not guarantee the security of UNCRO peacekeepers.  "When we are not allowed through, it is certain that something is going on, and that is worrying," said Natynczyk.<p>

<h1> HDZ Leaders Donate Blood</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by A.Malenica<br>  Slobodna Dalmacija, 5/6/95, Split, Croatia</i></h2><p>


<hr>

ZAGREB - The leaders and members of the HDZ [Hrvatska Demokratska Zajednica, Croatian Democratic Union; Ruling party in Croatia] responded to the invitation by the Institute for Transfusionology by donating blood on the premises of the party's General Secretariat.  The drive for voluntary blood donations started at 8:30 and finished at 12:00;  during that time many parliamentarians as well as the members of the General Secretariat donated blood, also joined by the employees of the many companies whose offices are located nearby.<p>

The Secretary-General of the HDZ, Zlatko Canjuga, said that the HDZ organizes such drives every 2-3 months and that the latest one was, as he emphasized, the least the leadership of the HDZ could do regarding the serious situation in Croatia and Zagreb.<p> 

He also expressed satisfaction with the response of the HDZ members to this humanitarian action, emphasizing that it was a small part of the HDZ's contribution to the general situation. "This way, we'll help the Croatian defenders, policemen and civilians who were hurt in these savage Serbian attacks," concluded Canjuga.<p>

Excerpts from the article<P>
<h1>THE AGREEMENT CONTAINS NO SECRET ANNEXES</h1>

<h2>Interview with Mate Granic, Croatian Foreign Affairs Minister</h2>

<strong>Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb, Croatia, September 2, 1996</strong><P>

In Geneva on 19 January 1994, the foreign affairs ministers of the Republic
of Croatia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (FRY), Mate Granic and
Vladislav Jovanovic, signed the first agreement on the normalisation of
relations between these two states. The result of this was the opening of
offices in Belgrade and Zagreb and the beginning of serious negotiations on
the relations between the two conflicting sides. The climax of the
negotiating process was reached on 23 August when the Agreement on the
Normalisation of Relations Between the Republic of Croatia and FRY was
signed in Belgrade, according to which both states mutually recognised each
other within their international borders. We spoke to Mate Granic who has
been at the head of Croatian diplomacy since the very beginning of the
mentioned process and who has been an active participant in all the
bilateral meetings of the Croatian and Yugoslav delegations.<P> 

<strong> How did the agreement come about?</strong><P>

 The road was a long one. The first time an agreement which
included mutual recognition and the establishment of diplomatic relations
was discussed at all was in Dayton. This, of course does not mean that 
there
was no mention of it at all before. For instance, during the meeting 
between
President Tudjman and Cosic and later when the Geneva Declaration was
signed. However, it is clear that until now the conditions were not ripe 
for
such an agreement.<P>

<strong> Does this mean that Dayton was the turning-point in the negotiating
process?</strong><P>

 In Dayton the Croatian side insisted on the normalisation
agreement as a precondition for the start of talks on the solution to the
B-H crisis. In the same way, Croatia requested an agreement on the peaceful
reintegration of the Croatian Danube Basin into the legal system of the
Republic of Croatia. For this reason, this was the main topic of
conversation in Dayton the first four days.<P>

<strong> Was it necessary to first reach an agreement on these questions 
which
you have just mentioned before turning to the problems connected to B-H?</strong><P>

 Correct.<P>

<strong> For what reasons?</strong><P>

 Primarily because of the historical and geopolitical aspects,
namely, it is well known that the Republic of Croatia at that time, after
operation "Storm" and after several successful operations in B-H, which 
were
legally established by the Split Declaration, was twice in the situation to
solve the problem of the liberation of Banja Luka. The international
community, however, prevented the Croatian Army, the HVO and the B-H Army
from accomplishing this. This issue was the subject of serious discussions
with the United States which was interested in keeping Serbia and Milosevic
as negotiators. On the other hand they did not want the destabilisation of
the whole region, particularly south-eastern Europe and the southern wing 
of
the NATO alliance. It is important to emphasise that they wished to 
maintain
a balance in the region because of their relations with the Russian
Federation. And finally, the mass humanitarian exodus of the Serbian
inhabitants from that area was also unacceptable to them, the reason being
that Milosevic would at that time have been placed before a choice - total
war or loss of power. The Republic of Croatia then showed complete
co-operation in its relations with the international community. It showed
that it knew how to liberate its territory when it estimated it necessary
and to stop all actions when this was in agreement with the international
community. In this way, along with the mentioned actions and the sanctions
against FRY, as well as NATO attacks in B-H, we arrived at the negotiating
table.<P>

<strong>May we conclude therefore that Croatia because of its
co-operativeness and the situation on the ground had, at that time, a 
strong
geostrategic position in the region and a strengthened negotiating 
position?</strong><P>

It does seem so. If this were not so, Croatia would never have
been able to impose its condition in Dayton, which was that the peaceful
reintegration of the Croatian Danube Basin be discussed first. Our position
has not changed since then. In Dayton, therefore, the basic agreement was
reached and apart for this, the normalisation of relations was agreed on.<P>

<strong> A long time, however, passed before it was signed. What are the
reasons for this?</strong><P>

In Paris, Belgrade was unwilling to sign because of Prevlaka,
namely, they suggested a three-way exchange of territory which we did not
even wish to discuss. After that there were several other meetings within
the Peace Conference in Geneva between presidents Tudjman and Milosevic and
between Minister Milutinovic and myself, which however brought no result or
agreement. It is necessary to add though that the reintegration of the
Croatian Danube Basin went its course and was within the predicted time
limits. The demilitarisation process was particularly successful. When we
bear this mind, then it is clear that this could not have been undertaken
without the support and co-operation of Belgrade. These were truly positive
signs.<P>

<strong>How to interpret Belgrade's readiness to co-operate?</strong><P>

For some time we had been evaluating and expecting to receive a
suggestion from Belgrade for the full normalisation of relations and for
mutual recognition because of the situation within FRY and its 
international
position. This evaluation was confirmed by the arrival of the initiative
from Belgrade for the Athens meeting.<P>

<strong>Why was Athens chosen?</strong><P>

Belgrade suggested two states and we also gave our own
suggestions. Finally we agreed the meeting be held in Greece, which 
although
traditionally a friend of Belgrade, has in the last year or two played a
very rational role towards Croatia in the European Union and the Council of
Europe as well as in bilateral relations.<P>

<strong>Certain circles attempted to portray this meeting as some sort of 
new
"Karadjordjevo"?</strong><P>

This was not a meeting at the expense of a third party but
exclusively of a bilateral nature. It lasted about four hours and we
attempted to find a way to bridge those obstacles which had previously
prevented us from reaching an agreement.<P>

<strong>What exactly?</strong><P>

Prevlaka, the continuity of statehood and the problem of missing
persons. As far as Prevlaka was concerned, the statement was very clear,
that is that this issue was for us primarily a security dispute, while for
Belgrade it was a territorial dispute as well. The statement states that we
must draw demarcation lines on the sea with FRY and allow the free passage
of vessels into the Boka Kotorska Bay. This will be regulated by an
agreement and stipulations of international law also exist. It is also 
clear
that Prevlaka is a security problem for Boka Kotorska and a part of
Dubrovnik. And fourthly, we must emphasise the existence of the observer
system established by the UN mission. When we solved this, we found the
corresponding formulations and removed the obstacles to the signing of the
agreement and we turned to talks on the continuity of statehood. We agreed
on a solution by which not only Croatia, but also Slovenia, B-H and
Macedonia should be pleased with. It is necessary to add that Macedonia was
the first to have solved this issue with Belgrade.<P>

<strong>The first article of the Agreement uses the phrase that both states
respect each other as sovereign states within their internationally
recognised borders. Why is the term "recognised" not used?</strong><P>

Because Croatia has been recognised by the UN. In this way,
Belgrade respects us as such an independent and equal state. This is an 
even
stronger formulation and there is not a trace of ambiguity. The same 
applies
to Article 2 which states that both states will respect each other in
accordance with international laws. These two articles together leave no
room for any speculation.<P>

<strong>According to this article, FRY has, for the first time, admitted 
that
the former state fell apart, that is, there was no secession. Is that 
correct?</strong><P>

This is how we interpret it and so does the international 
community.<P>

<strong>When did Belgrade consent to not mentioning Prevlaka as a 
territorial
dispute in the agreement?</strong><P>

The question of Prevlaka was solved in the manner stated in the
Athens Agreement of the two presidents. Belgrade has, however, until the
last moment fought for a better formulation. On our part, we knew how far 
we
could go.<P>

<strong>The Croatian version of the Agreement mentions the term Croatian
Danube Basin, whereas the Serbian one mentions eastern Slavonia, Baranja 
and
western Srijem. How did this difference come about?</strong><P>

A complete consensus was reached on this issue. It was agreed
that we use this formulation and they theirs. Although we are completely
concordant with their formulation, ours has more significance to us.<P>

<strong>As for the problem of the return of Serbs into Croatia, the
international community is putting great pressure on the leadership. Will
this agreement change anything?</strong><P>

As far as pressure is concerned, it has always existed from all
sides and has never stopped. We have always maintained that individual
return had never stopped and in fact 9,500 people have received permission
to return so far. We estimate that some 12,000 have returned all together.
We do not agree, therefore, with the estimates of Ms Rehn that only
1,500-2,000 persons have returned. On the other hand, we have constantly
warned that real obstacles for their return exist. One of them is the
question of the public, second their security, in particularly because of
the regions which still remain mined and the third is that it is only after
the signing of such an agreement that conditions are created for the safe
return which will be accompanied by an added amnesty law. <P>

<strong>How much is it in Belgrade's interests for these people to return?</strong><P>

Belgrade has another type of problem. Firstly, about 35% of 
FRY's
inhabitants are non-Serbs. Kosovo is also a problem with which they are
burdened and the international community is also placing pressure on them.
There is also the question of international isolation and the problem of
entering international institutions and associations. For this reason their
estimations as far as return is concerned are quite rational and there is 
no
difference in this between Croatia, the international community and 
Belgrade.<P>

<strong>What about the return of Croats to FRY?</strong><P>

This question will be solved in the same way. I must emphasise
that this will be a voluntary act on both sides. <P>

<strong>Belgrade wished to remove the formulation about war crimes from the
agreement. What was its aim?</strong><P>

Because of pressure on their side concerning this problem. This
pressure is really great - from the international community to the Serbs in
the Croatian Danube Basin. Our stance was firm in regards to this and we
could not give in. Not only because of our public but also because 
according
to international law those who have committed a war crime may not be
amnestied. Apart from this, Croatia signed the Agreement and passed a law 
on
co-operation with the International Tribunal for War Crimes in the Hague.<P>

<strong>It may be supposed that the normalisation of relations will give new
momentum to the process of peaceful reintegration of the Croatian Danube
Basin. What is most disputable is the possibility that one side might
request the extension of the UNTAES mandate. Since Croatia's stance is
well-known, what may we expect in the near future?</strong><P>

It is possible that the Serbian side will request an extension
but it won't necessarily be accepted. The decision on this will be brought
in agreement with the Croatian government, the UN and Mr Klein. Croatia has
already begun negotiations and President Tudjman has clearly let it be 
known
that three months are the most we'll allow after which time the take-over 
of
government must be accomplished in accordance with election results which
must be held by mid December. After this period an extension of three 
months
will be allowed, but this time period refers only to the physical departure
of international units who are deployed there.<P>

<strong>What are the dynamics of the return of non-Serbs to that region?</strong><P>

The first displaced Croats will return in September. This refers
to pilot projects in five places and later this process will be extended. 
On
the other hand, there is the fact that for example in Beli Manastir, 382
Serbs waited in line to receive Croatian documents on the very first day.
This also is part of the process of peaceful reintegration. Also this
reintegration means the opening of roads, railway lines, water ways, 
opening
the border crossing into Hungary, the reconstruction of houses, the return
of people, etc. This process will soon become unstoppable.<P>

<strong>When may real return be expected?</strong><P>

In 1997. Namely, it is clear that this will occur when we take
over complete control of the borders because then we will be able to
guarantee the complete safety of people and property.<P>

<strong>FRY has been buying up the debts of the former state. To what extent
will this fact influence the process of succession?</strong><P>

This presents no problem for Croatia because it regulated its
relations with the Paris and London Clubs. By signing this Agreement,
Croatia no longer has anything to do with the former state.<P>

<strong>What will happen to the property of ordinary citizens?</strong><P>

This problem will be solved through bilateral agreements between
the newly formed states. This refers to property of citizens and companies
of the Republic of Croatia in FRY and vice versa. The third category is
property damaged n the war and for this we shall establish our own 
requests.
The Agreement allows us to ask for compensation for war damages and there 
is
also a special category for the property of refugees from both states which
is also regulated by this Agreement.<P>

<strong>Can you tell us briefly what significance the Agreement has for 
Croatia?</strong><P>

Well, we must emphasise several facts. The first one concerns 
the
international public. There is not one significant person in the world who
did not explicitly support the Agreement - from the USA, China, Great
Britain, the Russian Federation, Germany, France,, Italy, the European 
Union
and our first neighbours, B-H, Slovenia, Hungary, etc. Secondly, this
Agreement will aid the peace process in B-H and it is in no way an 
Agreement
against a third party, as some would like to portray it. Furthermore, I 
wish
to emphasise that there are no secret annexes. Apart from this, the
Agreement significantly strengthens Croatia's international position
together with the successfully solved crisis in Mostar and the agreement on
the simultaneous transfer of authority of the B-H Republic and HR Herceg
Bosna to the B-H Federation. And finally, it strengthens Croatia's position
towards the European Union and its main strategic partners, members of the
Contact Group, and opens the doors to the EU. On the domestic scene, the
Agreement speeds up the process of solving the missing persons problem. 
When
we bear all this mind, we may say that the Agreement confirms all the
strategic aims Croatia has had since 1991 - territorial sovereignty,
independence, integrity, equality, the right to development, etc. Therefore,
with this signature the war has de facto ended. <P>

<strong>To what extent may we say that this agreement marks the definite
separation of Croatia from the rest of the Balkan territory, and will there
be any decrease in the pressure for the restoration of Yugoslavia?</strong><P>

This Agreement is the final chapter of the former state and of
any kind of association. It will enable us to withstand any kind of global
regional approach of the European Union and leaves us the possibility of
creating our relations with our neighbours according to our own interests. 
I
would like to add that no one can force Croatia to do anything, and this
mood is prevalent in Macedonia, B-H, Hungary, etc. In other words, all
states in the region are of the same opinion when it comes to this issue.<P>

<strong>The B-H elections are important for Croatia as far as the process of
joining international associations are concerned. A decision has been
brought to delay municipal elections with which the already complicated
situation has become even more so, and the international community for its
own reasons is forcing the elections no matter what they are like. How will
they contribute to the stability of the region?</strong><P>

These elections will certainly not be held under ideal 
conditions
because they are the most complicated elections in history. It is clear 
that
the B-H state according to the Dayton Accords is a state consisting of two
entities and three constituent peoples and this alone makes it a highly
decentralised state. Within this framework, we firmly support the elections
because without them there is no Dayton B-H. Without the elections the 
peace
process for this region is postponed. The delay in the municipal elections
was requested by the Croats several months ago because they claimed the
conditions were not right. They, however, subsequently agreed and current
opinion is that the election results should have been annulled only in 
those
places where more serious irregularities were reported. The decision of Mr
Frowick is, nevertheless, completely legitimate and the Croatian side
accepts them in whole.<P>

<strong>There has been much talk of a "new European order" and the stability
of south-eastern Europe. Croatia and FRY appear here as guarantees of peace
in B-H. To what extent is FRY necessary to Europe in this process and may 
we
say that there will be aims for FRY to enter the Partners for Peace 
programme?</strong><P>

Croatian-Serbian relations are a vital factor in the stability
and peace of southern Europe. Without the normalisation of these relations
it would be impossible to attain the mentioned aim. FRY has also accepted
Croatia as an equal state. It is only then that the application of the
civilian part of the Dayton Accords will be facilitated. As for FRY and its
orientation it has never declared whether it wishes to enter the programme
or not. The same may be said for its membership into the Euro-Atlantic
integration. So far it has clearly stated that it wishes membership into 
the
UN, the C.S.C.E and international financial institutions. What is crystal
clear is that the West wants a stable and democratic FRY so as to have
stability in the region and in NATO's southern wing.<P>

<strong>Finally, I would like to ask whether you believe that there is a
possibility that now after the normalisation of relations and the elections
in B-H new conflicts in B-H will reoccur?</strong><P>

We believe that IFOR will not completely leave B-H and that
certain international forces will be present for some time to come.<P>

<strong>This partially means that B-H will become a protectorate of the
international community. To what extent is this fact acceptable to Croatia
and the Croatian people in B-H?</strong><P>

This cannot be called a protectorate, but for the complete
stability of B-H the presence of the international community will be
necessary for a certain amount of time.<P>

<h1>Cleaning Up Our Own House</h1>

<strong><em>by Maja Freundlich</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb, Croatia, 11/13 1995</h2>

It has been five years since we decided that we didn't want to be a part of Yugoslavia.  We decided to start with democratic elections and to choose in those elections that party which guaranteed freedom from slavery under Serb domination, and which promised the end of the seventy-years-old destiny of the deceived, imprisoned and used nation.  We decided to make any sacrifices necessary to finally achieve independence, not to be ruled by anyone, not to be endangered by anyone, not to be killed and persecuted by anyone.<P>

The war is waning, nearing its end, and it is necessary to remind ourselves why we wanted out of Serb or any other Yugoslavia.  There are two reasons for that.  First, because some in the world, exactly those who at the time founded Yugoslavia, would like to push us back into it again, and give it a different name.  Now, it would allegedly be called <A HREF="http://www.mix.it/logoi/eurosing.htm">Euroslavia</A>.  Even this name shows that the babbling about Europe is actually a setting of a tempting goal through which it would be possible to impose any serious political solution on Croats and other South Slav savages and slowly push them back where they used to be in the first place.  The war at the south of Europe doesn't seem tragic to the English and those like them because the Serbs are killing people or because the Serbs have destroyed everything, but because the Serbs are loosing this war.  Indeed, the last hopes for the resurrection of Yugoslavia disappear with the Serb defeat.  That current in the world politics sees the only way out in the blackmail with eastern Slavonia and the Bosnian solution.<P>

<h2>Systematic Immigration</h2>

We wanted out of Yugoslavia because every nation has a right to freedom, independence, its own life in its historic house.  Today, when we are winning this war, which has been started by Serbia, today, after four years of suffering, today, when we see the light at the end of the tunnel, we cannot even contemplate a return to somebody's common bedroom, nor can we ever sacrifice our fate in order to satisfy the imperialist illness of the Russians, Serbs or English.  Or anyone else.<P>

However, at the first elections we also sought to achieve freedom from all constraints, policemen and persecution which had constituted Serb rule and domination in Croatia.  Let us recall Yugoslavia from which we wanted to escape.  It wasn't only built on its outside borders.  On the contrary.  For years, especially in Croatia, it was based on a complicated system of Serb overseers and sentries, who controlled our lives.<P>

Croatia was imagined as a country whose natural resources were handed over to Serbia, whose people was only a never-ending source of industrious slaves, whose foreign currency earnings had to be handed over to Serbs or to Serbia.  Croats were systematically denied employment, advancement in service, success; instead they were offered jail or a passport for a journey to Germany.  Serbs immigrated to Croatia, systematically and according to a plan, in order to increase their numbers and to turn Croatia into their country, really "a Serb land, which has always been a Serb land."  The greatest percentage of Serbs, who today demand all kinds of rights for themselves in Croatia, were colonized here with the clear intent for enslavement, gradual ethnic cleansing, changing of the ethnic composition of the population and the establishment of the strong network for police rule over Croats and Croatia.<P>

Serbs were in the most important positions in every Croatian company, factory, cultural establishment, school, government.  Wherever the source of power was in the director's position, a Serb man or a woman would certainly occupy that position.  Whenever a director was only a figurehead, the real power was in the hands of a chief of personnel.  In that case, a Croat would be found for the position of the director and the personnel would collect new reliable Serbs through advertisements.  In those cases, the professionalism of that man wasn't important; it was important that he was "our man".<P>

<h2>Power from Shadows</h2>

Therefore, when the former Communists and Serbs accuse today Croatian authorities for ethnic and party based cleansing of the society, they don't talk about what the Croatian authorities actually do.  Croatian authorities, on the contrary and unfortunately, haven't yet done that anywhere.  They are talking about cleansing because they know that they used to carry it out themselves; they know that the changes in the composition of the people can cause true changes in the social system, and are shouting in order to prevent the establishment of the true Croatian rule in the society.  Fighting for their own survival, they started shouting against "revenge" as early as 1990.<P>

Former rulers still control the core of the Croatian society, only because they sit at comfortable, hidden, but the most powerful positions.  While the Croats are dying, while Croats think that, besides the war, it is necessary to produce wealth for all members of the society, while Croats argue over whether someone stole something or gained more than others, the former people still think about "their people", assiduously care for them, and develop "organizations for protection of human rights."  Of course they wouldn't have been able to do all that without help from abroad.  Croatian police action "Zenit" revealed only a millimeter high top of a huge iceberg, and proved that Serb spies are in many important positions, even as important as the expert services in the Parliament.  Imagine then where else they could be.  Besides, the operation "Zenit" discovered only "operatives", those who, as former policemen, were actually establishing a spy network.  What about all those "our people" who had been implanted here a long time ago?<P>

To what extent do these people want to destroy the possibility for the survival of the Croatian society?  To what extent are they destroying it from inside, in hope that it will soon fail, and that a new slave-owning Yugoslav rubbish heap will grow on its ashes?  Isn't is our duty today, five years after the first elections in which we wanted freedom from all that, after we have secured our borders, to turn around in our own house and think about all those things we need to do in the future?<P>

<h1>New Humiliation for Croatia</h1>

 

<h2> Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb, Croatia, 5/27/96, page 7.</h2>

"Croatia must wait a little longer before being welcomed
into the European Union. This decision, made by the
community of western states showed once again their rigidity
in its grotesquely incorrect behaviour towards a country
struck by aggression." With  these words started the
commentary published a few days ago in the respected
Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung by Johann Georg Reissmueller.
The author stated that "the West didn't do anything when the
war started in Croatia, they only observed ethnic cleansing,
and in a carefree manner left a third of Croatia's
territories in the hands of the aggressors". That same West
"closed access to international monetary institutions, and
up until today, the European Union is acting towards the
country in an unfriendly and degrading manner."<P>

Given the fact that Russia in spite  of everything, has been
accepted into the European Union, the commentator asks - "Is
this a political cabaret?" In regard to Croatia's sins, in
the first place there is the Zagreb crisis, for which they
say the "Croatian leadership is behaving in a politically
short-sighted way, however, in keeping within the state's
law and democracy." But because of this crisis  "delaying
Croatia's entrance into the European Union is
irresponsible."  The text also sets out Croatia's co-
operation with the Hague Tribunal where only Croatia has
voluntarily delivered General Blaskic, "which  is not the
case with the Russian generals who have committed war crimes
in Chechenya". Continuing about the freedom of the media,
the author concludes that "not one of the criticisms is
sufficient for the decision to defer the acceptance of
Croatia for a longer period".  The main reason Croatia's
rejection is said to be Bosnia Herzegovina, however
according to Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung "Croatia is not
primarily responsible for the situation in that country, nor
can she alter it."<P>

<TITLE>Official Croatian View of the Situation in Mostar</TITLE>

<h1>Stop for Instigators</h1>

<strong><em>by Miljenko Karacic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Hrvatski Obzor, Zagreb, Croatia, February 26 1996</h2>

Mostar isn't any more the most serious conflict point in the Federation
of Croats and Bosniaks.  It is true, the situation in that divided city
is still far from ideal, but at least no one can point their accusing finger
at Mostar Croats and accuse them of slowing down the implementation of
the Dayton Agreement.  As late as last Friday, it was impossible to 
predict that the solution which would satisfy both the Croats and
Bosniak Muslims was at hand.  In fact, after numerous diplomatic meetings, 
last Friday, in Sarajevo a Croatian delegation led by [Croatian foreign 
minister] Dr. Mate Granic and a Bosniakmuslim delegation led by [Bosnian
president] Alija Izetbegovic set down at the same table.  The mayor of eastern
Mostar, Safet Orucevic, and the EU administrator of the city, Hans Koschnick
were also supposed to be at that meeting.  However, the two of them, in spite
of a written invitation from the Federation president [a Croat, Kresimir Zubak],
did not show up in Sarajevo.  On the contrary, Koschnick had stated at his
weekly press-conference that he hadn't been invited to that meeting.  Alija
Izetbegovic was adamant after the negotiations in Sarajevo: "Koschnik's
decision is in itself a compromise and it won't be modified.  There can be no
compromise with a compromise."<P>

<h2>Granic was an Optimist</h2>

The leader of the Croatian diplomacy indicated that is may be possible to find 
certain modifications which would be a step in the right direction.  That
Granic's optimism was not unfounded.  Since, in spite a strong anti-Croatian
campaign from the EU Mostar administration headquarters, among the authors
of the Dayton Agreement there were those who thought that Koschnik's decision
should have been given a second look; that it was necessary to take into account
Croatian documents which warned about the direct violation of the Dayton
Agreement.<P>

Then, on Saturday morning, Koschnick, Brajkovic [mayor of western Mostar],
and Orucevic were invited to Rome.  As the trip to Rome is much more agreeable
than a trip between Mostar and Sarajevo, none of the three had a problem with
going to "the eternal city".  Actually they were not given a chance to avoid 
 this meeting, since they were picked up by a NATO aircraft in Mostar.
According to the statements of IFOR soldiers, the three Mostar mayors shook
hands before getting in the aircraft, but kept silent throughout the flight.
At the Sunday evening press-conference in Rome in was announced that the borders
of the central city administration district had been changed.  This district
has been significantly reduced and a good part of its territory returned 
to Croatian control.<P>

<h2>High School the Only Remaining Point of Disagreement</h2>

The only difference between the new agreement and the initial Croatian 
proposal is that, against the Croatian will, the old High School building  
is still within the central district and it is supposed to house the city 
government.<P>

This was confirmed by Koschnick himself; he emphasized that, lo and behold,
not everything turned out the way Croats wanted.  After his return to Mostar,
Koschnick said that he hadn't taken part in the Rome negotiations, but that
the official representatives of the Bosniakmuslim and Croatian peoples
had agreed about the new solution and that he could only respect that fact.
Therefore, Koschnick returned from Rome with a new understanding that his 
authority, in spite of loud support from Kinkel and a few other European
ministers, burned out among the Mostar ruins (no connection with the burning
of Koschnick's effigy during the Mostar carnival).  On the other hand, Orucevic
returned to the eastern part of Mostar with a signed resignation to the position
of the president of the "Presidency of Mostar county", as his personal expression
of the dissatisfaction with the new agreement.  Of course, Alija Izetbegovic
refused to accept Orucevic's resignation.  Miro Brajkovic, visibly tired
after Rome, kept his caution:" This is not a victory.  We shouldn't be
euphoric about this.  This is simply a reality which we had supported 
from the beginning."<P>

All together, this was a great triumph for Croatian policy, its use of good
arguments and consistency in the implementation of the agreements.
This became obvious in the days which followed.<P>

<h2>Freedom of Movement was Two Hours Late</h2>

Namely, February 20 was an important day for Mostar.  On that day, after 2p.m.
all the citizens of Mostar were free to move all over the city.  It wasn't easy 
to ensure that.  The freedom of movement was ensured two hours late, after numerous
conversations and phone consultations with Sarajevo and Zagreb.  After all that 
had happened in Mostar it wasn't an easy task.  Especially because in a large group
of those who were waiting to cross from the eastern to the western past of the city,
there was a certain number of trouble-makers, who oppose the peace process.
How else to interpret the hoisting of a green flag with a crescent moon on the
police shelter next to the department store "Hit"?  Some of them wanted to
bring their Bayram [Muslim religious celebration] good mood, stoked by a huge quantity of alcohol, to the
western part of the city.  Police denied to such individuals the right to cross
to the western Mostar and a few of them were arrested.<P>

Koschnick admitted that he had believed that the freedom of movement and the 
unification of police forces wouldn't happen.  Alija Izetbegovic also hurried
with his accusations of Croats, saying that they do not stick to agreed deadlines.<P>

<h2>Only a Few Cross to Eastern Mostar</h2>

"Those two hours are not important, not at all.  What is important is that
the process has started, that Croats have yet again demonstrated good will
and that they respect agreements," said Ivan Jarnjak [Croatian minister of 
Internal Affairs], at the moment when the first patrol of the joint police force
made up from two Croat, two Bosnianmuslim, and two European policemen, and a translator,
arrived to the central administrative district.  The following days followed
without incidents.  Crossings of the citizens from eastern to western part
of Mostar went without troubles.  Police hardly had anything to do.  The 
crossings from western to the eastern side were rare.  Actually, only those who
had crossed to the western side out of curiosity or in order to buy something
returned to the eastern side.  Mostar cab drivers and merchants have made the
most profit out of the new freedom of movement so far.  In the shops in the
central part of the city there is a great demand for bananas and <em>Lasko</em>
beer.  So far, taxi cab drivers are sticking to their respective sides.<P>

Joint police force will be active in the central district until March 1.  After
that it will be active in the whole city.  Koschinick has signed the new statute 
for the city, the election agreement and the map of the central administrative 
district agreed in Rome; according to the 1991 census, there were 3,700
inhabitants in the central district: 41 percent Serbs and others [Yugoslavs],
36 percent Bosniaks and 23 percent Croats.  One month after the signing of
the city statute the return of all refugees and displaced persons to their
apartments should be ensured.  Those displaced persons who now live
in Mostar apartments can stay in them until their problem is resolved on the
federal level.<P>

<h2>Gasic Takes Vacation</h2>

Anti-Croatian campaign from the hotel "Ero" [headquarters of the EU city 
administration] has stopped.  Some colleagues see a reason for that in
the fact that Koschnick's spokesperson, Dragan Gasic [a Serb, according to the Croatian "patriotic" press], is on a vacation.
Whatever the reason, the EU administration will stay in Mostar until the
end of the year.  Its mandate was extended for another six months in Rome.
Koschnick says that he faces a new struggle with the Foreign ministers
of the European Union who are supposed to finance the administration
for another six months.  Therefore, a lot has changed in Mostar after Rome.
Nevertheless, Mostar  is still in Rama-Neretva-Hum velezupa [canton].
As the Federal minister of foreign affairs, Dr. Jadranko Prlic, said, 
the solution for Mostar would be closely related to the establishment of
the borders between the velezupas [cantons] in the Bosnian Federation.
Croatian proposal that Ljubuski, Siroki Brijeg and Posusje [Croat majority
towns before the war] are put in the same velezupa with Mostar was not accepted.
Those counties were given an opportunity of forming a separate velezupa
or forming a united velezupa together with Tomislavgrad, Livno, Kupres, 
Glamoc, Drvar and Bosansko Grahovo.<P> 

After these Mostar events, the problems of establishment of Federal structures
in other regions remain.  Another crisis points are in Bugojno, where the return
of Croats has been blocked, and in Vares where Croats are exposed to increasingly
brutal pressures.<P>

<h1>CORRIDOR TO NATO</h1>

<em><strong>by Milan V.</em></strong><P>

<h2>Obzor, Zagreb,Croatia, 10/14/96</h2> 

Currently, as things stand with Slovenia, an attempt will be made to agree
upon a concession which proposes that Slovenia receive a corridor to the
Adriatic and not legal authority over the sea-belt.<P>

As November and the proclaimed parliamentary elections on the "sunny side of
the Alps" draws closer so too do political temperatures continue to rise.
Even though there are 20 days left to go, there is an ever-increasing
reference to foreign policy within Slovene rhetoric.<P>

As in all official pre-election political appearances, the opposition
parties are taking advantage of foreign policy issues. Well that's how
Slovene analysts have interpreted statements by the Slovene Foreign
Minister, Dr Davorian Kracun, who coincidentally has had the shortest term
in the 5-year-history of the Slovene Republic. Dr Kracun replaced Zoran
Thaler at the end of July this year and only a few days into his term he
granted Vjesnik and Slobodna Dalmacija an interview where he reiterated
Slovenia's foreign policy priorities as a member of Nato and stressed on
resolving all outstanding questions regarding Croatia. Recently, however,
his position has become "harder".<P>

At a recent press conference in Ljubljana, Dr Kracun spoke of the results of
his discussions in New York and Washington. HINA reported:
"..members of NATO thank the acceptance of Slovenia's membership to NATO
which will strengthen the organisation and widen the security net of Europe.
The southern wing of NATO would especially be strengthened by the
tri-lateral army co-operation between Italy, Slovenia and Hungary..."<P>

Journalists then asked if the unresolved issues between Croatia and Slovenia
would hamper things.  Dr Kracun  replied that his discussions with American
officials in Washington indicated that the United States didn't see it as a
security risk which would prevent it from entering NATO.<P>

In relation to the resolution of bilateral relations with Zagreb, Dr Kracun
stated that his discussions with Foreign Minister, Dr Mate Granic in New
York showed signs that an agreement between the two countries on the issues
of property rights and the signing of a sea-belt agreement could shortly be
realised.<P>


<h2>INSTEAD OF PROGRESS - THE DEPARTURE OF THALER</h2>

In response to questions put forward by Slovenian journalists relating to
the border problems in the Piran Bay, the Chief of Slovenian Diplomacy
stated that sea borders must be determined and that an agreement be reached
after Croatia accepts the findings of a memorandum which was handed down in
Slovenian Parliament in 1993. Davoran Kracun explained how this relates to
the fact that Slovenia controls the Suran Bay and has direct access to the
Adriatic. He added that they should determine who controlled this area on
the 25 June 1991 and fix the boundaries.<P>

This is the position of the Slovenian Foreign Minister which once again
highlights the unresolved Slovene - Croat relations. This comes following
the July Ljubljana meeting between Croatian Foreign Minister, Dr Mate Granic
and the now-sacked Slovenian Foreign Minister, Zoran Thaler, which was, at
the time, heralded as a significant advance in resolving outstanding issues
between the two countries (Ljubljana Bank, Property Right questions, Krsko
Nuclear Power Plant, determination of borders). Now, however, the Slovenian
side is once again insisting that the determination of the sea-borders in
the Piran Bay be settled prior to the resolution of all other outstanding
questions.<P>


<h2>WHAT DO THE SLOVENES WANT?</h2>

Slovenes proposal for the settling of borders in the Piran Bay is a little
over a year old. The basic position of our western neighbour is complete
Slovene authority over the Piran bay which would in effect mean that,
according to the previous line of separation by police on its side, Croatia
would receive 278m of sea-belt. Slovenia would, by achieving such complete
authority over the Piran Bay, be able to draw a geographic line to its west
following the path of Croatian territorial sea borders that exist today.
That line would extend to the point where the open sea commence, that is,
the international water in the Adriatic. 
In this way, Slovenia would receive that which it has been longing for -
confirmation. Confirmation, even by its narrow sea corridor, of its national
and territorial sovereignty at sea.
That is the main reason behind the Slovenes urgency in resolving the Piran
Bay question. Although neighbouring states should conclude or commence to
conclude their lengthy boundary dispute by compromise, the Slovenian
proposal is anything but a compromise for Croatians. How to finally resolve
the issue between the neighbouring countries, when it is easier to resolve
co-operation between far away China than with their neighbour whose capitol
city is less than a two-hour drive away. Will both sides continue to pursue
their tactic of a resolute and uncompromising front on each occasion? It is
difficult to expect that the Croatian side will be able to accept the
Slovene proposal when  it would in effect mean the severing of the only
boundary between Croatia and Italy. The loss of this link, by granting the
Slovenes this corridor, is also in direct opposition to the Osimo agreement.<P>


<h2>CONCESSION OVER THE CORRIDOR?</h2>

At best, Croatia will offer Slovenia permission to use but not own the
corridor. As things stand now, an attempt will be made to negotiate a
concession over the corridor with the Slovenes. Slovenia, due to its push to
attain ownership over its access to the open sea, has offered a softer draft
agreement on the unresolved border dispute. This is a precedent which
Ljubljana calls a compromised solution. Slovenia has offered that a Croatian
sea-enclave be created north of the sea corridor.<P>

The Croatian territorial sea would, if the suggestion was to go ahead, be
divided into two and the only way to access this Croatian "sea enclave"
would be through the creation of a Croatian corridor running across the
Slovene corridor.<P>

Perhaps this extremely complex version of a compromise best reflects the
heart of the Croat-Slovene dispute, the different state and political
interests at play in the Piran Bay.
The Slovene side, as it has already been proven, is insisting upon such a
drawing of borders so that it can attain direct access to the open sea via
its own sea corridor. However, according to all geopolitical analysts,
Slovenian access to the Adriatic does not at all depend upon the different
variations of the division of the Piran Bay.<P>

Even if Slovenia received the entire Piran Bay, it still would not, on the
basis of international law, have the suitable natural-geographic
prerequisite for having its own corridor to the open sea. Slovenia would
only obtain access to its own seas and  not to the open seas, which has been
guaranteed to Ljubljana through the "Law on Unobtainable Access". On the
basis of this law, Slovenia has access to the open seas across Croatia's
territorial seas on the condition that it does not endanger the good order
and security of Croatia.<P>


<h2>SLOVENIA'S RIGHT UNDER INTERNATIONAL LAW</h2>

The right of passage of war ships is legally guaranteed. According to this
law, Slovene submarines, for example, could travel towards the open
Adriatic, however only on the surface and with clearly identifiable symbols
all the while they are in the Croatian territorial sea.<P>

Slovene fishing vessels when travelling towards the open seas across
Croatian waters must use the shortest route, without stopping or dropping
anchor and naturally, without fishing.
Recently, British and Croatian geopolitical scientists, in an analysis
published by the Research Centre of the University of Durhan, concluded
"...it is very questionable that Slovenia has a strong enough foundation for
a movement from the central line especially when it is trying to link that
question to its access to international waters from Slovene ports".<P>

It then concludes that "...it would basically leave untouched if a boundary
of the territorial sea with Croatia is drawn according to the principle of
acceptance".<P>

Together with Mladen Klemencic, Obzor commentator, Dusko Topalovec
participated in the analysis and identified Slovenia's reason for waiting in
Kracun's latest statements. For example, in an interview given to Delo,
Minister Kracun offered Slovene help in improving transport links with the
rest of Europe in exchange for Croatia's acceptance of Slovenia's proposal.<P>

Topalovic's second extremely interesting conclusion relating to Slovenia
entering NATO is, "they shall then have more arguments in seeking direct
access into international waters because of the need for direct contact with
the NATO fleet".<P>
 
Be as it may, it will only be possible to talk to our western Neighbours
about the solution of these unresolved questions after the parliamentary
elections.  Until then, the Piran Bay will continue to be one of the main
pre election theme.<P>

<h1>AGREEMENT ON THE MOST IMPORTANT ASPECTS</h1>

<em><strong>by Branko Tuden</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vecernji List, Zagreb, Croatia, 5/27/96 , page 2</h2>

The government and opposition have not for a long time had
talks in such a tolerant and constructive atmosphere as
during the course of the weekend at the meeting of the
Presidential Council, dedicated to the international
position of Croatia.<P>

The meeting was well prepared, about one hundred
participants and speakers, all well known experts in the
field of contemporary politics, geopolitics and diplomacy,
touched on many themes of critical importance for the future
of Croatia. The quality of the debate was lifted by the
participation of many Croatian diplomats from abroad, who
were also present. It seems that this type of meeting had
not previously been held in the independent Croatian state,
at least not publicly.<P>

The principle reason of the discussion on the international
position of the Republic of Croatia was the postponement of
the acceptance of Croatia into the Council of Europe.
Although an absolute consensus was not reached as to the
reason, the government maintained that it was due to outside
pressure, whilst the opposition said that it was due to
this, but also some domestic mistakes. That which is  most
important, is the following : when the key interests of
Croatia are in question all the important political forces
in the country are in agreement.<P>

That primarily relates to attempts to force Croatia into
associations that would return her to the Balkans, or push
her into federations similar to the one she left with great
sacrifices.<P>

The meeting showed that President Tudman and the Croatian
Democratic Union (HDZ) are not exclusive and arrogant, as is
sometimes ascribed to them, and that the opposition is not a
"natural disaster". Also, that when capriciousness is left
out, talks can be held and agreement reached on all of the
most important questions.<P>

A very positive reaction was given to the stand of Dr
Milorad Pupovac in the name of the Serbian community in
Croatia. It even caused President Tudman in his concluding
comments to refer to the stand taken by Dr Pupovac, and to
emphasise it, as a very positive act.<P>

<h1>AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR CROATIA</h1>

<strong><em>By Vladimir Goss</em></strong><P>
 
<h2>Vecernji list, Zagreb, Croatia, May 17, 1996</h2>

   Yesterday's meeting between U.S. Secretary of State
Warren Christopher and Croatia's Foreign Minister and
Deputy Prime Minister Mate Granic covered every major
topic of interest for both nations. Mr. Christopher
praised Crotia's role from the Washington to the Dayton
Agreements, and thereafter. Problems in the Federation
and Bosnia-Herzegovina in general were analyzed.<P>
    In terms of the Federation, all principal questions
have been settled. The U.S. wants    elections as soon as
possible, as well as a division of municipalities within
the Federation so as to restore the necessary system for
elections. New conferences regarding the Federation  will
soon be held in Firenza as well as in Switzerland in the
context of OESS.<P>
   Regarding Eastern-Slavonia, Mr. Christopher is
confident that the process of reintegration is making
progress, and that it will end in a peaceful manner.
However, the question still being asked in Washington is:
will this be another Sarajevo in terms of the exodus of
the Serb community. Croatia believes that the majority of
local Serbs will remain if it asks for American support
for the normalization of relations with Belgrade. The
next step has to be recognition. Croatia is looking for
American support in the acceleration of that process, but
in reality, reintegration means more to Croatia than
recognition.<P>
   Mr. Christopher agrees that Croatia is a part of the
western world. The U.S. demands a high level of respect
for human rights, but is also concerned with issues
regarding freedom of the press and the Zagreb elections.
The U.S. is giving Croatia
its support for admission to global financial
institutions, but also accepts the individual differences
of the nations of the former Yugoslavia on their road to
democracy and the free market. Mr. Christopher commended
the extradition of war criminals and expects total
application.<P>
   There is no change in strategic issues,  and the
strategic partnership will continue.
Minister Granic will meet with Defense Minister Perry
today at 17:00 (C.E.T.) and  they will discuss security
issues and integration. It is clearly understood in
Washington that admission into the Partnership for Peace
program is based on political resolutions as it will be
in the case of Croatia, but Croatia  has to allow the
U.S., as stressed  several times these last few days in
Washington, to further extend assistance and support.<P>

<h1>THE DEMILITARISATION OF EASTERN SLAVONIJA, BARANJA AND
WESTERN SRJEM HAS COMMENCED</h1>

<strong><em>by B.Vrbosic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vecernji List, Zagreb, Croatia, 5/22/96</h2>
                                       

Even though the commencement of demilitarisation in the
occupied part of Eastern Croatia has been impatiently
awaited, the announcement yesterday in Beli Manstir by the
chief of the transitional administration UNTAES General
Jacques Paul Klein that a thirty day process commenced
yesterday (21 May) exactly at midday, had almost came as a
surprise.<P>

"Yesterday I informed the Secretary General of the UN that
we are ready for the next phase, which is demilitarisation
within the framework of the UNTAES mandate. The Secretary
General shall inform the Security Council that from 12 noon
on 21 May, Central Europe Time that part of the process has
commenced. We have printed a special issue of the
Transitional Administrations bulletin in which General
Joseph Shoups, the Commander of the UNTAES forces, explains
the conditions of demilitarisation" said General Klein.<P>

General Shoups stated the conditions : according to the
already known procedure of taking and destroying weapons,
taking control of military facilities and the demobilisation
of all military and police formations. He has warned the
local civilian population that demilitarisation means that
no one shall be able to carry or transport weapons without
the permission of UNTAES, while even light arms which
civilians are allowed to keep at home shall need to be
reported to their local police station. Local police and
UNTAES forces shall enforce the prohibition and those found
breaching it shall be arrested and bought before the local
court. The Head of the Croatian government's Office for the
Implementation of Croatian Authority in Eastern Croatia, Mr
Ivica Vrkic applauded this decision. At the same time he
advised that the Croatian side has opened telephone lines to
Beli Manastir. He also advised of the case of Drazen Mandic,
a young man from the occupied part of Baranja, who 30 days
ago whilst hunting got lost and found himself near Osijek.
He was arrested and processed through the court.<P>

"Following the court procedure we are returning him to his
parents, Drazen Mandic shall be the first person who shall
be treated in accordance with the new amnesty law. We are
doing this because we believe that the war is over and we
want to create favourable conditions for peaceful co-
existence", said Mr Vrkic. In response to a question from
Serbian journalists about other Serbs in police custody, he
stated that the amnesty law shall be fully implemented very
quickly and appropriately.<P>

<h1>CAN THE CROATIANS BELIEVE?</h1>

<strong><em>By Jozo Pavkovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vecernji list, Zagreb, Croatia, May 20, 1996</h2>

   Towards the end of this last week, a number of
incidents occurred which confused the Croatians in Bosnia-
Herzegovina. Namely, since their resolutions, it seems as
if the Europeans have (un)intentionally taken the side of
the Muslims. At a press conference EU Administrator for
Bosnia  R. P. Casado categorically asserted how the
elections in Mostar need to be held within the
established Dayton accords, but only a day later his
legal adviser Birchler made a statement which further
complicated matters in Mostar. Mr. Birchler claims that
the elections will definitely be adjourned because the
Muslim polling committees haven't come to any meetings
since Friday. Mr. Casado denied this and emphasized that
he did not come to any decision, and that the statement
his adviser made was of his own personal opinion.<P>

What the real reasons were for those actions will soon be
known, but there is an impression being made that
European pre-election games have begun in Mostar and
Bosnia-Herzegovina. It's not a secret that a division
exists between high-ranking EU officials which has
resulted in the inclination to one of the sides. The
question is how the new administrator, who has thus far
shown himself to be objective and principled, will
complete the complicated Mostar project. Mr. Birchler's
statement alleges to the uncertainty of Mr. Casado's full
control over his people.<P>

   The elections in Mostar are perhaps the biggest test
to the implementation of  civilian parts of the Dayton
Agreement. Their not sticking to it would jeopardize the
otherwise fragile peace in Bosnia-Herzegovina, and the
resolutions from Dayton  wouldn't be liable to anyone.
The Croats in Mostar ask themselves if Mr. Birchler knows
this since he would so calmly and independently, or to
someone else's command, defer the elections. And what a
coincidence that it concurs with the Muslim stand,
similar to the decisions of  R.B. Owen, who just last
week denied the reprentatives clubs in Vares the right to
decision-making and obliterated the mandate of  three
Croatian representatives, which then enabled foreigners,
or better said Muslims, the nomination as bearer of
executive power.<P>

   On the basis of  the electoral results in Bugojno, Mr.
Owen influenced the Croatian side  to nominate the head
of the community. He abolished the mandate of a Croatian
representative and in his place appointed a Muslim?!
With that, Croatians lost the majority of one
representative which they acquired at the elections.<P>

   To the arbitrary Europeans, we extend another Kinkel
attack on Croatians in Mostar (again he is bothered by
the Croatian flag), which alleges to the conclusion that
a pre-election European campaign began in which Croatians
could lose their three key cities. After Mr. Birchler's
and Mr. Owen's resolutions,  and the additional Kinkel
threat, can the Croatians believe the Europeans?<P>

<h1>IT'S STILL MAY 31st AT THE POLLS</h1>

<strong><em>By  J. Pavkovic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vecernji list, Zagreb, Croatia, May 15, 1996</h2>

The elections in Mostar will be held as expected, on May
31st, stated EU Administrator for Mostar, Ricard Peres
Casado, in Brussels. The fifteen EU Foreign Ministers
showed their resoluteness by not giving in to Muslim
pressure and their threats of boycotting the elections if
their demand that all citizens of Mostar be able to vote
is not complied with.<P>

It is probable that the decision in Brussels was made
because it was known that the Muslims registered to vote.
Apart from HDZ (Croatian Democratic Union), HSP (Croatian
Party of Rights) and the Croatian Pure Party of Rights,
the Women's Party from Bosnia-Herzegovina also
registered. If  one is to carefully look at the list of
candidates from that party, one will, in fact, find
members and leaders of SDA (Party of Democratic Action)
on it.<P>

Consequently, the Muslims did not formally distinguish
their parties, so that they may put pressure on Europe.
Since members of the EU didn't put up with this, the
Muslims became the "second variant". They are now going
to ask their people to vote for the "women", and will
thereby simultaneously homogenize their electoral body,
which at any rate, is very significant. With that,
leaders of the SDA avoid the possibility of dividing
constituents, which was a serious threat in Mostar after
the formation of Silajdzic's party and his growing
popularity. Regarding the Muslims in the city of the
Neretva River, there will be an enumeration of
inhabitants instead of elections, while the three
Croatian parties need to redeem democracy.<P>

Therefore, an electoral race begins today for the
Croatian parties, while the Muslims may continue to
calculate and pressure. It is a forsaken possibility for
them in Brussels, in which the new EU Administrator for
Mostar, Ricard Peres Casado, has the right to delay the
elections for two weeks due to technical reasons. If  Mr.
Casado makes that decision, it will certainly start a
chain reaction in which the situation in Mostar may be
complicated to a maximum degree, while terms for the
September elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina may be
seriously jeopardized as well.<P>

<h1>Through Neum Without a Customs Inspection</h1>

<strong><em>D. Knezevic</strong></em><P>

<h2>Vecernji List, Zagreb, Croatia, May 14, 1996</h2>

Croatian citizens as well as foreign tourists who will be
coming to the Croatian Adriatic coast will have the right
to freely pass through the Neum municipality. The Ploce
harbor will be open for the needs of the Bosnia-
Herzegovina Federation. Those are, in a practical sense,
two legal documents which were signed by the Premiers of
Croatia and Bosnia-Herzegovina in Zagreb on Saturday.
They deal with the implementation of the agreement  made
between Croatia and the Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation in
which Croatian passage through Federation territory is
ensured, as is Federation access to the Adriatic. It is
clear that the signing of those documents had certain
political weight because they demonstrate adherence to
the Washington and Dayton Agreements, as well as
favorable economic implications for both countries.<P>

<h2>THE RESTORATION OF ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE</h2>

Guaranteeing unrestricted transit through Neum, as well
as the opening of the Ploce harbor for the needs of the
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation, will at the same time give
both countries admission to the World Bank so that they
may receive credit for the restoration of road
infrastructure.<P>
Among others, the agreement maintains that the Bosnia-
Herzegovina Federation is to allow trucks and remaining
road vehicles unrestricted entry for the transit of goods
and passengers from Croatia through Neum. Customs
inspections do not apply to vehicles with Croatian
license plates. Those vehicles will not be checked, nor
will official Federation authorities approach them,
unless the driver commits some type of traffic or customs
violation. Meanwhile, Deputy Premier Ljerka Mintas Hodak
estimates that the agreement realizes more than the
agreements in the US resolved because the Croatian side
chose freedom of transit for tourists who are coming to
the Croatian Adriatic coast and wish to pass through
Neum.<P>
In the second agreement, Croatia guarantees Bosnia-
Herzegovina  the unhindered and safe flow of goods
through the customs zone in the Ploce harbor. Goods that
are passing through that harbor on the way from the
Bosnia-Herzegovina Federation
or on the way in, do not pay customs or other dues and do
not file a customs report.<P>

<h2>MEASURES AGAINST BLACK-MARKETEERING</h2>
With that agreement, Croatia is obligated to maintain
land traffic (road and railway) from the harbor to the
border with Bosnia-Herzegovina, and not discriminate
against ships which are sailing for the needs of the
Federation, regardless of their national afiliation.
Since with the legal establishment of freedom of transit
for Neum and Ploce comes the risk of an increase in black-
marketeering, there is a clause built into the agreement
about Ploce in which road transit in and from the the
Federation will proceed with the supervision or
accompaniment of Croatian police. It will be like that
until a separate road from the unrestricted customs zone
to the Bosnia-Herzegovina border is buildt. Similarly, it
is expected that black-marketeering in Neum will be
rendered impossible only when a road is constructed in
which full transit control would be made possible.<P>

The agreements signed last Saturday in Zagreb went into
effect immediately but are considered temporary. Passage
through the Federation should be continuously regulated
by other documents which would control railway as well as
road transit. Likewise, new documents for  permanent
means in the future should be  arranged for Federation
access to the Adriatic. The present agreement does not
apply to goods and destinations in the rest of Bosnia-
Herzegovina.<P>

<h1>WHY ARE THEY SAVING MLADIC?</h1>

<strong><em>by Zeljko Toth</em></strong><P>

<h2>Vecernji list, Zagreb, Croatia, May 13, 1996</h2>

In the search for an answer as to why only "mere trifles"
from the Serb genocidal order are arriving in Den Haag, The
Sunday Times conducted its own investigation and came to a
shocking revelation: the UN, Western governments, and even
members of the British elite SAS had a shameful role in the
genocide. In the first part of the report about its
investigation (the second part will be announced next
Sunday), The Sunday Times responded to why organizers of
crime, both those from Serbia and those from Bosnia, aren't
in Den Haag: because Western governments and the UN knew
what was going on, didn't do anything to prevent it, and do
not want their spinelessness disclosed  at the International
War Crimes Tribunal.<P>
The British weekly re-enacted events which occurred in
Srebrenica before and after its fall into Serb hands.
At the beginning of July, Srebrenica defenders warned Dutch
UN soldiers daily of the arrival of Serb reinforcement from
the South and the South-east, but the Dutch soldiers acted
as if they did not hear anything. The Dutch came to the
conclusion  that the only Serb objective was to ensure the
southern entry to the "protected zone". Their alarm didn't
even go off when Serb tanks took over their observation
posts in the south. When in the early morning of July 6, the
Serbs fired six shells upon the UN staff in Potocari, the
Dutch soldiers took refuge in a shelter and spent all five
days of the Serb offensive there.<P>
The Dutch claim that they requested for NATO air attacks
from Sarajevo authorities everyday. The usual excuse was
that there were "technical difficulties".  Nevertheless, on
July 11, the Dutch informed Muslim authorities in Srebrenica
that the UN advised the Serbs to be prepared for air attacks
from forty NATO aircraft, including anti-tank fighter
planes. It was recommended that everyone take shelter.
However, nothing happened. The mayor of Srebrenica
wrathfully protested, but a Dutch officer explained: "Two
minutes ago, we received new instructions. We were given a
command to request for air attacks only if our soldiers were
to see a Serb soldier in the city with their very own eyes."
However, the Serbs were already in Srebrenica. At that
moment, the SAS group, which the people of Srebrenica didn't
even know were amongst them, took over their role in the
tragedy. The members of SAS came before the  Bosnian Army
headquarters, situated in a post office, and met with high-
ranking officers of the Bosnian Army. British specialists
asked for an interpreter and guide to show them the position
of the Serbs. When they got closer to the Serb tanks, the
Bosnian guide, Ekrem, showed the British, from a distance of
150 meters, the position of the Serb tanks. Surrounding them
were thirty Serb soldiers. Yet, the British replied by
asking, "Where are they? We can't see anything." Ekrem
showed them once again, yet the members of the SAS again
asserted to not seeing anything. An intense debate emerged
which finished upon their return to the city headquarters.
The British left the interpreter and guide and went to the
main UN headquarters. One can only assume what  happened in
the meantime between the Srebrenica-Sarajevo-New York-
Brussels connection, because a whole six hours later
NATO air intervention  followed. However, it was too late.
The Serbs had already captured Srebrenica and executed those
taken as prisoners. That is how the largest single war crime
began in Europe.<P>

	In 1909, a party of prospectors in northern Ontario, Canada, literally stumbled
	on to what would turn into one of the biggest gold finds of the century. One of the
	men slipped and fell, dislodged a piece of moss and found underneath a dome-shaped
	rock structure studded with gold. Hence the name Dome Mines Limited, one of the
	companies which would eventually become Placer Dome Inc. The term "placer" refers
	to water-borne deposits of sand or gravel containing valuable mineral nuggets of
	silver and gold.
	<p>
	
	Until the Second World War, prospectors trenched and scraped their way to most of
	the world's mineral finds. Today, advanced satellite imaging, super sensitive
	electromagnetic testing and the rapid transmission of digital information have
	improved the odds of locating elusive resources.

	Throughout history, culture has accorded gold a special place. A
	product like no other, it is both commodity and financial asset. Gold is
	attractive to people for many reasons. A form of money, its owners
	can hold it, trade it, make loans on it or convert it to other financial
	instruments with relative ease. Its role as jewelry is inextricably rooted in

	<img src="../gfx/gold$$.jpg" alt="Wall Street jpeg" align=right vspace=10>

	cultures around the world. And increasingly, its commodity value is tied to its
	lustrous performance as a material in a wide range of applications.

	<h2>
	1,858,000 Ounces of Gold

	A gram of gold is the size of a shirt button. But it can provide a day's
	income of $12 to feed the family of an independent hand miner in
	Venezuela. It's all a matter of scale, but our purpose is the same. At
	31 grams per troy ounce, Placer Dome produced 2,176,000 ounces of gold 
	in 1995 of which the Corporation's share was 1,858,000 ounces. Our gold
	mines generated operating earnings of $234 million on gold revenues of
	$843 million. We aim to provide growth for our investors, and improved 
	standards of living for those who inhabit regions of the world where our
	mining investments take place.

	<p>	
	
	In order to understand the Placer Dome story, basic knowledge of the principles
	behind the recovery of mineral resources is necessary. The following "mining primer" will be
	supplemented periodically with articles addressing technology issues of concern to
	the mining industry.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/mine2.jpg" align=right alt="V'al D'Or, Quebec mining operations jpeg" hspace=10 vspace=10>


	Mining is the process of removing ore from its original site beneath
	the earth's surface ("ore" being material that can be mined at a
	profit). However, since there are no "standard" orebodies, there are
	no "standard" mine workings.
	<p>
	
	The nature of the deposit will indicate whether open pit
	or underground extraction will be used. Where an orebody is covered
	by a relatively shallow layer of overburden, open pit mining may be practical
	in the initial stages. This type of mining uses highly mechanized methods
	of earth moving. Its economics are based on moving large tonnages possible
	only in surface operations with giant trucks and shovels. Ore trucks of 
	90- to 180-tonne capacities can be loaded in a few minutes by shovels lifting
	11.5 cubic metres or more at a time. This kind of equipment has significantly
	changed the economic feasibility of previously uneconomic mineral 
	occurrences.
	<p>
	
	Where a thick layer of overburden renders open pit mining impractical, the
	more traditional underground method must be used. Even here, the rapid 
	implementation of modern technology has changed the economics, making
	concentrations of lower grade ore practical to mine. However, the costs of
	sinking shafts or driving adits (a nearly horizontal entrance from the surface)
	to access ore remain high and require that underground mines work 
	with generally higher grade ore than that of open pit mines.
	<p>
	
	Milling is the primary step in the treatment of ore and is usually done at
	the mine. In certain cases, as with some gold ores, this treatment results
	in the extraction of gold dor&#233; bars (which must still be refined) on site. Most base
	metals, however, are found in a complex chemical form which cannot be economically
	converted into metal at the mine. In such cases milling simply extracts or
	concentrates the mineral so that it can be economically shipped to smelting
	and refining facilities.
	<p>
	
	All milling processes begin with the crushing and grinding of ore to a size 
	suitable for subsequent operations. These processes produce a particle 
	that is just small enough to ensure liberation or unlocking of the mineral
	from associated host rock.
	<p>
	
	Crushing, the first stage of this process, reduces the coarse material from the 
	mine to pebble-size in preparation for grinding, the term used to describe 
	the final steps of particle size reduction.
	<p>
	
	Grinding occurs in large, rotating cylinders in which tumbling steel shapes,
	and often ore chunks, crush the pebbles to a fineness which assures mineral
	liberation.
	<p>
	
	Separation processes are designed to remove the fine mineral
	particles from their host rock. Different processes have been
	designed for different minerals, but all are efficient at separating
	small amounts of minerals from masses of waste. For instance,
	typical gold ore in today's mines would average one twentieth of a
	troy ounce (14.583 troy ounces per pound) of the precious metal in
	2,000 pounds of ore. This is a very small ratio indeed, being
	approximately equal to two parts of gold per million parts of rock.
	Yet the modern recovery process is so efficient that many mines can
	drill, blast, load, haul, grind, and treat 20 tonnes of ore to
	recover one ounce of gold, sell it at a market price of, say, US$365
	per ounce, and still record a profit.
	<p>


	Flotation is the most common method of separating base metal minerals, many of which
	were deposited in sulphide compounds. The finely ground ore is mixed with water to
	form a slurry. Certain chemicals or reagents that coat only the desired mineral
	components are added in small amounts. Rising air bubbles capture the coated mineral
	particles and float them to the surface where they are skimmed off to a separate
	circuit. The waste rock, now called tailing, remains in the slurry. This process 
	is capable of increasing the concentration of minerals many times and of separating
	several different minerals from a complex orebody.
	<p>
	
	The shipment of concentrates to smelting and refining plants is the final step in
	the series of events that began with a prospector's interest in a rock sample
	or the flicker of a needle on an electronic instrument.
	<p>
	
	But the story does not end here. Eventually every mine exhausts its ore. The wind-up
	phase then begins: its objective is to prepare the site so that it will remain
	in a safe and stable condition, not very different from the surrounding area.

	Why does Placer Dome mine gold?</strong></a>
	<p>
	
	Gold is a metal which is traded on world markets, with individual buyers and
	sellers generally unable to exert significant influence over pricing or quantities
	sold.  Gold is used primarily in the fabrication of jewelry.  Other uses include
	electronics and coin fabrication, dentistry and decorative applications.  There is
	also significant demand for gold as an investment.

	<strong>
	What else does Placer Dome mine?</strong></a>
	<p>
	

	<strong>
	Silver
	</strong>
	<br>

	Silver is a metal which is traded on world markets, with individual buyers and
	sellers generally unable to exert significant influence over pricing or quantities
	sold. Silver is used in photography, jewelry, electrical equipment, mirrors,
	tableware, brazing alloys, coins and commemorative medals.  Most silver production
	is undertaken in tandem with, or as a byproduct of, lead/zinc, copper and gold
	mining operations. Placer Dome markets its silver to international buyers
	on a spot market basis and through forward sales contracts and other hedging
	instruments.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Copper
	</strong>
	<br>

	Copper is used in telecommunications, automobiles, construction and
	consumer durables.  Activity in these areas influences the price of
	copper.  Copper concentrates produced by the Osborne Mine are
	marketed to smelters in Japan and the Philippines. Electrowon copper
	cathode, produced at the Zald&#237;var Mine, is marketed to Japan and
	Europe.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Molybdenum
	</strong>
	<br>

	Molybdenum is used as an alloy to strengthen high quality steels.  Steel mills add
	molybdenum to steel in the form of molybdic oxide.  Placer Dome sells molybdenum,
	mostly in oxide form, to over 200 customers in Canada, the United States, Japan,
	Korea and Europe.

	<strong>
	How do you know where to look for gold?</strong></a>
	<p>


	Exploration is the heart of gold mining.  Placer Dome's exploration strategy
	combines the acquisition of promising "middle to advanced stage" properties with
	generative and grassroots exploration. This ensures a steady supply of projects
	with potential to maintain long-term growth in gold production.
	<p>

	Placer Dome Exploration Inc. -- based in San Jose, California -- leads Placer
	Dome's exploration program by evaluating opportunities and directing activities
	internationally. It runs four district offices in South America, one district
	office in Euro-Asia and one field office in Africa.  Placer Dome Exploration also
	works with regional subsidiaries.
	<p>

	Placer Dome Canada conducts exploration out of Vancouver and Toronto with four
	district offices.  Placer Dome U.S. conducts exploration throughout the United
	States, from San Francisco, California, with two district offices. It also manages
	one advanced project in northern Mexico.  Activities in Australia, Southeast Asia,
	China and the Southwest Pacific area are administered by Placer Pacific from
	Sydney and Perth, Australia, with six district offices.  Operating mines explore
	on their respective mine properties or venture areas, often jointly with
	exploration groups.

	<strong>
	What is Placer Dome doing about protecting the environment?</strong></a>
	<p>

	The mining industry is subject to stringent environmental regulations.  All of
	Placer Dome's activities, from exploration through reclamation, are subject to
	legislation.  Government regulation of the industry requires extensive monitoring
	activities and contingency planning for accidental discharges into the
	environment.
	<p>

	Placer Dome's environmental policy is reviewed annually and revised as required to
	provide the basis for maintaining the Corporation's position as an environmental
	leader.  The latest revision was approved by the Board of Directors on February
	18, 1994.  In support of this policy Placer Dome has established a comprehensive
	environmental management system, standards and guidelines which apply to all
	regions and activities including operations, development and exploration. 
	Improvements are made to all systems on a regular basis in keeping with the major
	principles underlying the environmental policy.

	<strong>
	What kinds of jobs does Placer Dome have?</strong></a>
	<p>


	As of December 31, 1995, Placer Dome employed approximately 8,000 people worldwide. 
	Placer Dome also retained a number of temporary employees or contractors to
	provide a variety of services in seasonal work or on specific projects. 
	Employment levels have increased by 14% since 1994.
	<p>
	
	During 1995, Placer Dome continued to improve its worldwide capabilities through
	its efforts in international policy development and its focus on career and
	succession planning systems. Communications training was conducted throughout the
	organization in 1995 with team effectiveness as the philosophical cornerstone of
	the program. Continuous improvement in employee development and employee relations
	are a key element of Placer Dome's corporate strategy.  Placer Dome is committed
	to creating strength and depth in the organization through investing in the talent
	of our people.

	<h2>
	Primordial Prospectors
	</h2>
	
	<a href="02a.html">
	Back to "Modern Day Explorers"</a>
	<p>
	
	The "Iron Age." The "Bronze Age." Entire periods of human history have been named
	after man's pursuit of metals, indicating the key role mining has played throughout
	the millennia.
	<p>
			

	<img src="../gfx/11archb.jpg" align=right alt="ancient grinding stone" vspace=10 hspace=10>

	From his earliest attempts to compete in a world where he was usually at a
	disadvantage, man has used metals. Quarrying, mining and prospecting are among the
	oldest of human activities. At the dawn of history, man's metal requirements were
	relatively basic -- only a few, such as native copper, gold and silver, were known
	and only a small quantity of those were used.
	<p>
	
	<strong>
	Scratching the surface
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	The sources of such metals were high-grade mineral outcrops at the surface and
	early man scratched at many of these deposits, extracting the mineral in
	primitive fashion. As one source became too difficult to work, he was forced to
	search for others and was often disappointed.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/11archc.jpg" align=right alt="shards of ancient rock" hspace=10 vspace=10>


	As time progressed, metals became important trading commodities and their variety
	and quantity increased. Eventually, high-grade surface outcrops became more
	scarce and greater ingenuity was applied to solve the problems of mining deposits
	at depth and to developing lower grade deposits. With cheap and abundant  labor,
	many man-hours could be expended in extracting a few pounds of metal and such
	civilizations as the Phoenicians, Greeks and Romans became highly proficient in
	hand-working lower grade mineral deposits to a considerable depth.
	<p>

	Specialists in prospecting probably evolved in the Middle Ages and the prospector
	remained the essential element in any exploration effort until the Second World
	War. Although he may have had some geological knowledge, the prospector's approach
	to exploration was generally effective because it was direct and simple -- he
	developed a sharp eye for metallic mineralization and a feeling for the rock. He
	panned samples of mineralization and traced float (fragments of rock often found
	on hillsides below an outcrop or vein) back to its source. He trenched, pitted and
	scraped to expose bedrock in any favorable areas. Prospectors have always been
	among the first to penetrate remote and unexplored areas and they have been
	eminently successful in finding near-surface mineral occurrences. Many of the
	major mines in production today resulted from an initial effort by prospectors.

	<h2>
	Exploration in the Satellite Age
	</h2>
	
	<a href="02a.html">
	Back to "Modern Day Explorers"</a>
	<p>
	
	The primordial prospectors of bygone eras would never recognize or understand
	Placer Dome's eclectic mix of explorationists. Picks and pans have been replaced
	by laptop computers and satellites. Specialists in geology, geophysics,
	geochemistry and information systems are the new trail blazers, working their way
	through data toward the discovery of mineral reserves. Most importantly, they're
	working together. More than anything else, Placer Dome's exploration story is one
	of converging technologies.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/02satell.jpg" align=right alt="satellite exploration jpeg" hspace=10 vspace=10>

	At Placer Dome, we believe that a "global approach" to exploration is essential to
	the future growth of a successful mining company. With more than 20 exploration
	offices scattered across the globe, our story is inextricably bound to that of
	information technology.
	<p>
	
	<strong>
	What kind of information?
	</strong>
	<p>

	Different scientific approaches, some of them unknown a generation ago, are now a
	normal part of exploration.  New methodologies underly work in the areas of
	geology, geophysics and geochemistry. Combined with digital data management and
	telecommunications systems, it's a new world.
	<p>

	Magnetic, electromagnetic, radio-metric, resistivity, gravity, seismic and
	induced polarization surveys are commonly used to detect mineral deposits.
	Some of this information can now be superimposed on images produced by satellites
	400 miles above the earth's surface that can see through the clouds. These maps-for-the-modern-age can reveal or
	confirm subtle variations not evident to geologists on the surface and not always
	clearly delineated through aerial photography.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Moving the sun around
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	In still another advance made possible by satellites and computers, geologists can
	view large sections of the earth's surface with the features enhanced by shadows
	resulting from the sun's rays. This is not remarkable in itself, except that the
	shadows are there whether the clouds are in the way or not. Furthermore, the
	geologist can have the computer take control of the sun's location, then move the
	sun up or down and all around the image. Each angle reveals different features of
	the surface and provides new clues for exploration people.
	<p>

	Exploration in the satellite age is the application of logical methodology to the
	search for mineral resources, employing specialized personnel and a variety of
	scientific techniques. The geologist formulates a geological concept, on the basis
	of comparison with known deposits and of knowledge of the basic geological
	processes and mineral distribution patterns. Those areas most favorable for the
	particular type of mineralization sought are then selected. Geological,
	geophysical and geochemical studies further delineate areas for more intense
	investigation until a significant anomaly is indicated.
	<p>

	At this point, the program becomes more specific by seeking actual samples.
	Trenching is used if the minerals are reasonably close to the surface; otherwise
	drilling and underground openings are the only ways of obtaining the samples on
	which all further calculations and decisions will be based.
	<p>

	The principle of drilling for samples is simple -- a drill stem, powered at the
	surface, penetrates the rocks of the target area. Samples, in the form of chips or
	core, are recovered for lab analysis. The major expense occurs in moving equipment
	into remote areas and preparing the drill site. Often, miles of road must be built
	or helicopters chartered, months of planning completed (including environmental
	protection) and a self-sustaining camp established before drilling -- to determine
	the size and grade of an anomaly -- can be carried out.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Exploration: No stasis
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	Although exploration is increasingly disciplined, methodical and scientific, one
	thing it will never be -- in the satellite age -- is static.
	<p>

	As the global information highway continues to evolve, new ways of "crunching the
	data" and sharing results will revolutionize Placer Dome's exploration efforts. A
	sophisticated telecommunications network, underway, provides improved means by which to reach a number of specialists in
	a variety of locations quickly.  The result: timely communications and full
	use of our knowledge base.
	<p>

	Many zones of mineralization still await discovery beneath the continents and
	oceans of our globe. Some of them could be richer than than any now known,
	but because they lie at depths beyond the reach of current methods of detection,
	their development depends upon the discovery of new and more imaginative methods
	of exploration.
	<p>

	Within this context, it's easy to see why, at Placer Dome, long-term exploration
	with adequate and consistent funding will continue to be an essential part of the
	company's growth strategy.

	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/02millio.jpg" align=right alt="geologists viewing ore sample" hspace=10 vspace=5>

	In 1995, Placer Dome spent $110 million on exploration which boosted the
	Corporation's share of estimated gold reserves to 21 million ounces, compared with
	19.8 million ounces a year earlier.
	<p>
	
	The essential purpose of exploration is to find mineral deposits and prove their
	potential as ore. By definition, the term ore means a mineral assemblage that can
	be developed, mined and processed at a profit. Whether a profit can be derived
	from a mineral deposit is dependent on many technical and economic factors. Such
	things as tonnage, grade and metal recovery can be established with considerable
	accuracy and remain relatively fixed.
	<p>

	Economic factors -- metal prices, capital and operating costs, infrastructure,
	transportation and taxation rates -- are constantly changing. In addition,
	changing technology, government legislation and legal and social influences can
	dramatically affect the viability of a potential mine. As a result, what
	constitutes ore varies as to place and time. The mineral industry is extremely
	sensitive to these changes and is continually reviewing international developments
	to determine those areas most favorable for developing economic mineral reserves.
	<p>
	
	Placer Dome's resource evaluations during 1995 were centred mainly on the Cerro
	Crucitas, Costa Rica, and Donlin Creek, Alaska projects and the newly-discovered
	QK Zone at the Detour Lake Mine in Canada. In 1996, intensive drilling
	continued on these properties.
	<p>
	
	The increase in reserves came from additional on-property exploration and from the 
	inclusion of 1.2 million ounces at Musselwhite in Canada and 1.5 million ounces at Cortez
	for the South Pipeline deposit in the United States.
	<p>
	
	The Corporation's share of estimated ore reserves at gold mining operations
	is shown in the following table:

	Minex: New Mines for Old
	</h2>
	
	<a href="02a.html">
	Back to "Modern Day Explorers"</a>
	<p>
		
	"The best place to look for a new mine is in the shadow of an old headframe," as
	the saying goes.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/02minex.jpg" align=right alt="Kiena Mine headframe" hspace=10 vspace=5>

	Ore deposits are classified into one of several general types. However, within each deposit, unique geologic characteristics may be recognized,
	and these may determine the mode of occurrence, configuration and size for the 
	deposit. There may be signatures for potential satellites to the main deposit,
	and these possibilities then become the focus for exploration programmes on the 
	mine properties and adjoining areas.
	<p>
	These Minex programmes (exploration efforts at or adjacent to existing mine sites) were
	initiated with the objective of studying, evaluating and identifying potential
	expansions to known orebodies and finding new deposits on the mine properties. These
	programmes are coordinated between exploration geologists and mine geologists to fit
	both short- and long-term mine plans.
		<p>
	Here are some recent results of Placer Dome Minex activites:
	<p>
			
	<li type=bullet>In 1985, Australia's Kidston Mine reserves were estimated at 37 million
	tonnes, which would keep the mine running until 1995. By 1991, Minex had added 33
	million tonnes to initial reserves. Mine life has now been extended to 2003,
	because of the discovery of 57.13 million tonnes of ore since the mine went into
	production.
	<p>
	
	<li type=bullet>The new "QK Deposit Zone" was found at Detour Lake Mine in Canada in 1995, adding
	significant reserves.
	<p>
	
	<li type=bullet>The H.G Young prospect, a small past-producer on the Campbell property,
	is being investigated for further reserves.
	<p>
		
	<li type=bullet>20,000 metres of drilling on the Lamaque property (adjacent to the Sigma gold
	mine in Canada) has intersected  mineralized vein systems. Placer Dome
	is confident these new mineral intersections will become ore reserves.
	<p>
	
	
	<li type=bullet>At the Kiena gold mine in Canada, the "North Zone" has been upgraded. A 
	higher grade ore zone was also discovered in 1993 and is being further delineated
	this year.
	<p>
	
	
	<li type=bullet>Minex has led to success at two U.S. gold mines: Bald Mountain and the 
	Cortez Joint Venture.

	<h2>
	The Rugged Office
	</h2>
	
	
	<a href="02a.html">
	Back to "Modern Day Explorers"</a>
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/02office.jpg" align=right alt="La Coipa landscape" hspace=10 vspace=5>

	In remote locations across the planet, in Latin
	America, China, Singapore, Jakarta, Port Moresby, Ivory Coast, Mali and Russia,
	Placer Dome's exploration work continues day in, day out. How will
	convergent exploration technologies re-shape the reality of Placer Dome
	prospectors in the field? We can answer this question with a couple of words:
	"Rugged office."
	<p>
	

	Typically the project development sites (these include both exploration and 
	production properties) that require communications are not in cities...but 
	are located a considerable distance from built up areas. With that in mind,
	on the drawing boards at Placer Dome is an exciting and innovative mobile computing 
	"toolkit" designed to provide a combination of hardware, software and 
	connecting devices to PDI employees who travel, enabling them to do mobile
	computing.
	<p>
	
	<strong>
	An office in a briefcase
	</strong>
	<p>

	
	Placer Dome's "rugged office" project must support easy-to-use voice and 
	data communication and support the capture and appropriate analysis of business
	information. Essentially it is an office in a briefcase, easily
	transportable and user-friendly.
	<p>


	<img src="../gfx/02rugged.jpg" align=right alt="Control systems" hspace=10 vspace=5>


	An "office in a briefcase" will provide Placer Dome explorationists with a number
	of advantages. It will allow geologists to exchange production, technical and
	business information worldwide. It will create an infrastructure in which raw data
	can be transmitted from remote field locations to be processed by specialists
	off-site. It will facilitate virtual meetings, eliminating the necessity for
	physical meetings which can be costly and difficult to orchestrate in
	far-flung locations.</td>

	Asked to think of gold, most people imagine glittering pendants, rings and
	chains. Or perhaps it's gleaming stacks of bars, looming behind heavily
	armed guards.
	<p>	

	<img src="../gfx/girl1.jpg" alt="cosmetic uses for gold jpeg" align=right vspace=5 hspace=5>
	<p>
	
	Gold is everywhere. You probably wouldn't think of it as microscopic pellets
	pulsing through veins and arteries.  Yet gold fights illnesses. Injection of such
	pellets helps retard prostate cancer in men. Women with ovarian cancer are
	treated with colloidal gold. And because it is biologically benign, biochemists
	use gold to form compounds with complex materials such as proteins to create new
	lifesaving drugs. One experimental new gold compound being tested for use in AIDS
	treatment blocks virus replication in infected cells.
		<p>
	Gold helps to prevent injuries. Gold delivers electricity and heat. It is stored
	in vaults by central banks as a means of monetary control. And it is worn as
	personal adornment in countries around the world.
	<p>		
	
	<h4>
	Five miles to the ounce
	</h4>
		
	If you own an ounce of gold, you might know its current market value. But you
	probably didn't know the same ounce can be drawn into a wire that stretches five
	miles. This metal is completely recyclable and is virtually immune to the effects
	of air, water and oxygen.
	<p>
	An unparalleled combination of physical and chemical properties makes gold 
	invaluable in thousands of common, everyday applications that require perfect
	performance over a long period of time.
	<p>	
	Virtually all reliable electronic products depend on gold to guarantee
	consistent performance. Gold is used in electronic equipment because,
	unlike other metals, it does not tarnish or corrode and is an exceptional
	transmitter of electricity and heat.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/golduse.jpg" alt="gold in electronics jpeg" align=left hspace=7 vspace=5>
	<p>

	Gold is found in cameras, videocassette recorders, fax machines, televisions
	and compact discs. Telephones would not provide clear reception over time 
	without gold-coated contacts at key transmission points. And gold is used
	on printed wiring boards of cellular phones to create a pathway which conducts 
	the current.
	<p>
	The wires within camcorders that connect microelectronic circuitry are 
	made of gold. Music lovers also depend on gold for the highest quality
	surface available on compact discs. The 24-karat gold surface resists 
	oxidation, eliminating its potential destruction by moisture.
	<p>
	Computers found in homes and offices use gold in microchips and 
	circuit boards. Modems, printers and other electronic devices all require
	gold.
	<p>
	As one distinguished engineer says, "Gold is absolutely essential when signal 
	purity, conductivity and reliability are required."

	Back to "Lustrous Performer"</a>
	<p>

	As early as 4,000 BC, Egyptian Pharoah Narmer minted the world's first gold bars.
	Valued for its rarity and beauty, gold was believed to have been placed on Earth
	by the Egyptians' sun god. Pharoahs and other royalty were buried with all of their
	golden treasures, in tombs made of gold, believing they would return one day with
	all of their wealth intact.
	<p>	
	
	<img src="../gfx/rawgold.jpg" align=right>
	<p>
	
	<h4>
	The first gold coins
	</h4>
	
	The first gold coins were minted by King Gyges of Lydia around 650 BC. He believed
	raw gold and silver were poor media for the development of trade. Gold became a
	monetary metal, and was valued at 13.33 times the value of silver.	
	<p>
	Around 300 BC, Alexander the Great created the first world-wide currency, the Drachma.
	His Macedonian Empire crumbled, however, when he produced more gold coins than
	useful goods and commodities, triggering the world's first inflation.	

	<h4>
	Empires built on gold
	</h4>
	
	After the Roman Empire was established by Augustus in 27 BC, its rulers raided and
	robbed country after country of gold. Later, the Romans made the mistake of
	"watering down" their gold with other metals, inducing inflation and currency
	depreciation. The Roman Empire fell.
	<p>
	In 325 AD, Byzantium rose from the ashes of Rome, creating a new world power and a
	new world-wide currency, the gold coin Solidus. It retained its worth for nearly
	800 years. Finally, in 1200 AD, the currency was watered down with other base metals
	and the Empire declined.
	
	<h4>
	Power from gold or gold from power?
	</h4>
	
	<img src="../gfx/00gold$.jpg" alt="raw gold jpeg" align=left vspace=5 hspace=5>
	<p>

	During the reign of Queen Elizabeth	I (1533-1603), Sir Francis Drake raised funds
	from the British public to attack the Spanish fleet in open seas. Drake's crew
	returned successfully, its holds laden with gold. As Britain gained dominance of
	seas, gold flowed through the arteries of commerce into its treasuries.  
	<p>	
	In the early 1700's, France experimented with the first paper 
	currency based on gold. This had an international impact until 1821,
	at which time Britain returned to the Gold Standard. In the decades that followed,
	its neighboring partners and the United States also adopted it. In 1914, England
	abandoned the Gold Standard, as did most of its neighbors, due to the escalating
	expenses of World War I. Gold then took on the role of inflation and currency hedge.
	<p>


	The Gold Exchange Standard was established in 1922. This allowed countries to 
	exchange paper currency instead of gold. The end result	was paper currency-based 
	inflation. A global stock market crash occurred seven years later. By 1931, most
	countries were off the Gold Exchange Standard. In 1934, the United States devalued
	the dollar by raising the official price of gold from $20.67/ounce to $35.00/ounce.
	This was the first price change since Sir Isaac Newton established the $20.67/ounce
	price in 1717. As the decades unfolded, the price of gold stayed at $35 while
	the dollar was backed by a smaller and smaller percentage of it.	
	<p>		
	In 1965, the gold reserve requirement was completely removed from the dollar,
	allowing currencies to "float." Again, inflation set in during the 1970s and another
	global stock market crash occurred several years later, in 1987. Now gold trades in a 
	range from $370/oz. to $400/oz.

	<p>
	
	The global supply picture in gold mining has changed dramatically. The biggest
	producers of yesteryear, South Africa, Canada, Australia, Russia and the 
	United States, are forecast to show declining or flat production in the 
	future. By contrast, South America is emerging as a new force.
	<p>
	
	Political uncertainty envelops Russia and South Africa. In the United States,
	and to a lesser extent in Canada and Australia, gold mining is being made less
	welcome by the regulatory climate. Canada's gold production is estimated
	to have peaked at 177 tonnes in 1991, and is expected to decline in the next
	eight years.
	<p>
	Canadian gold producers are increasingly taking their expertise and capital
	out of the country to develop mineral deposits offshore. This is shown by a 
	marked decline in total industry exploration spending in Canada -- a trend 
	reflected in Placer Dome's budgets as well.
	<p>
	The trend to invest outside the traditional producing countries will
	continue, particularly in South America, which is becoming the new
	Eldorado. In 1992, Latin America was the only region of the globe to
	show an increase (20%) in industry spending on mineral exploration.
	Placer Dome was at the forefront of this move to Latin America, and
	in Chile, the company already has a major gold and silver mine in
	operation.
	<p>
	Placer Dome was the first in the current wave of North American
	companies to move into gold exploration in Venezuela, where it has a
	major discovery. This success reflects the strategy of focusing on
	geologically attractive yet underdeveloped areas of the world.
	<p>
	In addition to South America, new sources of future supply are
	expected to come from Papua New Guinea, other Asian Pacific Rim
	countries -- especially Indonesia -- as well as West African
	countries like Ghana, as improved accessibility and technology make
	these places viable for gold mining.

	<p>

	Jewelry demand has been described as the cornerstone of the gold market. While
	gold continues to be valued as a solid, long-term investment and is still an
	alternative international currency, the continuing desire of hundreds of millions
	of people to own and wear real gold jewelry is also a key factor in the future
	prosperity of the gold mining industry.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/piechart.jpg" align=right alt="Gold demand pie chart">
	<p>
	
	Over the past decade, some two-thirds of the newly-mined gold supplied
	to the market has been consumed by purchasers of gold jewelry. For the last four
	years, the amount of gold used in the fabrication of gold jewelry has exceeded the
	entire gold mining output of the Western world.
		<p>
	The motivations for purchasing gold jewelry can vary enormously, depending on
	culture and geography. In the developed markets of the West, it is
	bought primarily for adornment, and often for sentimental reasons; in the 
	developing markets of the Far East and Middle East, it is bought for investment
	as well as adornment.
	<p>
	Developing countries such as China, India, Thailand and Turkey represent
	the fastest growing markets for gold jewelry demand, and now account for 
	some two-thirds of worldwide consumption.

	<a name="01">Know Your Karats</a>
	</strong>
	</font>
	<p>
	In the jewelry business, the fineness of gold is expressed in karats,
	also spelled carats. Twenty-four karats corresponds to "fine" or pure gold,
	while 18 karats indicates an alloy consisting of 18 parts pure gold and six
	parts other metal, often copper or silver. In North America, items of 
	jewelry can come in 24K, 22K, 18K, 14K, 9K and even 1K fineness. Karat is not
	to be confused with the carat used as a unit of gemstone weight (0.2 gram),
	as in a 5-carat diamond (1 gram), or with the vegetable, spelled carrot.

	<p>
	
	While highly evolved, we represent just a single piece in nature's intricate puzzle. If
	one piece changes shape, the other pieces must adapt in order to fit. By understanding
	the immediate environment and our effects upon it, we can see potential problems and
	stop them before they start.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/03spell.jpg" align=right alt="Golden Sunlight Mine, environmental tests" hspace=10 vspace=10>

	The Company operates under a detailed environmental policy which directs each mine to
	include a full account of environmental impacts and costs of any project evaluation or
	plan. Each facility is also required to have an environmental operating plan and an
	accident contingency plan.
	<p>

	In addition, a full-time senior environmental engineer works with facility management at
	each of Placer Dome's operations. Environmental engineers administer a three-tier audit
	programme which assists facilities in identifying areas for improvement. They also work
	to provide critical reviews of each facility, using both internal and external experts
	to ensure thoroughness and objectivity. All new facilities are included in the audit
	procedure guaranteeing its initial compliance is continued during and after its
	operational lifetime.

	Demonstrated environmental leadership is a dominant component of our drive for success.
	Even though our policies are some of the strongest in the mining industry, a further
	declaration of principles was adopted in 1995 to improve the application of the
	policies and to monitor their effectiveness.
	<p>
	
	To establish a position of environmental leadership, Placer Dome will achieve and
	maintain the level of performance and practice which, in the conduct of all of its
	activities, will:
	<p>
	
	<ul>
	
	<li type=bullet> Protect human health
	<p>

	<li type=bullet> Minimize use of the surrounding ecosystem
	<p>

	<li type=bullet> Return sites to a state compatible with a healthy and safe environment
	<p>
	

	</ul>
	<br>
	
	By adhering to these principles Placer Dome hopes to reduce the effects of its
	operations on both the modern and natural environment. In addition, we hope that our
	efforts can and will be modelled by others in similar industries.</td>

	Keeping it Clean: Minimizing Enviro-Impact
	</h2>
	
	<a href="03a.html">
	Back to "One World"</a>
	<p>
	
	The best way to reduce the effects of operations on the environment is to disturb as
	little of it as possible. Sustainable development initiatives -- those that meet the
	needs of the present without compromising those of future generations -- play an
	important role in Placer Dome operations.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/02clean.jpg" align=right alt="Campbell Mine, water treatment" hspace=10 vspace=10>
	
	The development of recent and future sites emphasizes the minimization of impact on the
	surrounding area -- placing any parts of the property having natural, social or cultural
	value off-limits.
	<p>

	Once the sites are up and running, efforts are focused on maintaining the development
	standards for the life of the facility. Ongoing monitoring activities are conducted both
	by the mine and by government to verify that the impacts on the ecosystem are as
	predicted during development.
	<p>

	As an example, sites in Canada have moved to reduce the impact of operations on nearby
	lakes and rivers. To date, over $11 million has been spent on the production and
	operation of water treatment plants for the six different mines across the country.
	<p>

	The investment has paid off as regular environmental assessments show a 93%
	reduction of contaminant discharges since 1988 with no indication of damage to the
	quality of water or food sources in those areas.
	<p>

	It is our belief that environmental management is an integral part of the operations at
	every Placer Dome mine and exploration site.

	<h2>
	Reclamation: Last, But Never Least 
	</h2>
	
	<a href="03a.html">
	Back to "One World"</a>
	<p>

	As large as our planet may be, it's the only one we've got. We've all
	taken "Mother Nature" for granted at one time or another and, if continued, abuses
	will become significant problems for future generations.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/03reclai.jpg" align=right alt="Bald Mtn. reclamation site" hspace=10 vspace=10>

	It is generally agreed that the increasing stresses placed upon the environment by
	modernization could cause irreparable harm. We've seen it in the extinction of entire
	species, the reduction of vital rain forests and the hole in the ozone
	layer.
	<p>

	Placer Dome predicts the effects of its operations on the
	environment before, during and after its operations. Plans for the decommissioning and
	reclamation process are outlined in mine feasibility studies as part of initial mine
	proposals. Once mines are operational, reclamation activities become an ongoing process
	and may commence as early as the first year of operation.
	<p>

	Upon closure of a facility, land disturbed by mining -- including waste dumps and
	tailings ponds -- must be returned to environmentally acceptable conditions. 
	Reclamation efforts are continued well past the mine's closure to increase the
	likelihood of success.
		<p>

	In recognition of our stewardship of sites where activities have ceased, Placer Dome
	received two Outstanding Reclamation Achievement awards: one for reclamation work
	carried out by its exploration staff in British Columbia and another for site
	rehabilitation at Equity Silver Mines. The latter award was for control of acid rock drainage
	and reclamation of rock piles.
		<p>

	These efforts are made in order to give something back to areas from which
	we've taken. It is our responsibility to remain accountable for our actions during
	and after business ventures. The benefits of such efforts go beyond the local area,
	beyond Placer Dome and even beyond the mining industry. The real winner is the
	environment and all it holds.

	<h2>
	The Human Factor: Protecting People
	</h2>
	
	<a href="03a.html">
	Back to "One World"</a>
	<p>
	
	Regardless of how big an organization becomes, its success is dependent upon the
	individuals associated with it. The health and safety of Placer Dome's employees,
	contractors and relevant publics are always priority.
	<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/03people.jpg" align=right alt="Zaldivar Mine Employees" hspace=10 vspace=10>



	<strong>
	Placer Dome People
	</strong>
	<p>

	All employees undergo stringent safety training, encompassing any use, maintenance and
	emergency handling of equipment and their relevant chemicals. The average lost-time
	accident frequency for Placer Dome employees has been and continues to be well below the
	industry average.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Our Friends, the Contractors
	</strong>
	<p>

	Major efforts have been taken to improve the safety performance of our contractors
	as well. As a first step, an internal task force was formed to develop comprehensive
	guidelines on safety in all dealings with contractors -- from the bidding process
	through to site enforcement. Safety reports on contractors now receive the same
	scrutiny as those for our own operations.
	<p>

	Placer Dome Technical Services and Comp&#227;nia Minera Zald&#237;var won a Chilean
	award in 1995 for safety performance during construction of the Zald&#237;var Mine.
	<p>

	To strengthen the application of our Occupational Health and Safety Policy, health
	protection programmes -- in place at all operations -- are reviewed regularly to ensure
	consistently high standards of protection at each mine.
	<p>

	<strong>
	A Large Group: The Public
	</strong>
	<p>

	As many of the areas explored and mined by Placer Dome are in developing countries, it
	is important that the Company's operations do not have a negative effect on everyday
	life.
	<p>

	For example, ground water and air quality tests are done on a regular basis to ensure
	any potential contaminants are recognized and proper action is taken.
	<p>

	In addition, the Company has taken efforts to assist those communities with which they
	do business. Local workers are used whenever possible and the development of major mining
	projects in the area helps to strengthen the local marketplace.

	We are committed to long-term profitable growth. The added value to our
	Company will be achieved by investing in our strategy, and in people whose
	combined skills will lead to successful exploration, property acquisition,
	mine development and mine operations.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/04gold.jpg" align=right alt="Gold products jpeg" hspace=10 vspace=10>


	We believe in integrating the efficient extraction of mineral resources
	with responsible environmental stewardship, and providing a safe and healthy
	workplace for our employees.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Goals and Objectives
	</strong>
	<p>

	The Corporation will increase its share of annual production to 2.5 million ounces
	of gold by the year 2000, at cash costs in the lower third of the world cost league.
	We will conduct exploration and acquisition of our primary targets, gold and 
	gold/copper deposits, on a worldwide basis, to increase our reserves to a 10-year
	base at the increased rate of production.
	<p>
	We will remain opportunistic in selected base metals if they enhance long-term 
	cash flow. Non-precious metals production, primarily copper, is not expected
	to exceed about one-quarter of the gross revenue of Placer Dome.

	<h2>
	Placer Dome reports improved quarterly performance
	</h2>
	<font size=-1>(all dollar amounts in U.S. currency)</font><P>
	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. today reported a consolidated
	loss for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 of $8 million or
	$0.03 per share, compared with net earnings of $36 million or $0.15
	per share in the corresponding period of 1995.  Third quarter 1996
	earnings were $16 million or $0.07 per share compared with earnings
	of $24 million or $0.10 per share in the year-earlier period.
	
	<p>

	The Corporation improved its gold earnings performance in the third
	quarter compared with the disappointing first half of the year due
	to higher gold production and improved cash operating costs.  Third
	quarter gold operating earnings were $74 million compared with $77
	million in the year-earlier period, and with $41 million and $47
	million in the first and second quarters of 1996.  For the nine
	months, gold earnings were $162 million compared with $175 million a
	year ago.

	<p>

	The loss in the first nine months is attributed to a $43 million
	after tax provision against earnings representing the estimated net
	impact of the accidental escape of mill tailing at the Marcopper
	Mine in the Philippines.

	<p>

	Sales revenues for the first nine months of 1996 were $845 million
	compared with $735 million in 1995, and cash flow from operations
	amounted to $183 million compared with $157 million.  The average
	realized price for gold in the third quarter was $409/oz. and for
	the nine months $408/oz., compared with an average market price of
	$392/oz. in both periods of the prior year.

	<p>
	
	The Corporation's share of gold production for the third quarter was
	503,000 ozs., bringing production for the first nine months of 1996
	to 1,438,000 ozs., 6% higher than in the 1995 period.  Reflecting
	improved operating performance since June 30, the average cash
	production cost in the third quarter was $210/oz., bringing the cash
	cost for the nine months to $233/oz., compared with $246/oz. in the
	first half of 1996 and $215/oz. in the first nine months of 1995.
	
	<p>
	
	Significantly higher gold production compared with the first nine
	months of 1995 was achieved at the Granny Smith Mine in Australia,
	the Dome Mine in Canada and the Cortez and Golden Sunlight mines in
	the United States.
	 
	<p>
	
	Operating earnings from copper for the nine months were $17 million,
	and $5 million for the third quarter.  The average realized price
	for copper in the nine months was $0.92/lb.  Cash production cost
	for copper was $0.57/lb. for the nine months.  At the Zaldvar Mine
	in Chile, the share of production in the nine months was 27,520
	tonnes of cathode copper.  The Osborne Mine in Australia produced
	31,415 tonnes of copper in the first nine months of 1996.
	
	<p>
	
	Construction of facilities at the 60%-owned Cortez Joint Venture in
	the United States is three months ahead of schedule for start-up in
	April 1997 and is expected to be $50 million under budget.  Plant
	buildings have been completed, concrete work is virtually done, and
	structural, mechanical and electrical work is well advanced. 
	Low-grade ore from the deposit is being transferred to heap leach
	areas while stripping of waste is ongoing.  The Corporation
	announced an enhanced production profile for the project with output
	of 675,000 ozs. per year (PDG share 405,000 ozs. per year) during
	the first five years due to higher grade in the early years.  Over
	the 12-year mine life, gold production is forecast to average
	440,000 ozs. per year (PDG share 264,000 ozs. per year) at an
	average cash production cost of $152/oz.  Application has been made
	to the Nevada State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for
	approval of a Plan of Operations to integrate mining and processing
	of ore from the adjoining South Pipeline and Pipeline pits.
	
	<p>
	
	At the 68%-owned Musselwhite gold property in Canada, construction
	of a mine and processing facilities is ahead of schedule and on
	budget.  The goal of erecting and closing in essential structures
	before the onset of winter is expected to be achieved, with cladding
	of buildings currently 80% complete.  Underground development is
	progressing on schedule.  Commissioning of the power supply is
	expected to start in late January 1997 for gold production to
	commence in the second quarter of 1997 at a planned rate of 200,000
	ozs. per year (PDG share 135,000 ozs. per year) at an average cash
	production cost of about $200/oz.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation announced a positive development decision on August
	1 regarding the 70%-owned Las Cristinas Mine in Venezuela. 
	Construction will commence with finalization of shareholder and
	financing arrangements currently being negotiated.  The Government
	of Venezuela approved the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in
	early October, allowing financing arrangements for the project to be
	advanced.  Plans for the facilities and future reclamation have
	established a new benchmark for proactive environmental protection
	in a wet, tropical setting.  The mine is scheduled to produce gold
	at an average rate of 450,000 ozs. per year (PDG share 315,000 ozs.
	per year) following a two-year construction period.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation has completed a new resource estimate for its
	wholly-owned Cerro Crucitas gold property in Costa Rica.  The
	measured and indicated resource is now calculated to be 58 million
	tonnes of material averaging 1.2 grams gold per tonne, containing
	2.2 million ozs. of gold.  Exploration is continuing.
	
	<p>
	
	Drilling of several targets continues at the wholly-owned Donlin
	Creek property in Alaska, where a measured and indicated resource of
	45 million tonnes grading 2.5 grams gold per tonne containing 3.6
	million ozs. of gold has been identified.  Strong evidence is
	emerging of continuity between the main Lewis deposit and adjacent
	areas, Queen, 900 metres north of Lewis, and Rochelieu, 300 metres
	to the west.  Metallurgical testwork is being conducted on the
	dominant gold-bearing refractory material to determine the optimal
	processing options.
	
	<p>
	
	At the Marcopper Mine in the Philippines the Corporation remains
	engaged in repairing the drainage tunnel which caused the major
	escape of mill tailing in March, and in remediation of the river
	environment.  The introduction of concrete grout and heated bitumen
	through drillholes from surface has served to seal the tunnel
	pending the installation of a permanent plug.  Approval is being
	awaited from Philippine authorities and the affected communities to
	take action to remove tailing from the channel of the Boac River. 
	The Corporation is continuing negotiations with the majority
	shareholder of Marcopper with a view to divesting itself of its
	interest.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation's share of proven and probable reserves at the
	Porgera Mine in Papua New Guinea increased by 490,000 ozs. to 2.2
	million ozs. at June 30, 1996 following revisions based on
	substantially increased data from exploration drilling in 1996.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation tendered its 30.8% interest in Gibraltar Mines
	Limited to a successful take-over bid by Westmin Resources Limited
	of Vancouver for all of the shares of Gibraltar.  A gain of about
	$11 million after currency translation and income tax adjustments
	will be recorded in the fourth quarter.

	<strong>Notes:<br>
	(1)</strong> Figures represent 100% of the results of mines owned by the
	Corporation and its subsidiaries and a pro-rata share of joint
	ventures.  The Corporation's ownership interest is 75.4% of Placer
	Pacific Limited which holds the interests in the Australian and
	Papua New Guinea mines.  Placer Pacific Limited's ownership interest
	is 80% of Misima Mines Pty Limited and 70% of Kidston Gold Mines
	Limited.  All dollar amounts are in U.S. currency. <br>
	<strong>(2)</strong> Gold grades
	are shown as grams per tonne; copper grades are shown as a
	percentage.  Gold production is shown as kilograms and ounces while
	copper production is shown as tonnes and pounds.  Costs for gold are
	shown per ounce while costs for copper are shown per pound.<br>
	<strong>(3)</strong> Includes all costs incurred for mining operations, except
	exploration, financing, non-mine site general and administrative
	costs and non-recurring charges.  The cash production costs include
	currency hedging gains and losses.  Cash cost per ounce conforms
	with the Gold Institute Production Cost Standard. <br>
	<strong>(4)</strong> Comprises
	cash production cost plus depreciation, depletion and reclamation
	provisions.  Amounts include charges for smelting and refining. 
	Total cost per ounce conforms with the Gold Institute Production
	Cost Standard. <br>
	<strong>(5)</strong> Comprises sales, at the spot price, less cost
	of sales, depreciation and depletion for each mine, in millions of
	dollars. <br>
	<strong>(6)</strong> Osborne Mine commenced operations on August
	1, 1995, producing copper concentrate with gold as a by-product.<br>
	<strong>(7)</strong> Recovery is not susceptible to accurate
	measurement at heap leach operations.<br>
	<strong>(8)</strong> Golden Sunlight Mine ceased milling operations in 1994 due to
	ground movement. Production resumed February 6, 1995. <br>
	<strong>(9)</strong> Gold and silver are accounted for as co-products at La Coipa
	Mine. Silver is converted to equivalent ounces of gold, using the
	ratio of silver market price to gold market price, for purposes of
	calculating cash and total production costs per equivalent ounce of
	gold.<br>
	<strong>(10)</strong> Hedging revenue represents the difference
	between spot and realized prices.

	<h2>
	Nuts & Bolts of a Placer Dome Project
	</h2>
	
	<a href="05a.html">Back to The Tools</a>
	<p>

	After years of drilling, testing, estimating, planning, negotiating and raising
	money, the mine development project is approved. "Let's go," says the Board of
	Directors. "Okay," says the Government and the local community. "Aye, Aye," says
	Placer Dome's in-house Project Development Division.
			<p>
	
	<img src="../gfx/lacoipa.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=5>


	There are essentially two approaches that can be adopted in designing, purchasing
	and constructing a mine and metallurgical processing facility: * Completely design
	the whole installation or major elements and go out for a lump sum tender on
	supply and construction. This has the advantage of known costs at the start point
	but takes a lot more time. * Fast track the project from the time of approval to
	completion.
	<p>

	Placer Dome has elected to proceed on the basis of fast tracking,
	because the sooner we can get a plant into production, the sooner we can reverse
	the flow of cash from going out to coming in. By fast-tracking, we ourselves
	manage the design, engineering, purchasing and construction using in-house
	engineering and management expertise, supplemented by the specialized skills of
	consultants.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/millshell.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=5>

	By doing all of our own purchasing, we usually arrange to take delivery at the
	manufacturing plant. We engage a shipping broker to handle shipments, including
	chartering vessels specifically for our project needs.
	<p>

	What are we looking for in our relationship with those providing services and
	equipment? There are three vital elements: Quality/Price, Delivery time, and
	Service.
	<p>

	Starting with Quality/Price, these go hand in hand. You get what you pay for and
	we do not necessarily buy on the basis of the lowest bidder. The other factor is
	that we expect the supplier to make a profit, otherwise he is really not much good
	to us in the long run.
	<p>

	We have, over the years of dealing with people in all aspects of our business,
	developed a knowledge of, and preference for, certain types of equipment and
	manufacturers which have proved to be reliable and have stood the test of time. A
	good product or innovative idea will always sell in the mining business, as ours
	is a wide-open forum for the exchange of operating information and new technology.
	Poor products get widely discussed to warn others of potential pitfalls.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/roaster.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=5>

	We have from time to time been involved in the development of equipment with
	suppliers or manufacturers to meet specific needs in our mines, such as the
	introduction of "cherry pickers" at Endako in 1966 for removal of oversize rock
	from the primary crusher - an idea taken from a log loader.
	<p>

	

	The second element, delivery time, requires that we solicit bids very early on for
	items requiring long manufacturing lead times, such as mills, crushers, and
	autoclaves. The delivery of these items usually dictate the project time frame,
	along with seasonal considerations such as winter construction.
	<p>

	The most common shortcoming among suppliers is a lack of consistency between the
	sales department and the production department. Sales wants the order and makes
	optimistic estimates of delivery times. Once the order is placed, they sail off to
	bigger and better things and we find ourselves dealing with a hard-nosed
	production group who have a different shop schedule which does not meet our
	expectations.
	<p>

	To give us some insurance we have introduced penalty clauses for default on
	promised delivery dates.  This often becomes a sore point and has a tendency to
	strain relations when production has any sort of upset. In one instance a pipe
	fabricator was caught in a credit limit situation with his welding supplier which
	was not brought to his or our attention. The net result was that a purchase order
	was not processed and we had a potential three-week delay in taking delivery.
	Fortunately Placer Dome's Purchasing group was able to locate an alternative supply of
	welding supplies which were rush delivered to the pipe fabricator.
	<p>

	Thirdly, with regard to Service, we view most of our suppliers as potentially
	long-term associates who will fill our present as well as future requirements.
	Quite often we run into serious difficulties with a particular piece of equipment
	at the time of installation or during operations and require immediate assistance
	in rectifying the problem.
	<p>

	This is an area where some suppliers excel, because of the close relationship
	established between us, and where they know it is mutually beneficial to solve the
	problem. A supplier has an excellent opportunity to witness first-hand the
	deficiencies of his product in cases such as this and also to contribute to the
	solutions which will ultimately provide him with a better product. Other suppliers
	tend to get bogged down in procedural details and miss the opportunity to provide
	service that counts.
	<p>

	Placer Dome projects cover a wide range of requirements for services, equipment,
	supplies and fabrications. Orders for process equipment for the Porgera project in
	Papua New Guinea, for example, were placed in Australia, North America, Papua New
	Guinea and Germany. Of the North American content, about half the dollar value
	came from British Columbia for tanks, autoclaves and piping.
	<p>

	While North American suppliers currently have an edge in technology, innovation
	and experience, Pacific Rim suppliers are catching up, particularly those closer
	to the project sites, mainly because they can offer competitive labour costs
	related to productivity. We all must consider competitiveness. Trading blocks are
	becoming a fact of life and we must develop ways of working with the Asian block
	and the evolving USA-Mexico block. This may require joint ventures both at home
	and with offshore partners in servicing some of the upcoming projects.

	Significant gold values were discovered 500km north of Thunder Bay, Ontario, near
	Opapimiskan in 1973. Since then, there has been a wide array of explorations and
	studies of the proposed mine to determine the effects it could have upon the
	region's people and environment. With completion scheduled for 1997, the
	Musselwhite project is a modern mine that is designed to address modern concerns.
	The Musselwhite Project, owned by Placer Dome Canada and TVX Gold, includes a mill
	fed by an underground mine and a small open pit. The total capital investment is
	about $250 million, generating 500 construction jobs and 282 positions when the mine
	is in full operation. Workers will travel by air to the mine from local First
	Nations communities and Thunder Bay.
	<p>

<h3>
Our Shared Vision for Musselwhite
</h3>

<strong>
1. Planning and Design
</strong>
<p>

The water, vegetation, fish, amphibians, birds and mammals in the Musselwhite area were carefully studied to determine the effects of the mine.
Musselwhite's design will ensure that:
<p>

<ul>
<li type=bullet>water quality in the rivers and lakes will continue to meet provincial standards during and following mine operation;
<li type=bullet>air emissions will be minimal;
<li type=bullet>the small amounts of fish habitat lost to tailing and polishing ponds will be replaced;
<li type=bullet>metal levels in fish will remain low;
<li type=bullet>there is limited temporary displacement of vegetation and wildlife; and
<li type=bullet>the land will be revegetated and returned as near to its original state as feasible.
</ul>
<p>

<strong>
2. Operation
</strong>
<p>

<img src="../gfx/123musel.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=8>

	The project includes state-of-the-art engineering of effluent treatment, spill
	containment and air emission control. The gold will be recovered using an easily
	destroyed cyanide solution. Rock will be washed and treated to reduce contaminants
	to safe levels before it is deposited in a tailing pond.  
	<p>
	Potential increases in the harvesting of fish and wildlife will be minimized by
	limiting travel by employees and contractors, implementing a catch-and-release
	policy for fish and banning firearms on the property.
	<p>
	
<strong>
3. Closure
</strong>
<p>

Following closure, about 2010, Placer Dome Canada will accelerate its restoration efforts by:
<p>

<ul>
<li type=bullet>removing all structures, equipment, and materials;
<li type=bullet>establishing soil conditions conducive to plant life as well as stabilizing landscape, soil and other organic materials.;
<li type=bullet>contouring and replanting disturbed area with jack pine seedlings;
<li type=bullet>re-establishing natural drainage systems;
<li type=bullet>creating new fish habitat in the open pit and constructing a marsh;
<li type=bullet>ensuring no increase in metal/pollutant levels in wildlife or drinking water;
<li type=bullet>obstructing access road and removing bridges to limit use;
<li type=bullet>removing dams, re-establishing wetlands in treatment pond and creating new wetlands in the tailing pond and open pit; and 
<li type=bullet>monitoring the ecosystem for a minimum of five years after closure. 
</ul>
<p>

	Upon completion, vegetation will cover the site, a wide range of wildlife will
	return and  new small lakes will be established in the open pit and tailing pond.
	<p>

<strong>
An Historic Agreement: Local People, Local Concerns
</strong>
<p>

	The Musselwhite project is located on the traditional lands of the Windigo,
	Shibogama and Mishkeegogamang First Nations. First Nations elders identified a birth
	site, a spirit site and a burial site to be preserved in the area. Archaeological
	studies have been conducted for the minesite, powerline and road areas to ensure
	other culturally significant sites will not be disturbed. The social and
	environmental effects on the area bands and the people living in local communities
	were compiled through public consultation, meetings and reports prepared by the
	First Nations. Preserving the environment and heritage of the Musselwhite Project
	area is the overriding concern of the First Nations people, as well as ensuring that
	local residents receive economic and quality-of-life benefits from the mine. These
	concerns led to the signing of the Musselwhite Agreement in 1992. This accord
	between Placer Dome Canada, TVX Gold, the First Nations, Province of Ontario and
	Government of Canada is a step forward in the relationship between the mining
	industry and the aboriginal community. The Musselwhite Agreement defines how First
	Nations will benefit from the mine, provides a strategy to minimize any possible
	negative effects and establishes commitments to protect the environment. First
	Nations and Placer Dome Canada, will continue working together through the
	Musselwhite Co-ordinating Management Committee and the Public Liaison Committee
	about any aspects of the project that may be affecting local residents, fish or
	wildlife.
	<p>

<strong>
The Placer Dome Commitment
</strong>
<p>

	Studies, planning and working with local residents make the Musselwhite Project an
	example of the Placer Dome vision. Every Placer Dome project is
	examined from a profit/loss and an environmental perspective. A clean, healthy
	environment is in the best interests of the mining industry because it is in the
	best interests of everyone. Placer Dome and its partners take every precaution
	available to ensure our projects have a positive impact on all of our stakeholders
	while limiting the effects on the natural environment. We are committed to success
	through responsibility.
	<p>

<strong>
Our Environment, Our Responsibility
</strong>
<p>

	Placer Dome is one of the country's leading gold mining companies. Our
	success depends on our reputation. We are responsible, not only to our shareholders,
	but also to the people and the environment wherever we operate. It is not a
	responsibility we take lightly. The mining industry has changed forever the way it
	does business and Placer Dome is leading the way with its Musselwhite
	Project. Not only does the Musselwhite Project include a plan for opening and
	ongoing operations, our strategy for closing the mine will revitalize the land and
	limit environmental impacts. The care taken by Placer Dome will return the
	area to a bio-diverse state and allow the traditional pursuits of the First Nations
	people to continue for generations.

	What are Reserves and Resources?
	</strong></font>
	<p>
	<font size=+1><strong>
	Reserves
	</strong></font>
	<p>

	The Corporation's ore reserves are calculated as at December  31, 1995
	(using a gold price of $375 per ounce) and incorporate the current and/or
	expected mine plans and cost levels at each property.
	<p>
	An <strong>ore reserve</strong> is that part of a mineral deposit which 
	could be economically and legally extracted or produced at the time of 
	the reserve determination.
	<p>
	<strong> Proven (Measured) Reserves</strong> are reserves for which (a) quantity
	is computed from dimensions revealed in outcrops, trenches, workings or
	drill holes; grade an/or quality are computed from the results of 
	detailed sampling and (b) the site for inspection, sampling and measurement
	are spaced so closely and geologic character is so well defined that size,
	shape, depth and mineral content of reserves are well established.
	<p>
	<strong>Probable (Indicated) Reserves</strong> are reserves for which
	quantity and grade and/or quality are computed from information similar to
	that used for proven (measured) reserves, but the sites for inspection,
	sampling and measurement are farther apart or are otherwise less adequately
	spaced. The degree of assurance, although lower than that for proven (measured)
	reserves, is high enough to assume continuity between points of observation.
	<p>
	<strong>
	Contained kilograms and contained ounces</strong>
	are estimates of the metal contained in the mineralized material or
	mineral deposit and have been calculated as the product of estimated
	tonnes times grade expressed in kilograms (1,000 grams) and ounces
	(31.1042 grams per ounce). These figures are before allowances for processing
	losses.
	<p>

	<font size=+1><strong>
	Resources
	</strong></font>
	<p>

	<strong>Resources</strong> refer to other mineralized material. Other mineralized material in place
	has been calculated as at December 31, 1995 incorporating relevant assessment
	criteria to determine the appropriate category. With respect to exploration
	properties, significant capital expenditures would be required for mine
	construction prior to the start of commercial production.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Mineralized material or a mineral deposit</strong>
	is a mineralized body which has been delineated be appropriate drilling
	and/or underground sampling to support an estimated tonnage and average
	grade of metal(s). A mineralized body does not qualify as a reserve until
	a comprehensive evaluation, based upon unit cost, grade, recoveries and
	other factors, demonstrates economic feasibility.
	<p>

	Consequently, although the potential exists, there is no assurance that such
	mineralized material or mineral deposits will ever become ore reserves.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Contained kilograms, contained ounces, contained tonnes and contained pounds
	</strong>are estimates of  the metal contained in the mineralized material
	or mineral deposit and have been calculated as the product of estimated
	tonnes times grade expressed in kilograms (1,000 grams) and ounces 
	(31.1042 grams per ounce) or tonnes (2,204 pounds) and pounds as
	appropriate. These figures are before allowances for mining and processing
	losses. Until economic feasibility is established, there is no assurance 
	that any of these quantities will be produced.

	<strong>
	Bald Mountain Mine
	</strong>
	</font>
	<br>
	The Bald Mountain open pit gold mine is located in White Pine County,
	northeastern Nevada, USA. The mine started as a 2,300 litres-per-minute
	heap leach gold project in 1983. In 1985 the plant was upgraded to a
	4,600 litres-per-minute commercial facility processing 600,000
	tonnes of ore per year with four years of reserves. The Bald
	Mountain open pit mine life at December 31, 1995 was 7.5 years and
	tonnage crushed had increased to 2,500,000 tonnes of ore per year.
	Multiple open pits and two semi-portable crushers are operated.

	<strong>
	Cortez Mine
	</strong>
	</font>
	<br>
	
	The Cortez open pit gold mine commenced production in northeastern
	Nevada, USA in 1969. In 1981 the mill process was converted to a
	carbon-in-leach (CIL) plant from a standard countercurrent
	decantation Merrill-Crowe plant. In 1990 a dry grinding plant and a
	circulating fluid bed roaster were constructed for oxidation of
	refractory ores prior to processing in the CIL mill. In 1994 the
	Crescent pit, a shallow oxide portion of the South Pipeline deposit,
	was brought into production. In addition to achieving technological
	advancements in refractory ore processing, Cortez Gold Mines was the
	first Nevada gold producer to successfully employ heap leaching as a
	stand alone method of ore treatment. A new mine and mill for the Pipeline
	deposit starts production in 1997.

	<br>
	
	The Endako open pit molybdenum mine is located in central British
	Columbia, Canada and commenced production in June 1965. A plant to produce
	Ultrapure, a high grade molybdenum  disulphide additive for use in
	a wide range of special lubricants, was commissioned in 1980. The
	mine temporarily ceased production between 1982 and 1986 due to low
	market demand and prices, and was returned to full operations by
	October 1988.

	The Kidston open pit gold mine is located in north Queensland, Australia. Mine
	production began in 1985. Current mining is from the Wises Hill pit and, some 500
	metres to the northeast, the recently outlined Eldridge pit which will extend the
	life of the mine into the next decade. Mining of the Eldridge near surface reserve
	commenced in the North Knob area in mid 1994 and continued in 1995.

	Kiena Mine
	</strong>
	</font>
	<br>
	
	The Kiena underground gold mine located in Quebec, Canada, started production
	in 1981. Development of the lower levels of the mine was approved in
	1990 following a successful exploration program in 1989 to further
	define the extension of the ore body at depth. The development
	continued in 1995 and is expected to be completed in early 1996.

	<img src="../gfx/mussel.jpg" alt="Musselwhite Mine" align=right vspace=10 hspace=10>
	A decision was made in February 1996 to construct a gold mine at the
	Musselwhite property in northwestern Ontario, Canada, at a capital cost of
	$190 million. Development of a mine and construction of processing
	facilities started immediately in order to commence production in
	the second quarter of 1997.

	<strong>
	Osborne Mine
	</strong>
	</font>
	<br>
	
	The Osborne copper-gold mine is located in the state of Queensland in northeastern
	Australia. Construction of a one-million tonnes-per-year open pit and underground
	mine started in June 1994 and was completed over 11 months with one month
	allocated for commissioning. Full production commenced in August 1995 and at year
	end, copper production, recoveries and mill throughput were running ahead of plan.
	Open pit mining was completed in February 1996 and will supply ore to the mill
	until late 1996. Following the open pit mining operation, ore production will come
	from the underground operation which is now being developed. Underground mining
	will start in 1996 and continue for 10 years. Capital cost to date is $120 million
	and $50 million remains to be spent on underground development.
	<p>
	
	<strong>
	Ownership Interest
	</strong><br>
	75.4%
	<p>

	<strong>
	Location
	</strong><br>
	North-central Queensland, Australia. About 195 kilometres southeast of the inland
	city of Mt. Isa, and 720 kilometres west-southwest of the coastal city of
	Townsville.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Capital Costs
	</strong><br>
	The construction cost estimate to date is $120 million and includes the cost of
	open pit mine stripping, warehouse inventory and project commissioning.
	<p>


	<strong>
	Production
	</strong><br>
	Production in 1995 was 15,180 tonnes (33,466,000 pounds) of copper and 17,428
	ounces of gold. Total production is estimated to be 324,000 tonnes (715 million
	pounds) of copper and 416,000 ounces of gold over the original 11.5 year mine
	life.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Production Costs
	</strong><br>
	(including royalties): The 1995 cash cost was $0.41 per pound of copper and the
	total cost was $0.70 per pound of copper. The average cash cost over the original
	life of the mine is estimated to be $0.63 per pound of copper and the average
	total cost is estimated to be $0.81. Copper production costs are calculated by
	subtracting gold credits from operating costs.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Processing Plant
	</strong><br>
	The treatment plant includes a small gyratory crusher, a secondary cone crusher, a
	rod mill/ball mill grinding circuit, a copper flotation circuit and a circuit for
	additional gold recovery by pyrite/gold flotation and leach/carbon-in-pulp
	processing. Mill throughput in 1995 was 2,400 tonnes per day and for 1996, is
	estimated at 2,700 tonnes per day.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Ore Reserves
	</strong><br>
	The proven and probable ore reserves at December 31, 1995
	contained 319,912 tonnes (706 million pounds) of copper and 419,000 ounces of gold
	in 10,832,000 tonnes of ore grading 2.956% copper and 1.2 g/t gold.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Mine Life 
	</strong><br>
	11 years at December 31, 1995.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Mining Method
	</strong><br>
	Open pit and underground
	<p>

	<strong>
	Mineralization
	</strong><br>
	At December 31, 1995 the measured and indicated
	mineralization contained 7,454 tonnes (16 million pounds) of copper and 9,000
	ounces of gold in 475,000 tonnes of material grading 1.570% copper and 0.6 g/t
	gold.

	<strong>
	Zald&#237;var Mine
	</strong>
	</font>
	<br>
	
	The Zald&#237;var open pit copper mine is located in northern Chile.
	Construction of the processing plant was completed on schedule in
	May 1995 and the first cathodes were produced in June. Commissioning
	of the plant began in June and commercial production was delayed
	from August to November 1995 due to required modifications to some
	process equipment. The capital cost of the project was within budget
	at approximately $600 million.


	<p>
	
	<strong>
	Ownership Interest
	</strong><br>
	50%
	<p>

	<strong>
	Location
	</strong><br>
	Northern Chile. Approximately 1,400 kilometres north of Santiago and 175
	kilometres southeast of Antofagasta.

	<p>

	<strong>
	Production
	</strong><br>
	Production in 1995 was 19,914 tonnes (43,904,000 pounds) of cathode
	copper. Copper production is estimated to be 2.0 million tonnes
	(4,400 million pounds) of cathode copper over the 20-year mine life.

	<p>

	<strong>
	Production Costs
	</strong><br>
	The 1995 cash cost was $0.72 per pound of copper and the total cost
	was $1.01 per pound of copper. Over the 22 year mine life, the
	average cash cost is expected to be $0.49 per pound of copper and
	the average total cost is expected to be $0.67 per pound of copper.

	<p>

	<strong>
	Processing Plant
	</strong><br>
	Heap leaching followed by SX-EW is the treatment
	process for recovering copper. This process will produce readily
	saleable cathode Grade A copper.

	<p>

	<strong>
	Ore Reserves
	</strong><br>
	The proven and probable ore reserves at
	December 31, 1995 contained 2,790,436 tonnes (6,152 million pounds)
	of copper in 293,730,000 tonnes of ore grading 0.95% total
	copper and 0.34% acid soluble copper. Total copper comprises
	acid soluble (oxide) copper plus sulphide copper. The acid soluble
	copper or extent of oxidation determines upon which heap leach pile
	the ore will be treated.

	<p>

	<strong>
	Mine Life 
	</strong><br>
	Twenty years at December 31, 1995. Mining will be completed in year 20
	and leaching operations will continue for an additional two years.

	<p>

	<strong>
	Mining Method
	</strong><br>
	Open pit
	<p>

	<strong>
	Mineralization
	</strong><br>
	The measured and indicated mineralization
	contained 1,277,172 tonnes (2,816 million pounds) of copper in
	311,505,000 tonnes of material grading 0.41% total
	copper and 0.11% acid soluble copper.

	<dt><strong>Carat:</strong>
	<dd>In the jewelry business, the fineness of gold is expressed in
	karats, also spelled carats. Twenty-four karat corresponds to "fine"
	or pure gold, while 18 karats indicates an alloy consisting of 18
	parts pure gold and six parts other metal, often copper or silver.
	In North America, items of jewelry can come in 24K, 22K, 18K, 14K,
	9K and even 1K fineness. Karat is not to be confused with the carat
	used as a unit of gemstone weight (0.2 gram), as in a 5 carat
	diamond (1 gram), or with the vegetable, spelled carrot.

	<dt><strong>Carbonaceous:</strong>
	<dd>Containing carbon or coal, especially shale or other rock
	containing small particles of carbon distributed throughout the
	whole mass.


	<p>
	<dt><strong>Carbon-in-leach (CIL) process:</strong>
	<dd>This process is used to recover gold into activated carbon during
	the agitation leach process. The CIL system then follows the normal
	carbon-in-pulp procedures. This process is used to improve gold
	recoveries when naturally occuring carbonaceous materials are
	present in the ore which will compete for gold values and reduce
	normal gold recoveries.
	
	
	<p>
	<dt><strong>Carbon-in-pulp (CIL) process:</strong>
	<dd>This process is used to recover gold that has been dissolved
	after cyanide leach agitation. Pulp, after cyanidation, is contacted
	in a series of agitators with coarse activated carbon particles.
	Carbon is moved counter-current to the pulp, absorbing gold as it
	passes through the circuit. Loaded carbon is removed by screening
	from the first agitator. Gold is recovered from the loaded carbon by
	stripping at elevated temperature and pressure in a caustic cyanide
	solution. This high-grade solution is then passed through an
	electrolytic cell, where gold is deposited on a steel wool cathode,
	which is later smelted to produce dor&#233;.

	Placer's role in the search for Amelia Earhart

	"At 10.00 a.m. the machine was taken off, the actual take-off being satisfactory for
	a loaded machine - the run taken was approximately 850 yards."
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/amelia.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=5>

	It was July 2, 1937 at Lae, New Guinea.  The silvery Lockheed Electra, its extra fuel
	tanks brimming with gasoline, sank away over the sea, before disappearing from sight
	bound for Howland Island en route to Honolulu across the broad Pacific. With Amelia
	Earhart at the controls and navigator Fred Noonan in the aft cabin, they set off on
	the most dangerous leg of their round-the-world flight, the first attempted by a
	woman pilot. The watching pilots praised the handling of the aircraft on take-off
	with such a heavy load. It was the last they, or anyone else, would see of Lockheed
	NR16020 and its famous aviators.
	<p>

	

	"As the machine was leaving the ground the following weather reports were received at
	the Lae Wireless Station: `EARHART LAE ACCURATE FORECAST DIFFICULT ACCOUNT LACK OF
	REPORTS YOUR VICINITY. CONDITIONS APPEAR GENERALLY AVERAGE OVER ROUTE NO MAJOR STORM
	APPARENTLY PARTLY CLOUDY WITH DANGEROUS LOCAL RAIN SQUALLS ABOUT 300 MILES EAST OF
	LAE AND SCATTERED HEAVY SHOWERS REMAINDER OF ROUTE ...  -  FLEET BASE PEARL
	HARBOUR'".
	<p>

	The quoted words are from a previously unpublished report in Placer Dome's possession
	relating to Amelia Earhart's stopover in Lae, which was at that time the jumping off
	point for Placer's Bulolo gold dredging operations, just as today it is the port of
	supply for the Porgera Mine. The report was written by Eric Chater, General Manager
	of Guinea Airways at Lae, three weeks after Earhart's departure, when a U.S. Navy
	search had turned up no trace of the flyers. Earhart and Noonan and their
	twin-engined plane had vanished. Now the Bureau of Air Commerce in Washington was
	asking for help in obtaining information about Earhart's departure. They cabled
	Placer.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/documnt1.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=5>

	Bulolo, which in 1937 had been operating for five years, had been established by a
	massive airlift of dredging equipment over the mountains of New Guinea from Lae.
	Because of Bulolo, Lae was an outpost of aviation, served by Guinea Airways. That
	is why W.T. Miller of the Bureau of Air Commerce made a request to Frank Griffin
	of Placer Management Limited in San Francisco for "information of interest
	relative to Miss Earhart's visit and flight... for Government official record
	purposes." Griffin cabled Chater, who replied by telegram and followed up with an
	eight-page letter. 	
	<p>

	The original letter, carefully typed on Guinea Airways Limited notepaper, has been
	found, with the telegrams that requested it, in a file of correspondence marked
	"Bulolo Gold Dredging, Ltd./ Amelia Earhart" in Placer Dome's basement storage in
	Vancouver.
	<p>

	The disappearance of Earhart and Noonan has become one of aviation history's great
	enigmas, embroidered with fanciful theories about their fate and the subject of at
	least 30 books. The circumstances of their disappearance remain the most intensively
	researched mystery in aviation.
	<p>

	Today, foremost among the researchers is The International Group for Historic
	Aircraft Recovery (TIGHAR), who in a 1989 search of a remote Pacific island thought
	to have been Earhart's last landfall, discovered an aluminum navigator's bookcase
	consistent with the type that would have been aboard Earhart's plane.  In March 1992
	TIGHAR announced that after another sand-sifting search on the same island, it had
	found a piece of aluminum sheet likely to have been part of the underside of the
	Lockheed, as well as remains of a shoe and a medicine bottle cap which may have been
	Earhart's.
	<p>



	Placer Dome contacted TIGHAR in December 1991 about the Earhart file in the Company's
	storage and received the following reply from Richard Gillespie, Executive Director
	of the organization based in Wilmington, Delaware.
	<p>

	"This (Chater's report to the Bureau of Air Commerce) is an important, and as far as
	we know unpublished, piece of historical documentation which sheds important new
	light on the Earhart disappearance. Of particular interest are confirmation of the
	fuel load carried, and the fact that Earhart made an unsuccessful attempt to test her
	radio direction finder prior to that flight. Many other details contained in the
	report fill in gaps in our understanding of just what happened and why. Your
	vigilance and awareness in bringing forth this document is to be commended and we
	greatly appreciate Placer Dome's generosity in making it available to TIGHAR."
	<p>

	At a time when aircraft exploits gripped the popular imagination the way space travel
	would do to a later generation, Amelia Earhart was the first woman to attempt to fly
	around the world and the first person to try to do so around the equator. She was
	already the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean and she held other
	aviation records. On radio, on movie newsreels and in the Herald Tribune, to which
	she sent dispatches of her progress, people around the world followed the stages of
	her journey with the same sense of history-in-the-making as attended Neil Armstrong's
	Apollo mission to the moon.
	<p>

	Starting at Oakland, California, she headed to Miami, Florida, where she announced
	she was making an around-the-world attempt and prepared her plane for the journey.
	She took off on June 1, 1937 bound for South America. During June she travelled
	eastward in stages, to Africa, India, Java, the top end of Australia, and landed at
	Lae on June 29. Earhart planned to refuel at Howland Island, fly on to Hawaii and
	then to arrive in Oakland from Honolulu to complete her circumnavigation on the
	Fourth of July. It was not to be.
	<p>

	<img src="../gfx/documnt2.jpg" align=right vspace=3 hspace=5>



	Her navigator, Fred Noonan, who had pioneered Pan American Airways routes across the
	Pacific Ocean, was acknowledged as one of the best aviation navigators of his day.
	But according to a reconstruction of the flight from Lae by TIGHAR, it was a
	combination of navigation and wireless problems that caused their disappearance.
	<p>

	Howland Island is on the equator, a speck of land in the immensity of the Pacific
	Ocean. It is 2,500 miles from Lae and over half way to Honolulu, making it an ideal
	refuelling point. As confirmed in Placer's document, Earhart had 1,100 U.S. gallons
	of fuel aboard. The flight to Howland Island was estimated to take about 18 hours and
	Earhart had fuel aboard for about 25 hours flying, a safe margin. But navigating that
	distance across trackless ocean to make a landfall was like trying to sink a 100-mile
	putt. There was little margin for error. This was the first over-water part of the
	trip that did not involve approaching a large land mass.
	<p>

	The first third of the flight went as planned and, as Placer's report bears out,
	communication with New Guinea was normal. According to the report:
	<p>

	"Arrangements had been made between the plane and Lae station to call at 18 minutes
	past each hour and arrangements made to pass any late weather information, but local
	interference prevented signals from the plane being intelligible until 2.18 p.m. The
	Lae operator heard the following on 6210KC - `HEIGHT 7,000 FEET SPEED 140 KNOTS' and
	some remark concerning `LAE' then `EVERYTHING OKAY'. The plane was called and asked
	to repeat position but we still could not get it. The next report was received at
	3.19 p.m. on 6210KC - `HEIGHT 10,000 FEET POSITION 150.7 EAST 7.3 SOUTH CUMULUS
	CLOUDS EVERYTHING OKAY'. The next report received at 5.18 p.m. `POSITION 4.33 SOUTH
	159.7 EAST HEIGHT 8,000 FEET OVER CUMULUS CLOUDS WIND 23 KNOTS'"
	<p>

	That was the last Lae heard of Amelia Earhart. But she was on course for Howland.
	That night a radio station on the island of Nauru heard her, and a crewman standing
	watch aboard a freighter putting in to port at Nauru heard the plane pass overhead.
	The final exchange of signals before the disappearance took place between Earhart and
	the U.S. Coastguard cutter Itasca, standing by off Howland Island to provide radio
	signals so that Earhart could use her radio direction finder to locate the island,
	and then to chase the birds off the runway when it came time for her to land.
	<p>

	The last signal heard by Itasca was "WE ARE ON LINE 157 337. WILL REPEAT MESSAGE. WE
	WILL REPEAT NORTH AND SOUTH THIS ON 6210 KILOCYCLES. WE ARE RUNNING ON LINE.
	LISTENING 6210 KILOCYCLES."
	<p>

	In air navigation terminology, "running on line" describes the accepted procedure for
	finding a destination when a pinpoint landfall has not been made. Earhart flew the
	Lockheed on a north-south line that ran through the Howland Island destination. She
	and her navigator did not know whether they were north or south of Howland Island, so
	they would run up and down the line until they found it. If they were north of
	Howland and they ran south they would see it; but if they were south of Howland and
	turned south they would miss it. The TIGHAR reconstruction speculates that,
	tragically, within only a 100-mile radius of Howland Island, they turned south
	instead of north, and because they were already south of the island missed it, and
	ran out of fuel before they could retrace the line northward.
	<p>

	In the report in Placer Dome's possession, Eric Chater concludes: "Miss Earhart and
	Captain Noonan spent a considerable time in the radio office and as previously
	mentioned it was learned that neither of them could read morse at any speed but could
	only distinguish letters made individually slowly and repeated often; in that case
	their direction finding apparatus would be useless or misleading unless they were
	taking a bearing on a station using a radiophone which could give the station
	position on voice. We understand the Itasca was to do this but if the plane was
	unable to pick up the Itasca it is doubtful if the direction finder would be any use
	to her."
	<p>

	In its editions of Saturday, July 3, 1937, the San Francisco Chronicle reported: "In
	what is surely one of the loneliest spots in this world, tousle-haired Amelia
	Earhart, America's first lady of the air, last night was down on a shark-infested
	ocean in a big, graceful airplane rendered useless by lack of gasoline."
	<p>

	A search fleet of seven U.S. ships, assisted by aircraft, failed to locate any trace
	of the Lockheed or crew. Adding further poignancy to the disappearance were reports
	of distress signals being heard with the Lockheed's call sign for three days after
	the disappearance. For the aircraft to have operated its transmitter, it would have
	had to run its starboard engine equipped with the generator. This means the plane
	would have had to have been on land in a wheels-down position for the propeller to
	turn.
	<p>

	Based on searches of Earhart's likely landfall, TIGHAR speculates that the plane
	ditched at Gardner Island, now called Nikumaroro and part of the Republic of
	Kiribati, south of Howland Island and on the same line of bearing as Howland. Earhart
	probably set the plane down on a flat beach area while the tide was out. With the
	tides, the Lockheed was floated and swept progressively over the edge of the coral
	reef into deep water offshore. No one knows for sure, 55 years later, what happened
	to the plane, or its brave aviators.
	<p>

	<strong>
	"STAY TUNED"
	</strong>
	</font>
	<p>

	In today's world of the Internet, global TV, cellular phones and satellite navigation, it is hard
	to imagine the rudimentary nature of morse code, wireless and radio direction finder
	used by the flyers of the 1930s to keep in touch and find their way.
	<p>

	Amelia Earhart's Lockheed had two ways of transmitting and receiving messages: morse
	code, which neither she nor her navigator Fred Noonan could read, and voice radio on
	only two frequencies. Unlike the VHF (Very High Frequency) and UHF (Ultra High
	Frequency) signals used in aviation today, Earhart's transmissions were "bounced" off
	the ionosphere, making them susceptible to variables such as day and night, weather
	and sunspot activity. Hence the difficulty of keeping in touch. In the last hours
	before her disappearance, guidance from the ground was inadequate because either she
	could not hear the ground station, or they could not hear her.
	<p>

	The navigation technique for finding a tiny island on a large ocean was to use
	celestial navigation (working out a position from the sun or the stars) and using
	radio direction finding for the final run-in. Celestial navigation requires precise
	timekeeping because the sun and stars change position with the passage of time.
	Navigators' clocks had to be set at the correct time before departure and for this
	they depended on radio time signals.
	<p>

	The report in Placer Dome's possession describes how Earhart and Noonan's departure
	from Lae was delayed one day while they listened for a radio time signal, eventually
	from Adelaide, South Australia, to set the four clocks they had on board. Next
	morning they checked their clocks again, this time on an 8 a.m. signal from Saigon,
	and "expressed their complete satisfaction and decided to leave at 10 a.m."
	<p>

	The 10 a.m. take-off was carefully set to minimize the confusion involved in crossing
	not only two and a half time zones to get to Howland Island but the international
	dateline as well. Ten a.m. July 2 in Lae was 00.00 Greenwich Mean Time, so the
	flight's elapsed time would correspond to the GMT hour. Earhart and Noonan lost
	contact with ground stations at 20 hours and 15 minutes into the flight, which means
	it was 20.15 GMT, or 8.45 a.m. July 2 at Howland Island.
	<p>

	The radio direction finder navigation technique was based on a loop antenna fixed
	above the Lockheed's cockpit. Upon receiving a signal from the ground station, the
	pilot would slowly rotate the antenna. Because of its circular shape, a pronounced
	fade in the signal, known as a "null", would be heard by the pilot when the loop was
	oriented edgewise to the source of the signal. The loop was geared to a compass rose
	in the cockpit. When the pilot "got a minimum" (i.e. the "null") the pointer on the
	compass gave a relative bearing to the station.
	<p>

	The Placer Dome document reveals that when Earhart was at Lae, she carried out a
	30-minute air test of the direction finder. The Lae operator was requested by voice
	to send a long dash while Earhart "endeavoured to get a minimum" on her direction
	finder. "On landing Miss Earhart informed us that she had been unable to obtain a
	minimum and that she considered this was because the Lae station was too powerful and
	too close," wrote Eric Chater in the report.
	<p>

	In the critical final hours of her flight near Howland Island, one of Earhart's last
	messages said she was "unable to get a minimum". The ground station's direction
	finder could not home in on Earhart's frequency. This time it was not a test, with
	tragic results.

    <h2>Placer Dome achieves 91% ownership of Highlands Gold</h2>
	
    <strong>February 7, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc., in its A$0.75 per share bid for
     Highlands Gold Limited, has taken its holding in Highlands to more
     than 91%.  This includes a small proportion of legally binding
     undertakings to tender to the offer.  Once the undertakings are
     converted to formal acceptances, Placer Dome will be entitled to move
     to compulsory acquisition.
<p>
            Placer Dome has agreed to extend its offer to allow
     shareholders with small holdings to accept the offer.  The extension
     will also allow people who have purchased Highlands shares this week
     to accept the offer.
<p>
            "Placer Dome is extremely pleased with the outcome of the
     offer," John Willson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said.
     Highlands Gold owns 25% of the Porgera Mine in Papua New Guinea.  The
     offer is now scheduled to close on Saturday, February 15, 1997.

    <h2>Agreement signed for Las Cristinas Mine</h2>
	
    <strong>February 6, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces that Placer Dome Latin
     America and Corporacion Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) signed the
     definitive shareholders' agreement and reached accord on terms for
     construction of the mine and power line required to develop the Las
     Cristinas project in Venezuela.
<p>
            Elias Ynaty, President of CVG and William M. Hayes, President
     of Placer Dome Latin America, signed the shareholders' agreement in
     Caracas today and expressed confidence in the success of the project,
     estimated to cost US$576 million.
<p>
            Mr. Ynaty said: "I reiterate my faith that this will be one of
     the most important mines in the world.  We have begun the process to
     obtain the exoneration of the wholesale tax, as well as to obtain the
     rest of the permits from government agencies, in order to initiate the
     construction of this important project."
<p>
            Mr. Hayes said the signing of the agreement, and accord on the
     power line and mine construction contracts, will facilitate obtaining
     financing for the project for the joint venture company, Minera Las
     Cristinas, C.A. (Minca) (PDG 70% interest).
<p>
            In terms of the date to initiate construction, Mr. Hayes said
     that this will hinge on the granting of the environmental permits and
     especially the wholesale tax exoneration.  On the latter he expressed
     optimism, saying, "We trust that the Economic Cabinet of the
     Venezuelan Government will recognize the importance that the
     exoneration will have for the development of the mining sector during
     the pre-operations phase, which will allow us to rehire Minca
     personnel as well as to generate approximately 2,500 direct jobs
     during the construction of the mine."

    <h2>Placer Dome restructures Detour Lake Mine</h2>
	
    <strong>February 4, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces it is taking steps to
     return its Detour Lake Mine in Canada to profitability.  As part of a
     restructuring programme, 103 of 347 active employees are being laid
     off effective February 12, 1997.
<p>
        Cash production costs averaged US$401/oz. in 1996, primarily due to
     a change in continuity of the main ore zone which reduced underground
     production rates.  In addition to returning the mine to profitability,
     reduced production costs are also expected to increase the viability
     of the prospective QK Zone of mineralization, currently being
     explored.  An accelerated exploration programme on the QK Zone is due
     to be completed by mid-1997.
<p>
        Detour Lake's forecast gold production in 1997 is expected to be
     reduced to 117,000 ozs. from 147,000 ozs., with negligible impact on
     Placer Dome's target of 2.3 million ozs. for the year.

    <h2>Placer Dome welcomes favourable report on Placer Pacific</h2>
	
    <strong>February 4, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> -  Placer Dome Inc. today welcomed a favourable
     independent expert's conclusion and an intended recommendation by the
     independent Directors, released by Placer Pacific Limited.  Placer
     Dome has launched a takeover bid for the 24.6% publicly owned shares
     of Placer Pacific.
<p>
            The independent expert's report, compiled by Grant Samuel &
     Associates, found Placer Dome's offer of one Placer Dome share for 15
     Placer Pacific shares to be "fair and reasonable" and that "the
     Directors of Placer Pacific would be justified in recommending to
     shareholders that they accept the offer."
<p>
            "We are pleased with the independent expert's conclusion and
     the intended recommendation from the independent Directors," John
     Willson, Placer Dome's President and Chief Executive Officer, said.
     "This report confirms the fairness of our offer to Placer Pacific
     shareholders.  We look forward to the Placer Pacific Board meeting to
     finalize their response."
<p>
            Placer Dome dispatched its offer documents on January 24, 1997.
      The offer is scheduled to close on February 25, 1997. However, Placer
     Pacific has requested that Placer Dome extend its offer to accommodate
     printing and dispatch of Placer Pacific's response document.  Placer
     Dome is considering a short extension of the offer.

    <h2>Placer Dome welcomes acceptance by Highlands Gold</h2>
	
    <strong>January 23, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. welcomes the announcement made
     today by Highlands Gold Limited that its Directors strongly recommend
     acceptance of Placer Dome's A$0.75 per share offer for all of the
     shares of Highlands Gold.  Highlands Directors have indicated that
     they will accept the offer for their own holdings.
    <p>
        Placer Dome looks forward to pursuing the proposed spin-off of
     Highlands Pacific Limited from Highlands Gold (see attached
     information) for the benefit of shareholders who have accepted the
     offer and those who plan to accept the offer.
    <p>
        "This deal satisfies everyone," John Willson, President and CEO,
     said.  "Highlands shareholders now have no reason not to follow their
     Directors' recommendation to accept our offer."  Placer Dome is
     entitled to 61.7% of Highlands Gold and has received undertakings to
     accept its offer from Papua New Guinea institutions which hold a
     further 12.3%.  Placer Dome has agreed to extend its offer to
     Saturday, February 8, 1997.

     <h3>From Highlands Gold:</H3>
    
     <strong>Highlands and Placer agree to terms of restructuring</strong><p>
     <strong>Placer's offer extended to February 8, 1997</strong><p>
     <strong>Highlands board recommends Placer's offer</strong><p>
   <p>
   <strong>January 23, 1997</strong>
   <p>
        Highlands Gold and Placer today announced that they have reached
     agreement on the terms of a restructuring of Highlands Gold, including
     the formation of a new company, Highlands Pacific Limited, which is to
     hold the non-Porgera assets of Highlands Gold.
 <p>
        Under the revised proposal, which has Placer's full support, all
     Highlands Gold shareholders who accept Placer's offer will receive for
     each Highlands Gold share held $0.75 in cash, and it is proposed that
     they will participate in a renounceable entitlements issue to acquire
     shares in Highlands Pacific.  The precise terms of the proposed issue
     are yet to be determined.  It is proposed that shareholders who have
     already accepted Placer's offer also receive the entitlements to
     acquire Highlands Pacific shares.
 <p>
        It is intended that the restructuring will be effected at the
     conclusion of Placer's offer (now scheduled to close on 8 February
     1997) and will incorporate the following key features:
 <p>
     <li>Highlands Pacific will acquire the non-Porgera assets of
     Highlands Gold for a cash payment of approximately A$107 million
     (subject to balance day adjustments).  As a result, Placer's net
     acquisition cost for Highlands Gold 25% interest in Porgera (including
     the receivable from Orogen Minerals) will be approximately A$316
     million, equivalent to the top end of Baring's valuation range in its
     independent expert's report;
<p>
     <li>To finance the acquisition of the non-Porgera assets and to
     provide working capital of approximately A$50 million, Highlands
     Pacific will raise approximately A$190 million through an underwritten
     equity raising.  A consortium of Papua New Guinea financial
     institutions have committed to subscribe for up to A$110 million, and
     are expected collectively to have an interest of not less than 50% in
     Highlands Pacific at the conclusion of the equity raising; and
<p>
     <li>The proposed underwriters are Merrill Lynch (Australia) and
     Wilson HTM Corporate Services.
<p>
     <li>The proposed entitlement issue is subject to a number of conditions
     including the restructuring not requiring the approval of Highlands
     Gold shareholders, negotiation of detailed documentation to give
     effect to the restructure, entry into an Underwriting Agreement and
     compliance with a specified timetable.
<p>
     <li>The Board of Highlands Gold believes that this restructuring
     proposal, which has Placer's full support, is in the interests of
     Highlands Gold shareholders and accordingly strongly recommends that
     shareholders ACCEPT Placer's offer as the Directors of Highlands
     intend to do in respect of their own shareholdings.
<p>
     <li>In making their recommendation, the Highlands Gold Board point out
     that if the conditions attaching to the restructuring proposal are not
     satisfied or waived by Placer, then the proposed issue by Highlands
     Pacific may not proceed.
<p>
     <li>To reflect Placer's position as controlling shareholder of
     Highlands Gold, Ian Goddard, Geoff Applegate and Bill Hodgson have
     agreed to resign from Highlands Gold Board and will be replaced by
     three Placer-appointed Directors, Dick Zandee, Russell Barwick and Mel
     Togolo.  Clive Hildebrand and Sir Henry ToRobert have agreed to remain
     on the Board to represent the interests of minority shareholders.
<p>
     <li>Highlands Gold Managing Director, Ian Goddard, said today, "The
     restructuring proposal agreed with Placer represents a better outcome
     for Highlands shareholders who accept the offer as they will receive
     A$0.75 per share AND the possibility of participating in the
     development of Highlands' world class advanced base metal projects and
     Highlands' extensive exploration portfolio."
    <p>

     <strong>From Hon. C. Haiveta, Papua New Guinea:</strong>
 <p>
        The Deputy Prime Minister, Mr. Chris Haivets today congratulated
     Placer Dome Inc. and Highlands Gold on the resolution of the
     outstanding matters relating to the takeover of Highlands Gold by
     Placer Dome.  Mr. Haiveta said that the agreement allows each Highland
     shareholder who accepts the current offer by Placer to receive 75
     cents, plus a right to purchase a share in Highlands Pacific, the
     company that will eventually hold the non-Porgera assets.  These
     rights should be valuable and give the Highland's shareholders more
     than the original Placer offer.
 <p>
     Mr. Haiveta said:<br>
     "The agreements between Placer and Highlands Gold, in co-operation
     with the PNG institutions, to allow the non-Porgera assets held by
     Highlands to be sold to Highlands Pacific is to be commended.  The
     restrucuture proposed by the parties will allow the orderly
     underwriting and placement of shares in the newly formed company and
     at the same time ensures that these non-Porgera assets will be dealt
     with on a timely basis.  The Government supports the proposed
     restructure.
 <p>
     "This deal was brokered by the PNG institutions and the underwriters
     McIntosh & Wilsons.  They have managed to satisfy the demands of
     diverse interests, including the State's legitimate interest in seeing
     that the non-Porgera assets currently owned by Highlands are given
     every oppportunity of being developed.  They have done a wonderful
     job."
 <p>
     Hon. C. Haiveta<br>
     Deputy Prime Minister &  Minister for Finance<br>
     Port Moresby<br>

    <h2>Placer Dome extends offer for Highlands Gold</h2>
	
    <strong>January 17, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. has been approached by a number
     of shareholders of Highlands Gold Limited seeking an extension of
     Placer Dome's A$0.75 per share offer for Highlands Gold to enable them
     to accept.
    <p>
        Placer Dome has agreed to extend the offer by one week.  It is now
     scheduled to close at 7.00 p.m. (Sydney, Australia, time) on Saturday,
     January 25, 1997.  Placer Dome's offer has been declared final and,
     therefore by law, cannot be increased.
    <p>
        At the close of business in Australia today, Placer Dome held more
     than 58% of Highlands Gold.  "We have received a high level of
     acceptances and are happy with the outcome of our offer," John
     Willson, President and CEO, said.  "To ensure all shareholders who
     have decided to accept the offer have the opportunity to do so, we
     have decided to extend for one week."

    <h2>Placer Dome's offer for Highlands to close on Saturday</h2>
	
    <strong>January 14, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Highlands Gold Limited 
     shareholders have three days left to accept Placer Dome Inc's 
     A$0.75-a-share takeover offer. The offer is scheduled to close on 
     Saturday 18 January.
    <p>
        "Obviously many Highlands shareholders like our 75 
        cents-a-share offer," Placer Dome Inc. President and Chief 
        Executive Officer Mr. John Willson said.  "We are encouraged 
        by the strong level of acceptances we have received, both from 
        small shareholders and institutions.
<p>
        "While the Highlands' board has stopped short of recommending 
        Placer Dome's offer to its shareholders, it has warned 
        shareholders that Highlands' shares could trade below the 
        offer price when the bid closes.
<p>
        "The Highlands' board has also advised shareholders with small 
        unmarketable parcels that they may find the cash offer 
        attractive," he said.
<p>
        Mr. Willson also said Placer Dome could not understand why 
        Highlands is pursuing a restructuring that the market has 
        rejected.
<p>
        "The failed underwriting was trying to float Highlands' 
        non-gold assets at about A$200 million.  On the basis of our 
        now withdrawn offer to buy the Porgera assets for A$316 
        million, Placer Dome's A$0.75-a-share offer values these same 
        assets at A$143 million.
<p>
        "Looking at market values rather than theoretical valuations 
        contained in the independent expert's report, Placer Dome 
        believes its offer for Highlands Gold shares is demonstrably 
        fair and reasonable,"
     Mr. Willson said.

    <h2>Placer Dome proposes merger with Bre-X Minerals</h2>
	
    <strong>January 14, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces 
     it has presented a proposal to Bre-X Minerals Ltd. for Placer 
     Dome to merge with Bre-X, and for Placer Dome to take the lead in 
     developing the Busang gold property in Kalimantan.
    <p>
        "We understand Indonesia's interest in the development of 
        Busang and believe that a combination of Bre-X and Placer Dome 
        will best serve that interest," said John Willson, President 
        and Chief Executive Officer.  "We are experienced in building 
        mines like Busang and have the financial strength to fund 
        construction."
    <p>
        He added: "Our proposal provides for significant Indonesian 
        ownership of this world-class deposit, as well as an 
        opportunity for Bre-X shareholders to obtain attractive value, 
        plus continuing participation in Busang.  It also provides 
        further growth for Placer Dome."
    <p>
        The proposal is contained in the attached letter from John 
        Willson to David Walsh, President and Chief Executive Officer 
        of Bre-X Minerals.  The proposal provides:
    <p>
     <li>Indonesian participation of up to a 40% equity interest in the 
     project; 
     <li>A stock-for-stock "merger of equals" between Bre-X and 
     Placer Dome; 
     <li>Staged construction of a mine and plant of up to 
     200,000 tonnes per day costing up to US$1.7 billion, to start 
     gold production in 1999. Depending on the ultimate optimum scale, 
     production would average 3 to 4 million ounces per year.
    <p>
     Placer Dome's proposal would be subject to negotiation with 
     Bre-X and the Indonesian Government, customary due diligence 
     procedures, issuance of a suitable Contract of Work, 
     satisfactory resolution of ownership issues, and regulatory 
     and shareholder approvals.

    <h2>Placer Dome disappointed as underwriting fails -
        offer for Highlands declared final</h2>
	
    <strong>January 10, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>


     Vancouver, Canada - Placer Dome Inc. has been advised by Highlands
     Gold Limited that the proposed underwriting of Highlands Pacific
     Limited has not been concluded.  The proposed underwriting was
     designed to support a A$160 million raising of capital at A$0.30 per
     share, necessary to enable Highlands Gold's proposed restructuring.
    <p>
        Placer Dome had offered to buy Porgera for A$316.1 million (US$250
     million), or A$0.56 per Highlands share, provided that a A$160 million
     underwriting was secured for the non-Porgera assets.  Placer Dome's
     conditional offer to buy Porgera has now been withdrawn.
    <p>
        "We are disappointed that this underwriting failed, but we remain
     committed to our A$0.75 a share offer for Highlands," Placer Dome
     President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Willson said.
    <p>
        "Placer Dome's offer price for Highlands for A$0.75 is final.
     There will be no increase," Mr. Willson declared.
    <p>
       The cash offer is scheduled to remain open until January 18, 1997.

    <h2>Placer Dome indicates agreement in principle to Highlands Gold proposal, 
        providing underwriting is secured</h2>
	
    <strong>January 6, 1997</strong>
    
    <p>


	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. said today it is prepared to 
     enter into an agreement with Highlands Gold Limited, a Papua New 
     Guinea company, to acquire Highlands' 25% interest in the Porgera 
     Mine, subject to conditions.
    <p>
        The proposal by Highlands Gold would enable Placer Dome to acquire the 25% 
        stake and related assets for A$316 million (US$250 million) effective 
        December 31, 1996.  The price is equivalent to the high point of a valuation 
        prepared by Baring Brothers Burrows & Co., an independent expert in 
        Australia, for those assets.  The purchase price would be adjusted for any 
        other assets, costs or liabilities being assumed by Placer Dome. <p> 
        Placer Dome is prepared to enter into an implementation agreement provided 
        that:<br> 
        <li>Highlands Gold concludes an acceptable underwriting agreement by Friday, 
        January 10, 1997 to raise at least A$160 million (US$126 million) for the new 
        company required to be formed under its proposal. 
        <li>This new entity, Highlands Pacific Limited, would own the Ramu and 
        Frieda-Nena projects in Papua New Guinea and other Highlands' exploration 
        assets. 
        <li>All necessary approvals and tax rulings are received from the Government 
        of Papua New Guinea.
        <p>
        Meanwhile, Placer Dome's A$0.75 per share cash offer for all of the      
        shares of Highlands Gold is scheduled to close on January 18, 1997.  Placer 
        Dome subsidiaries currently own more than 46% of Highlands Gold.
        <p>
        Highlands Gold's announcement on this matter is attached for 
        information.

		<p>
		<h3>From the offices of Highlands Gold Limited</h3>
		
		<p>
		
		The Directors of Highlands Gold announced today that they have 
		received Placer Dome's agreement in principle to Highlands' 
		restructuring proposal, subject to a satisfactory underwriting for 
		A$160 million.
		<p>
		Under Highlands' proposal, all of Highlands Gold's assets other than 
		its 25% interest in Porgera (and the receivable from Orogen Minerals) 
		are to be transferred to a new company, Highlands Pacific Limited, in 
		return for the issue to Highlands Gold of 564.5 million shares (the 
		same number of shares in Highlands Gold).
		<p>
		By way of scheme of management, all of the shares in Highlands Gold 
		held by shareholders other than Placer in completion of Placer's 
		takeover offer will be cancelled. In exchange, those shareholders will 
		recive a capital return, planned to be A$0.65 cents cash per share, and 
		one share in Highlands Pacific, for each share held in Highlands Gold.
		<p>
		Following this cancellation, Placer will own all to the remaining 
		share capital of Highlands Gold and, therefore, will acquire full 
		ownership of Highlands' 25% interest in Porgera.
		<p>
		Placer has agreed to an acquisition price for Highlands' 25% interest 
		in Porgera (and Orogen receivable) of A$316.1 million subject to 
		settlement adjustments (including related borrowing which Placer would 
		assume) in Highlands Gold.
		<p>
		It is proposed that the shareholding entitlement in Highlands Pacific 
		otherwise attributable to Placer will be placed, and that Highlands 
		Pacific will also raise new capital to secure funding for the final 
		feasibility study on Ramu, further work on Frieda-Nena and the ongoing 
		exploration programme.
		<p>
		It is planned that the total equity raising will be at least A$160 
		million at an issue price of A$0.30 per share. It is intended to 
		provide priority to Highlands Gold shareholders in the capital 
		raising.
		<p>
		The underwriting arrangements proposed are subject to completion by 
		Friday, January 10, 1997.
		<p>
		Placer will pay to Highlands Gold sufficient funds to meet the A$0.65 
		capital return to shareholders who have not accepted the Placer offer. 
		This amount, together with funds already expended by Placer on 
		Highlands shares previously acquired and as acceptances to its 
		takeover offer, will be offset by the placement of its attributable 
		shareholding in Highlands Pacific, to reduce its net cost to A$316.1 
		million.
		<p>
		"We are pleased that Placer has accepted our offer," Highlands 
		Managing Director Mr Ian Goddard said.
		<p>
		"There has been strong institutional interest in our proposal, which 
		unlocks the value of Ramu, Frieda-Nena and Highlands' extensive 
		exploration interests. We are looking forward to finalising the 
		underwriting by the end of the week," he went on to say.
		<p>
		The scheme of arrangement under Section 192 of the PNG Companies Act 
		would be subject to approval by Highlands Gold shareholders and PNG 
		regulatory authorities. It is planned that the scheme would become 
		effective once it is approved by the National Court of Papua New 
		Guinea in late February.

    <h2>Placer Dome ownership of Highlands Gold breaks through 40%</h2>
	
    <strong>December 30, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>


	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> -  Placer Dome Inc. has received acceptances taking
     its shareholding in Highlands Gold Limited to 40.8%.  The A$0.75 a
     share takeover offer for Highlands Gold will close on Saturday,
     January 18, 1997.
	<p>
        "We are pleased that Highlands Gold shareholders have seen the
     value in our offer and have rushed to accept," Placer Dome President
     and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Willson said.
	<p>
        "This highly encouraging response, coupled with the fact that we
     picked up 33.3% of the company in a matter of hours when we first
     launched our offer on market, sends a clear message that our offer is
     attractive.
<p>
        "We hope that Highlands shareholders will continue to see our offer
     as attractive, particularly in the light of our reduced five business
     day cash settlement period."

    <h2>Placer Dome offers to cancel shares in Highlands Gold in return for 25% of Porgera Mine</h2>
	
    <strong>December 23, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>


	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. has made an in-principle offer to
     Highlands Gold Limited to cancel its Highlands Gold stake in return
     for 25% of the Porgera Mine.  Any difference would be settled in cash.
    <p>
        Placer Dome President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John
     Willson, said the proposal was made in direct response to the Barings'
     valuation released by Highlands Gold yesterday.
    <p>
        "I see this as the only solution possible to deliver Highlands Gold
     shareholders the value that their independent expert believes is in
     Frieda-Nena, Ramu and the exploration assets.  Placer Dome cannot
     accept these valuations and is unable to justify any increase in its
     takeover offer, let alone the A$0.21 necessary to bring the offer into
     Barings' valuation range," Mr. Willson said.
    <p>
        "The Barings valuation of Highlands' 25% interest in Porgera is
     inconsistent with the valuation Barings completed just 18 months ago.
     However, we are prepared to concede that the issue regarding valuation
     of Porgera may be bridged and are making a proposal to do so.
    <p>
        "On the other hand, the Barings valuations of Frieda-Nena and Ramu
     are beyond my comprehension.  Based on the information we have
     available, Placer Dome cannot ascribe even a fraction of Barings'
     value to these assets.  Interestingly, the former majority owner of
     Highlands Gold could find no such value either."
    <p>
        Mr. Willson said Placer Dome would be prepared to buy 25% of
     Porgera at the mid-point of the Barings valuation range, or A$276.8
     million.  It would also purchase the receivable from the Papua New
     Guinea government relating to Porgera on the same terms.  A copy of
     Mr. Willson's letter to Mr. Hildebrand, Highlands' Chairman, is
     attached.
    <p>
        Mr. Willson described the proposal as a "win-win" solution.
     "Highlands Gold shareholders would get to keep the assets that
     Highlands' directors apparently value so highly but which Placer Dome
     cannot agree to pay for," he said.  "Placer Dome would buy 25% of
     Porgera, an operation it knows and understands at the value ascribed
     by the independent expert.
    <p>
    "If Barings' valuations are accepted, our proposal further boosts
     the value of the remaining Highlands shares.  I believe that the
     Highlands Board and its independent expert should therefore conclude
     our proposal to be fair and reasonable."
    <p>
        Placer Dome's offer is made subject to reaching agreement on
     detailed terms with Highlands and to there being no adverse
     transaction costs or triggering of pre-emptive rights under the
     Porgera Joint Venture agreement.
    <p>
        Mr. Willson has asked Mr. Hildebrand for a reply as to whether this
     proposal is of in-principle interest by Monday, January 6, 1997 so
     that Placer Dome may withdraw or close its takeover offer for
     Highlands Gold and proceed down this new course if it is of mutual
     interest.

     <hr width=40% align=center>

    <p>
     December 23, 1996
    
    <p>
    
     Mr. Clive Hildebrand<br>
     Chairman<br>
     Highlands Gold Limited<br>
     167 Eagle Street<br>
     Brisbane, QLD 4000<br>
     Australia<br>
    <p>
     Dear Clive:
    <p>
     I have received a copy of your media release relating to the Barings
     valuation of Highlands Gold Limited and the extracts from the Barings
     report that were attached.  Obviously, I am keen to see the full
     Barings valuation and I will need to have my people review it
     thoroughly to understand the assumptions underlying it.  Whatever the
     detailed assumptions, however, I see a fundamental problem emerging.
    <p>
     The Barings valuation places a value of A$258.7 million to A$294.8
     million on Highlands' 25% of Porgera excluding the Porgera Sale
     Receivable (or A$0.458 to A$0.522 per share).  This is a surprisingly
     high valuation since Barings valued 25% of Porgera 18 months ago, in
     its role as independent valuer for Pancontinental Mining, at A$262.9
     to A$295.7 million.  Since that time, unfortunately, the gold price
     has fallen, production at Porgera has fallen, costs are higher and
     share prices of the Porgera Joint Venture partners have fallen
     sharply.  From the sensitivity analyses in the previous Barings
     valuation I would have expected their value to have fallen by many
     millions of dollars.  Nevertheless, I am prepared to concede that, in
     relation to Porgera, the value gap is not so large that it could not
     be bridged.  In fact, this letter contains a proposal to do so.
    <p>
     It is with the valuations of Highlands' other assets that I have the
     most difficulty.  As you know, Placer Dome has very little information
     on Frieda-Nena, Ramu, or your exploration assets.  Your independent
     expert is placing a value of A$289.7 million to A$358.2 million (or
     A$0.513 to A$0.635 per share) on these assets.  This is an
     extraordinary value for two greenfields projects.  Frankly, there is
     no way Placer Dome can acknowledge even a fraction of this value on
     the information we have available.  I can therefore see no way that
     Placer Dome could justify any increase in its offer for Highlands, let
     alone the A$0.21 increase necessary to bring our offer into Barings'
     valuation range.
    <p>
     Clearly, we have a fundamental problem.  There may, however, be a
     solution which gives your shareholders the value which the Highlands
     Board and its independent expert believe is there for Frieda-Nena,
     Ramu and your exploration assets on terms which Placer Dome can meet.
     Simply put, I am proposing a cancellation of Placer Dome's
     shareholding in Highlands in consideration for the 25% Porgera
     interest.  Highlands would continue as an independent entity following
     this cancellation and would keep Frieda-Nena, Ramu and its exploration
     assets.
    <p>
     The terms on which Placer Dome would be prepared to consider such a
     transaction are broadly:
    <br>
     <li>Placer Dome would agree to the effective cancellation of its
     shareholding in Highlands at a notional value of A$0.75 per share (a
     substantial concession, having regard to Barings' valuation of
     Highlands shares of A$0.96 to A$1.14 per share);

     <li>in conjunction with the cancellation, Placer Dome would purchase
     25% of Porgera for A$276.8 million, and the Porgera Sale Receivable
     for A$20.9 million, the mid-point of the Barings' valuation range; and

     <li>any difference (either way) would be settled in cash.
    <p>
     As an example, if Placer Dome had 50% of Highlands shares at the close
     of its offer it would agree to the effective cancellation of these at
     a total value of A$211.7 million.  It would purchase the 25% Porgera
     interest and the Porgera Sale Receivable for a total of A$297.7
     million and pay Highlands A$86 million in cash, representing the
     difference.
    <p>
     This example illustrates how Highlands shareholders might be
     substantially better off following our proposed transaction, providing
     the Barings' values are accepted.  Highlands would have the following
     assets (adopting the Barings' numbers for the sake of example):

     <p>
     The resulting value per share to Highlands shareholders is in fact
     higher than the current Barings' valuation range.  I believe that the
     Highlands Board and its independent expert must, therefore, conclude
     that this offer is fair and reasonable.
    <p>
     This offer is made subject to our reaching mutually agreeable detailed
     terms and entering a formal legal agreement.  Placer Dome would need
     to ensure that the transaction structure adopted would not lead to any
     onerous transaction costs and would not trigger pre-emptive rights
     under the Porgera Joint Venture agreement.  These issues, however,
     while of fundamental importance to Placer Dome, are matters of
     implementation and structure.
    <p>
     More urgently, we need to establish whether this proposal is of
     interest in-principle to the board of Highlands.  If this is the case,
     and the Highlands Board wishes to proceed with this transaction, we
     could take steps to withdraw or close our offer and proceed along the
     new path.  I would therefore ask for your reply to this letter by
     Monday, January 6, 1997.
    <p>
     I am advised that Placer Dome, having release an intentions statement
     in regard to Highlands, has an obligation to keep the market informed
     of any changes in its intentions.  I will therefore be releasing this
     letter to the market today.
    <p>
     I look forward to hearing from you.
    <p>
     Yours sincerely,
    <p>
     Placer Dome Inc.<br>
     J.M. Willson<br>
     President and Chief Executive Officer <br>

    <h2>Placer Dome forecasts higher gold production</h2>
	
    <strong>December 23, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>


	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. said today its share of gold
     production is expected to increase to about 2.3 million ozs. in 1997,
     from 1.9 million ozs. in 1996, at a cash production cost of about
     $240/oz.  The Corporation's share of gold production is expected to
     increase to an average of 3 million ozs. per year by the end of the
     decade.
    <p>
        These amounts assume completion of the proposed acquisitions of
     Highlands Gold Limited and the Placer Pacific minorities.  Without
     these, the 1997 share of production is forecast to be about 2 million
     ozs. at a cash production cost of about US$235/oz.  All these
     estimates assume the sale of the Kiena and Sigma mines in Canada by
     the end of the first quarter.
    <p>
        The Corporation's share of production from Placer Pacific mines in
     1997 is expected to be about 10% higher than in 1996 at 900,000 ozs.,
     at a cash production cost of about US$280/oz.  Cash production costs
     are expected to be higher due principally to lower ore grades at the
     Misima and Porgera mines in Papua New Guinea.
    <p>
        Gold production from United States mines in 1997 is anticipated to
     increase by about 45% to about 450,000 ozs. at a cash production cost
     of less than US$200/oz.  The new mill at the 60%-owned Cortez Joint
     Venture will start commercial production early in the year.  Low-grade
     stockpiled ore from the Crescent pit at Cortez will be processed until
     mid-year when development of the Pipeline pit is expected to be
     sufficiently advanced  to meet all millfeed requirements.  In 1997,
     the Corporation's share of Cortez production is expected to exceed
     200,000 ounces at a cash production cost of less than $200 per ounce.
    <p>
        At the Golden Sunlight Mine in United States, a revised mine plan
     prepared following the reorganization announced in the third quarter
     no longer includes marginal heap leach material which was intended for
     treatment in the last four years of the mine life, thereby reducing
     ore reserves by 500,000 ozs. to 1.4 million ozs.
      <p>
        John Willson, President and Chief Executive Officer, commented:
     "Our operations profile is changing as we concentrate on
     higher-quality, longer-life gold mining assets and benefit from new,
     lower-cost gold output."

	institutional and retail investors."
	<p>
	"We are extremely pleased that Highlands shareholders now have the
	opportunity to consider and accept our offer."
	<p>
	Conditions on the offer have been removed for all but Papua New

	<li>Las Cristinas: a gold deposit in Southeastern Venezuela where Placer Dome expects to start construction shortly.


    <h3>Intentions In Respect Of Highlands</h3>

    <strong>Intentions if 100% of Highlands acquired</strong><br>

	If Placer Dome Holdings becomes entitled to compulsory acquisition rights in respect 
	of Highlands shares, it intends to exercise those rights. Following the acquisition 
	of 100% of Highlands, Placer Dome Holdings intends to:
	<br>

    <strong>(a)</strong> maintain the interest in the Porgera Joint Venture, although 
    ownership of that interest may be changed to facilitate repatriation of 
    dividends;
    <br>
    <strong>(b)</strong> review Highlands' exploration program and make whatever 
    changes are necessary to make that program consistent with the global exploration 
    strategy of the Placer Dome group;
    <br>
    <strong>(c)</strong> consider whether the Nena project in Papua New Guinea is 
    economically viable and of sufficient quality to justify development and, if so, 
    continue to develop the project either alone or with joint venture partners;
    <br>
    <strong>(d)</strong> consider whether development of the Ramu nickel project in 
    Papua New Guinea is economically viable and of sufficient quality to justify 
    development and, if so, consider how the project may best be developed given that 
    the primary business of Placer Dome is gold mining;
    <br>
    <strong>(e)</strong> close the offices of Highlands in Brisbane and consolidate the office in Port Moresby with the existing office of Placer PNG Limited, which may involve retrenchment of Highlands employees whose functions overlap with those already performed by employees of PDH and its related companies;
    <br>
    <strong>(f)</strong> to review with Highlands' existing management the business, operations, management systems and strategy of Highlands in order to enhance its competitive position as a part of the Placer Dome group. This may involve the redeployment of employees of Highlands into the worldwide operations of Placer Dome and retrenchment off employees whose positions are no longer required once the review process has been completed.

    <p>
    <strong>If  less than 100% of Highlands is acquired</strong><br>

    If Placer Dome Holdings does not acquire 100% of Highlands shares, it proposes to 
    cause the Highlands board to be reconstituted to reflect its shareholding in 
    Highlands. This will involve the convening or a requisition for an extraordinary 
    general meeting of shareholders if Placer Dome Holdings is unable to reach 
    agreement with the current board of Highlands within a reasonable time. 
    Otherwise, it intends to undertake the same general review described above, with 
    a view to causing Highlands to focus on its existing assets and to maximize 
    dividends to its shareholders, rather than conducting exploration at its current 
    levels.

    <p>
    <strong>Shareholding of Placer Dome Group in Highlands</strong><br>

	As at December 2, 1996, the shareholding of subsidiaries of Placer Dome in Highlands 
	was 187,755,458 ordinary shares representing (33%) of the issued shares made up as 
	follows:

	<li>Placer Dome Holdings held (directly or through nominees) 56,397,458 shares
	<li>Posadas Investments Pte Ltd, a Singapore company and the holding company of placer Dome Holdings held (directly or through nominees) 131,358,000

    <p>
    <strong>Relationship of Placer Dome Holdings to Placer (PNG) Pty Ltd</strong><br>
    <p>
    Placer Dome Holdings is an indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of Placer Dome.
    <p>

    <h2>Placer Dome warns of potential bid withdrawal</h2>
	
    <strong>December 16, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>


     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. has announced that it will take
     action to withdraw its A$0.75 a share takeover offer for Highlands
     Gold Limited if Highlands proceeds with litigation against the offer.
    <p>
     Placer Dome has completely rejected the unfounded allegations made by
     Highlands Gold in relation to the conduct of the offer.  We cannot
     condone the frustration tactics of Highlands.
    <p>
     As yet, threatened litigation has not been initiated and the offer is
     open for acceptance.  Placer Dome has dropped the offer conditions,
     for all shareholders excluding Papua New Guinea residents and
     shareholder on the Papua New Guinea register, to ensure that Highlands
     shareholders can accept the offer with certainty if they wish to do
     so.
    <p>
     The cash settlement period has been reduced to five business days from
     30 days.
    <p>
     "The offer is open now but, due to the threat of legal action I can
     offer no guarantees as to how long the offer will remain open," Placer
     Dome President and Chief Executive Officer, Mr. John Willson said.
    <p>
     "We have complied with each and every legal obligation in relation to
     the conduct of this offer.  All information we are required to
     disclose has been disclosed and we value our solid corporate
     reputation highly, as do our shareholders."

    <h2>Placer Dome rejects nondisclosure allegations made by Highlands

    <strong>December 15, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>


     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. has rejected allegations made by
     Highlands Gold Limited in relation to Placer Dome's intended A$0.75 a

    <p>
     "We are extremely disappointed that the Highlands Gold board has
     raised these completely unfounded allegations," Placer Dome President

     letter received by Highlands Gold, but would supply a response on

    <h2>Placer Dome implements financing plan</h2>
	
    <strong>December 5, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>


     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. today announced plans to raise
     funds through the sale of assets and the issue of preferred
     securities.  As a result of both the decision to dispose of  assets,
     and the re-evaluation of two properties, Placer Dome will record a
     US$78 million after-tax charge against earnings in the fourth quarter
     in order to reflect expected recoveries.
	<p>
     "The steps we are taking are intended to sharpen our focus on core
     gold assets," said John Willson, President and Chief Executive
     Officer. "We want to realize greater value from our assets, and we
     feel we can do this by concentrating on higher-quality, longer-life
     gold mining opportunities."

     <h3>The steps being taken are as follows:</h3>

     A preliminary short form prospectus is being filed to offer
     preferred securities for sale in the United States with a term of 49
     years up to an aggregate principal amount of US$300 million.  A
     description of the terms of the preferred securities will be set forth
     in one or more prospectus supplements.
	<p>
     CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. has been retained to assist
     with the sale of a package consisting of the Sigma and Kiena gold
     mines in Val d'Or, Canada, and gold exploration properties in the
     vicinity.
	<p>
    CIBC Wood Gundy Securities Inc. has been retained to assist
      with a review of alternatives for the sale of the Endako molybdenum
     mine in Canada.
	<p>
     Activities at the Detour Lake Mine in Canada are to be heavily
     focused on exploring the QK zone with a view to accelerating its
     development.  Mining of the Main zone will continue on a break-even
     basis to provide the infrastructure and support for QK zone-related
     activities.
	<p>
            Work will be terminated at the Paymaster property adjoining the
     Dome Mine in Canada following completion of an exploration drilling
     and test stoping programme which has concluded that the economics are
     marginal.
	<p>
       	A registration statement relating to the preferred securities will
     be filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.  The
     securities may not be sold nor may offers to buy be accepted prior to
     the time the registration statement becomes effective.  This press
     release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an
     offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy, nor shall there
     be any sale of the securities in any jurisdiction in which such offer,
     solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or
     qualification under the securities laws of any such jurisdiction.

	<h2>
	Placer Dome seeks partnership with Bre-X Minerals
	</h2>

	<strong>
	December 2, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>    

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. disclosed today that for the past
     two months it has been negotiating specific proposals with Bre-X
     Minerals Ltd. and its advisers for participation in the Busang gold
     property in Indonesia as part of a normal auction process.
     <p>
        As a result of considerable discussion, a conditional offer which
     reflected a price well in excess of today's Bre-X price was discussed,
     and a due diligence property visit was being arranged.  At that point,
     Placer Dome was told by Bre-X that the tendering process had been
     pre-empted.
       <p>
        Placer Dome confirms that it remains keen to acquire a substantial
     interest in Busang and wishes to rapidly develop the property.  The
     Corporation is especially qualified as, employing its own in-house
     capabilities, it has constructed nine mines in the last 11 years, two
     of them in the same challenging tropical environment as Busang.
      <p>
        John Willson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said today:
     "We were very disappointed to see the auction process pre-empted.  We
     regret that the opportunity for Bre-X shareholders to determine the
     value of their holdings, and to exercise their natural right to
     determine their partner, was taken away.
     <p>
        "However, we note that in Thursday's Toronto Globe and Mail
     newspaper, the Indonesian Vice-Consul for Investments, Jean Anes,
     indicated that the Indonesian Government is willing to consider other
     offers before the deadline of December 4.  We have therefore notified
     the Government that Placer Dome is not only highly qualified to
     participate with Bre-X and the Government in the development of Busang
     but wish to make a competitive offer to do so."

    <h2>Placer Dome offers to acquire Highlands Gold
        and the minority of Placer Pacific</h2>
	
    <strong>November 27, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

        

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces it is launching
     takeover bids for the 24.6% publicly owned interest in its subsidiary
     Placer Pacific Limited, as well as for all of the shares of Highlands
     Gold Limited, a Papua New Guinea company which owns 25% of the Porgera
     Joint Venture.  The value of these transactions upon completion will
     be about US$600 million.
     <p> 
        "This is about growth for Placer Dome shareholders and a golden
     opportunity for the shareholders of Highlands Gold and minority
     shareholders of Placer Pacific," John Willson, President and Chief
     Executive Officer, said.  "We have great confidence in the Asia Pacific
     region.  Placer Dome is consolidating its presence to compete more
     effectively."
     <p> 
        The bid for Highlands Gold is a cash offer of A$0.75 per share.
     The offer will be conditional upon no material change to the business
     or operations of Highlands Gold, the Australian Stock Exchange Gold
     Index not falling below 1500 during the offer period, and the Bank of
     Papua New Guinea approving Papua New Guinea residents' acceptance of
     the offer.  There will be no minimum acceptance condition.
     <p> 
         With on-market purchases made yesterday at A$0.75 per share,
     Placer Dome already holds 33% of Highlands Gold.  Placer Dome is
     making an offer at the same price to all shareholders under the Papua
     New Guinea Companies Act.
     <p> 
         "The offer represents a premium of over 36% on the Highlands Gold
     share price on Tuesday, November 26, the date immediately before
     yesterday's purchases," Mr. Willson said.  "It is cash, it has no
     minimum acceptance condition and I believe that Highlands Gold
     shareholders will recognize the attractiveness of the offer," he said.
     <p> 
        Placer Dome also announces it is offering one Placer Dome common
     share for every 15 Placer Pacific shares.  The bid is conditional upon
     Placer Dome gaining sufficient acceptances to exercise compulsory
     acquisition rights under the Australian Corporations Law, there being
     no material adverse change to the business or operations of Placer
     Pacific, the Australian Stock Exchange Gold Index not falling below
     1500 during the currency of the offer, and Foreign Investment Review
     Board approval.
     <p> 
        At Placer Dome's closing price in New York on November 26, the
     offer values Placer Pacific at A$2.03 per share.
    <p> 
        The Placer Pacific offer is not being registered under the U.S.
     Securities Act of 1933 and no shares will be issued to persons
     resident in the United States.
     <p> 
        "We are offering Placer Pacific shareholders the opportunity to
     participate directly in Placer Dome's global growth," Mr. Willson
     said.
     <p> 
         "As well as a significant premium of almost 50% over the Placer
     Pacific price on November 26, Placer Pacific shareholders will
     participate in a high-growth company with a portfolio of mines in
     Australia, the Pacific, and the Americas.  We hope that they will
     remain long-term shareholders of Placer Dome."
     <p> 
        Placer Dome intends to deliver takeover documents to Highlands Gold
     shortly, and expects to send the offer documents to Highlands Gold
     shareholders in mid-December.
     <p> 
        The Placer Pacific takeover documents will take longer to complete
     because it is a share offer, and will be delivered to the company at
     the end of December.  The offer documents will be forwarded to Placer
     Pacific shareholders in mid-January 1997.
     <p> 
        The Placer Pacific offer will be extended to shares issued under
     the Placer Pacific Executive Option Scheme during the offer period.

    <h2>
	Placer Dome reports improved quarterly performance
	</h2>
	
	<strong>October 23, 1996</strong>
	
	<p>
	
	<font size=-1>(all dollar amounts in U.S. currency)</font><P>
	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. today reported a consolidated
	loss for the nine months ended September 30, 1996 of $8 million or
	$0.03 per share, compared with net earnings of $36 million or $0.15
	per share in the corresponding period of 1995.  Third quarter 1996
	earnings were $16 million or $0.07 per share compared with earnings
	of $24 million or $0.10 per share in the year-earlier period.
	
	<p>

	The Corporation improved its gold earnings performance in the third
	quarter compared with the disappointing first half of the year due
	to higher gold production and improved cash operating costs.  Third
	quarter gold operating earnings were $74 million compared with $77
	million in the year-earlier period, and with $41 million and $47
	million in the first and second quarters of 1996.  For the nine
	months, gold earnings were $162 million compared with $175 million a
	year ago.

	<p>

	The loss in the first nine months is attributed to a $43 million
	after tax provision against earnings representing the estimated net
	impact of the accidental escape of mill tailing at the Marcopper
	Mine in the Philippines.

	<p>

	Sales revenues for the first nine months of 1996 were $845 million
	compared with $735 million in 1995, and cash flow from operations
	amounted to $183 million compared with $157 million.  The average
	realized price for gold in the third quarter was $409/oz. and for
	the nine months $408/oz., compared with an average market price of
	$392/oz. in both periods of the prior year.

	<p>
	
	The Corporation's share of gold production for the third quarter was
	503,000 ozs., bringing production for the first nine months of 1996
	to 1,438,000 ozs., 6% higher than in the 1995 period.  Reflecting
	improved operating performance since June 30, the average cash
	production cost in the third quarter was $210/oz., bringing the cash
	cost for the nine months to $233/oz., compared with $246/oz. in the
	first half of 1996 and $215/oz. in the first nine months of 1995.
	
	<p>
	
	Significantly higher gold production compared with the first nine
	months of 1995 was achieved at the Granny Smith Mine in Australia,
	the Dome Mine in Canada and the Cortez and Golden Sunlight mines in
	the United States.
	 
	<p>
	
	Operating earnings from copper for the nine months were $17 million,
	and $5 million for the third quarter.  The average realized price
	for copper in the nine months was $0.92/lb.  Cash production cost
	for copper was $0.57/lb. for the nine months.  At the Zaldvar Mine
	in Chile, the share of production in the nine months was 27,520
	tonnes of cathode copper.  The Osborne Mine in Australia produced
	31,415 tonnes of copper in the first nine months of 1996.
	
	<p>
	
	Construction of facilities at the 60%-owned Cortez Joint Venture in
	the United States is three months ahead of schedule for start-up in
	April 1997 and is expected to be $50 million under budget.  Plant
	buildings have been completed, concrete work is virtually done, and
	structural, mechanical and electrical work is well advanced. 
	Low-grade ore from the deposit is being transferred to heap leach
	areas while stripping of waste is ongoing.  The Corporation
	announced an enhanced production profile for the project with output
	of 675,000 ozs. per year (PDG share 405,000 ozs. per year) during
	the first five years due to higher grade in the early years.  Over
	the 12-year mine life, gold production is forecast to average
	440,000 ozs. per year (PDG share 264,000 ozs. per year) at an
	average cash production cost of $152/oz.  Application has been made
	to the Nevada State Office of the Bureau of Land Management for
	approval of a Plan of Operations to integrate mining and processing
	of ore from the adjoining South Pipeline and Pipeline pits.
	
	<p>
	
	At the 68%-owned Musselwhite gold property in Canada, construction
	of a mine and processing facilities is ahead of schedule and on
	budget.  The goal of erecting and closing in essential structures
	before the onset of winter is expected to be achieved, with cladding
	of buildings currently 80% complete.  Underground development is
	progressing on schedule.  Commissioning of the power supply is
	expected to start in late January 1997 for gold production to
	commence in the second quarter of 1997 at a planned rate of 200,000
	ozs. per year (PDG share 135,000 ozs. per year) at an average cash
	production cost of about $200/oz.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation announced a positive development decision on August
	1 regarding the 70%-owned Las Cristinas Mine in Venezuela. 
	Construction will commence with finalization of shareholder and
	financing arrangements currently being negotiated.  The Government
	of Venezuela approved the Environmental Impact Statement (EIS) in
	early October, allowing financing arrangements for the project to be
	advanced.  Plans for the facilities and future reclamation have
	established a new benchmark for proactive environmental protection
	in a wet, tropical setting.  The mine is scheduled to produce gold
	at an average rate of 450,000 ozs. per year (PDG share 315,000 ozs.
	per year) following a two-year construction period.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation has completed a new resource estimate for its
	wholly-owned Cerro Crucitas gold property in Costa Rica.  The
	measured and indicated resource is now calculated to be 58 million
	tonnes of material averaging 1.2 grams gold per tonne, containing
	2.2 million ozs. of gold.  Exploration is continuing.
	
	<p>
	
	Drilling of several targets continues at the wholly-owned Donlin
	Creek property in Alaska, where a measured and indicated resource of
	45 million tonnes grading 2.5 grams gold per tonne containing 3.6
	million ozs. of gold has been identified.  Strong evidence is
	emerging of continuity between the main Lewis deposit and adjacent
	areas, Queen, 900 metres north of Lewis, and Rochelieu, 300 metres
	to the west.  Metallurgical testwork is being conducted on the
	dominant gold-bearing refractory material to determine the optimal
	processing options.
	
	<p>
	
	At the Marcopper Mine in the Philippines the Corporation remains
	engaged in repairing the drainage tunnel which caused the major
	escape of mill tailing in March, and in remediation of the river
	environment.  The introduction of concrete grout and heated bitumen
	through drillholes from surface has served to seal the tunnel
	pending the installation of a permanent plug.  Approval is being
	awaited from Philippine authorities and the affected communities to
	take action to remove tailing from the channel of the Boac River. 
	The Corporation is continuing negotiations with the majority
	shareholder of Marcopper with a view to divesting itself of its
	interest.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation's share of proven and probable reserves at the
	Porgera Mine in Papua New Guinea increased by 490,000 ozs. to 2.2
	million ozs. at June 30, 1996 following revisions based on
	substantially increased data from exploration drilling in 1996.
	
	<p>
	
	The Corporation tendered its 30.8% interest in Gibraltar Mines
	Limited to a successful take-over bid by Westmin Resources Limited
	of Vancouver for all of the shares of Gibraltar.  A gain of about
	$11 million after currency translation and income tax adjustments
	will be recorded in the fourth quarter.

	<h2>
	Placer Dome announces Pipeline expansion plan
	</h2>
	
	<strong>
	September 24, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announced plans
	today to integrate development of the 2.5 million-ounce gold
	deposit, South Pipeline, with the adjacent 4.3 million-ounce
	Pipeline deposit.  Facilities to treat ore from the deposits are
	currently under construction at the 60%-owned Cortez Joint Venture
	in the United States with approved expenditure of US$320 million. 
	Placer Dome U.S. Inc. has applied to the Nevada State Office of the
	Bureau of Land Management for Approval of a Plan of Operations for
	South Pipeline.
	<p>

	Ore reserves at South Pipeline are estimated to be 44 million tonnes
	grading 1.75 grams of gold per tonne, bringing total Pipeline/South
	Pipeline reserves to 76 million tonnes grading 2.8 grams of gold per
	tonne, containing a total of 6.8 million ounces of gold.  Ore from
	both deposits will be treated in the new carbon-in-leach (CIL) gold
	recovery plant currently under construction, the capacity of which
	has been increased to a nominal 7,250 tonnes per day from 4,200
	tonnes per day.  Total combined gold production is expected to
	average 440,000 ounces of gold per year over a 12-year mine life, up
	from 310,000 ounces per year for Pipeline alone, at a cash
	production cost of US$152/ounce.
	<p>

	Construction of facilities for the combined project is three months
	ahead of schedule and is expected to be materially under budget.  By
	integrating South Pipeline, economic returns from the project are
	being enhanced by the increased throughput of ore.  The first gold
	from Pipeline is expected to be poured in the spring of 1997.

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces its 100%-owned subsidiary Placer Dome 
	Canada Limited has agreed with Westmin Resources Limited of Vancouver to tender 
	Placer Domes 30.8% stake in Gibraltar Mines Limited into a take-over bid being made 
	by Westmin for all of the outstanding shares of Gibraltar, a copper producer.  The 
	agreement contemplates that the Corporations 10,156,101 shares of Gibraltar will be 
	tendered for proceeds of C$8.85 per share in cash and common shares, resulting in a 
	gain of about US$11 million net of taxes and currency translation adjustments.
	<p>
	The consideration will consist of cash or shares, or a combination, as follows: (i) 
	C$8.85 in cash per Gibraltar common share up to a maximum aggregate cash payable to 
	all shareholders of Gibraltar of C$86.6 million; or (ii) 1.18 common shares of 
	Westmin per Gibraltar common share based on a Westmin price of C$7.50 per share.  In 
	the event that all Gibraltar shareholders elect to receive cash, the consideration 
	will be pro-rated as to C$2.50 in cash and 0.847 common shares of Westmin per 
	Gibraltar common share.  Placer Dome has agreed to elect to take its consideration in 
	the form of cash to the fullest extent available.
	<p>
	The agreement is subject to limited confirmatory due diligence and, subject to 
	certain conditions, Placer Dome will have the right to tender its Gibraltar shares 
	into any higher offer that may materialize.  Placer Dome previously announced its 
	intention to sell its interest in Gibraltar as part of its focus on growth in gold 
	production.  John Willson, President and CEO, said: "This is a very good deal for all 
	Gibraltar shareholders and will ensure the Lomas Bayas project can move forward 
	rapidly as part of a company that has a strategic focus on growth in base metal 
	production."
	<p>
	Gibraltar owns and operates the McLeese Lake Mine, an open pit operation producing 
	copper in concentrate and cathode form in British Columbia, and is developing the 
	Lomas Bayas oxide copper deposit in northern Chile.

    <h2>Placer Dome announces intention to sell 30.8% interest in Gibraltar</h2>
	
    <strong>September 4, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces that its wholly owned
     subsidiary, Placer Dome Canada Limited, has retained Nesbitt Burns
     Inc. to identify strategic buyers for its 30.8% interest in Gibraltar
     Mines Limited.  This step is in keeping with Placer Dome's focus on
     growth in gold.
        <p>
     Gibraltar Mines Limited owns and operates the McLeese Lake copper mine
     near Williams Lake, British Columbia and owns 100% of the Lomas Bayas
     and Fortuna de Cobre oxide copper deposits in Chile.  Gibraltar
     recently announced that it has obtained a bank financing commitment of
     US$140 million for development of the Lomas Bayas project, which
     together with the Fortuna property, has total reserves and geological
     resources of 8.92 billion pounds of contained copper.

	<h2>
	Additional ore identified at Porgera
	</h2>
	
	<strong>
	August 12, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc.'s share of proven and probable gold reserves
	at the 18.8%-owned Porgera Mine in Papua New Guinea has increased by 490,000
	ounces to 2.2 million ounces at June 30, 1996, from 1.7 million ounces at the end
	of 1995, as a result of revised estimates by the Porgera Joint Venture (PJV).
	<p>
	Porgera's total proven and probable ore reserves are now estimated to be 78.7
	million tonnes of ore grading 4.5 grams of gold per tonne containing 11.5 million
	ounces of gold, representing an increase in contained gold of 2.6 million ounces
	over the December 1995 estimate.
	<p>
	The Corporation's share of gold estimated to be contained in other mineralized
	material, which is in addition to its share of reserves, is 222,000 ounces, down
	from 359,000 ounces at the end of 1995, as a portion of these resources were moved
	to the ore reserve category.  The PJV said total measured and indicated resources
	at a cut-off grade of 1.5 grams per tonne are estimated to be 16.4 million tonnes
	at 2.2 grams of gold per tonne containing 1.2 million ounces of gold.
	<p>
	The increased estimates are the result of a substantial increase in data obtained
	by exploration drilling since the December 1995 estimates.  Increased reserves
	have resulted primarily from additions to open pit ore while underground reserves
	also increased.  Because of the extreme topography and the mining sequence, the
	open pit part of the deposit is not as extensively drilled as the underground
	mine.  Both open pit and underground areas remain highly prospective and the PJV
	is extending drill coverage as mining provides suitable access.
	<p>
	By Porgera's sixth anniversary of commercial production on September 1, 1996 the
	mine will have produced more than 6 million ounces of gold.

	<h2>Golden Sunlight acts to improve performance</h2>
	
    <strong>August 9, 1996</strong>

    <p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. advises that significant organizational and 
	operational changes are being implemented at the Golden Sunlight Mine in the United 
	States to improve its performance.  The Corporation regrets that as a result of the 
	reorganization, a reduction in the workforce of 73 employees was announced today.  
	While 10 to 15 of these employees will be transferred to other operations in the 
	Placer Dome Group, the balance will be provided with severance packages.
	
<p>

	In 1993, the mine - located at Whitehall, Montana - completed a profitable year with 
	record production of 121,600 ounces of gold.  In June 1994, however, ground movement 
	under the plant facilities necessitated the shutdown of the mine and mill.  
	Operations resumed in February 1995.  In 1996, taking the changes into account, 
	production is expected to be about 118,000 ounces with 203 employees at year-end, 
	compared with 89,700 ounces with 301 employees in 1995.

    <h2>Las Cristinas gold mine project approved</h2>
	
    <strong>August 1, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc., 70% owner, and Corporacin Venezolana de 
	Guayana (CVG) today announced approval for expenditure of US$536 million for design 
	and construction of a gold mine at the Las Cristinas property in south-eastern 
	Venezuela.  The approval is subject to completion of a financing and risk management 
	plan, the cost of which is not included in the capital cost estimate.  Inclusion of a 
	US$40 million contingency gives a total estimated project cost of US$576 million.  
	Construction is expected to start in late 1996 for gold production to commence during 
	the fourth quarter of 1998.
	
    <p>

	The mine is projected to produce an average of 450,000 ozs. of gold per year (PDG 
	share 315,000 ozs. per year) for at least 16 years.  Ore reserves are currently 
	estimated to be 233 million tonnes of ore grading 1.21 grams of gold per tonne, 
	containing 9 million ozs. of gold.   An open pit will be mined at a rate of 55,000 
	tonnes per day (tpd) in the first year, rising to more than 100,000 tpd when bedrock 
	is reached.  The average waste to ore ratio is expected to be 1.14:1.
	
    <p>

	The combined flotation/carbon-in-leach processing plant is being designed to treat 
	40,000 tpd, or 14.6 million tonnes of ore annually.  About half of the planned 
	production of 7.4 million ozs. of gold will be produced in dor bullion form.  The 
	rest will be contained in a copper concentrate.  Copper production is expected to 
	average 36 million lbs. per year.  
	
    <p>

	According to the feasibility study recently revised by Placer Dome, cash production 
	costs are forecast to average US$205 per oz. of gold, including copper credits.  In 
	the early years, production will average about 530,000 ozs. per year at an average 
	cash production cost below US$200/oz.  The processing circuit has been optimized to 
	reduce costs and to make water and tailing management cleaner and safer.  
	Construction is expected to require a workforce of 2,500 and the mine will employ 
	about 985 people.
	
    <p>

	John Willson, President and Chief Executive Officer, characterized Las Cristinas as a 
	large, low-cost gold deposit.  "This profitable, long-life mine that we are about to 
	build represents the successful application of our growth strategy.  As a result of 
	our own exploration activity, it adds substantial value.  Its considerable scale as 
	one of the largest precious metals producers in Latin America will strongly augment 
	our production and cash flow levels.  And through the high probability that further 
	exploration will add gold reserves, it contributes to our long-term future."
	
    <p>

	The financing and risk management plan being pursued involves both private sector and 
	multilateral lenders.  Financing will have limited recourse to Placer Dome upon 
	project completion.  Discussions with potential lenders are well advanced, and the 
	Corporation expects project construction to commence in the fourth quarter.    	
	
    <p>

	A recent addition of higher-grade reserves from an area separate from the main 
	deposit further improved the project economics and will contribute to early 
	production.  A series of recent exploration drillholes has extended ore-grade 
	mineralization down dip along the length of the main Conductora orebodys western 
	margin.  As much as 100 million tonnes of new resource of similar grade may be added 
	by year end.
	
    <p>

	Las Cristinas will become the third gold mine project to start construction in the 
	Placer Dome Group in 1996, after Musselwhite in Canada and Pipeline in the United 
	States.  Two more gold projects, Mulatos in Mexico and Mt. Rawdon in Australia await 
	approval, and a further two properties, Cerro Crucitas in Costa Rica and Donlin Creek 
	in Alaska are in advanced stages of evaluation.

    <h2>Sigma Mine renewal plan under way</h2>
	
    <strong>June 25, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>
    
     <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. advises that a major renewal plan
     is under way to improve the economics of its high-cost Sigma gold mine
     in Canada.  The Corporation regrets that, as part of the strategy, the
     workforce is being reduced by about 100 employees from 325 effective
     July 10.
     <p>
        Sigma, which had an average cash production cost of US$488 per
     ounce of gold in the first quarter, has been striving for
     profitability since a rockburst in June 1995 limited access to its
     primary ore zone.  Studies have since shown that accelerated
     development of several alternative gold veins will not compensate for
     the shortfall sustained.  The average cash production cost in May rose
     to US$550/oz., necessitating action to stem losses in the short-term.
    <p>
        The initial element of the renewal plan entails reducing ore
     production from underground, which accounts for the lay-off of
     employees, and increasing ore production from the Sigma II open pit
     mine.  Mining of higher grade stopes underground will partially offset
     the effect of lower grades from the open pit.  With mill throughput
     continuing at 1,800 tonnes per day, production in 1996 is expected to
     be 72,000 ozs. of gold, 13,000 ozs. less than originally budgeted,
     compared with 78,000 ozs. in 1995.
      <p>
        The longer term elements of the plan are still being studied,
     including access to the ore isolated by the rockburst and the mine's
     future exploration potential.

    <h2>Placer Dome increases exposure to gold price movements</h2>
	
    <strong>May 27, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

		<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. reports that in order to provide its 
		shareholders with greater exposure to the gold price, it has completed a programme to 
		close out 1.7 million ounces of its gold hedge position which would have required the 
		Corporation to deliver gold at prices of $450 per ounce or less.
         <p>
        As a result, Placer Dome's gold hedge programme now aggregates 3.8 million 
        ounces compared with 5.5 million ounces at March 31, 1996 and the average 
        price has increased to $482 per ounce from $462 per ounce. (Amounts represent 
        the Corporation's share and details are in the attached table.)
        <p>
        In closing out these positions, the Corporation has locked in pre-tax gains 
        totalling $23 million which will be included in reported earnings from the 
        third quarter of 1996 to the fourth quarter of 1997.  In addition, it is 
        expected that gold hedging activities will contribute $10 million to the 
        Corporation's operating earnings in the second quarter of 1996.
        <p>
        Placer Dome's approach to hedging is a balanced one.  It is intended to 
        enable the Corporation to benefit from the higher price realizations that can 
        be achieved in the forward market, while still retaining significant exposure 
        to upside gold price movements.  To date the programme has realized in excess 
        of $400 million.  Beyond this, the Corporation's remaining hedge position has 
        unrealized gains, at today's prices, exceeding $100 million.
        <p>
        The reduction in the hedge position is consistent with this approach.  Given 
        the fundamental strength of the gold market, the Corporation has concluded 
        that the balance it seeks is currently best achieved by hedging only when 
        realizations will exceed $450 per ounce.  As
a result almost all positions below this level have been closed out.

	<h2>
	Placer Dome's first quarter below target
	</h2>
	
	<strong>
	April 15, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	(all dollar amounts in U.S. currency)
	<p>
	
	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. advised at its annual meeting of shareholders
	in Toronto today that due to production shortfalls at some of its gold mines, the
	Corporations share of first quarter production at 458,000 ounces of gold was
	below the planned level of 495,000 ounces, although higher than the 1995 first
	quarter level of 400,000 ounces.
		<p>
	Costs were also adversely affected and the average cash cost of production for the
	Corporations share was $245 per ounce compared with $235 per ounce in the first
	quarter of 1995.
		<p>
	The operating shortfalls reflect previously disclosed conditions at the Porgera
	Mine in Papua New Guinea and the Detour Lake and Sigma mines in Canada, as well as
	lower-than-expected recoveries and grades at the Golden Sunlight and Bald Mountain
	mines in the United States.
		<p>
	At Porgera, difficult ground conditions have restricted the availability of
	several high-grade underground stopes and resulted in the rescheduling of
	production from these stopes until later.  Reinterpretation of the model of the
	main ore zone at Detour Lake reduced ore reserves by about two years of millfeed,
	and resulted in lower grades and development constraints which are limiting the
	mines ability to feed the mill at capacity.  Operations at Sigma are being
	affected by two major rock bursts in 1995 which resulted in a loss of scheduled
	high-grade ore and a shortfall in development.
		<p>
	In spite of these results, Placer Dome expects to meet its 1996 objective of
	producing 2 million ounces of gold for its account.

    <h2>Venezuela gold project shows positive economics</h2>
	
    <strong>March 26, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces that it has completed a positive feasibility study for development of a mine and processing facilities at the 70%-owned Las Cristinas gold property in south-eastern Venezuela.  The study has been delivered to the joint venturers, Corporacin Venezolana de Guayana (CVG) pending a development decision.
<p>
The study estimates that mineable ore reserves contain 8 million ounces of gold in the main Cuatro Muertos and Conductora zones.  At a milling rate of 40,000 tonnes per day, the operation is expected to produce an average of 450,000 ounces of gold per year for 14.5 years at an average cash cost of $205 per ounce and an average total cost of $310 per ounce, both net of copper credits.  The initial capital cost is estimated to be US$565 million, including contingency.
<p>
The open pit mine will operate with conventional truck shovel combinations and a crushing circuit for bedrock will be introduced in year two of operations.  As significant copper occurs with the gold, a copper concentrate containing gold will be produced as well as gold in dor bullion form.  About 60% of total gold production will be contained in concentrate and 40% will be in dor&#233;.
<p>
For environmental and economic reasons, the processing plan includes measures to recover most of the cyanide used to extract gold.  The mine will employ 840 people at start-up and it is anticipated that most will be Venezuelan nationals.
<p>
The Corporation is continuing to work with government authorities in Venezuela to clarify the fiscal and regulatory regime for gold mining investment.  The timing of a development decision is dependent on this clarification.

	<h2>
	New Placer Dome mine project approved
	</h2>
	
	<strong>
	March 4, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome U.S. Inc., a unit of gold miner Placer Dome Inc.
	of Vancouver, announced today that approvals have been received for development of
	the Pipeline gold deposit at the 60%-owned Cortez Joint Venture, and construction
	of a mill and related facilities will commence immediately.
		<p>
	The Nevada State Office of the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) has issued a formal
	Approval of the Plan of Operations for the Pipeline Project in Crescent Valley,
	Nevada.  The BLM also issued a favourable Record of Decision for the Final
	Environmental Impact Statement (EIS).  The Cortez Joint Venture, owners of the
	Pipeline Project, announced an immediate construction decision.  The joint venture
	is owned by Placer Dome U.S. Inc. and Kennecott Explorations (Australia) Ltd.
	(40%).  Placer Dome U.S. is the operator.  The Pipeline Project is located near
	the existing Cortez gold mine which has been in operation since 1968.
		<p>
	Pipeline will be an open pit gold mine with 4.3 million ounces of gold reserves. 
	The total capital cost to develop the combined carbon-in-leach mill and heap leach
	facility is estimated to be US$319 million.  Output is planned to average about
	310,000 ounces of gold per year for 12 years.  Construction and commissioning will
	take place over a 15-month period with production to begin in mid-1997.
		<p>
	Jay K. Taylor, President and CEO of Placer Dome U.S., said: "Pipeline is a great
	project which will be a significant part of Placer Dome U.S. for many years."  He
	acknowledged that the 41-month permitting process was arduous but comprehensive. 
	"Although it has been a difficult process at times, we would like to acknowledge
	the effort of the BLM in completing a professional and comprehensive EIS," Taylor
	said.
		<p>
	Placer Dome U.S. currently operates two gold mines in Nevada and one in Montana
	and conducts active exploration projects throughout the U.S. and Mexico.

	<h2>	
	Placer Dome discloses updated plans for five more mines
	</h2>
	

	<strong>
	February 26, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>

	(all dollar amounts in U.S. currency)
	<p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - During the next 12 months, Placer Dome Inc. expects to start
	construction of five mines which in aggregate will contribute an average of 
	800,000 ozs. of annual gold production and substantially elevate its production
	base from the two million ounce level expected in 1996, John Willson, President
	and CEO, will tell securities analysts at briefings which start in major North
	American cities today.
	<p>

	"During this period, production from some of our existing mines will decline but
	clearly this will be eclipsed by the incremental output from new projects," he
	said. They are the Musselwhite gold project in Canada, a major expansion of the
	Cortez Joint Venture (CJV) in the United States, the Las Cristinas gold project in
	Venezuela, the Mount Rawdon heap leaching project in Australia and the Mulatos
	gold project in Mexico.
	  <p>

	"If we begin construction as we expect, we will meet our strategic target of 2.5
	million ozs. in 1998 and exceed it in 1999.  Further growth beyond this is likely
	as we continue to make excellent progress on other projects such as South Pipeline
	in the United States and Cerro Crucitas in Costa Rica."
	 <p>

	On February 22, Placer Dome announced it was starting construction of a mine and
	processing facilities at the 68%-owned Musselwhite gold property in northern
	Ontario. Willson said the Corporation's share of pre-tax operating earnings from
	Musselwhite is projected to average $8 million per year based on feasibility study
	assumptions.  He added that while current ore reserves are 9.8 million tonnes, the
	feasibility study is based on processing approximately 12 million tonnes of ore
	and other mineralized material over the mine life.  Furthermore, he said there is
	a good probability of identifying an additional 7 million tonnes to extend the
	life of the operation by six years.  "This additional tonnage would have a
	substantial impact on the value of the project."
	  <p>
	
	He added, "Musselwhite will be profitable and over time as we pursue its upside
	potential it may be very profitable.  It is a strategic investment in what we see
	as Canada's next gold camp."
	 <p>

	A decision to expand operations at the 60%-owned Cortez Joint Venture (CJV) in the
	United States is expected in March following the issue of mine permits expected
	from the federal Bureau of Land Management.  "This will be, without question, one
	of the best gold projects ever undertaken by Placer Dome," said Willson.
	 <p>
	
	At Cortez, development plans have been updated to build maximum flexibility into a
	planned new metallurgical plant, in order to capitalize on the exploration
	potential of the CJV.  The plant is designed to facilitate expanded production at
	nominal cost should this become possible.  The capital cost of the project, which
	includes development of the Pipeline gold deposit,  is now estimated to be $320
	million.
	  <p>

	Pipeline will be an open pit mine with 4.3 million ozs. of reserves.  At an
	average cash production cost over the 12-year mine life of $110/oz., it is
	expected to be Placer Dome's lowest-cost gold producer.  Output is planned to
	average about 310,000 ozs. per year for 12 years, based on a 4,200 tonnes of ore
	per day processing plant.  Production is expected to
	begin in mid-1997.
	 <p>
	
	"Pipeline is a great project," said Willson.  "Based on a gold price of $375 per
	ounce, the mine is projected to contribute operating earnings in the order of $43
	million per year to Placer Dome over its first three years."
	  <p>

	The CJV has been mining and milling several deposits since 1968 and owns
	facilities to treat a number of types of gold ore.  Following discovery of the
	Pipeline deposit in 1991, step-out drilling encountered the South Pipeline deposit
	800 metres south.  As at year-end 1995, 1.5 million ozs. of gold from South
	Pipeline have been placed in the ore reserves of the CJV.  In 1996, the CJV will
	spend in excess of $1 million on drilling around the South Pipeline deposit.
	 <p>

	Willson said the feasibility study for development of the 70%-owned Las Cristinas
	gold property is due to be completed in March.  "This is a great discovery that we
	are all very proud of, and we are committed to making the project a success.  The
	question is not if Las Cristinas will become a mine, but how, and when.  Our
	engineers have now largely finalized the plant concepts and mine design that we
	believe are right for this exceptional deposit," said Willson.  "What remains is
	to resolve outstanding business issues related to the investment climate in
	Venezuela."  Willson said current plant concepts will increase the rate of gold
	production above previous projections and also increase the capital cost although
	final estimates are not yet available.
	 <p>

	A feasibility study for the Mount Rawdon project will be completed in the second
	quarter of 1996 and before the end of 1996 a feasibility study is expected to be
	completed on the Mulatos project.
	 <p>

	"Assisted by new mines which began operations in 1995, in 1996 our operations
	should be generating cash at a rate in excess of $350 million per year at current
	metal prices," Willson told the analysts.  "We anticipate increasingly strong cash
	flows in future from mines we will start to construct in the coming months." 
	Placer Dome expects to fund its future growth from these cash flows, from its cash
	and short term investments exceeding $300
	million and from some debt financing.
  <p>

	Noting that Placer Dome's ore reserves have increased to 21.0 from 19.8 million
	ozs., Willson said a further increase in reserves is projected for this year as
	decisions are made on more projects.  Measured and indicated mineralization
	increased to 29 million ozs. from 24.6 million ounces at the end of 1994. 
	Inferred mineralization increased to 14.6 million ozs. from 10.1 million ozs. at
	the end of 1994 (see attached table).

	<h2>Placer Dome earns $74 million in 1995</h2>
	
    <strong>February 22, 1996</strong>

    <p>
    
    <font size=-1>(all dollar amounts in U.S. funds)</font>
    
    <p>

        <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. reports consolidated net earnings for 
        1995 of $74 million or $0.31 per share compared with net earnings of $105 
        million or $0.44 per share in 1994.  Fourth quarter net earnings were $38 
        million or $0.16 per share, compared with $26 million or $0.11 per share in 
        the year-earlier period.  Fourth quarter gold sales volumes were 18% higher 
        than a year ago.
         <p>
        In 1995, mine operating earnings increased for the fifth consecutive 
        year to $308 million from $271 million in 1994, reflecting higher 
        realized gold prices and sales volumes and increased earnings from 
        molybdenum.  Notwithstanding the improvement in mine operating 
        earnings, net earnings declined primarily as a result of a higher 
        level of exploration expense, including $42 million on a project in 
        Kazakstan and the $17 million after-tax write-off of a venture 
        capital investment.
         <p>
        Sales revenues in 1995 were $1,029 million compared with $899 million 
        in 1994.  The average realized price of gold for 1995 was $392/oz. 
        compared with $388/oz. in 1994.  The average London market price for 
        gold in 1995 remained unchanged from the 1994 average spot price of 
        $384/oz.
          <p>
        Cash flow from operations amounted to $229 million compared with $225 
        million the previous year. The Corporation continues to maintain a 
        strong financial position, in spite of capital expenditures in 1995 
        of $451 million.  The year-end cash and short-term investments 
        balance was $321 million compared with $312 million at the end of 
        1994, and debt amounted to $563 compared with $276 million.  The 
        Corporation issued $300 million of long-term and medium-term notes in 
        1995 to build liquidity in advance of anticipated capital 
        expenditures.
         <p>
        Consolidated gold production in 1995 was 2.2 million ounces of which 
        the Corporation's share was 1.9 million ounces at an average cash 
        production cost of $217/oz compared with $198/oz. in 1994.  The 
        higher average cost in 1995 was due to the mining of lower grades, 
        the start-up phase of the expanded facilities at the Dome Mine, and 
        operating difficulties at the Detour Lake and Sigma mines.  The 
        higher production in 1995 was primarily the result of increased 
        output at the Dome Mine in Canada following completion of a major 
        expansion project, and the normalization of operations at the Golden 
        Sunlight Mine in the United States. Our most profitable gold 
        mines were the Campbell and Dome mines in Canada, the Misima and 
        Porgera mines in Papua New Guinea and La Coipa Mine in Chile.  Seven 
        of 13 gold mines recorded either higher production or lower costs or 
        both.  The Campbell Mine set a new production record of 323,775 ozs.  
        The Corporation's share of gold production in 1996 is expected to be 
        2 million ozs. at an average cash production cost of about $210/oz.
          <p>
        Mine operating earnings from molybdenum at $67 million were 
        significantly higher than in 1994 due to much higher prices in the 
        first half of 1995.  The average Metals Week Dealer Oxide quoted 
        price for 1995 was $7.42/lb. compared with $4.50/lb. in 1994.
         <p>
        The Corporation's share of proven and probable ore reserves at 
        December 31, 1995 is estimated to be 21.0 million ozs. of gold, 
        compared with 19.8 million ozs. a year earlier.  In addition, the 
        Corporation's share of other mineralized material in the measured and 
        indicated category is estimated to contain 8.0 million ozs. of gold 
        at mines and 21.0 million ozs. at exploration properties.  The most 
        significant reserve additions come from the inclusion of new reserves 
        of 1.5 million ozs. from the South Pipeline deposit on the 60%-owned 
        Cortez Joint Venture property in the United States and 1.2 million 
        ozs. at Musselwhite in Canada.  The Dome, Campbell and Bald Mountain 
        mines also increased reserves.
         <p>
        The increase in gold estimated to be contained in other mineralized 
        material is accounted for chiefly by inclusion of results from the 
        Donlin Creek exploration project in Alaska and the Cerro Crucitas 
        project in Costa Rica.  Donlin Creek is estimated to contain 3.6 
        million ozs. of gold in 44.6 million tonnes of material grading an 
        average 2.5 grams of gold/tonne, based on a 1995 drilling programme 
        which is to be followed up in 1996 at a cost of $6 million.  The 
        Cerro Crucitas property, where further drilling is under way, is 
        estimated to contain 1.8 million ozs. of gold.  The Corporation 
        expects exploration expense for 1996 to be about $100 million, 
        compared with $110 million in 1995.
         <p>
        The Corporation today announced it will proceed with development of 
        the Musselwhite Mine in Canada.  (See separate news release issued 
        simultaneously.)  In 1995, our project development teams completed 
        the construction of the Zald&#237;var Mine in Chile and the Osborne Mine 
        in Australia, as well as expansion of the Dome Mine in Canada and the 
        Porgera Mine in Papua New Guinea.  Construction decisions are to be 
        considered in 1996 on the Pipeline project in the United States, Las 
        Cristinas project in Venezuela and Mt. Rawdon in Australia, while 
        also this year a feasibility study is to be completed on the Mulatos 
        gold deposit in Mexico and a pre-feasibility will start on the Cerro 
        Crucitas gold property in Costa
        Rica.

	<h2>
	Placer Dome approves construction of new gold mine in Canada
	</h2>

	<strong>
	February 22, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	(all dollar amounts in U.S. currency)
	<p>
	
	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces that a positive decision has been
	made to construct a new gold mine at the Musselwhite property in northern Ontario,
	Canada, at a capital cost of $190 million.
		<p>
	Development of a mine and construction of processing facilities will start
	immediately on site, 500 kilometres north of Thunder Bay, in order to commence
	production in the second quarter of 1997.  Musselwhite is 68% owned by Placer Dome
	in a joint venture with TVX Gold Inc. of Toronto.  A feasibility study estimates
	total proven and probable reserves of 9.8 million tonnes of ore grading an average
	5.6 grams of gold/tonne, containing 1.8 million ozs. of gold.  The mine is
	forecast to produce 200,000 ozs. of gold per year for 10.6 years at an average
	cash production cost of $200/oz.  Other mineralized material identified at
	Musselwhite amounts to 3 million tonnes with an average grade of 5.8 grams
	gold/tonne containing 554,000 ozs. of gold.  Significant exploration potential
	exists to prolong mining beyond the 11-year mine life.
		<p>
	The feasibility study envisages a two-stage mining plan.  In the first stage a
	decline ramp will be developed to access ore in the top levels of the mine, using
	truck haulage to the mill, followed in later years by deeper underground mining
	requiring shaft access and ore hoisting.  In addition, lower-grade ore from a
	small open pit will be developed early to create an ore stockpile.  Processing
	facilities will be based on a mill with a nominal capacity of 3,300 tonnes of ore
	per day employing the conventional gravity separation, cyanide leach and
	carbon-in-pulp processes.  The ore is free-milling, providing gold recoveries of
	about 95%.
		<p>
	The project will employ about 500 people in its peak construction period.  When
	the mine starts operations in 1997 it will provide 282 new jobs in the region.  A
	key element of the project is an agreement ensuring the active participation of
	local First Nations communities.  Environmental impact and reclamation plans,
	including measures to protect water quality in rivers and lakes, have been
	approved by the Province of Ontario and the Government of Canada.

    <h2>Placer Dome announces senior management change</h2>
	
    <strong>January 3, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Domes 75%-owned subsidiary, Placer Pacific Limited, announced today that as a result of the resignation of its Managing Director, Lawrie Reinertson, it will appoint Dick Zandee, 50, to that position before the end of the first quarter of 1996.  The timing will accommodate a smooth transition between Mr. Reinertson and Mr. Zandee.
<p>
Mr. Reinertson has notified Placer Pacific that he is leaving to become President and Chief Executive Officer of Rio Algom Limited, a mineral producer based in Toronto.  He joined the Placer Dome Group as Senior Vice-President, Exploration, based in Vancouver, in 1987 and became Managing Director of Placer Pacific and Kidston Gold Mines Limited in 1990.
<p>
Since joining Placer Pacific, he has led the Company to record earnings over four successive years.  It is with great regret that his resignation has been accepted by the Placer Pacific Board of Directors and he will leave with the gratitude and best wishes of his fellow Directors and employees.
<p>
Mr. Zandee, a mining engineer, has been with the Placer Dome Group for 27 years and has broad experience in international operations in Canada, the Philippines and Papua New Guinea.  He is currently Managing Director of Placer Niugini Limited, based in Port Moresby.  His extensive mining background and depth of experience, especially in Papua New Guinea, make him eminently qualified to lead Placer Pacific.

	<strong>
	Marcopper Update #4
	</strong>
	
	<h2>
	Progress continues on repairs and mitigation
	</h2>

	<strong>
	September 23, 1996
	</strong>

	<h3>
	The Story so Far
	</h3>
	

	Placer Dome Inc. owns 40% of Marcopper Mining Corporation which operates a copper
	mine on Marinduque Island in the Philippines where a major escape of mine tailing,
	a mixture of sand and water, occurred on March 24, 1996, closing the mine.  A
	drainage tunnel plugged with concrete in order to impound tailing in a mined-out
	open pit gave way, spilling 4 million tonnes of material into the environment. 
	Fortunately no lives were lost and the tailing is not toxic to humans. 
	Independent studies, principally by United Nations teams, have confirmed that no
	persons became sick as a result of the accident, the main consequence of which was
	the overwhelming presence of silt in the river which smothered aquatic life. 
	Placer Dome is committed to rectifying the damage, and took a US$40 million charge
	against earnings in the second quarter to cover financial obligations for
	Marcopper, including US$15 million for the cost of repairs and environmental
	mitigation.
	<p>

	<h3>
	The Latest News
	</h3>

	Placer Dome reports that work continues on sealing the drainage tunnel from which
	the tailing escaped into the Boac River system.  The flow of tailing from the
	drainage tunnel has stopped, though water continues to flow.  A second tunnel is
	being advanced past the area of rock failure in the drainage tunnel to install a
	permanent plug.  Dredging of a channel at the mouth of the river is complete in
	order to capture tailing moved downstream in the wet season which is now in
	progress.
	<p>

	Following a meeting between the President of the Philippines, Fidel Ramos, and the
	President and Chief Executive Officer of Placer Dome, John Willson, on September
	16, Mr. Ramos expressed satisfaction with Placer Dome's ongoing efforts and said
	the Company is welcome to continue its involvement in the Philippines mineral
	industry.
	<p>

	Three Marcopper officials, two of them Placer Dome employees on secondment who
	have since resigned from Marcopper, have been charged with criminal offences in
	connection with the spill.  At a court hearing on September 5, 1996, the judge
	agreed to a motion filed by John Loney, formerly President of Marcopper, Steve
	Reid, formerly Resident Mine Manager, and Senior Manager Pete Hernandez, to
	dismiss the charges.  He gave the prosecution 20 days to respond.  Defence counsel
	will have another 20 days after that to reply.
	<p>

	The judge ruled that as the accused were exercising their rights to apply to
	dismiss the charges, there could be no arraignment until the outcome of the
	application is determined.  The Philippines Government meanwhile lifted Hold
	Departure Orders against Mr. Loney and Mr. Reid, allowing them to depart the
	Philippines pending their court appearances.  Mr. Loney remains Placer Dome's
	senior manager in the Philippines and Mr. Reid has taken up a position with Placer
	Dome in Vancouver, Canada.
	<p>

	Placer Dome has been negotiating with the major shareholder of Marcopper a
	survival plan that gives Marcopper the best structure for a real opportunity to
	re-open the mine and therefore provide:
	<p>

	<li type=bullet>ongoing well-paid employment;
	<li type=bullet>economic and social benefits for the citizens of Marinduque;
	<li type=bullet>the best chance of Marcopper meeting its remaining financial obligations.
	<p>

	In order to achieve these objectives, Placer Dome will acquire the financial
	obligations of the US$21 million Asian Development Bank loan to Marcopper and will
	be surrendering its 40% interest in Marcopper back to Marcopper.  Placer Dome will
	also be providing for development of an Environmental Reclamation Plan for the
	mine site to ensure that Marcopper can meet its future legal environmental
	rehabilitation requirements.  The cost of these obligations was included in Placer
	Dome's charge to earnings recorded in the second quarter.
	<p>

	<h3>
	Environmental Report
	</h3>
	
	<strong>
	Remediation of the Boac River
	</strong>
	<p>
	
	The first critical step towards the remediation of the Boac River, the dredging of
	a 1,000-metre-long channel near the river mouth, began July 27 and was completed
	earlier this month.
	<p>

	Dredging serves two purposes:

	<li type=bullet> The six-metre deep channel will act as a trap and permanent
	underwater storage facility for the coarse tailing which washes down the river,
	preventing it from reaching the sea;
	<p>

	<li type=bullet> The channel is also designed to reduce the additional risk of
	flooding which would be created if the tailing were allowed to build up in the
	delta area.
	<p>

	In order to remove the tailing from the river, Placer Dome has proposed a
	programme to continue to use the river as the main transport mechanism to remove
	the tailing from the Boac and Makulipnit channels and to transport the tailing to
	the dredged channel where the coarse fraction will settle out under safe disposal
	conditions.  Under this proposal, the fine material would continue to the ocean
	where it will disperse naturally over time in a manner which contains no long-term
	risk and which allows for the recovery of the marine environment. 
	<p>

	To minimize impacts and risks in the river system, it is proposed that mechanical
	methods be used to ensure tailing stored along the river channel is removed during
	the current rainy season.  The river has the ability to be restored quickly once
	the tailing has been removed from the channel, thus enabling normal aquatic and
	human activities to resume with minimum disruption to ongoing life in the river
	valley.  In comparison with other alternatives such as land-based disposal, the
	proposed programme will not take valuable land out of production or create any
	long-term impacts or risks.  Placer Dome will conduct community consultations on
	the proposed programme and its alternatives and seek Government permission before
	any action is taken.
	<p>

	<strong>
	Plugging the tunnel
	</strong>
	<p>

	For 12 consecutive weeks no tailing has been detected in the intermittent flow of
	water from the tunnel.  Work is under way to re-seal the tunnel.  The installation
	of a temporary plug by injecting mixed hot bitumen and concrete down bore holes
	into the tunnel where it will harden is continuing.  A second, fully engineered
	permanent plug has been designed and should be installed in the first quarter of
	1997 after physical access is gained through a second tunnel.
	<p>

	<h3>
	Environmental studies
	</h3>

	A series of environmental studies have been initiated to measure the impact of the
	spill and design measures to protect the health of the local residents.
	<p>
	
	<li type=bullet>A team of marine experts are monitoring effects on fish and
	aquatic life, and tailing dispersal in the ocean, to satisfy human health concerns
	and to predict long-term recovery.
	<p>

	<li type=bullet>Thirteen river monitoring sites are now being sampled on a
	fortnightly basis and a large database to aid scientific analysis has been
	established.  Tailing samples have been collected at one-metre intervals down the
	river and are being analyzed in Australia.  Results continue to show that the
	water and tailing material are not toxic to humans.
	<p>
	
	<li type=bullet>Residue quality studies include analysis of 17 agricultural soil
	samples collected from the flood plain of the Boac.
	<p>
	
	<li type=bullet>River behaviour studies involve the monitoring of sediment
	transport on a constant basis with the aid of 14 beacon sites, an aerial survey of
	the Boac and Mogpog rivers and a hydrographic survey of the marine environment
	offshore from the Boac River.
	<p>

	<li type=bullet>Environmental studies under way associated with the delta and
	dredge channel include:
	<p>
	
	-groundwater saline intrusion study,<br>
	-river water saline intrusion study,<br>
	-beach profiling,<br>
	-beach sand particle size distribution analysis,<br>
	-plume monitoring,<br>
	-tide monitoring.
	<p>
 
	<h3>
	Humanitarian aid
	</h3>

	Although no illnesses relating to the spill have been detected, medical missions
	funded by Placer Dome have been extended to 10 communities to continue monitoring
	human health and to provide medical treatment as required.
	<p>

	A social impact assessment is being conducted jointly by the University of the
	Philippines and the University of British Columbia, Canada.  It will provide a
	comprehensive, systematic and factual description of the impact of the tailing
	spill on local communities and will make recommendations regarding compensation
	and sustainable development options.  The study results from extensive community
	consultations, data collection and analysis.  It will be available to the public
	on request after mid-October.

    <h2>Marcopper accident to reduce Placer Dome earnings</h2>
	
    <strong>June 27, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. announces that it will be recording a US$40 million after tax provision against second quarter earnings as a result of the accidental escape of tailing (ground-up rock and water) at the 40%-owned Marcopper Mine in the Philippines.
<p>
The provision reflects the Corporations conclusion that, as a result of the accident and the subsequent revocation of its Environmental Compliance Certificate, Marcopper may be unable to repay the US$21 million of its loans guaranteed by Placer Dome, or to pay US$4 million of amounts due to Placer Dome.  The provision includes an amount of US$15 million representing the Corporations recently completed estimate of the net cost of repairing the drainage tunnel through which the tailing escaped, and mitigating the environmental impacts of the accident.
<p>
John Willson, President and Chief Executive Officer, said: "Placer Dome has repeatedly expressed regret for what happened and we have made firm commitments to the Government of the Philippines that we will act responsibly and mitigate the effects of this unfortunate accident.  In this spirit, Placer Dome has devised engineering solutions to repair the tunnel, and we have a plan awaiting government approval for dredging of the river mouth to mitigate potential future flooding.  With our support, Marcopper has built flood protection and housing on higher ground for river-bank residents, and has organized community support services.
<p>
"This significant provision against earnings reflects our determination to carry through the necessary work, despite Marcoppers current lack of cash flow.  Given the importance we attach to our environmental record, we are prepared to go beyond our obligations as a 40% shareholder of Marcopper."

    <h2>Philippines charge Marcopper's Placer Dome managers</h2>
	
    <strong>June 21, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. has been advised that three managers employed by
40%-owned Marcopper Mining Corporation in the Philippines are to be charged on Monday
with alleged criminal offences relating to the accidental escape of sand and water from a
containment at the mine in March.
  <p>
    They are John Loney, President of Marcopper, Steve Reid, Resident Mine Manager,
both Australian citizens, and Pedro Hernandez, manager of mining operations and a Philippine
citizen.  Mr. Loney and Mr. Hernandez are charged with reckless imprudence, violation of the
water code and violation of the Mining Act.  Mr. Reid also faces these charges, as well as an
additional allegation of violation of the Pollution Control Law.  Mr. Loney and Mr. Reid are
employees of the Placer Dome Group of Companies on secondment to Marcopper.  The
charges will be appealed immediately.
  <p>
    Placer Dome stands by those charged and will defend them in court.  The escape of
tailing (ground-up rock and water which was not toxic) was an accident, no injuries occurred
and there was limited property damage.  The accident should not be the subject of criminal
prosecution, particularly as there has been no opportunity for a technical investigation to be
conducted into what went wrong.  
<p>
    Placer Dome deplores the fact that in spite of the goodwill shown in its commitments to
the Philippine Government, the current work programme to clean up the river impacted by the
spill, and the efforts to assist residents affected by the spill, that the Philippine authorities are
proceeding with criminal charges against Marcopper employees.

	<strong>
	Marcopper Update #3
	</strong>
	
	<h2>
	The Marcopper spill: what is being done now
	</h2>

	<strong>
	June 21, 1996
	</strong>



    <h3>Background</h3>

	Marcopper Mining Corp. is a Philippine company incorporated in 1964 in which 
	Canada-based Placer Dome Inc. has a 39.9% shareholding.  Placer Dome acquired an 
	interest after an association with exploration of the mine property dating from 1956.  
	Marcopper has operated a copper mine on Marinduque Island in the south-central 
	Philippines since 1968.  During the development of the San Antonio orebody which 
	started production in 1992, Marcopper was directed by the Philippine Department of 
	Energy and Natural Resources (DENR) to cease the permitted disposition of tailing in 
	the ocean.  It was agreed by Marcopper and the DENR that the abandoned Tapian open 
	pit should be utilized for tailing disposal.  The Tapian Pit was used for this 
	purpose without incident for four years.
	
	<h3>What happened?</h3>
	
	On March 24, 1996, a fracturing of the rock around a concrete plug in a drainage 
	tunnel leading from the Tapian Pit to the Makalapnit River allowed a mixture of 
	ground-up rock and water, known as tailing, to escape from the Tapian Pit into the 
	Makalapnit and Boac Rivers.
	
    <p>

	The mine ceased operations on March 24 and remains closed.
	
    <p>

	Marcopper, with the assistance of engineers from the Placer Dome Group, quickly 
	succeeded in reducing the flow by 90%.  Placer Dome Technical Services Limited, 
	working under contract with Marcopper, is now coordinating all remedial work on the 
	tailing problem.
	
    <p>

	On April 17, 1996, Marcopper transferred funds from a 5.18-million-peso (US$207,000) 
	Environmental Guarantee Fund, established by the Company in compliance with its 
	Environmental Compliance Certificate, into a bank on Marinduque.  The fund is 
	administered by a committee comprised of Marinduque Governor Jose Carrion, Boac 
	Municipal Mayor Roberto Madia, the DENR Technical Director S.E. Tolentino and Senior 
	Marcopper Manager Ralph Ante.  The committee is chaired by the DENRs Environmental 
	Bureau Director Manual S. Gaspay.
	
    <p>

	Independent studies conducted by the United Nations and the Philippine Department of 
	Science and Technology have concluded that the escaped tailing is not toxic and does 
	not pose a health hazard.  In addition, it was concluded that the levels of heavy 
	metals do not exceed standards set by the DENR.
	
	
	<h3>Solving the tunnel problem</h3>
	
	<strong>What has been done?</strong><p>
	
	As a result of work done to date, the amount of material discharging from the tunnel 
	has been reduced from a volume of 140 litres of tailing per second when the accident 
	first occurred to an intermittent discharge of about 12 litres per second.  Two 
	emergency measures were undertaken to reduce the amount of materials escaping from 
	the tunnel.  First, water was pumped out of the Tapian Pit to reduce the hydraulic 
	pressure of the tailing.  Second, geotextile bags filled with concrete were installed 
	to partially seal the tunnel to reduce the flow.
	
	<h3>What is being done now?</h3>
	
	Placer Dome Technical Services with the support of Marcopper has assembled a team of 
	international specialists who will live and work on Marinduque Island until a 
	permanent plug in the tunnel is in place.  In order to stop the flow they are 
	devising unique solutions to a unique engineering challenge.  Twenty bore holes have 
	been drilled from the ground surface to the tunnel.  Grout and concrete have been 
	pumped into the tunnel area to seal the fractured rock and restrict the flow.  Next, 
	engineers will use a high pressure pump to force a liquid bitumen/cement mixture at 
	high temperatures through these holes into the tunnel where the mixture will solidify 
	to form a seal.  It is anticipated that this work will be completed in July.  A fully 
	engineered second plug is being designed and should be installed by year-end after 
	physical access to the area is gained through a second tunnel or shaft.
	
	
	<h3>Rehabilitating the river</h3>
	
	<strong>What has been done?</strong><p>
	
	As an emergency measure to prevent the tailing deposited in the Boac River bed from 
	spreading and to minimize the annual flooding which naturally occurs in the area, 
	crews of mine workers have built 22 kilometres of levees along the riverbank above 
	the town of Boac.
	<p>

	<strong>What is being done now?</strong><p>
	
	With the containment plan  the construction of levees along the riverbank  nearly 
	completed, the first phase of river rehabilitation can begin.  The Company has 
	formulated dredging plans which are currently being discussed with relevant 
	Government authorities prior to a permit being sought. Studies are currently being 
	conducted of the river system to determine the options for the removal and 
	disposition of the tailing currently in the river bed.  Once those options have been 
	determined, Marcopper will present its findings to members of the local community and 
	seek approval from the relevant authorities.
	
	
	<h3>Protecting and helping members of the community affected by the spill</h3>
	
	<strong>What has been done?</strong><p>
	
	A total of 158 core shelters are under construction to house community members who 
	have chosen to relocate after the accident to higher ground to minimize the risk from 
	flooding.  These sturdy, all-weather dwellings built by local workers feature a 
	cement floor, concrete block foundation and metal roofing.
	
    <p>

	Construction of 16 kilometres of new, all-weather roads has been completed to connect 
	residents isolated by the spill to the rest of the island.  The surfacing of these 
	new roads is nearly complete.
	
    <p>

	A medical mission was organized to monitor the health of the five affected 
	communities and to provide regular medical care.  In addition, another five 
	communities not affected by the spill have asked to receive free medical care and 
	medicines.  Although no illnesses connected to the spill have been diagnosed by the 
	attending physicians, members of the 10 communities are receiving medical care and 
	health education for other health problems to which they are normally exposed.
	
    <p>

	Marcopper staff continue to distribute food and household supplies to residents of 
	six communities.  As of May 31, 1996, the Company had distributed over 1.5 million 
	pesos (US$60,000) worth of supplies to affected families.
	
	<h3>What is being done now?</h3>
	
	Programs to ensure the health and safety of local residents in affected areas 
	continue.  Groundwater and drinking water is being tested regularly.  An independent 
	community-based committee continues to review compensation claims and establish a 
	priority for disbursements.

	<strong>
	Marcopper update #2
	</strong>
	
	<h2>
	Placer Dome makes commitments to remedy mine spill
	</h2>


	Placer Dome Inc. owns 40% of Marcopper Mining Corporation which operates a copper 
	mine on Marinduque Island in the south-central Philippines where a major escape of 
	mine tailing, a mixture of sand and water, occurred on March 24.  This is our second 
	update on developments.
	
	
	<h3>The flow has stopped</h3>
	
	After flowing intermittently and at a much reduced rate after the first four days of 
	unimpeded escape, the discharge of tailing stopped of its own accord.  This may be 
	temporary as flows have resumed before.  It is believed that the drainage tunnel 
	leading from the mined-out Tapian pit from which the escape occurred is blocked with 
	the flow of solids. 
	
    <p>

	Because the flow stopped without human intervention, it remains necessary to install 
	a temporary concrete plug in the tunnel, then to determine what exactly happened to 
	cause the escape and to design a permanent solution.  Four holes have been drilled 
	from surface to intersect the tunnel and an attempt is being made to pump concrete 
	down the holes to form a temporary new plug.  Alternatives for a lasting solution are 
	being sought with the help of Philippine and international geotechnical consultants.
	
	
	<h3>Charges said to be filed</h3>
	
	The Department of Environment and Natural Resources has recommended to the Justice 
	Department that charges be filed against five Marcopper executives for reckless 
	imprudence resulting in damage to property, and violations of the Water Code, 
	Pollution Control Law and the 1995 Mining Law.  They are John Loney, an Australian, 
	President of Marcopper, Steve Reid, an Australian, Resident Mine Manager (both 
	seconded from the Placer Dome Group), and Filipino senior operations managers Pedro 
	Hernandez, Manuel Quing and Ralph Ante.
	
    <p>

	It is Placer Domes understanding that the Justice Department must determine whether, 
	if charges are brought, there is sufficient evidence for the charges to succeed in 
	court.  Hearings to make this determination were due to be held this week, but to 
	date there has been no notification either to Marcopper or the individuals involved 
	that charges relating to the accident have been filed.
	
    <p>

	Placer Dome does not believe criminal charges are appropriate as the escape of 
	tailing was an accident.  If charges are filed, Placer Dome will defend against them 
	and provide every support to its employees in the Philippines.  
	
    <p>

	It is important however that the Department of Environment and Natural Resources and 
	Marcopper cooperate in reaching appropriate solutions to the accident.  This would be 
	facilitated by a stay of proceedings.  Marcopper is working towards this goal in the 
	interests of improving dialogue in order to expedite remedial actions.
	
	
	<h3>Commitments to remedy damage</h3>
	
	The accident has imposed hardship on the lives of many Filipinos (about 600 families 
	have been directly affected) as well as government administrators and Marcopper and 
	Placer Dome employees.
	
    <p>

	While no injuries or illness are attributable to the accident, the residents of 
	Marinduque have suffered personal inconvenience or damage.  They will be quickly and 
	fairly compensated.  Marcopper had previously established an Environmental Guarantee 
	Fund adjudicated by a broadly representative committee.  Placer Dome will use its 
	best efforts to ensure that this fund receives the financial support of Marcoppers 
	shareholders.  If  the fund proves less than adequate for the compensation required 
	to be paid, Placer Dome will provide supplementary contributions as needed.
	
    <p>

	Government expenses incurred because of direct assistance to people affected by the 
	accident should be reimbursed from the fund.
	
    <p>

	While Placer Dome and Marcopper remain certain the material that escaped is not 
	harmful to human health, Marcopper will continue to monitor the health of residents 
	affected and their drinking water.  A third party will conduct an independent 
	assessment of the health effects of the accident and Placer Dome, if requested, will 
	pay for the work.
	
    <p>

	Once the flow of tailing is permanently halted, a comprehensive environmental 
	rehabilitation programme will be conducted to remedy impacts on the river, to improve 
	road access to villages, to implement flood protection, to monitor long-term health 
	and the environment and to develop a plan to ameliorate conditions in the ocean at 
	the mouth of the river.
	
    <p>

	For these purposes a Marcopper Rehabilitation Fund will be established by Marcopper 
	with an initial contribution from Placer Dome.  In addition, it has been proposed 
	that Marcopper in consultation with the Government, will appoint an independent, 
	widely recognized, technical research organization to advise on the rehabilitation 
	programme.
	
    <p>

	Because the people of the Philippines have a right to know what went wrong, Placer 
	Dome and Marcopper will cooperate fully in any commissions of inquiry convened by 
	government to establish the causes of the accident and to prevent a recurrence. Mr. 
	A.M. (Sandy) Laird, Senior Vice-President, Placer Dome Group, who was a member of the 
	Marcopper project team during construction and the first Resident Mine Manager from 
	1968, has been appointed by John Willson, President and CEO, to take management 
	control of Placer Domes interests with respect to the Marcopper situation.
	
	
	<h3>Placer Dome will retain its leadership status</h3>
	
	Placer Dome has been commended for providing information in a spirit of open 
	communication with all interested parties whatever their point of view.
	
    <p>

	The Governments of the Philippines and of Canada as well as United Nations agencies 
	have become involved in the aftermath of the accident and calls have gone out from 
	critics for stricter environmental laws to control Canadian mining companies working 
	internationally.  
	
    <p>

	We point out that this regrettable event was an accident arising from a failure of a 
	designed installation and that conceivably the same failure could have arisen 
	anywhere in the world, including Canada, in spite of laws and standards.
	
    <p>

	Perfection cannot be legislated; it must be strived for.  Placer Dome has made 
	repeated commitments to become a leader in the mining community in environmental 
	protection, in minimizing the impact of mining, and reclaiming land upon mine 
	closure.  Placer Dome has received many environmental awards in recognition of its 
	leadership in Canada, the Philippines, Australia, Chile and the United States.
	
    <p>

	We will continue, with even greater intensity of commitment to environmental and 
	social ideals, to gain acceptance for our activities world-wide.

    <strong>
	Marcopper Update #4
	</strong>
	
    <h2>Environmental accident involves Placer Dome</h2>
	     
    <strong>April 9, 1996</strong>
    <p>

        Marcopper Mining Corporation, 39.9%-owned by Placer Dome, has operated a 
        copper mine on Marinduque Island in the south-central Philippines since 1968.
          <p>
          On March 24, 1996 a massive flow of mine waste called tailing, a 
          mixture of sand and water, started escaping from a drainage tunnel 
          into the environment, in the most regrettable environmental accident 
          in which Placer Dome has been involved.


          <h3>Source of the Problem</h3>

          During the development of the San Antonio orebody, Marcopper was 
          directed by the Philippine Department of Energy and Natural Resources 
          (DENR) to cease the permitted disposition of tailing in the ocean.  
          It was agreed by Marcopper and DENR that the abandoned Tapian open 
          pit should be utilized for tailing disposal and permits were granted 
          on this basis.  A concrete plug in a disused drainage tunnel was 
          designed and installed by Marcopper personnel.  The Tapian pit has 
          been used as a reservoir without incident for four years.
          <p>
          However, in August 1995 water seeps were observed above the mouth of 
          the tunnel and, as a precautionary measure, equipment was mobilized 
          to drill holes into the tunnel to place a second concrete plug at the 
          midpoint.  Access had just been achieved when the tailing discharge 
          occurred.  On March 24, the flow of tailing out of the mouth of the 
          tunnel started at a rate of 5 to 10 cubic metres per second.  This 
          continued for four days, increasing to higher water flows as the 
          tailing density dropped. During this period approximately 2.4 million 
          tonnes of tailing solids discharged into the river. The tailing is a 
          mixture of sand, water and traces of copper minerals and is non-toxic 
          (no cyanide is used in the copper-recovery process).  Water analysis 
          is being conducted continuously at 15 points along the 24-kilometre 
          length of the river.  No threat to the health and welfare of local 
          inhabitants has been detected.  Residents in the area do not depend 
          on the river for drinking water and use it mainly for irrigation and 
          washing clothes.
          <p>
          The most serious environmental effect of the accident is the build-up 
          of sediment on the river banks and at crossing places.  There have 
          been a number of confirmed reports of fish deaths caused by the flows 
          of silt.  To mitigate the effect of the sediment build-up on access 
          by local residents, the Company has hired helicopters to help people 
          cross the river where necessary.  The helicopters are also taking 
          medical teams to the affected areas to monitor the health of local 
          residents.


          <h3>Subsequent Situation</h3>

          The flow of tailing stopped on its own after four days and has 
          subsequently flowed intermittently at reduced volume and variable 
          density at about half a cubic metre per second, discharging between 
          50,000 tonnes to 100,000 tonnes per day of solids.
          <p>
          The immediate priority is to install a temporary plug in the tunnel, 
          then to determine the cause of the escape of tailing and with the 
          help of independent experts to design and implement a permanent 
          solution to secure the tailing impoundment.
          <p>
          Tailing has been confined to the river bed except for a spill over 6 
          to 10 hectares of banana and coconut plantation.  Heavy sedimentation 
          has occurred in the first 14 km of the Boac river while fine-grained 
          material has been washed out to sea at the mouth of the river, 25 km 
          downstream from the mine.  Equipment continues to work in the river 
          bed to ensure the tailing does not impede the river flow and that the 
          flow is contained within the river banks.
          <p>
          Since the access track to communities upstream follows and crosses 
          the river bed, assistance has been provided to local residents who 
          have been stranded by the deposition of solids on the river bed. 
          Marcopper, supported by government agencies, has transported water, 
          food and medical supplies to isolated families.  Foot bridges have 
          been built where appropriate.  No one has been injured and no adverse 
          health effects have been confirmed.  An assessment of property damage 
          is under way.
          <p>  
          On the Island of Marinduque cooperation between Marcopper and 
          National, Provincial and local officials has been and continues to be 
          at a high level.
          <p>
          Employees who can perform useful and necessary work are being 
          retained at the mine while those who are unessential are being 
          temporarily terminated but with continuing financial support.  An 
          effort will be made to rotate employees in jobs as circumstances 
          permit.

          <h3>Relations with Government</h3>

          The Philippine Government has reported to the media that Placer Dome 
          is banned from working in the Philippines although Marcopper has 
          received no official communication to that effect.  Officials have 
          confirmed, however, that Placer's expatriate employees assisting in 
          the recovery operations are welcome and will not be subjected to any 
          sanctions.
          <p>
          The Government has announced commissions of enquiry and Marcopper 
          will assist and will cooperate fully with any investigations into the 
          incident.  The Government has also stated that criminal charges may 
          be laid against Marcopper and its management and may take action to 
          cancel the Environmental Compliance Certificate and the Mining Lease.
          <p>
          Concurrently, the Government of Canada has agreed to a request by the 
          Chairman of the Philippine Senate Committee on Environment to provide 
          the standards applicable in Canada and to provide Placer Dome's 
          environmental record.  We are cooperating with the Canadian 
          Departments of Environment and Foreign Affairs in this matter.
          <p>
          Simultaneously, the Government of Canada has received an enquiry from 
          the United Nations Department of Humanitarian Affairs in Geneva, 
          prompted by the United Nations Development Program in Manila, as to 
          whether the Canadian government would provide technical assistance in 
          the remediation of the Marcopper spill.  The Government of Canada has 
          decided not to provide technical assistance, on the basis that 
          Marcopper and Placer Dome have the capacity and willingness to do the 
          remediation.


          <h3>Prognosis</h3>

          When permanent repairs have been made to the tailing impoundment, or 
          an alternative storage is identified, Government approvals will be 
          sought to re-open the mine.  This may occur within six months.
          <p>
          It is probable that much of the tailing solids in the river will be 
          flushed out to sea during the next typhoon season (about October) and 
          any that remains will lie on the river bottom or on the banks where 
          it will be revegetated.  It is unlikely that any long term 
          environmental damage will occur.  However, an independent, 
          scientifically oriented third party will review long term remediation 
          plans.
          <p>
          The accident is likely to remain politically prominent in the 
          Philippines for some time to come, with commissions of investigation, 
          as well as possible criminal charges and civil suits.  Although the 
          long term environmental consequences will be minimal, this will 
          continue to be a significant black mark against Placer Dome, its 
          environmental practices and its engineering standards.
          <p>  
          Immense effort goes into maintaining high environmental standards 
          throughout the Placer Dome Group and a strong record of protection 
          has been achieved.  While an incident has occurred that should not 
          have happened, it is not representative of Placer Dome's striving to 
          apply the best environmental management practices.

	<h2>
	Progress made to control Marcopper spill
	</h2>
	
	<strong>
	March 29, 1996
	</strong>
	<p>

	<strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome advises of measures being taken to control the
	major escape of mill tailing from an impoundment at the 39.9%-owned Marcopper Mine
	in the Philippines.  Sand and water residue from the copper recovery process
	stored in a mined-out pit started escaping through a drainage tunnel in the pit
	when a concrete plug failed on March 24, discharging sediment into the Boac River.
		<p>
	Late on March 28 the tailing discharge stopped of its own accord, bringing some
	relief to the situation. Engineers are studying the reasons for the stoppage. 
	Preparations are being made to instal a new temporary plug while a long-term
	permanent solution is being sought.
		<p>
	Marcopper is implementing the following measures:
		<p>
	<li type=bullet>Water is being pumped out of the mill residue stored in the pit to
	reduce the pressure and mobility of the tailing mix.  The most secure methods of
	sealing the drainage tunnel are being considered by a technical team comprising
	experts from the Philippines, South Africa, Australia and Canada.
		<p>
	<li type=bullet>The Company has started a monitoring programme with the Department
	of the Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) to ensure there is no danger to
	human health. The tailing is not toxic.  Chemical analyses of the discharge have
	confirmed that it has no toxicity for people or livestock.  Marcopper and DENR are
	continuing to conduct independent tests of the discharge and will share their
	findings.
		<p>
	<li type=bullet>While there is no threat to the health and welfare of local
	inhabitants, access to and from villages has been restricted as a result of
	sediment build-up in the river.  The Company is minimizing the build-up by
	deepening the river channel and constructing levee banks to safeguard agricultural
	land.  Food is being supplied to affected communities and this will continue until
	normal access across the river is restored.

	<h2>Environmental incident at Philippine mine</h2>
    
    <strong>March 26, 1996</strong>
    
    <p>

    <strong>Vancouver, Canada</strong> - Placer Dome Inc. advises that a major escapement of mill tailing has occurred at the 39.9%-owned Marcopper Mine in the Philippines.  The health and welfare of local inhabitants is not believed to be at risk, but their safety is being continuously monitored.  The Company is deeply concerned about the effects on the area and urgent and intensive measures are under way to bring the situation under control.
	 The tailing left after the extraction of copper is a mixture of sand and water 
	containing traces of copper mineral.  It is impounded in a mined-out pit at the 
	copper mine operated on the Island of Marinduque.  The material is discharging from a 
	tunnel that was developed to drain the pit when it was being mined.  The tunnel was 
	plugged with concrete before residues were deposited in the pit and it has been 
	secure for four years.
	
	Routine monitoring detected seepage of water in the tunnel area late last year and 
	plans were progressing toward installing a second concrete plug.  The escape of 
	tailing, which was detected on March 24, occurred before this procedure could be 
	completed.  A number of measures to stem the flow are being attempted.  Meanwhile 
	mill operations have been suspended.
	
	The environmental effects are chiefly a build-up of sediment in the Boac River, with 
	mud deposited on the banks and at crossing places.  Residents are not dependent on 
	the river for drinking water.  The Company has hired helicopters to assist residents 
	at river crossings and to help in other ways as required.  All relevant authorities 
	have been informed of the situation.

    <strong>CIM 1997 Mineral Economics Society Symposium Cordilleran Roundup<br></strong>
    January 27, 1997<br>
    Hotel Vancouver<br>
    Vancouver, Canada<br>

    <p>
	<strong>Written by John M. Willson, President & CEO,  Placer Dome Group<br> 
	Delivered by A.M. (Sandy) Laird, Senior Vice-President, 
	Placer Dome Group</strong>
    </font>

    <p>


    John was tempted to name this talk "The Throne Speech".   This is 
    not because he thought he had the best strategy here today, but 
    because his speech outline was composed while he was locked in the 
    washroom at his office.
    <p>
     The inside door handle came off in his hand and our CEO was 
     marooned for 25 minutes while someone was found to rescue him.  
     So once his assistant had squeezed documents and a pen under the 
     door, he had lots of time to read the briefing notes for this 
     conference and to ponder his strategy.
    <p>
     It struck us when reading the list of participants who are here 
     today, that we should have some others here also, to talk about 
     their strategies.  We had in mind people like Peter Munk, Robert 
     Friedland, Norman Keevil, Michael Sopko.  After all, these are 
     the people who are breaking the norms, no pun intended, Norm.
    <p>
     For myself, it is a pleasure to be here, to be numbered among this
     august set of speakers.
    <p>
     To talk strategy is an easy topic.  After all, that is what CEOs are
     supposed to worry about all the time.  First of all, what is strategy,
     what does it mean?  For Peter Munk - and we have read some of his book
     - it is the be-all and end-all.   He says it doesn't matter what you
     pay, what matters is what you do, what strategy you apply.  The trick
     these days may perhaps be how you get to pay at all, with Munk
     pre-empting the best deposits the way he is.
    <p>
     From this insight, one could ask does strategy mean how you go about
     leading the company?  Does it mean what vision of the future you
     develop?  What your big picture is?
    <p>
     Does it mean how the Company goes about its business?  Its value
     system and the way it is applied?
    <p>
     The background material on the purpose of this discussion suggests
     that what we are focusing on here is the strategy applied by a company
     to get its hands on more mineral reserves.
    <p>
     Much of John's experience in leading a company has been in the gold
     industry, first with Pegasus in Spokane, and from 1993, with Placer
     Dome.  Gold mining is not base metal mining, it has a different
     alchemy.  This alchemy is what I will try to explain today as one of
     the biggest gold players here - no disrespect to Clive or Milt.
    <p>
     In the course of being a CEO with gold mining companies, John has been
     fortunate to be able to put into practice some of the ways of
     developing a strategy.  At Pegasus he conducted a process that
     involved senior employees in devising the strategy the company would
     adopt.
    <p>
     When he came to Placer Dome, he joined a company that already had a
     well-defined strategy and very good people to implement it.  We
     fine-tuned the strategy however by conducting a similar but much
     deeper employee consultation process, involving employees, managers,
     senior managers and the Board of Directors.
    <p>
     We basically asked employees: What kind of company do you think Placer
     Dome should be in five years' time and how should it get there?  This
     proved to be an excellent way of determining what is important.
    <p>
     In the end, we concluded that Placer Dome will focus on gold
     exploration, development and production, and because copper often
     occurs with gold we would produce that metal also, but no more than
     the equivalent of 25% of revenues.  We set a target for gold
     production which has since been revised upwards.  We set a cash cost
     goal in the lower tercile. And we set out a business philosophy and
     values statement to govern our conduct.
    <p>
     There has been very good buy-in to the result, but as usual we failed
     to provide enough good feedback and reinforcement within the Company
     and now we must revive the process.
    <p>
     Currently our strategy has taken a new turn with renewed focus on
     improving the quality of our gold production by concentrating on
     developing and operating large, long-life, low-cost gold mines.  This
     is what has been driving the asset sales we announced late last year.
    <p>
     The underlying thought in setting a strategy is finding out what is
     important, given the business we are in and the nature of our market
     and shareholders.
    <p>
     A couple of years ago, we were provided with a survey on what is
     important to investors who buy, or are considering buying, gold
     shares.  The survey was thorough and targeted analysts and fund
     managers.
   <p>
     <strong>GROWTH POTENTIAL</strong><br>
     At the top of the chart [on the screen] is Growth Potential.  If 
     you ask Frank Mirsh at Altamira what is the key issue for good 
     miners, he will say it is growth.  Well, you say, what does that 
     mean?
    <p>
     Earnings growth, cash flow growth, reserves-resources growth, what
     growth?  It is production growth that counts.  He is very clear on
     that.  Does quality of the growth not matter? Well, yes, but only if
     it is seriously poor quality.
    <p>
     So if you have growth potential, you probably have good reserves, you
     probably have clever explorationists, you probably have good mine
     builders in-house, and operators and mine reclamation people, all of
     which give you the ability to convince the market that you can go on
     forever, which is the assumption they must implicitly make to accord
     you, the gold company, the kind of magnificent multiples that we get
     as good long-term gold miners.
    <p>
     So perhaps the Growth word in fact means much more than one's
     likelihood of growing, it also implies excellence in many areas.
    <p>
     <strong>MANAGEMENT QUALITY</strong><br>
     Management quality must be good, durable, deep, modern, conservative
     in reporting, entrepreneurial in action, flexible, steady and
     believable as leaders to the market and the employees of the company.
    <p>
     <strong>ABILITY TO DEVELOP MINES</strong><br>
     This means to turn exploration into production at the least cost, to
     mine the ever-lowering average grade of ore, to design and build
     reliably.  We at Placer Dome have all this probably more than anyone
     else.
    <p>
     <strong>RESERVE ESTIMATES</strong><br>
     As we all know there are reserve estimates, and reserve 
     estimates. Ounces in the ground are not all equal, and despite 
     efforts to standardize, estimates vary.  Some companies are known 
     for putting the best face on reserves, others are known to be 
     conservative and the market will therefore credit variability to 
     different companies based on their track records.
    <p>
     Reserve estimates are a piece of the growth equation and the longevity
     equation, so it is not surprising they are important.
    
     <p>
     <strong>OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE</strong><br>
     The gold community is, in my personal opinion, little troubled by low
     earnings, so long as they are not chronically low or negative.
     Write-downs appear to be relatively easily forgiven.  They appear to
     look through the earnings to cash, and they like to see it spent, not
     on yield, but on growth.  Growth is exploration, acquisitions and more
     mines.
    <p>
     <strong>EXPLORATION TEAM - QUALITY</strong><br>
     In our business, exploration is where the value is added and a quality
     exploration team is what one needs if you are to "out-multiple" the
     competition.  Quality, and lower down the list you see up on the
     screen, high activity in exploration, is not easy to come by.  Much of
     the entrepreneurial talent has "gone junior", and good mine finders
     like David Lowell are in short supply.  In fact, they are likely the
     most critical shortage in our industry.
    <p>
     Exploration quality is not, of course, merely a matter of having the
     very best mine finders and geologists.  It is also very much a matter
     of strategy and the way you are organized.  Our exploration strategy
     mirrors the way our whole international company is organized, such
     that there is a great deal of autonomy at the local/regional level
     with scope at that level for initiative and freedom of action, but, on
     the other hand, we reprioritize our considerable exploration
     expenditures four times a year on a worldwide basis in accordance with
     the manner in which projects are developing.
    <p>
     This is not easy to do effectively.  Not easy because good
     entrepreneurial geologists do not like to have their pet projects
     closed down in favour of someone else's pet project in a different
     part of the country or of the world.  To achieve such prioritization
     effectively, the whole exploration team must be focused on the
     ultimate success of the parent company, Placer Dome Inc.  And there is
     also a very strong need for a fearless leader of the worldwide
     programme who is willing to call the shots as he sees them following a
     participative process in which all senior geological managers agree on
     the geological and commercial merits of the projects being compared.
    <p>
     Another strategy for exploration executives is to get your geological
     talent in the field.   Organizing moving vans, visiting ambassadors or
     currying favour with government officials is not in the job
     description.

     <p>
     <strong>MANAGEMENT CONTINUITY</strong><br>
     Once a management group is formed and settles down and is successful,
     it is a  good idea to have it stick around for a while.  It represents
     an opportunity for it to carry out a consistent strategy and succeed
     at it.  Much could be said about this.  Some would say top management,
     or its leadership, needs to be turned over fairly regularly so that it
     does not become set in its ways.
    <p>
     We agree to some extent with that thought, and some turnover in the
     top is appropriate, but only if there is a centre of stability in
     management and the Board that keeps the ship steering a pretty steady
     course.  At Placer, we have achieved a stable senior management team
     with a very stable Board of Directors which agree on and adhere to the
     Company's strategies and policies, while not ceasing to cast around
     through an annual Strategic Planning Review for new and more
     shareholder beneficial paradigms.
     <p>
     <strong>MANAGEMENT DEPTH</strong><br>
     In order to be able to grow as our shareholders want us to, and to run
     our exploration, mine-building and operations well, we need to
     continuously develop all our people.  Particularly, perhaps, we need
     to develop our technical people who will form the backbone of our
     activities, and our financial people who make it possible to optimize
     our activities and to find the money necessary to take the quantum
     leap when we occasionally identify those opportunities.
    <p>
     Depth of management is particularly important when an opportunity like
     Busang comes along.  To design and build and operate Busang will
     require an enormous commitment of resources of the human and financial
     kind.  In this sense, to be able to move top class people into the
     activity without compromising other ongoing corporate priorities is a
     huge strength that nobody in the gold industry can match.  Placer Dome
     can deploy a world class team to implement this project immediately,
     despite the fact that it is in the closing stages of two mine-building
     programmes in North America and in the opening stage of a third and
     very large one in South America.  Such an ability illustrates great
     management depth, as I say, second to none in the gold business.
    <p>
     Do I make a relevant and topical point?  I hope so!
    
     <p>
     <strong>EXPLORATION TEAM - HIGH ACTIVITY</strong><br>
     Not far below the quality of the team comes its level of activity.
     This can be measured by the budget with which it is endowed, in Placer
     Dome's case one of the most aggressive in our business, and the volume
     of projects at all different stages from pure grassroots to
     feasibility study status.
    
     <p>
     <strong>LIQUIDITY</strong><br>
     In the sense of the survey, this relates, of course, to the ability of
     the shareholders of the corporation to buy and sell its stock, in
     large lumps, rapidly and with minimal market impact.  This has come
     about in our Company as a result of what has been achieved, and along
     with the other high market cap gold stocks, it tends to make us a part
     of most fund's portfolios, and also a so-called trading stock.
    <p>
     We are lucky to be there.
    <p>
     <strong>
     ACQUISITION STRATEGY</strong><br>
     It is surprising to me that this is so low in the field of what is
     important, since it is evident that if one is successful at
     acquisition the Company can do very well indeed.  A successful
     acquisition is obviously an acquisition where one does not pay too
     much for what the project eventually becomes.
    <p>
     Barrick's Goldstrike is the one acquisition that no one will argue was
     a brilliant one.  It has formed the foundation and backbone of the
     company.  So many people turned it down, then Peter Munk took the risk
     and paid what everyone said was a silly price, and it came up trumps!
    <p>
     But analysis shows that while acquisitions are good for the acquiree,
     they are rarely good for the acquirer.  Too often, especially right
     now, the competition is so fierce that a reasonably priced acquisition
     simply cannot be made.
    <p>
     That is why, in my opinion, exploration success is put so much higher
     up the list.  It is patently obvious that if we can find good quality
     reserves at $36/oz, then that will beat good quality reserves
     purchased at $130/oz.
    <p>
     We have a capable and considerable Corporate Development department
     which has been beavering away for a few years in its post-Mount
     Milligan form.  We do not make a lot of noise about it - in fact we
     frequently get letters from frustrated shareholders wishing that we
     made a lot more noise - but you see some of what we are doing fairly
     clearly at the moment.
    
     <p>
     <strong>RESPONSIBILITY</strong><br>
     It is good to see this so high up the list, much higher than I would
     have expected it.  One has the feeling that fund managers and analysts
     do not much care how the company achieves its goals of higher
     shareholder return, so long as it does it.
    <p>
     But over the years we have come to be encouraged by the fact that some
     of them really do care about the image of the company they own.  More,
     unfortunately, do not.  Stocks are simply chips to play in the
     business of improving returns.
    <p>
     Anyway, more and more today, responsibility is quite properly expected
     of our industry.  As time goes on, this will become increasingly
     important as standards quite rightly continue to become higher.
    <p>
     My company prides itself on being a responsible one, and nowhere is
     that better illustrated than in the Philippines where Marcopper had an
     unfortunate accident resulting from a concrete plug placed in a tunnel
     many years ago that failed.  While no persons or domestic animals were
     killed, the Boac river was filled with tailing, and it will take years
     to recover.
    <p>
     Despite the fact that we own only 40% of the company, we are paying
     for 100% of the remediation, the Marcopper company having no money and
     the other shareholders being unwilling to contribute.  It would have
     been easy to walk away, but not only would that have been extremely
     contrary to the responsible stance that we take, but more
     pragmatically it would have made life very difficult for us whenever
     we next tried to permit a mine.  In fact, at this moment, one of our
     competitors is highlighting our Marcopper problem in its own interest.
    <p>
     <strong>INTERNATIONAL OUTLOOK</strong><br>
     This is an essential feature, we believe, in the never-so-open world
     that is mining today.  We had a good start at this, with operations in
     Papua New Guinea in the 1930s, and we are now more diverse
     geographically than any of our peers.  We regard this as a critical
     strategic advantage.
    <p>
     It takes many years to develop the skills needed to be effective
     internationally.  One does not develop an experienced and seasoned
     cadre of commercial and technical people overnight, who can be relied
     upon to go wherever they need to go, to be effective when they arrive,
     and to hold up the Company's values through it all.
    <p>
     It is not cheap to develop this international cadre of people.  Much
     training and job exposure is needed in different environments.  Much
     sensitivity training is necessary so that the customs and
     sensitivities of the host nation are respected in word and in deed by
     our people.
    <p>
     Cross fertilization, cross-training, language training, international
     transfers, international training exposure, compensation for foreign
     conditions, home leave, is all expensive but necessary in an
     international company.  Chileans in Canada, Australians in the United
     States, Americans in Australia, Canadians all over the world since
     Canada is still our biggest employer, it all costs but there is no way
     to do without it.
    <p>
     Sometimes there is a reluctance to accept international assignments.
     To try to resolve this inflexibility, we are very actively recruiting
     those young and promising professionals who truly express an interest
     in getting a lot of varied international experience, to pick up
     foreign languages, to learn to respect other peoples' ways, their
     customs, their religions, their sensitivities, in short, to have an
     international outlook.
    <p>
     Just a couple more comments on these strategy points.

     <p>
     <strong>QUALITY OF THE INVESTOR RELATIONS EFFORT</strong><br>
     This is one of the more lowly issues according to this survey, but we
     would argue with this conclusion.  If you had been at Pegasus in 1989
     when the realization came that the good grade at Montana Tunnels was
     not as good as it was supposed to be,  and you had to deal with that
     problem effectively, and you had seen your market capitalization drop
     by 10% in two days, you might understand why we think it is very
     important.
    <p>
     We contend that as long as it is well done, great additional frills
     and fanciness do not benefit anyone much, but if it is badly done, you
     will pay for it in spades.  The difference between a good Investor
     Relations programme and a bad one can easily be 25% of the stock
     price, or more.
    <p>
     So, at Placer Dome, we give very full and regular disclosure, we are
     sensitive and responsive to the information needs of our market, and
     we think it is very, very, important.
     <p>
     And now, at the very bottom, we come to .....

     <p>
     <strong>YIELD</strong><br>
     Well, as everyone except a few individualists know, dividends are 
     irrelevant in the North American golds.  We pay 30&#162; per 
     share, more people pay 10&#162;, and others pay nothing.  And 
     Newmont pays a little more than we do.  But people are just not 
     there for dividends, in the main.  They are there for total 
     return, which, being translated, means stock appreciation.
    <p>
     By now you are bored, I can see the eyes glazed and the heads bowed,
     or nodding, so I will desist after a couple more points.

     <p>
     <strong>ONE IS THE ENVIRONMENT</strong><br>
     We feel we do a fairly good job, but Marcopper was a loud wake-up call
     for us.  Now we have a renewed commitment not only to be good, but to
     be a leader in the field, and be recognized as such.  It takes so long
     to build a reputation, and with one incident you can lose it all.

     <p>
     <strong>THE SECOND IS EMPOWERMENT</strong><br>
     Empowerment has little to do with focus on the gold industry, what I
     am here to talk about.  It is a newish word for making people's lives
     more interesting, more rewarding, more autonomous and more fulfilling.
      It is what we are trying very hard to bring about at Placer Dome.
    <p>
     First, we have a so-called decentralized structure, with Placer Dome
     Canada, Placer Dome U.S., Placer Dome Latin America and Placer
     Pacific.  Those are our regional companies that have their own CEO,
     CFO and other officers, as well as their own Boards.  Then we have
     P.D. Exploration, and the Project Development Division, each run by a
     Senior Vice-President.  In the middle of all this, becoming by design
     less and less visible, is Placer Dome Inc., the little mother, as I am
     sure it is often called!
    <p>
     To fit all of this, we have finally almost completed the installation
     of a fully modern Human Resources department which spreads its web
     throughout the world of Placer Dome, concentrating on career
     development, succession planning, nurturing the culture, ensuring fair
     and equitable competitive compensation, among many other critical
     activities.  While it is a central service organization, the regions
     and other groups have their own Human Resources organizations which
     reflect the nature and location of the activities undertaken.
    <p>
     Training is a large part of empowerment.  Most people want to run
     their own jobs just as they want to run their own lives.  To run their
     own jobs they need to be trained to do them.  Therefore, training is a
     key component of empowerment and we are working hard at it.  We are
     even training miners in finance, and financiers in mining.   Not easy!
    <p>
     Finally, to help with the motivation that should come with
     empowerment, we have programmes to encourage employee ownership of
     stock, both through option awards, and the award of options for
     holding PDG stock.
    <p>
     How did I get so far off track?  After all this was to be about our
     strategy, particularly for finding and developing gold resources.
    <p>
     We would obviously submit that a set of strategies and tactics may be
     very wisely and cleverly conceived, but without the depth of
     experience, knowledge and commitment of the people who make the
     company work, the company will never succeed.  At Placer, we will.

    <p>

	Today multinational corporations, such as Placer Dome, are going to 
	places where a few years ago we would not have dreamed of going.  
	Economic pressures combined with ideological evolution has forced - and 
	is forcing - countries which were communist, or nationalistic, or 
	protectionistic, or simply heavily indebted to turn to multinational 
	corporations for investment capital and economic growth.  
	International agreements such as NAFTA and the WTO are instituting 
	legal structures that encourage trade and investment by multinational 
	corporations. Multinational corporations are being actively courted 
	by many governments that once spurned us, and we are responding.  
	Rightly can we describe the 1990s as the decade of globalization.
    <p>	
	What do we find when we cross those once forbidding frontiers, in 
	Eastern Europe or the Former Soviet Union, in much of Latin America, 
	or Africa, or Southeast Asia, or China?  We encounter rampant 
	corruption in many governments and court systems.  We face in most 
	cases, if not the absence of environmental legislation, then a 
	complete lack of government capacity to monitor and regulate the 
	environmental impact of industrial activity. In some places, our 
	presence in the midst of sensitive ecosystems triggers issues related 
	to rainforest preservation, biodiversity protection, or 
	desertification prevention.  We are coming into contact with 
	indigenous populations, whose rights of land ownership and usage 
	generally remain undefined in their countries' laws and who are often 
	ignored or oppressed by their national governments.  Our projects are 
	sometimes surrounded by communities of impoverished people, 
	particularly in rural areas, such as landless peasants, or migratory 
	workers, or small scale miners, communities which are often 
	dysfunctional and in desperate need of medical and educational 
	services.  We are confronting labour unions which may be totally 
	controlled by their governments, or totally corrupt, or totally 
	politicized.  We are entering into contracts with governments, whose 
	willingness or capacity to abide by the terms of a legal agreement is 
	often sorely deficient.  Finally, we are dealing with governments who 
	may have opened their economies to multinational enterprises, but 
	politically remain dictatorial, denying their citizens their civil 
	rights and liberties.  Most fundamentally, and underlying the 
	foregoing specific conditions, we are relating across cultures to 
	value systems and customary practices which at various points conflict 
	with our own basic beliefs and principles as to what is right, 
	acceptable and conducive to everyone's best interest.
	<p>
	If this is globalization, why are multinational companies so keen on 
	it? Why are we rushing into places that pose such enormous challenges?  
	The main answer, of course, is that there are enormous opportunities 
	in these challenging places for doing business as it has not been done 
	before: opportunities for markets, for investments, for profits.  In 
	many of the more difficult jurisdictions competition may be weaker, 
	total costs less burdensome, regulations less constraining and 
	resources more available and less exploited than in the more developed 
	and attractive regions of the world.  To some extent, a foreign 
	company may be able to ignore or circumvent or insulate itself against 
	the social and environmental deficiencies it encounters, but should 
	it?  What responsibility should a company assume in remedying those 
	deficiencies, in becoming constructively engaged in bringing about 
	social and environmental improvements in the society where it is doing 
	business? To define the responsibility of multinational corporations 
	we must first acknowledge the essential nature of business.  From one 
	point of view the paramount, if not sole, objective of business is to 
	create wealth, to maximize the return on capital.  Part of that new 
	wealth is captured by the country where it is generated through taxes 
	and business expenditures.  As countries become richer they become 
	more able to attach priority to and deal with social and environmental 
	issues.  The encounter with foreign businesses may itself help 
	stimulate new thinking in a citizenry as to what is possible and 
	desirable.  Solving a country's problems can be viewed as the 
	responsibility not of the foreign company, but of the people in the 
	country itself.  Foreign capital, foreign technology and foreign 
	business practices merely provide a stimulus and perhaps an 
	opportunity to change.
	<p>
	From another point of view, it is the very nature of business to act 
	as a change agent in society: first in the marketplace, then with 
	respect to technology, production processes, management practices, and 
	so forth, and then on the periphery through interaction with local 
	communities, with the natural environment and with national 
	governments.  Companies cannot function in society without causing 
	change.  Progressive companies endeavour to solidify public and 
	political support by providing to local communities social and 
	physical infrastructure (schools, clinics, sports facilities, roads 
	and bridges, etc.), by showing respect for the natural environment 
	which may be affected by their operations, and by persuading 
	governments to adopt policies supportive of good business practices 
	and a stable operating environment.  The driving objective of 
	increasing shareholder value can itself be understood as the 
	consummate change, the end result of many specific internal and 
	external changes.  Companies which perceive themselves essentially as 
	change agents respond to the expectations not only of shareholders but 
	of numerous stakeholders: employees, communities, governments, 
	environmentalists, human rights advocates and others.  The differences 
	among companies is whether they consider themselves passive change 
	agents, focussed exclusively on shareholder interests, or active 
	change agents, fully engaged in developing constructive responses to 
	the social challenges around them.
	<p>
	This distinction between passive and active change-agents raises a 
	critical question.  Is it appropriate for a code of conduct to respect 
	the limits of corporate social responsibility implied in the role 
	definition of passive change-agent?  The inclination of those who wish 
	to accelerate positive change in societies around the world is to 
	press all corporations in the direction of becoming active change-agents.  
	Must a code of conduct go beyond restraining corporations 
	from doing evil?  Should codes of conduct actually direct 
	multinational corporations towards doing good, towards taking 
	positive actions to bring about social, political and economic 
	improvements in the societies where they are operating?  What are the 
	appropriate limits to a multinational corporation's active efforts to 
	bring about constructive change in the countries where it operates?
	<p>
	There are many voices proclaiming that globalization, and the growing 
	influence of multi-national corporations, presents a threat to, rather 
	than an opportunity for, positive social change.  The anti-globalizers 
	seek to reassert the national sovereignty, economic protectionism, and 
	barriers to the entry of multinational corporations, which have been 
	diminished through globalization.  They see the evils of globalization 
	as: a threat to the powers of local and indigenous communities and 
	even nations to control their futures as power is transferred to 
	multinational corporations; an acceleration of modes of economic 
	development that give scant attention to issues of equity or 
	environment; a widening of the gap between rich and poor, particularly 
	in developing countries; an invasion of the earth's remaining 
	wilderness places with a loss of biodiversity, natural resources, and 
	the planet's life support systems; and a worldwide homogenization of 
	diverse, local and indigenous cultures, social and economic 
	structures, as well as values and living patterns to reflect the 
	efficiency needs of the new global monoculture (IFG Position 
	Statement, January 1995). For the anti-globalizers multinational 
	corporations cannot be agents for positive change, no matter what 
	their codes of conduct may say.
	<p>
	Is a multinational corporation's code of conduct only a public 
	relations ploy, targeted at governments, communities, social activists 
	and concerned shareholders?  Certainly, such codes are useful in 
	deflecting the attacks of the anti-globalizers.  They help the 
	corporation put the best image on its intentions, irrespective of 
	whether it defines its social responsibilities narrowly or broadly.  
	Codes of conduct may in fact serve to strengthen a corporation's 
	competitive advantage.  When governments or potential partners have to 
	choose among bidders for a particular project, they may be inclined to 
	select that company which has the best reputation with respect to 
	environmental performance or community relations or even human rights 
	practices.  A code of conduct expresses and promotes those corporate 
	attributes.  Companies that have a code of conduct can present 
	themselves as more predictable and desirable partners, investors, or 
	operators.
	<p>
	Of course, by adopting a comprehensive code of conduct, a 
	multinational corporation invites increased public scrutiny of its 
	actions against its own self-imposed standards.  The risk of 
	attracting attention and generating criticism may limit the interest 
	of corporations in developing a comprehensive code of conduct.
	<p>
	Is it sufficient then for a multinational corporation simply to adopt 
	or reference statements of principles that have been developed by 
	multilateral institutions, such as UN declarations, ILO conventions, 
	World Bank guidelines, or the benchmarks of the Canadian, U.S. and 
	U.K. Task Forces on Corporate Responsibility?  Despite the excellence 
	of these documents and the effort that has gone into them, they remain 
	external admonitions. Often such principles are difficult for 
	corporations to internalize, as they seem not to reflect real-life 
	experience with the hard choices companies are often confronted with 
	in the field.
	<p>
	The usefulness of a code of conduct to a corporation is probably 
	proportionate to the effort it has expended in developing the code.  
	When a corporation without an explicit code of conduct is confronted 
	by complex social issues, it relies on its best judgment as 
	represented by personnel on the scene and by senior management.  The 
	corporation's best judgment generally represents enlightened corporate 
	self-interest.  The principles or rules underlying its choice of 
	actions are either expressed ad hoc or remain unstated.  Articulating 
	those underlying principles may help a corporation structure its 
	judgments in a more consistent and effective manner, and facilitate 
	the transfer of lessons from one experience to other situations.  
	Developing a code should be a corporate learning experience. However, 
	the task of producing a comprehensive set of principles or rules which 
	apply globally and respect the interest of all stakeholders may exceed 
	the capability of all but the most determined corporations.
	<p>
	Let me offer a few examples of the difficulty of formulating 
	comprehensive, globally applicable principles.  Many multinational 
	corporations have codes that deal with corruption, these prohibit 
	employees from paying gratuities, commissions, inducements or other 
	compensation to government officials for services rendered or 
	expected.  Generally, however, allowance is made for "facilitating 
	payments" to induce government officials to perform routine tasks for 
	which they are normally responsible in order to accommodate the 
	reality of conditions in much of the developing world. Even the U.S. 
	Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the one piece of U.S. extra-territorial 
	legislation which one cannot fault, allows for the payment of 
	facilitating payments.  Corporations which are used to honest 
	government officials who discharge their duties without facilitating 
	payments, in countries such as Canada, rightly find this pervasive 
	form of corruption in the developing world to be repugnant.  Yet it 
	may be virtually  impossible to operate without making such payments 
	in countries where the government underpays officials in the 
	expectation that they will supplement their incomes with money 
	received from users of their services. As long as corporations are not 
	paying government officials bribes to exercise discretionary authority 
	in major decisions in their favor, corporations may consider 
	themselves to be abiding by the general rules against corruption.  In 
	countries like Canada those rules are black and white, but in many 
	developing countries the rules are varying shades of gray, which 
	challenges corporations to determine the limit between facilitating 
	payments and major corruption.
	<p>
	Are there not cases, however, where even the principle against large 
	scale corruption might justifiably be broken?  Would it be allowable, 
	for example, for a corporation to pay an inducement to a government to 
	make a human rights concession, such as the release of a political 
	prisoner?  It is debatable.  Who, after all, should decide that such 
	an infraction of an important principle is permissible?
	<p>
	Some corporations in Canada, the U.S. and Australia have developed 
	codes of conduct dealing with their relations with indigenous people.  
	Can the principles intended to guide Canadian corporations in relating 
	to our First Nations be applied to indigenous people throughout the 
	Americas and the rest of the world?  Up to a point, possibly; but 
	there may be limits.  At least one multi-national corporation received 
	a sharp surprise when the government of an African country challenged 
	its statement of principles on aboriginal relations as threatening to 
	promote tribalism.  That African country had during the past 30 years 
	made great progress in transcending tribalism, to the point that its 
	citizens truly identify themselves with their nation rather than with 
	their tribe.  There may also be a problem in defining who is 
	indigenous.  In Canada the law provides a clear definition; in many 
	other countries, it is far less clear.  These difficulties might deter 
	corporations but they have not deterred  multilateral institutions 
	from attempting to develop globally applicable principles regarding 
	indigenous peoples, notably the I.L.O. Convention, the U.N. Draft 
	Declaration, and the World Bank's guidelines.
	<p>
	Frequently it is recommended that principles regarding the rights of 
	employees and organized labour should be included in multinational 
	corporate codes of conduct.   The union-promoting codes of the I.L.O. 
	are held up as a model.  In some countries, however, large national 
	unions have extensive control over who is hired for industrial 
	operations anywhere in the country, and jobs tend to be awarded on the 
	basis of favouritism and corruption.  In such circumstances a 
	corporation's intention to maximize the hiring of people from the 
	local community risks being thwarted by the national union.  The 
	question then rises as to whether the company should seek to impede 
	the national union's effort to control the worksite so as to enhance 
	employment opportunities for the local community, or abdicate 
	community responsibility to remain consistent with principles 
	respecting the rights of unions.
	<p>
	These examples are meant only to illustrate the potential limitations 
	of globally applicable principles, whether on corruption, aboriginal 
	relations, labour rights, or environment, social development, or even 
	human rights.  The difficulty of developing principles which are truly 
	applicable without reservation in all situations which a company may 
	find itself in around the world is perhaps the principal reason (in 
	addition to the reluctance to invite greater scrutiny and possible 
	criticism)  why corporations may be hesitant to develop comprehensive 
	global codes of conduct.
	<p>
	It may be that the concern of many who advocate multinational 
	corporate codes of conduct is wrongly focused.  They are mostly 
	concerned about individual corporations doing evil or contributing to 
	persistent evils in countries where they operate.  Perhaps, a more 
	productive focus would be not on individual corporations but on 
	processes that bring about positive change.
	<p>
	In my view, to promote positive change and prevent harmful actions by 
	multinational corporations, codes of conduct need ultimately to take 
	the form of specific guidelines for individual countries.  Moreover, 
	the potential for positive change will be greatly enhanced if there is 
	consistent action by a group of like-minded corporations, and possibly 
	allied non-governmental organizations.  Multinational corporations 
	may benefit from the self-educating process of attempting to develop 
	their own comprehensive set of globally applicable principles, but 
	they may benefit more from educating each other by developing specific 
	codes of conduct for those countries in which they collectively face 
	challenging social conditions.  Such country specific codes will 
	clarify the ambiguities inherent in global principles, and provide 
	real guidance on difficult issues for all the corporations and 
	organizations that adopt the code.
	<p>
	The human rights agenda, to which Amnesty International is dedicated, 
	may be the most difficult for multinational corporations to address 
	in a code of conduct.  Individual corporations should certainly abide 
	by human rights principles in situations where they have some control, 
	such as their own operations.  However, it is nearly impossible and 
	possibly inappropriate for individual corporations to directly 
	influence governments in the broader areas of human rights, such as 
	freedom of expression, of assembly, from oppression, from torture, and 
	so forth.  There is a serious question as to how far a foreign 
	corporation, essentially a guest in the country where it is operating, 
	should go in influencing government policy in areas outside its own 
	business interests.  Public statements of disapproval may represent 
	the appropriate limit of intervention by a multinational corporation 
	in the domestic politics of its host country.  Even then, I would 
	suggest such statements should be logically linked to identifiable 
	corporate self-interest.
	<p>
	Collective action, even if only in the form of remonstrations, may if 
	it is broad-based and strong-willed enough, be far more effective in 
	bringing about improvements in human rights practices.  Collective 
	action by a number of multinational corporations and allied 
	organizations may go beyond words and include specific initiatives 
	which might advance the human rights agenda more than would be 
	possible for an individual corporation. Did not the collective 
	action of the well-intentioned corporations that subscribed to the 
	Sullivan principles help bring about eventual change in South Africa?  
	I would suggest that Amnesty International should promote that 
	multinational corporations active in a country where there are 
	significant human rights abuses, jointly develop (with groups such as 
	Amnesty) a code of conduct specific to that country, which concerned 
	corporations adopt and implement, with a view to acting collectively 
	to bring about positive change.
	<p>
	There is a model for such an approach.  The movement known as 
	Transparency International (of which a Canadian chapter has just been 
	established) is a coalition of business and other organizations formed 
	to deal with the matter of corruption.  Transparency International 
	members undertake to work collaboratively with each other, with other 
	like-minded organizations and (where possible) with the government to 
	bring about progressive elimination of corruption in countries where 
	they are operating.  The principle guiding Transparency International 
	is that "the approach has to be evolutionary, as one cannot change the 
	way the world is operating at a stroke of the pen". The same 
	collective approach could be productive in other areas of 
	multinational corporate activity, including community development, 
	aboriginal issues, labour relations and human rights.
	<p>
	Let me sum up.  Codes of conduct can be useful for multinational 
	corporations, and beneficial to the countries where they operate, but 
	they have their limits.  Global principles are subject to varying 
	interpretations and applications in different countries and under 
	different circumstances.  Therefore, globally applicable comprehensive 
	codes of conduct are difficult, if not impossible, to develop; but the 
	effort may be very enlightening to corporations which try.  Individual 
	corporations, however compelling their code of conduct, however 
	well-intentioned and powerful they may seem, have limited ability to 
	change overall social conditions in their countries of operation.  
	Collective action by corporations and other institutions in accordance 
	with country-specific codes of conduct which they jointly develop 
	offer the best hope of bringing
	about positive social change.

	Managing an environmental crisis</a><br>
	</h2>
    
    <font size=-1>
    <strong>Vancouver Mining Investment Conference</strong><br> 
    November 15, 1996<br>
    Westin Bayshore Hotel<br>
	Vancouver, British Columbia<br>
  
    <p>
	<strong>Address to the Randol by Hugh Leggatt, Manager, Corporate 
	Communications, Placer Dome Inc.</strong>
	</font>
	

	<p>
	
	I want you to know at the outset that Placer Dome's reputation is as 
	solid as the gold we mine.  This year for the first time we tarnished 
	our record. But we're making every effort to reclaim it.
	<p>
	In March, after many years of good performance, we suffered a major 
	environmental mishap.  We have done our best to face up to the 
	situation, act responsibly, make restitution and ultimately acquit 
	ourselves with honour.
	<p>
	Still, in some quarters we were pilloried as environmental bandits.  
	This came as a shock to the system, because we are a strongly 
	principled company.  We have thought through our values, and we are 
	committed to doing the right thing.  So our regret was absolute.
	<p>
	Today I'd like to tell you what happened, what we have done about it 
	and what we have learned from it.
	<p>
	The spill took place in the Philippines, at the Marcopper Mine, of 
	which we own 40%.  In accord with the environmental compliance 
	certificate issued by the Government, this decommissioned open pit was 
	being used to store tailing, the ground-up rock and water left after 
	the copper is extracted.
	<p>
	Back in the 1970s, to prevent storm water from accumulating in the pit 
	when it was being mined, a two-kilometre-long tunnel was drilled from 
	the pit bottom through a mountain to the headwaters of the Boac River.
	<p>
	To ready the pit for tailing storage, in 1991 the upstream end of the 
	tunnel was collapsed, and the downstream opening was sealed with an 
	eight-metre-long concrete plug, secured to the rock by steel rods.
	
	In 1992, four years ago, the pit began to fill with tailing from the 
	new San Antonio mine.  In 1995, in the course of studies into future 
	tailing disposal, seepage was detected from the mountainside near 
	where the tunnel was plugged.
	<p>
	As a precautionary measure, on the advice of a consultant, it was 
	decided to drill into the tunnel and plug it further by pumping in 
	more concrete. The first borehole had been drilled, when on March 24 
	this year the tunnel gave way and tailing began pouring out into the 
	environment.
	<p>
	All told, three to four million tonnes of material escaped through the 
	tunnel into the Boac River system.  It was a very serious and 
	regrettable situation. It could have been worse, however.  Fortunately 
	the tailing was not toxic to humans.  No lives were lost, and a United 
	Nations investigation has independently confirmed that no one was made 
	sick.  We believe the damage to the river is reversible.
	<p>
	Still, the river is heavily silted, resulting in a significant impact 
	on aquatic life.  The lives of more than 20,000 people were disrupted.  
	Crops, commerce and community life were affected.
	<p>
	Our response was swift.  We tended to the immediate needs of the 
	nearby communities and were absolutely frank about what had happened.  
	We adopted a policy of full disclosure of all information to anyone 
	who might conceivably be interested, including admitting friend and 
	foe to the site to take a look.
	<p>
	We also sought to make amends.  Although only a 40% shareholder, we 
	assumed 100% responsibility.  We took a US$40 million charge 
	against earnings to cover financial obligations for Marcopper, 
	including US$15 million for repairs and environmental 
	mitigation.  As a result, Placer Dome posted a loss for the first six 
	months and first nine months of 1996.
	<p>
	We are now doing our best to clean up and to make restitution.  We 
	have installed a plug in the tunnel using a mixture of heated bitumen 
	and concrete.  The mixture was pumped down a fence of 20 boreholes 
	into the voids of the tunnel and surrounding rock.
	<p>
	This water running clear from the tunnel in May has stopped.  The 
	bitumen and concrete is holding while we drive another tunnel parallel 
	to the first to gain physical access to put in a permanent plug.
	<p>
	We have dredged a kilometre-long channel across the river at its 
	mouth. This will trap the coarse tailing moving along the river bottom 
	and prevent it from silting up the delta.  The finer material floating 
	down the river will disperse naturally in the ocean and the river 
	should over time return to normal.  Underwater disposal renders the 
	material inert and is regarded as the safest long-term solution.
	<p>
	We are compensating fisherfolk for the temporary effects on fisheries.  
	We are compensating others for loss of income, damage to property and 
	inconvenience.  We are moving people in danger of flooding to new 
	houses on higher ground.
	<p>
	 We are establishing a sustainable development programme projected for 
	 at least 10 years into the future.  This is to improve the condition 
	 of affected communities through upgraded infrastructure, better 
	 education and health facilities and technically more advanced 
	 fisheries and farms.
	<p>
	Local wells are being scientifically monitored, the health of 
	inhabitants is being scrutinized, and politicians are taking an 
	interest in the area.
	<p>
	As awful as it was, the tailing spill has triggered significant 
	benefits for the people of Marinduque Island. For our part, we 
	have given up our operational role.  The Mine Manager and the 
	President, who are Placer Dome employees, have resigned from 
	Marcopper. And we are divesting ourselves of our interest in the 
	company.  But we will complete the remedial work.
	<p>
	We faced up to this with our best effort - full disclosure and 
	everything possible in the way of mitigation and compensation.
	<p>
	<strong>What have we learned?</strong><br>
	From the international perspective, the incident created 
	communications challenges, especially regarding news reporting in 
	different cultures.
	<p>
	The Filipino media have only recently emerged from a long era of 
	government control.  As a consequence, some reporters and editors 
	don't follow courtesies like balancing allegations of wrongdoing with 
	replies from those who stand accused.
	<p>
	Although the spill was not toxic to humans and no one became sick, the 
	Manila media was full of reports of sick and injured people, dead 
	animals and general devastation.  They always described the tailing as 
	toxic. While we fully acknowledged that the silt in the river channel 
	was bad enough, it was made to seem much worse than it was.
	<p>
	The problems arose for us here in Vancouver when international news 
	agencies picked up exaggerated or incorrect reports in Manila and ran 
	them as straight wire stories in North America.  We found ourselves 
	continually on the defensive in responding to errors of magnitude 
	throughout the coverage.
	<p>
	The only useful response was full disclosure.  Every time the word 
	"toxic" came up, we had to call up and clarify.
	<p>
	In telling a mining story to the public you clearly start at a 
	disadvantage.  The nature of mining makes us easy targets.  We move 
	dirt and rock to make pits.  We use chemicals.  We create hazardous 
	waste.  We make rather large holes in the ground.
	<p>
	This makes for images that are graphic and disturbing to most people.  
	We live in a popular-movie-and-TV culture that prizes image and 
	presentation over reasoned analysis.  In this, ugly equals bad.
	<p>
	An additional factor is that the battle is fought by the power of 
	communications on the Internet, so that for example an accident in the 
	Philippines immediately becomes ammunition to oppose new mine 
	developments in far-off places like South America.
	<p>
	We also live at a time when industry is not trusted, but 
	environmentalists are considered credible.  The reason is 
	understandable: in spite of all the benefits conferred on humanity 
	since the Industrial Revolution, goods-producing industries like ours 
	went through a long phase in which no one cared about the environment.
	<p>
	The fact that industry has learned its lesson and has changed over the 
	past generation is not generally accepted.  Today we build mines to 
	much higher standards of environmental protection than when Marcopper 
	was built in the late 1960s.  Our mine in Venezuela will have 
	tremendous tailing dam safety factors and a process to recycle the 
	cyanide.
	<p>
	The only way to counter opposition is to operate mines that do not 
	pollute, and to operate them that way for a long, long time.
	<p>
	In the meantime, every medium of communication -- including the 
	Internet -- should be used to counter misinformation with verifiable 
	facts. Ultimately, good information should drive out bad.
	<p>
	At Placer Dome, we welcome public scrutiny of our activities and are 
	prepared to respond constructively to criticism.  Our future success 
	as an international mining company depends on maintaining our 
	credibility as being environmentally responsible.
	<p>
	The countries and communities that host our mines need to know that we 
	at Placer Dome will protect and preserve their interests.  The 
	authorities who have decision-making power over our projects have 
	every right, indeed a duty, to question whether we will be good 
	corporate citizens.
	<p>
	The millions of dollars we are spending in the Philippines, and the 
	effort we have made to tell the  truth about what happened, are in 
	keeping with our ethical standards and an investment in our future 
	ability to develop mines worldwide.
	<p>
	Another investment we want to make is to improve relationships with 
	special interest groups, especially those with environmental agendas.
	<p>
	We genuinely care about their concerns.  We are prepared to address 
	their worries about our projects and mines in a spirit of open 
	communication.  We want to find what is the right thing to do; what is 
	acceptable to a broad range of special interests.  We want to go 
	forward with more supporters and fewer enemies.
	<p>
	Mining companies and environmentalists really have much in common.  
	Most people today, including those of us employed by mining companies, 
	possess strong environmental values as individuals.  Environmental 
	sensitivity is part of today's culture.
	<p>
	A large part of our intended growth will depend on how well we manage 
	the environmental and social dimensions of international mining.
	<p>
	Good neighbouring with good mining is the way to go.  The accident at
	Marcopper has only strengthened our resolve to be the best.

	<P>
	The new opening in Latin America to foreign investment in mining that 
	has occurred during the past five years is driven by a powerful 
	combination of economic necessity and ideological evolution in many 
	countries of the region.  One by one, beginning with Chile in the late 
	1980s, countries in Latin America have revised their mining codes, 
	taxation regimes and foreign investment laws so as to become more 
	attractive to multinational mining companies.  The result has been a 
	veritable rush of mining companies from the industrialized world into 
	Latin America in pursuit of mineral exploration and mine development 
	opportunities.
	<P>
	As we enter these countries, which have for many years been 
	effectively closed off to us, we are encountering unfamiliar and 
	difficult challenges. The quest for minerals often takes us to the 
	frontier zones of countries. There we find migratory populations of 
	small scale miners (garimp&#233;iros), working the surface of the same 
	lands for which the large scale developmental rights are being granted 
	by governments to the newly-invited-in foreign mining companies.  In 
	many countries of Latin America, we are coming into contact with 
	indigenous populations, whose rights of land ownership and usage 
	generally remain poorly defined in their countries' laws.  Frequently, 
	we face environmental issues, related to the impact of our activities 
	on sensitive ecosystems newly exposed to our presence, such as 
	tropical rain forests.  Generally, we find ourselves relating to 
	governmental regulatory agencies whose mandates and responsibilities 
	often greatly exceed their managerial and technical capacity.  More 
	fundamentally, we are communicating across cultures, confronting 
	values and habits which may at various points conflict with our own 
	basic beliefs and principles as to what is right, acceptable and 
	conducive to everyone's best interests.  Finally, as extractors of a 
	depleting resource, we are inevitably prompting questions from various 
	quarters as to how mining can possibly contribute to long-term 
	sustainable development.
	<P>
	Responding to these challenges is imposing extensive demands on our 
	resources of time, talent and effort, as well as on our capacity for 
	flexibility, ingenuity and strategic thinking.  Each situation and set 
	of circumstances requires its own, often unique, response.  However, 
	at least three generalizations appear appropriate.
	<p>
	First, multinational mining companies need the support of other 
	organizations which can bring talent and expertise to addressing the 
	social challenges around mine development.  For example, national or 
	multilateral aid agencies may have a role to play in optimizing the 
	developmental potential of a mine in the surrounding area.  
	Non-governmental organizations (NGOs), focused for example on 
	environment (assuming they are scientifically oriented and not purely 
	political), or on social and economic development, or on particular 
	interests, such as indigenous people, may also complement and add 
	credibility to a company's efforts to deal with issues relating to the 
	development of a mine.  Most importantly, foreign mining companies 
	need to be clearly allied to the interests of surrounding communities 
	in a strong spirit of cooperation with their local institutions.  Not 
	uncommonly in frontier zones, foreign companies run the risk of 
	becoming surrogate governments, directly providing goods and services 
	to neighbouring communities, which the government may have the 
	responsibility but not the capacity to deliver.  Our role as foreign 
	mining companies should be not to replace community or national 
	governments but rather to strengthen, and sometimes help create, local 
	institutions that are able to foster community growth and improvement.
	<p>
	Secondly, multinational mining companies need to clearly recognize and 
	respect the ethical principles that relate to our activities.  
	Corruption, human rights and social issues in many developing 
	countries raise ethical challenges.  These have the potential to 
	become as demanding of the industry's attention and its ability to 
	respond as have been environmental challenges during the past couple 
	of decades.  We need to think through our role with respect to 
	combatting official corruption, to promoting political change in 
	support of human rights, and towards acting as a catalyst for local 
	and national economic and social progress.  Ultimately, I think we 
	will need to articulate our global ethical principles and hold 
	ourselves accountable to acting in conformity with those principles.
	<p>
	Thirdly, multinational mining companies need to define our activities 
	in the framework of "sustainable development".  This policy 
	orientation, following the Rio Convention of 1992 (referred to as 
	Agenda 21), has been embraced by many governments in Latin America.  
	The concept of sustainable development, however, is open to various 
	definitions; but key elements for the mining industry include 
	effective public consultation with populations affected by mine 
	development, equitable distribution of wealth generated by mining to 
	local communities, and effective management of the environmental and 
	socio-economic impacts of mining both during operations and after mine 
	closure.
	<p>
	Let me offer you a specific example of Placer Dome's social 
	investment at one of our projects in Latin America, namely the Las 
	Cristinas mine in Venezuela.  Las Cristinas is located in a 
	frontier zone in Southeastern Bolivar state, near the border with 
	Guyana.  At Las Cristinas Placer Dome has entered into a 70/30 
	joint venture agreement with the CorporationVenezolano de Guayana 
	(CVG) to explore and eventually mine the surface and bedrock gold 
	deposits of the contract area.  Until now gold production in 
	Bolivar State has been derived mainly from small-scale operations 
	by local artisanal miners (garimp&#233;iros), whose activities 
	have been practised in an environmentally disruptive way.  The Las 
	Cristinas project once developed would be the first large scale 
	gold mine in Venezuela, and could serve as a model of 
	environmentally and socially responsible private sector mining. 
	The Las Cristinas mine will be developed at a capital cost of 
	US$576 million, with a projected production rate in excess of 400,000 
	ounces per year, and a mine life of at least 13 years.  During its 
	operating life, the mine is expected to employ 850 people, most of 
	whom will be hired within Venezuela. Placer Dome's  long-term 
	objectives go beyond the construction and operation of a 
	successful mine, and include the creation of new business 
	opportunities in the region and the sharing of the benefits of 
	success with both the government (national and state) and local 
	communities representing 4000 people.
	<p>
	Las Cristinas is a prime example of a mine on the frontier of a 
	developing country.  There is an indigenous population of over 20 
	villages located within a 50 kilometre radius of the project, with the 
	two closest villages (10 and 25 km away) having together a population 
	of approximately 500.  In general, the recent influx of international 
	mining companies into the area has been a cause of concern, 
	particularly for those indigenous communities which are sandwiched 
	between contract areas.  While the Las Cristinas contract area does 
	not abut or encroach on native claimed lands, other companies' areas 
	do.  This has lent increased momentum to indigenous efforts to clarify 
	the legal status of their traditional use areas and secure legal 
	recognition from both the federal and state governments, efforts which 
	thus far have met with limited success.
	<p>
	Indigenous village economies are typically mixed, based on both 
	traditional activities (agriculture, hunting and fishing) and 
	commercial activities (forest products, carpentry, artisanal mining, 
	poultry farming, ecotourism and handicrafts).  For the past few years, 
	local village leadership has been actively promoting the expansion and 
	diversification of the non-traditional cash economy with the explicit 
	goal of increasing autonomy and providing resources for the 
	strengthening of traditional activities and social institutions.  As a 
	result of their longer history and more cohesive social and political 
	organisation, both their physical and social infrastructures are 
	better developed and of higher quality than those of the 
	non-indigenous communities.  This is especially so with regard to 
	housing stock, roads, water supply, sanitation, educational and 
	recreational facilities.
	<p>
	Of all the communities in the general area, the indigenous communities 
	are best positioned to take advantage of new economic opportunities 
	provided by the presence of foreign mining companies.  Two communities 
	have already secured carpentry and forest product supply contracts 
	from the Las Cristinas project. It should be noted, moreover, that 
	these indigenous communities are shielded from the direct impacts of 
	our proposed mine, due to their physical distance and social isolation 
	from the Las Cristinas site.
	<p>
	The non-indigenous communities in the Las Cristinas region present a 
	much more difficult challenge for Placer Dome.  The Las Cristinas 
	contract area was inhabited and mined by Venezuelan nationals and 
	foreign migrants (referred to collectively as "criollos") on a 
	quasi-legal basis from the 1950s until 1990/1991.  At this time, the 
	area was cleared of inhabitants by the CVG, with about 2800 people 
	being relocated to a site approximately 5 kilometres east of the 
	contract area.  Today the displaced communities are home to around 
	1700 people, living in two villages, Santo Domingo and Ciudad Dorada 
	(also known as Nuevas Claritas).  The majority of inhabitants continue 
	to derive their livelihood from small-scale mining activities. Since 
	no "legal" mining areas were assigned to the small miners by the 
	government at the time of relocation, this activity now occurs 
	illegally. Miners continue to work in areas where they have 
	historically operated, i.e. contract areas now assigned to the 
	international mining companies. Such "unauthorised" mining provides a 
	livelihood for 42% of the economically active population within the 
	general area, and for 65% and 45% of the Santo Domingo and Ciudad 
	Dorada workforces respectively. The "criollo" communities near to Las 
	Cristinas (in contrast to the indigenous communities) are politically 
	disorganised and lack social cohesion.  Almost all economic activity - 
	both formal and informal - derives from the "illegal" mining of gold, 
	an activity that has become increasingly difficult to practice both 
	locally and regionally within the past few years.  This is due both to 
	the lack of a supportive legal and institutional framework and to the 
	re-assignment of lands to international mining companies.
	<p>
	The situation of these "criollo" communities does not lend itself to 
	social stability.  Living conditions remain primitive for most 
	residents. Unfortunately, local and regional governance has 
	historically worked to benefit not the communities overall, but rather 
	selected individuals.  As such, these communities have been left 
	largely to their own devices for the delivery of essential public 
	services.  Central government intervention in the area is limited to 
	basic law enforcement via the National Guard. Rudimentary health care 
	facilities and services (a walk-in medical clinic) are provided free 
	of charge by the State Government.  Recently the State Government 
	announced its intention to abandon fiscal support of the two public 
	elementary schools in the area due to budgetary constraints.
	<p>
	Social and economic baseline studies have identified a number of 
	critical feature of the criollo communities, including:
	<p>
	<li>low educational and skill levels among the local populations,
	<li>lack of alternate economic activities and work opportunities, 
	<li>lack of property rights and security of residential tenancy, 
	<li>deficient and insufficient housing stock, 
	<li>inadequate or absent basic public services (health, 
	sanitation, potable water supply, communications, electrification, 
	education, recreation, etc.),
	<li>lack of access to mineral resources for artisanal mining, 
	<li>endemic public health problems, including malaria, intestinal 
	parasites, and venereal diseases.
	<p>
	These existing conditions, along with the displacement experience, 
	underlie much of the mistrust and anxiety within the local "criollo" 
	communities. The establishment of large-scale mining operations in the 
	area by international mining companies will have the potential to 
	intensify certain of these negative conditions, while ameliorating 
	others.  In the first instance, the limitation of access to old mining 
	areas enforced by some of the mining companies has already adversely 
	affected livelihood and life in some of the communities, exacerbating 
	already high levels of tension and anxiety.  In late May-early June 
	1995, one local community blockaded the main road into the mining 
	areas.  This action was the community's response to intensified 
	harassment from the National Guard and to the hard-line attitude of 
	one of the Canada-based junior mining companies operating in the area.  
	The community confronted the National Guard at that company's mining 
	property and eventually overran the property.
	<p>
	In sharp contrast, we have decided to countenance small-scale 
	artisanal mining activity on parts of the Las Cristinas property, 
	while also initiating a social investment program during the final 
	stage of the exploration program.  For example, assistance was 
	provided to expand the local school, improve the local clinic and 
	install a new water storage tank.  During the recent roadblock, only 
	vehicles of the Las Cristinas project were allowed unhindered passage 
	by the townspeople.  As a result of this affirmative and conciliatory 
	approach to the communities, the Las Cristinas project and the company 
	are positively viewed and its early efforts at social investment 
	appear to be appreciated.
	<p>
	Building a positive relationship with the local "criollo" communities 
	through limited social investment during the exploration stage is, 
	however, only the first step towards effectively addressing the 
	challenges of mine development on the frontier.  Maintaining social 
	stability in the area around the mine through an on-going program of 
	community improvement throughout the life of the mine will be a key 
	success factor for the Las Cristinas project.  Sustaining those social 
	and economic improvements after the mine closes will be the ultimate 
	challenge.
	<p>
	We recognize that the impact of the Las Cristinas project on the local 
	communities will be mixed.  There will be positive impacts in the form 
	of jobs, business opportunities, and mine related improvements in the 
	local physical and social infrastructure.  However, there will also be 
	negative impacts, such as: inflationary pressures on local commerce; 
	an influx of outsiders through migration towards a "growth pole"; an 
	increase in social problems such as alcoholism, gambling and 
	prostitution; a loss of livelihood by many artisanal miners; an 
	increase in political opportunism and local corruption; pressures on 
	the cultural integrity of local indigenous communities; and the list 
	goes on.  These are the potential downsides of mine development in an 
	already rough-and-tumble frontier zone.
	<p>
	To optimize the potential benefits and counter the possible adverse 
	effects of the mine development, a long-term socio-economic 
	improvement program is beginning to be implemented by the Las 
	Cristinas project designed to strengthen community capabilities and 
	institutions.  Over the life of the mine, the programme aims:
	<p>
	<li>to improve the general level of income within the local communities 
	and its equitable distribution within communities,
	<li>to facilitate the creation of a sustainable, diversified 
	economy, 
	<li>to encourage local initiatives and the development of stable 
	communities, 
	<li>to increase the level of education and training within 
	communities,
	<li>to improve quality of life and access to essential public 
	goods and services.
	<li>to minimise environmental impacts of new and existing 
	activities,
	<li>to increase the participation of women in the development 
	effort.
	<p>
	To describe the details of this socio-economic program would take us 
	beyond the time available for this presentation; but one point must be 
	stressed. We are implementing this social investment strategy in line 
	with these principles I stated at the beginning by: (1) collaborating 
	with government agencies and non-governmental organizations focused on 
	economic and social development; (2) acting according to ethical 
	principles in addressing social challenges around our mine operations; 
	and (3) structuring our overall social investment in the context of 
	sustainable development.
	<p>
	Recently we have entered into an agreement with CIDA (September 20, 
	1996) under the Industrial Co-operation program, to complete the 
	viability study for a project referred to as "Local Economic 
	Diversification Initiatives (Social Economic Improvement Program)" 
	related to the Las Cristinas mining project.  The objective of the 
	viability study is to create a strategic and action oriented framework 
	for promoting the long-term social, economic and environmental 
	sustainability of the local community through the activities of 
	Venezuelan NGO's strengthened by Canadian NGOs, with support from 
	Placer Dome.  We already have an alliance with the local Catholic 
	church NGO, Fe y Alegria, and have entered discussions with other 
	Venezuelan NGOs. The viability study, which is scheduled to be 
	completed by May, 1997, will set out the terms of reference for a 
	program of implementation, which it is envisaged will also take the 
	form of a continuing Placer Dome-CIDA partnership.
	<p>
	The Placer Dome-CIDA "Local Economic Diversification Initiatives" 
	project is designed to augment and realize the potential of a number of 
	possible developmental projects, such as ecotourism expansion in the 
	area, aviculture facility upgrading, technical assistance for small 
	scale mining, sewing workshops for local communities, cement block 
	fabrication and many other possible projects.  The viability study 
	will focus on defining specific needs related to these proposed 
	projects, such as training and education, local organisational and 
	leadership capacity enhancement, micro-enterprise financing through 
	revolving funds, and so forth.  The viability study will help resolve 
	uncertainty within the local communities as to what types and forms of 
	assistance and partnerships with respect to new or alternative 
	business development they might reasonably expect during the 
	construction and operating life of the mine.
	<p>
	The partnership model of social investment (Placer Dome with CIDA and 
	with Venezuelan and Canadian NGOs) positions the company as one player 
	among many in the community development field.  Moreover, it holds out 
	the hope of creating an institutional structure in support of 
	continuing community improvement which can go on after the closure of 
	the mine.  Finally, this model also gives the company allies, which 
	may act as defense mechanisms against future political risk, as the 
	mine will not be an isolated foreign company presence in southeast 
	Bolivar state, which some future Venezuelan government may for 
	whatever political purpose target.
	<p>
	In conclusion, let me say that I know of no perfect solutions for any 
	of the many challenges posed to mine development in the frontier zones 
	of Latin America.  What matters most is the correct orientation.  What 
	we can achieve may be limited to incremental improvements in the right 
	direction. However, over the life of a mine, the accumulation of those 
	improvements can become truly significant.  A key factor in making 
	sustainable progress will be the involvement of international aid 
	agencies and non-governmental organizations, whose institutional 
	presence can help support and maintain the levels of development 
	achieved, even beyond the life of the mine.  Our intention is to bring 
	about social, environmental and economic improvements which make a 
	lasting contribution to the development of the country where we are 
	operating.  At the end of the day, we recognize that mining can only 
	be judged in the context of sustainable development by what remains 
	after the mine closes.

	<strong>Remarks by John M. Willson, President and Chief Executive Officer,
	Placer Dome Inc.</strong>
	</font>
    <p>

        Good Morning Ladies and Gentlemen, and thank you for joining 
        us. My name is John Willson and I am the President and Chief 
        Executive Officer of Placer Dome.  With me are Sandy Laird, 
        Senior Vice-President, Placer Dome Group, and Ian Austin, 
        Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer.
    <p>
        By now you will have seen the press release we issued this 
        morning with regard to the Marcopper mine, announcing a 
        provision of US$40 million against second quarter earnings as 
        a result of the accidental escape of tailing.   We are here 
        today to give you some background and fill in some blanks.  
        There are a few things I believe it is important that you 
        understand.
    <p>
        All of us at Placer Dome highly value our environmental track 
        record and are saddened to have it tarnished by this accident. 
        Those of you who know us will appreciate how distressing this 
        has been -- especially when so many other things are going 
        right for the Company.
<p>
        The Pipeline and Musselwhite mine projects are off to 
        excellent starts and it appears the very least they will do is 
        come in on schedule and budget.  The puzzle at Las Cristinas 
        is getting quite complete and exploration drilling on the 
        Sofia and Mesones targets is progressing well and producing 
        encouraging results that we will be telling you about before 
        too long.
<p>
        We feel very strongly that Placer Dome should do everything it 
        can to correct the situation at Marcopper.  That is why we are 
        incurring what seems to be a very large amount given that we 
        only have a 40% interest.
<p>
        This is in keeping with a commitment I have made to the 
        President of the Philippines, that we will fix the situation 
        -- even though it has become apparent that Marcopper doesn't 
        have the financial ability to do this on its own.
<p>
        We have some of our best engineering talent assigned to the 
        task, and a swarm of consultants, and they have now devised 
        solutions to repair the tunnel.  We also have a remediation  
        plan awaiting government approval which is centred on dredging 
        of the mouth of the Boac river.
<p>
        Sandy Laird can answer any detailed questions you may have on 
        the technical area, but I will tell you that no tailing flow 
        has occurred since June 11.  Water which appears to be mostly 
        clear groundwater continues to seep at the rate of 120 litres 
        per second.  Work continues to completely stem this flow 
        including further use of bitumen as a sealing agent.
<p>
        Our approach to permanently plugging the tunnel is twofold.  
        We are mobilizing equipment to blind bore from surface to 
        provide access for installing a plug, however ground 
        conditions may prevent this strategy from being successful.  
        We are therefore also preparing to drive a second tunnel next 
        to and parallel with the original one.  If this plan proceeds, 
        we would then drive a drift from the second tunnel to the 
        first to provide access for installing the plug.
<p>
        With regard to river clean-up, we have applied to dredge a 
        deep channel which would intersect the Boac River at its 
        mouth.  Over time we would expect this channel to collect 
        about 30% to 40% of the tailing now deposited in the river, 
        with the remainder being dispersed in the ocean. There is 
        already evidence this has process has started to occur as 
        rainfall increases.
<p>
        We are of course very concerned for the local community, 
        particularly with the monsoon season approaching.  To protect 
        against flooding, we are building berms and dykes along the 
        river, and starting to relocate families whose homes are the 
        most at risk.  A small protective harbour facility is also 
        being built near the mouth of the river for the local 
        fishermen's boats.
<p>
        Jim Cooney, whom some of you know, has just returned from 
        Marinduque where he has been co-ordinating the involvement of 
        non-government organizations.  They are ensuring that the 
        needs of the community are being satisfied.
<p>
        It is important that I point out that Placer Dome does not 
        have control of Marcopper Mining Corporation, since we have 
        had only three Directors on an eight-member Board.
<p>
        The controlling shareholder, who acquired his position in 1994 
        from the Philippine Committee for Good Government, is becoming 
        more involved in the Company than the previous benign 
        shareholder -- to the extent that our representatives have now 
        stepped down from their respective positions as President and 
        General Manager.  The controlling shareholder is appointing 
        his own representatives to these positions from Marcopper 
        personnel.
<p>
        As a result, we will no longer be involved in any on-going 
        operations at Marcopper.  We remain concerned that the mine 
        re-open and will stay involved to see that environmental and 
        community issues be properly dealt with.  But the prospects 
        for re-opening are uncertain.
<p>
        The mine's Environmental Compliance Certificate has been 
        lifted, the copper price cycle appears to have turned and 
        Marcopper's financial situation has not fully recovered from 
        previous typhoons.  Together these factors have caused us to 
        finally conclude that Marcopper may not be able to service its 
        debt and a provision against earnings is required.
<p>
        Let me say how important it is for Placer Dome to see this 
        process at Marcopper through to an appropriate conclusion.  It 
        is critical to our strategic plan that we do so, since we have 
        been working so hard to successfully resolve environmental 
        issues at new projects in Venezuela and Costa Rica and will 
        need to do the same for all the other mines we plan to build 
        in future.
<p>
        In essence, we are trying to look at this expenditure at 
        Marcopper
        as an investment in our future ability to develop mines worldwide.

    </font>

    <p>
	 As a result of the current global opening to foreign investment in 
	 mining, companies such as Placer Dome are moving into unfamiliar and 
	 difficult environments, areas formerly off-limits to us, frontier 
	 zones, where we are confronting a range of difficult and demanding 
	 challenges.  We are encountering migratory populations of small scale 
	 miners (garimp&#233;iros), working the surface of the same lands for 
	 which the large scale developmental rights are being granted by 
	 governments to the newly invited-in foreign companies.  We are coming 
	 into contact with indigenous populations whose rights of land 
	 ownership and usage in most cases remain undefined in their 
	 countries' laws.  We are facing environmental issues, related to the 
	 impact of our activities on sensitive ecosystems newly exposed to our 
	 presence, such as tropical rainforests.  We are entering 
	 relationships with governmental regulatory agencies whose mandates 
	 and responsibilities often greatly exceed their managerial and 
	 technical capacity.  More fundamentally, we are relating across 
	 cultures to value systems and habitual practices which at various 
	 points conflict with our own basic beliefs and principles as to what 
	 is right, acceptable and conducive to everyone's best interests.  
	 Finally, as extractors of a depleting resource, we are inevitably 
	 giving rise to questions from various quarters as to how mining can 
	 possibly contribute to long-term sustainable development.
	<p>
	Responding to these challenges is imposing extensive demands on our 
	resources of time, talent and effort, as well as on our capacity for 
	flexibility, ingenuity and strategic thinking.  Each situation and set 
	of circumstances requires its own, often unique, response.  However, 
	at least three generalizations appear appropriate.
	<p>
	First, multinational mining companies need to reach out to credible 
	allies, institutions which can lend support in addressing these 
	challenges.  For example, national or multilateral aid agencies may 
	have a role to play in optimizing the developmental potential of a 
	mine in the surrounding area. Global non-governmental organizations 
	(NGOs), focused for example on environment (assuming they are 
	scientifically oriented and not purely political), or on social and 
	economic development, or on particular interests, such as indigenous 
	people, may also complement and add credibility to a company's efforts 
	to deal with these issues.  Within countries, foreign mining companies 
	need to be clearly allied to the interests of communities in a strong 
	spirit of cooperation with their local institutions.  Not uncommonly 
	in frontier zones, foreign companies run the risk of becoming 
	surrogate governments, directly providing goods and services to the 
	surrounding community, which the government may have the 
	responsibility but not the capacity to deliver.  Our role should be to 
	strengthen, and sometimes help create, local institutions to support 
	community growth and improvement.
	<p>
	Secondly, multinational mining companies need to clearly recognize and 
	respect the ethical principles that relate to our activities.  
	Corruption, human rights and social issues in many developing 
	countries raise ethical challenges.  These have the potential to 
	become as demanding of the industry's attention and its ability to 
	respond as have been environmental challenges during the past couple 
	of decades.
	<p>
	We need to think through our role with respect to combatting official 
	corruption, to promoting political change in support of human rights, 
	and towards acting as a catalyst for local and national economic and 
	social progress.  Ultimately, I think we will need to articulate our 
	global ethical principles and hold ourselves accountable to acting in 
	conformity with those principles.
	<p>
	Thirdly, multinational mining companies need to define our activities 
	in the framework of "sustainable development."  This policy 
	orientation is being embraced by many governments, including those of 
	many developing countries.  The concept of sustainable development is 
	open to many definitions, but key elements for the mining industry 
	include effective public consultation with populations affected by 
	mine development, equitable distribution of wealth generated by mining 
	to local communities, and effective management of the environmental 
	and socio-economic impacts of mining both during operations and after 
	mine closure.
	<p>
	With this background, I invite you to consider one case of a 
	multinational mining company endeavouring to meet the challenges of 
	building a mine in a frontier zone of a developing country: Placer 
	Dome's Las Cristinas mine in Venezuela, as captured in this brief 
	video clip from an hour-long CNN program on the globalization of gold 
	mining.
	<p>
	(Show video: CNN clip "Fool's Gold")<p>
	Placer Dome is endeavouring to address the complex set of challenges 
	you have just seen through the following multi-faceted strategy:
	<p>
     <strong>(1) Public participation in decision-making.</strong>  Planning for the 
     Las Cristinas mine has involved extensive public consultation 
     with all affected communities, indigenous people, small miners 
     and municipalities in the region.  One instrument of public 
     consultation is the socio-economic impact study, which was 
     undertaken by Venezuelan sociologists, anthropologists, 
     economists and community relations professionals during the 
     course of a year.  Ultimately, the way in which the operation 
     relates to local communities needs to clearly reflect their 
     expressed needs and preferences.
	<p>
	<strong>(2) Constructive engagement with the small scale miners.</strong>  We are 
	facilitating the development of a cooperative with limited membership, 
	which will be allowed to continue small scale mining on a defined part 
	of the Las Cristinas concession.
	<p>
	<strong>(3) A program for improving the health and environmental impact of 
	small scale mining.</strong>  We particularly want to eliminate their use of 
	mercury to recover gold.
	<p>
	<strong>(4) Community improvement.</strong>  We are supporting community self-help 
	programs involved in building community physical infrastructure, as 
	well as local institutional development, with a particular focus on 
	municipal government.
	<p>
	<strong>(5) Training and education of the local community.</strong>  We want to enable 
	as many local people as possible to find economic roles other than 
	small scale mining, either through employment by our mine or in other 
	local businesses, or through the start-up of their own small 
	enterprises.
	<p>
	<strong>(6) Provision of financing mechanisms for small business start-up.</strong>  We 
	are looking into the possible establishment of a cooperatively run 
	revolving fund, which would provide loan financing to local 
	entrepreneurs.
	<p>
     <strong>(7) Coming to terms with the rain forest issue.</strong>  We believe 
     that our environmental management and reclamation plans are 
     more favourable to the long term well-being of the rain forest 
     than the unrestricted activity of small scale miners.  
     Nevertheless, some forest will need to be removed to 
     accommodate the Las Cristinas mine.  To compensate, a program 
     of forest enhancement, using former small scale miners who 
     have been appropriately trained may be implemented.
	<p>
	<strong>(8) Collaboration with Venezuelan and Canadian NGOs in the foregoing 
	community development initiatives.</strong>  We have an alliance with the local 
	Catholic church NGO, Fe y Alegria, and have entered discussions with 
	other Venezuelan NGOs, with CIDA, and with Canadian NGOs.
	<p>
	In conclusion, let me say that I know of no perfect solutions to any 
	of the many challenges posed to mine development in the frontier zones 
	of the world.  What matters most is the correct orientation.  What we 
	can achieve may be limited to incremental improvements in the right 
	direction. However, over the life of a mine, the accumulation of those 
	improvements can become truly significant.  A key factor in making 
	sustainable progress will be the involvement of non-governmental 
	organizations whose institutional presence can help maintain the 
	levels of development achieved, even beyond the life of the mine.  Our 
	objective is to bring about social, environmental and economic 
	improvements which make a lasting contribution to the development of 
	the country where we are operating.  For at the end of the day, mining 
	can only be judged in the context of sustainable development by what remains after the mine closes.

    <strong>John Willson:</strong></a>
    <br>
      It is my privilege and pleasure to welcome you to Placer 
      Dome's Annual General  Meeting.
 <p>
      We are very unhappy and indeed humiliated to be conducting 
      this meeting under   the cloud of the unfortunate accident in 
      the Philippines. As Rob has said we will      be talking about 
      this and you will have the opportunity to ask questions to 
      which we will respond.
 <p>
      Before talking about Marcopper I just want to mention three 
      things:
	 <p>
	<li>We will be reporting a poor first quarter due to a number of mining 
	difficulties that reduced our gold output to below targeted levels.
	 <p>
	<li>We are very encouraged by news from Venezuela that exchange controls 
	will be lifted, news that favours our important Las Cristinas project.
	<p>
	<li>And we are very pleased that despite the shame we feel, and the 
	slings and arrows that we are suffering as a result of the Marcopper 
	accident, our shareholders continue to support us, as shown by the 
	share price.
	<p>
	In the Philippines on March 24th, a massive flow of mine waste which is 
	a mixture of sand and water called tailings started to escape from a 
	drainage tunnel into a river which flows 27 km to the ocean.  This is 
	the only environmental accident on this scale in which we have been 
	involved.  This should not have happened, we have expressed regret and 
	I do so again in all humility to you today.
	<p>
	Our immediate concern is for residents of the riverbanks that have 
	been affected and for their property.  Marcopper, with our backing, 
	has been quick and continues to be diligent in ensuring the health and 
	safety of the local population, in seeking to stop the flow and to 
	lessen the impacts of the sand, silt and water flows in the river.
	<p>
	As regrettable as this accident is, let us keep it in perspective.  No 
	person to our knowledge was injured by the spill, though there was 
	limited property damage.  No loss of livestock has been confirmed and 
	it is unlikely that any long-term environmental damage will occur.
	<p>
	We are well along with mobilizing the technical and financial 
	resources to stop the flow, determine the cause, assist and compensate 
	all the affected people, and to design and implement a permanent 
	solution. Henry Brehaut, our Senior Vice-President, Environment, who 
	has just returned from the Philippines, will bring us up-to-date on 
	the situation at Marcopper later in this presentation, and there will 
	be a question period during this meeting, and a media conference right 
	after it.
	<p>
	Reverting now to our presentation.
	<p>
	We are fortunate in Placer Dome to be making progress towards our 
	growth objective.
	<p>
	We have started construction of  two more mines this year and expect 
	to announce three more within 12 months.   By 1998, we expect to be 
	producing 2.5 million ounces of gold per year on an annualized basis.
	<p>
	To make today's presentation more informative, instead of a 
	report-back by myself from the podium, we have a number of our senior 
	managers from around the world.
	<p>
	As our Annual Report states, our goal is to provide growth for you, 
	our investors.  Our key to achieving this is to increase the value of  
	the Company by increasing our level of gold reserves and production 
	per share, as well as earnings and cash flow per share.
	<p>
	 That means each share you hold becomes more valuable because it 
	 represents more gold and more quality economic activity.
	<p>
	As a gold mining company, what sets us apart is our integrated ability 
	to raise and manage money, to find gold deposits, evaluate them, 
	develop and build them, and then to conduct mining operations and 
	environmental protection.
	<p>
	Our exploration pipeline has 85 mid-stage and advanced projects 
	located in 28 countries.  Of  these, the most exciting projects are in 
	Alaska and Costa Rica.  Further along the pipe are three development 
	projects close to approval, and closer to the production outlet are 
	two mines under construction.
	<p>
	Last year we completed construction of two new mines and two major 
	expansions.  I have a video clip here of one of those openings, a 
	blast at the Zald&#237;var mine in Chile.
	<p>
	That's a copper mine, but if we begin construction on new projects as 
	we expect we would add about 800,000 ounces of gold to our annual 
	output, and reach our production target of 2.5 million ounces of gold 
	per year on an annualized basis during 1998, about two years earlier 
	than we originally forecast in 1992.
	<p>
	During this period production from some of our existing mines, 
	particularly those in Papua New Guinea, will decline but this will be 
	eclipsed by the new production.
	<p>
	To give you a perspective on the people behind these achievements, to 
	show you a sampling of the strength and depth of our management team, 
	we have a number of people here today who will carry the presentation, 
	assisted by charts, pictures and video clips of our projects.
	<p>
	These people represent each of our strengths which, in total, we 
	believe make us a very strong competitor in our chosen field.
	<p>
	We have Ian Austin, our Senior Vice-President and Chief Financial 
	Officer to show you our strategy and how well we are doing with it, 
	and to briefly comment on recent results.
	<p>
	Eliseo Gonz&#225;lez-Urien, Senior Vice-President Exploration, will give 
	a brief overview of our ongoing gold finding success -- our 
	"legendary" exploration performance, as it was described by one 
	highly-respected gold analyst.
	<p>
	Bill Trythall, Vice-President Evaluations, who is responsible for 
	producing our feasibility studies and computing ore reserves and 
	resources, will speak about the process of  that activity and the 
	development part of the pipeline, an area that we believe is another 
	unusual strength.
	<p>
	We are diversified internationally, and fortunate that three of our 
	four regional CEOs were able to join us today from Canada (Doug 
	Fraser), the U.S. (Jay Taylor), and Latin America (Bill Hayes) to show 
	highlights of growth activities in their regions.  Unfortunately Dick 
	Zandee, the newly-appointed Managing Director of Placer Pacific in 
	Sydney, Australia, was unable to join us.
	<p>
	Lastly, but by no means least, Henry Brehaut, Senior Vice-President, 
	Environment, is here to say a few words about how we strive to lessen 
	the impacts of our activities and to make good what we have disturbed.  
	As I said, he will also update us on Marcopper.
	
	<p>
	<a name="02">
	<strong>Ian Austin:</strong></a>
	<br>
	<li> As John was saying, we seek global growth in gold.
	<p>
	<li> We intend to add shareholder value through successful exploration.
	<p>
	<li> While we produce metals other than gold, we plan to keep gold revenues 
	above 75% of total revenue.
	<p>
	<li> How are we doing relative to our plan?
	<p>
	<li> Our first quarter gold production, which I can announce today, was 
	458,000 ounces, which is less than planned, but we still expect to 
	achieve our goal of 2 million ounces in 1996.
	<p>
	<li> We are focused on gold production and on investing in exploration for 
	more gold.
	<p>
	<li> Total operating earnings show a growth trend.
	<p>
	<li> Decline in gold's contribution to total earnings in 1995 will turn 
	around in 1996.
	<p>
	<li> Exploration expense will remain at about $100 million per year.
	<p>
	<li> Canada generated half of  total operating earnings in 1995, much from 
	molybdenum.
	<p>
	<li> Contribution from Papua New Guinea declining.
	<p>
	<li> United States will contribute more in future.
	<p>
	<li> Cash and Short-term Investments $321 million at end of 1995 after 
	Capital expenditures of $451 million.
	<p>
	<li> Cash flow a strong $230 million per year.
	<p>
	<li> We should generate $350 million in cash in 1996 with help of new and 
	expanded mines.
	<p>
	As in 1995 with Zald&#237;var and Osborne, we expect new mines will 
	continue to be financed by cash and short-term investments, cash flow 
	and some debt. No issue of new equity as we see it today, or at least 
	for the five projects we have mentioned.
	
	<p>
	
	<a name="03">
	<strong>Eliseo Gonz&#225;lez-Urien:</strong></a><br>
	
	<li> Map illustrates target areas for our global activities.
	<p>
	<li> Currently more than 85 active projects around the world.
	<p>
	<li> Added 3 million ounces after producing 1.9 million in 1995.
	<p>
	<li> And 4.4 million ounces in measured and indicated mineralization.
	<p>
	<li> From 1991 to 1995 have added 30 million ounces to our mineral 
	inventory at an average finding cost of $16 per ounce, further 
	evidence of very cost effective growth.
	<p>
	<li> Steady growth in reserves reflects only partially this exploration 
	success because discoveries take time to reach reserve status.  In 
	fact several projects are advancing towards reserve status, but are 
	not included in the above list
	<p>
	<li> Chart shows all South American reserves in Chile but this will change 
	as we add Venezuela and Costa Rica.
	<p>
	<li> Note importance of North America.
	<p>
	<li> See further major increases in 1996 from inclusion of Las Cristinas 
	and Mulatos and probably thereafter from Cerro Crucitas and Donlin 
	Creek.
	<p>
	<li> The Donlin Creek project was one of our success stories of 1995.
	<p>
	
	Our work since last June has identified a resource of more than 5 
	million ounces. This year we will spend US$6 million to US$8 million 
	dollars to further define resources in at least four target areas, two 
	of which have received over 100 drillholes to date.
	<p>
	Strategically, our exploration is based on aggressive, disciplined, 
	well-funded programmes in areas of the world which are geologically 
	most promising for discovery of gold deposits, where our early 
	presence may give us an advantage.
	<p>
	In addition to our significant effort in North America and Australia, 
	we explore in countries newly opened to international mining 
	investment where we seek what we call mid-stage projects for further 
	evaluation.  These projects hold the most promise of helping us fulfil 
	our growth goals at an acceptable finding cost.
	<p>
	At nearly $100 million a year we are probably one of the best funded 
	exploration outfits in the gold sector.
	<p>
	These strategies have been successful so far and will continue to be 
	the basis of our growth in the future.
	<p>
	
	<a name="04">
	<strong>Bill Trythall:</strong></a><br>
	
	<li> Our   evaluation,   design   and   construction   teams   turn 
	exploration   projects   into   operating   mines.
	<p>
	<li> The  core  group of evaluation engineers in the   
	Vancouver Project Development Division is staffed with   
	25 mining, geological, mechanical and civil engineers   
	involved in the evaluation process from scoping   
	studies through to bankable feasibility studies.
	<p>
	<li> This   group   is   supported   by   Exploration's   Resource 
	Estimating Group   and   by   metallurgical,   mechanical   and 
	electrical   engineer in   Project   Development's   design   group. 
	Computer   Applications staff   provide   the   needed   mine   design   
	software   and   cash flow   modeling   capability.    PDG's 
	environmental  staff   complete the   evaluation   team.
	<p>
	<li> Smaller,   but   just   as   experienced,   core   groups   of   
	evaluation engineers   have   been   established  in   Placer Pacific,   
	Placer Dome   Latin   America   and   Placer   Dome   U.S. they   make   
	a significant   contribution   to    PDG's   overall evaluation   
	process.
	<p>
	<li> From   mine   scoping   study   through   to   the   publishing   of   
	a feasibility   study   can   take   up   to   3   years   and   cost   
	up to $15   million   dollars   inclusive   of   late   stage   
	exploration drilling.    Evaluation   and   Pre-feasibility   Studies   
	are   often necessary   prior   to   commissioning   the   final   
	feasibility study.
	<p>
	<li> A   typical   6   volume   Feasibility   Study   covers:
        Geology,   Exploration   and   Resource   Estimates -<li> Mine   
        Design   and   Ore   Reserves -<li> Metallurgical   Testwork   and   
        Process   Plant   Design -<li> Environmental   Studies   and   
        Socio   Economic   Matters -<li> Power,   Water,   and tailing  
        Studies -<li> Legal   Matters -<li> Capital   and   Operating   Cost   
        Estimates -<li> Project   Economics   and  risk assessment
	<p>
	<li> Two   Feasibility   Studies   were   completed   in   the   first   
	quarter of   1996,   namely   Musselwhite   and   Las   Cristinas.
	<p>
	<li> Three   additional   studies   are   scheduled   for   completion   in 
	1996: Cerro   Crucitas,   Mount   Rawdon   and   Mulatos.
	<p>
	<li> Pipeline   was  finalized   in 1995   and   Donlin   Creek   is   
	scheduled for   completion   in   1997.
	<p>
	<li> Exploration   projects   do   become   operating   mines.

    <strong>Doug Fraser:</strong></a>
    <br>
      <li> Placer Dome Canada is in the midst of a major growth phase.
	<p>	
		<li> Canadian mines produced 866,000 ounces of gold in 1995, or 46% of Placer
		Dome's 1.9 million ounces.   We are constructing a new gold mine at
		Musselwhite in northern Ontario at a cost to Placer Dome of US$130 million.
	<p>	
		<li> We are also spending US$51 million to sink a new shaft at the
		Campbell Mine.
	<p>	
		<li> The Detour Lake Mine has just undergone a mill expansion and while we are
		also solving some mining problems, we are exploring a promising new zone of
		mineralization.  Improvements are also under way at our two mines in
		Quebec.
	<p>	
		<li> With all this, Canadian mines are expected to be producing 1.2 million
		ounces of gold annually as their contribution to the Placer Dome Group's
		growth objectives.
	<p>	
		<li> The major contributor will be 135,000 ounces per year from Musselwhite.
	<p>	
		<li> The other big item at Placer Dome Canada is the depth development project
		at Campbell Mine.
	<p>	
		We have recognized the increased potential of finding new ore at depth.
		While the mine currently has reserves of under 10 years, with the new shaft
		we expect to extend the life of the mine further into the next century.
		
	<p>	
		<a name="06">
		<strong>Jay Taylor:</strong></a><br>
		
		<li> Placer Dome U.S. is on the threshold of making big contributions to the
		Placer Dome Group.
		<p>
		<li> One factor is that the Golden Sunlight Mine in Montana after 12 years
		finally gets into the heart of the orebody and we'll have considerably
		higher grades for a number of years.
		<p>
		<li> But the major development will be the commissioning in June next year of
		the Pipeline Project.  With an open pit grade of more than 4 grams of gold
		per tonne and more than four million ounces of gold in the ground this is
		the top Placer Dome project.
		<p>
		<li> On March 4, after three and a half years of study by the federal and state
		governments, we received permits to develop the deposit.
		<p>
		<li> On the same day, we started moving the first dirt for the open pit.  This
		video was taken a few days after.
		<p>
		<li> Capital expenditure $320 million of which our share is $192 million.
		<p>
		<li> New plant will have built-in flexibility to accommodate future potential of
		Cortez.
		<p>
		<li> Our share of production 250,000 ounces of gold in the early years.
		<p>
		<li> Lowest cost mine in the group at $110 per ounce.
		<p>
		<li> Operating earnings in early years $43 million based on gold at $375 per ounce.
		<p>
		<li> Separate South Pipeline is lower grade but has contributed 1.5 million ozs.
		to reserves end of 1995.  Exploration continuing, expected to increase
		reserves modestly.
		<p>
		<li> We are preparing a feasibility study on the Mulatos deposit in Mexico, seen
		here.
		<p>
		<li> Our 70% share of the resource is 2.3 million ounces.  At a grade of 1.1
		grams gold per tonne it is a bigger challenge than Pipeline.
		<p>
		<li> We also have a nearby community that will be impacted and we have to manage
		the changes which a mine will bring.
		<p>
		<li> The feasibility study is due to be completed by the end of the year.
		<p>
		<li> This appears to be a good-sized heap-leach operation.
		<p>
		<li> If all goes according to plan, Placer Dome U.S. could have a new mine
		starting here in 1998 and producing more than 100,000 ounces a year for our
		account.
		<p>
		<li> The Pipeline and Mulatos projects, plus higher production at Golden
		Sunlight, will be major contributors to the Placer Dome Group's growth
		spurt.
		
		<p>
		<a name="07">
		<strong>Bill Hayes:</strong></a><br>
		
		
		<li> Greetings from Latin America, where we are also going through an exciting
		period of growth.
		<p>
		<li> The Zald&#237;var copper mine in which we have a 50% interest started operations
		last year.
	    <p>	
		<li> It is operating to plan and is forecast to produce 85,000 tonnes of cathode
		copper in 1996.
		<p>
		From the high desert country of the Atacama desert we go to a different
		climate where we are about to go ahead with construction of the largest
		precious metals mine in South America.
		<p>
		<li> This is a project we are proud of because it demonstrates Placer Dome's
		expertise at each phase of the mine development process, from exploration
		to production.
		<p>
		<li> The property adds 8 million ounces to our ore reserves at minimal finding
		cost, which is the kind of cost-effective growth we strive for.
		<p>
		<li> When this starts operating in 1998, it will produce nearly half a million
		ounces of gold per year for at least 15 years.   And we are certain we will
		add further reserves in the Mesones/Sofia area close to the main deposits,
		where this drill is operating.
		<p>
		<li> We now go to Costa Rica where we have started a pre-feasibility study on
		the Cerro Crucitas property.  This is another one with a minimal finding
		cost.
		<p>
		<li> The gold was discovered in these distinctive dome-shaped hills.
		<p>
		<li> Cerro Crucitas is in a country famous for eco-tourism and which does not
		have a mining tradition.  The way we strive to operate mines is not out of
		keeping with the values of Costa Rica.  We have mobilized an information
		effort in the communities and with the Government.
		
		<p>
		<a name="08">
		<strong>Henry Brehaut:</strong></a><br>
		
		<li> The Latin American operations and future projects are good examples of our
		environmental responsibilities.  Cerro Crucitas has become a model
		exploration project with reclamation of disturbed areas.
		<p>
		<li> At Las Cristinas environmental factors were important considerations in the
		design of key components such as tailing dam design, effluent quality and
		site water control.  At Zald&#237;var and La Coipa we are implementing
		leading-edge environmental management systems.
		<p>
		<li> For the closure of the Equity Silver Mine we developed innovative solutions
		to reduce acid rock drainage and have provided $32 million to ensure our
		obligations are met over the long-term as long as treatment is required.
		<p>
		<li> The same commitment and effort will be applied to the remediation of the
		Marcopper tailing discharge.  We already have a good example of this
		commitment in the Philippines at the abandoned tailing disposal site in
		Calancan Bay.
		<p>
		<li> When Marcopper ceased the disposal of tailing in the bay in 1991, we
		restored the area by growing vegetation on the waste material seen here on
		this causeway.  It is now a swimming area of choice with shade and sandy
		beaches.
		<p>
		<li> In the water, mangrove trees have been planted along the shoreline with
		good success and this programme is continuing.  In deeper water seagrass is
		being transplanted and artificial reef structures are being put in place.
		We have restored the habitat to attract a wide range of fish species.
		<p>
		<li> All this work has led to the return of an active fishery in the bay at a
		productivity greater than that of surrounding areas.
        <p>		
		<li> Reclamation is part of our ongoing mining activities as illustrated by our
		Bald Mountain Mine in Nevada.  Waste dumps are also planned in advance to
		meld with local topography.  Bald Mountain has received an award from the
		State of Nevada for the quality of their programmes.
		<p>
		<li> At our Golden Sunlight Mine in Montana reclamation is also important.  The
		final configuration of the dumps has been projected and whereever possible
		final slopes are reclaimed when available.
		<p>
		 <li> This programme is supported by an extensive research program and the
		results to date are very encouraging as illustrated by the excellent growth
		that has been established and by the diversity of wildlife which is found
		on the site.
		<p>
		<li> For the Musselwhite project environmental considerations have been in the
		forefront.  This is the site as it is today.
		<p>
		<li> This is how we envisage it when it is operating.  Musselwhite should be an
		example of how neat and clean a mining operation can be.
		<p>
		<li> And this is how we expect it to be when mining has ceased, long after I've
		retired. Musselwhite has developed a vision of what a mining project should
		look like once the ore has been extracted.  It will be returned to part of the
		local ecosystem.
		<p>
		<li> We have started the process of having all our mines develop such a vision
		of how they wish the site to be reclaimed to best advantage.
		
	    <p>
	    
		<strong>John Willson:</strong></a><br>
		
		I regret that Dick Zandee was not able to be with us today from Sydney.
		<p>
		However, I have some pictures to show you on behalf of Placer Pacific, our
		75%-owned subsidiary, of which I am the Chairman.
		<p>
		The notable event of the year was bringing the Osborne Mine into production
		in Queensland.
		<p>
		Now that Osborne is in production, in Australia we are turning our
		attention to Mt. Rawdon which is a gold heap leach project on which we are
		currently conducting a feasibility study.
		<p>
		This is a property we have held since 1980.
		<p>
		The leaching properties of the ore are looking good.  Soon we'll be in a
		position to make a decision.  At a capital cost of about US$25 million, 
		we could add another 50,000 ounces per year to our production.
		<p>
		This nine-metre-high, roller-compacted concrete water supply weir was
		constructed ahead of the feasibility study to allow two season's rainfall
		to collect in readiness for possible commissioning of the mine in early
		1997.
		<p>
		With that, I want to conclude our "show and tell" by reiterating it is
		clear from what we have seen that our Company is in a strong position to
		grow.
		<p>
		Production will grow to 2.5 million ounces per year during 1998.  As to how
		we will finance this growth, Ian assures me that with a combination of our
		cash in hand, cash flow and some debt we can make it happen.
		<p>
		And all over the world, Eliseo and his team will continue to conduct their
		successful strategies of gold discovery which can give us growth in
		shareholder value.
        <p>		
		My colleagues and I would be happy to answer your questions, both now and
		afterwards when we have finished the meeting.

	Global Mining:  Three priorities in a politically challenging world</a><br>

	Inc.</strong>

    <p>

	What is required for the mining industry to grow and prosper in a 
	politically challenging world?  In my view, the answer to this 
	question can be summarized as "the industry's three priorities".
	<p>
	The first priority is gaining access to the world's mineralized 
	jurisdictions.  The second priority is establishing a measure of 
	security and predictability in government treatment of mining.  
	Confidence in the stability of the fiscal and legal framework within 
	which we operate is necessary to encourage the investment of large 
	amounts of capital in mine development.  The third priority is 
	sustaining our welcome over the long term in those jurisdictions which 
	we find worthy of investment.  I believe the mining industry has 
	generally been focussed on the first two priorities, while giving too 
	little attention to the third.  As a result, the mining industry may 
	be accumulating more political risk globally than we generally 
	recognize.
	<p>
	The mining industry has made much progress in recent years on the 
	first priority, gaining access to mineralized jurisdictions around the 
	world. Less than a decade ago, many countries (such as the former 
	Soviet bloc) refused entry to multinational mining companies.  Many 
	other countries, particularly in Africa and Latin America strongly 
	discouraged foreign investment in mining, through punitive taxes and 
	royalties, or state control of the mineral sector, or onerous laws and 
	regulations.
	<p>
	Today, much of the world that was previously closed to us is now 
	formally open to foreign investment in mining.  However, in many areas, 
	access continues to be impeded by certain adverse conditions.  
	Violence on the ground, in the form of civil war or guerilla movements 
	in a number of countries deters all but the most intrepid and 
	risk-tolerant miners. Corruption is serious enough in some countries 
	to make it impossible for an honest mining company to gain access.  
	The alliance of some governments with terrorist organizations has 
	placed several countries off-limits for all foreign investors.  Human 
	rights abuses in some countries makes them unacceptable as investment 
	targets.  The lack of clear policies supporting foreign investment in 
	mining, often aggravated by political and bureaucratic entanglements, 
	hinders access in such major mineralized areas as Russia, China, and 
	India.  Finally, in certain countries where mining companies have long 
	enjoyed access, such as the U.S., Canada, and Australia, there are 
	emerging restrictions related to the impact of mine development on 
	parks, wilderness areas, rain forests or traditional aboriginal uses.
	<p>
	In my view, it is unlikely our expanded zone of access will grow much 
	further during the next decade because of the persistence of these 
	impediments.  Indeed, certain areas now open may actually regress, 
	such as the former Soviet Union, where if the free market experiment 
	is rejected by the electorate, our current access may eventually 
	become only a memory of a brief opening.
	<p>
	This brings us to the second priority:  securing our investments 
	through the establishment of supportive legal, fiscal and 
	administrative structures.  Fundamentally, what mining companies and 
	enlightened governments seek is a system of taxation, regulation, and 
	government treatment that satisfies public purposes without imposing 
	so heavy a burden as to discourage investment in mine development.  
	This may be a delicate balancing act, but it can be done.  The system 
	should be efficient and effective, and also transparent, fair, stable, 
	and predictable.
	<p>
	Considerable progress has been made in recent years in designing 
	mining codes and investment laws that encourage exploration and mine 
	development. In Latin America particularly, governments have had the 
	advantage of the precedent set by Chile, and have revised and updated 
	their mining and investment laws using the Chilean model.
	<p>
	Elsewhere in the world, governments have been urged and advised by the 
	World Bank, the United Nations (until recently), the Commonwealth 
	Secretariat, as well as path-finding mining companies, to make their 
	laws more competitive in attracting capital to develop their mineral 
	resources. The success to date of such efforts in Africa, the former 
	Soviet Union, and East and Southeast Asia has been modest.  Many of 
	those governments remain wedded to mandated state or domestic equity 
	participation in mine development, to high royalties and additional 
	profits taxes, and to habits of administrative incompetence and 
	corruption.  Moreover, many of those countries have no tradition of 
	rule by law.  In such countries modern mining and investment laws, 
	even if adopted, will not necessarily be fairly interpreted, nor will 
	they provide conditions that are stable and predictable.  Investment 
	protection structures in addition to the general laws are often 
	required.
	<p>
	Mine development agreements are one such structure.  They spell out in 
	specific terms how an investment will be treated.  While project 
	specific contracts may provide more stability and predictability than 
	general laws, experience has shown that they are not inviolable, and 
	may be particularly fragile precisely at those points where they 
	conflict with the laws of general application.  Contracts are 
	particularly fragile in jurisdictions which do not have a history of 
	observing them as final and binding (which would include all of the 
	current and former communist countries).
	<p>
	Joint-venturing with a strong domestic partner is a possible structure 
	for overcoming the deficiency in security provided by laws or 
	contracts.  The multinational mining company brings capital, 
	technology and managerial efficiency to building and operating a mine, 
	and the domestic partner provides an interface with government and 
	society.  The domestic partner should obviously understand how to get 
	things done in the midst of legal chaos, administrative incompetence 
	and political corruption.
	<p>
	Such joint ventures can be an effective arrangement.  However, one 
	risk is that the foreign investor might be induced through the 
	partnership to conform too closely to a socio-political system that 
	requires not indulgence but change.  The domestic partner, in order to 
	secure continuing government support for the joint venture's 
	interests, may take actions with which the foreign investor would 
	prefer not to be associated.  A useful and productive domestic partner 
	is by definition well-connected in the host country, but the foreign 
	investor needs to know where those linkages lead. Otherwise the 
	foreign mining company may find its project embedded in a matrix, not 
	of laws but of relationships, which a responsible company would 
	normally not find acceptable.
	<p>
	Clearly, there are limits to how effectively we can structure security 
	for our investments within a country.  However, there are also 
	external structures available to shore up a country's internal legal 
	and relational shortcomings.
	<p>
	The first of these external structures is political risk insurance, 
	provided by government agencies such as the US Overseas Private 
	Investment Insurance Corporation (OPIC), or the Canadian Export 
	Development Corporation (EDC), or the Multilateral Investment 
	Guarantee Agency of the World Bank (MIGA).  Such insurance, however, 
	is generally limited to three primary risks: damage from war or 
	insurrection, expropriation and the blockage of financial transfers.  
	It does not provide security against such risks as taxation 
	instability, regulatory maltreatment, administrative deficiencies, 
	personnel transfer impediments or costly performance requirements.
	<p>
	Another way to provide security to investments is to involve 
	international or regional development banks in project financing, such 
	as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank or the Andean 
	Development Corporation. Governments may be dissuaded from treating 
	adversely a mine thus financed because of the impact such action would 
	have on a financial institution which it can ill afford to antagonize.  
	A degree of economic and financial common sense must be imputed to 
	governments in order to assume that this financing strategy will 
	provide effective security.  Unfortunately, such rationality tends to 
	be most lacking in those governments against which security is most 
	needed.
	<p>
	Still another external structure for protecting investments is a 
	bilateral treaty between the host and home countries of the investor.  
	Such treaties raise a company's investment to a relationship between 
	two sovereign nations, as opposed to it being a matter between an 
	individual foreign company and a single sovereign government.  
	Treaties are able to address more aspects of an investment that the 
	three items covered in political risk insurance.
	<p>
	To date, investment protection treaties have been primarily bilateral.  
	The exceptions are NAFTA and the European Union, which provide 
	comprehensive investment protection to their respective members.  
	However, work is underway in the OECD to establish a Multilateral 
	Investment Agreement (MIA), initially for OECD members, but ultimately 
	for any country which is willing to conform its treatment of 
	investment to the treaty's requirements.  The World Trade Organization 
	(WTO) is also beginning to draft a binding agreement on investment 
	liberalization.  The Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC)  
	has endorsed a set of Non-Binding Investment Principles, and at its 
	meeting in Osaka in November, adopted an action plan for its 
	implementation.  While APEC's Non-Binding Investment Principles are 
	legally weaker than the instruments for protecting investment which 
	the OECD and WTO are considering, moral suasion among APEC members, 
	particularly in Asia, may in fact prove to have a compelling effect on 
	improving the treatment of investors in the region. The success of 
	multilateral investment agreements, whether legally binding or 
	non-binding, remains to be demonstrated.  The mining industry can work 
	in its own interest by collaborating with international business 
	generally to press the OECD and WTO towards establishing appropriate 
	multilateral investment protection structures, and by joining with 
	business forces around the Pacific Rim, through organizations such as 
	the Pacific Basin Economic Council (PBEC), to bring pressure to bear 
	on member countries of APEC to implement the action agenda on 
	investment principles.
	<p>
	Finally, we can gain some security for our investments through an 
	alliance with a developmental aid agency (such as CIDA or US-AID).  By 
	integrating a mining project into a broader regional development 
	program supported by overseas direct assistance (ODA), a mining 
	company may succeed in deterring adverse action by a government 
	against its operation.  Before acting adversely, a rational government 
	would need to consider the impact of its actions on the larger 
	developmental program, on the population that is benefitting and on 
	the attitude of the donor nation towards continuing aid. Again, this 
	structure is likely to provide security only if governments exercise 
	common sense in weighing policy options towards a mine, a condition 
	which may not always prevail.
	<p>
	Our third priority is to make sure that once we have extensively 
	invested around the world, governments do not decide that foreign 
	ownership and management of resource industries is not in their long 
	term best interest, and reverse the practice of attracting and 
	accommodating us.  How can we sustain our welcome over the long term?
	<p>
	I believe that a future-oriented and farsighted evolution may be 
	required in some of our thinking and practices.  Let me make three 
	specific suggestions.  First, we need to make alliances with other 
	institutions that have credibility around the world.  I have already 
	mentioned the possibility of partnerships with multilateral financial 
	institutions and bilateral aid agencies.  Other potential allies are 
	global non-government organizations (NGOs) focussed on environment 
	(assuming they are scientifically oriented and not purely political), 
	or on social and economic development, or on particular interests, 
	such as indigenous people.  Within countries we need to be clearly 
	allied to the interest of communities in a strong spirit of 
	cooperation with their local institutions.  We, as a global 
	wealth-creating industry, need to define our interests and 
	relationships broadly, so as to attract as much sympathy and the 
	support from the worldwide public as possible.
	<p>
	Secondly, we need to articulate and observe the ethical principles 
	that relate to our activities.  This is particularly relevant with 
	respect to corruption, human rights and social issues in many 
	developing countries. The ethical challenges confronting business over 
	the next several decades, I believe, are likely to be as demanding on 
	our attention and our ability to respond as environmental challenges 
	have been during the past couple of decades.  The current controversy 
	surrounding the actions of Shell in Nigeria is one example of the 
	coming challenges to corporate ethics.  It would be useful for those 
	concerned about the long term welcome for mining around the world to 
	study the document recently issued by the Canadian Task Force on the 
	Churches and Corporate Responsibility together with its sister 
	organizations the US Interfaith Center and the UK Ecumenical Centre, 
	entitled "Principles for Global Corporate Responsibility: Benchmarks 
	for Measuring Business Performance".  Eventually, global mining 
	companies will need to write down our own global ethical principles, 
	and to hold ourselves accountable to acting in conformity with them.
	<p>
	Thirdly, we need to define our activities in the framework of 
	"sustainable development," a term which conceals many ideas and 
	requires elaboration. The sustainable development movement, which had 
	its origins in the Brundtland report and received impetus at the 
	United Nations Summit on Environment and Development at Rio (1992), 
	has been embraced by a number of governments in Latin America and is 
	slowly winning adherents in Africa. The key theme of sustainable 
	development is utilizing resources today with respect for the needs of 
	future generations.  Unfortunately, there are some in the 
	environmental movement who have concluded that mining, as the 
	exploitation of a depleting resource, is essentially incompatible with 
	sustainable development.  Equally, unfortunately, there are some in 
	our industry who see in sustainable development only an emblem of the 
	forces antagonistic to mining.  We do ourselves a disservice if we 
	reject the notion of sustainable development while a number of 
	governments are attempting to structure their economic and social 
	policies within that framework.
	<p>
	There is no reason for us to feel discomfort with sustainable 
	development, though at times the rhetoric may sound somewhat 
	impractical and abstract. We in fact practice sustainable development 
	by endeavouring to achieve the most efficient and least wasteful level 
	of production, the highest degree of environmental protection and the 
	most equitable distribution of social benefits from our projects.  
	That essentially is the definition of sustainable development: a 
	balanced integration of high quality economic, environmental and 
	social performance.
	<p>
	Let me focus on three aspects of sustainable development, public 
	participation in decision-making, distribution of wealth, and 
	post-mine-closure environmental and social conditions.
	<p>
	First, public consultation.  We must listen to the needs, wants, 
	intentions and expectations of all stakeholders affected by our 
	activities, and do our best to accommodate them.  Effective public 
	participation must visibly and substantially affect our plans, our 
	project designs, and our actions.  The World Bank has recently 
	reviewed some 20 major projects in which it has been involved and has 
	concluded that effective public participation adds about 15% to the 
	decision process cost of a project but results in demonstrably more 
	acceptable, viable and sustainable projects.
	<p>
	Second, wealth distribution.  Sustainable development requires that a 
	fair share of the economic benefits of mining go to the "have nots" in 
	local communities and not disproportionately to the "haves" in 
	metropolitan centres.  In the traditional model, the government 
	receives revenues from industrial operations such as mines in the form 
	of taxes and then provides social benefits to the population in the 
	vicinity of those operations; but the model does not work well in 
	many developing countries.  Too much tax revenue is lost to 
	governmental incompetence and corruption, so that relatively little 
	returns to local communities in any effective manner.
	<p>
	International mining companies have an interest in political stability, 
	which is threatened by inequitable wealth distribution, as well as 
	in broad-based public support.  We therefore have an interest in 
	promoting a fair and equitable distribution of the benefits of mining, 
	whether through an effective channelling of taxes to local communities 
	or through company social expenditures, preferably in lieu of taxes.
	<p>
	Third, post-closure environmental and socio-economic conditions.  The 
	ultimate question with respect to how mining relates to sustainable 
	development is:  What is left behind after the mine closes?  Is it a 
	hole in the ground, a road to nowhere and a fading memory of boom 
	times and boom towns?  If so, the long term acceptability of the 
	industry in many jurisdictions is questionable.
	<p>
	The mining industry needs to demonstrate that our activities are 
	compatible with wilderness, with rainforests, with biodiversity, with 
	aquatic life, and so forth.  We do this by operating and reclaiming 
	our mines in ways that respect and protect those ecological values.  
	Unfortunately, much of the world remains to be convinced, and one 
	failure can hurt us immensely. A consistently high level of 
	environmental performance is absolutely key to our long term 
	acceptability in many jurisdictions.
	<p>
	There is a social as well as an environmental dimension to sustainable 
	development.  Here also mining will be judged by what it leaves behind 
	after mines close.  Are people in the region around the mine more 
	educated and healthier, and thus able to live more productive and 
	satisfying lives, even when the mine which helped bring about those 
	improvements is no longer operating?  Are businesses which got their 
	start in response to the opportunity offered by the mine able to 
	sustain themselves through other markets and customers after the mine 
	closes?  Can the physical infrastructure which was developed to 
	support the mine be put to other economically beneficial uses?  We 
	must demonstrate that the legacy of mining consists of sustainable 
	social and economic improvements.
	<p>
	The global mining industry is gradually coming to terms with the 
	sustainable development agenda.  The International Council on Metals 
	and the Environment (ICME), representing 27 leading mining companies 
	around the world, has subscribed to a Charter of Environmental 
	Principles which is consistent with sustainable development.  In June 
	1994, the ICME together with the World Bank and UN Conference on Trade 
	and Development (UNCTAD) jointly sponsored a three day conference in 
	Washington, DC on mining, environment and development, which was 
	attended by many representatives of governments in Latin America, 
	Africa and Asia.  Currently, the World Bank is considering convening a 
	Round Table on sustainable development and mining in the Central 
	American and Caribbean region.  Also, a South American regional summit 
	on sustainable development and mining is scheduled for La Paz in 
	November 1996. 
	<p>
	Let me rapidly summarize.  We have gained entry to much 
	of the world that was formally closed off to us.  We have options to 
	choose from in establishing a measure of security for our investments.  
	The question is whether we can sustain our long term welcome around 
	the world.  Ultimately we will be judged by the quality of our 
	performance, not only technically and economically, but 
	environmentally, socially and ethically as well.  The mining industry 
	has the capacity to influence the world's judgment and sustain our 
	welcome over the long term.  The question is whether we have the 
	collective inspiration and will to do so.

<HTML><TITLE>International Admission Information and Electronic
Application</title>
<BODY>
<Center>
<H2>Electronic Application Instructions and<br>
Admission Information for International Students
</H2><P></Center>
<B>IMPORTANT: All <I>supplementary documentation</I> (except test
scores) should be mailed together in one envelope.</B><p>
Applicants to the graduate programs at Clemson University must
hold a four-year bachelor's degree (or equivalent) or a master's
degree from an institution whose scholastic rating is
satisfactory to the University.  Initial enrollment of
international students in summer sessions is strongly
discouraged.<P>

<H3>Application Fee</H3><P>

A $35 non refundable application fee payable to Clemson
University via money order or a check drawn on a U.S. bank, is
required. If you apply to a second program, you do not need to
pay an additional fee.  If you apply to more than two programs,
each program after the second will require an additional $35 fee.
The application fee(s) must be
received before the application will be processed. 
<B>Application fee(s)
cannot be waived or deferred.</B>  Applications received
electronically will be discarded after 60 days if application fee
is not received.<P>

<H3>Application Deadline Dates</H3><P>
<OL>
<LI><B>Students from abroad.</B> Completed applications for
admission of prospective international students from abroad
<B>must be</B> received by the Graduate School by May 1 and
October 1 for registration in the subsequent fall and spring
semesters, respectively. <B>Every required item in support of the
application must be on file with the Graduate School by these
dates.</B> A number of programs have earlier deadlines or
restrict admission to fall semester only. Students should contact
the department of their interest for the deadlines. <P>
International applicants living outside the United States should
complete the required standardized tests at least three months
prior to May 1 and October 1, as appropriate.  Documents for a
student visa will be issued no later than June 15 and November 1
for registration in fall and spring semesters, respectively. 
Initial enrollment of international students during the summer
sessions is strongly discouraged and is permitted only on rare
occasions.<P>
<LI><B>Students living in the United States.</B> International
students living in the United States do not require Form I-20
from OIPS until they arrive on the Clemson University Campus. 
Consequently, slightly more time is allowed for international
students living in the United States to complete their
applications for admission to the University.  Completed
applications for admission of prospective international students
who currently reside in the United States should be received by
the Graduate School by June 15 and November 1 for registration in
the subsequent fall and spring semesters, respectively.  Every
required item in support of the application must be on file with
the Graduate School by these dates.<P>
</OL>
<H3>Application Time Limit</H3><P>
Generally, acceptance under an application is valid for one year
beyond the initial date desired for enrollment.  Academic
departments reserve the right to deny deferred admission because
of limited space and/or resources.  Thus, students must make a
written request for deferred enrollment from the department in
which they wish to study.<P>
After an application has become invalid, a student must reapply
to the University by submitting a new application, including
the required fee.  Students also need to resubmit all academic
supporting materials with the application. All application
materials received must be in the original form.<P>

<H3>Transcripts and References</H3><P>
Official transcripts of academic records must be received from
each postsecondary college and/or university attended before an
application can be processed.  Students should request two (2)
official transcripts of their academic work from the respective
registrar's office of each college or university attended.  The
transcripts should be in a sealed envelope.  Include both an
official copy written in one's native language and an official
English translation of all academic records.  For those
institutions that provide transcripts of academic work in
English, a transcript in the native language is not required. 
<B>DO NOT OPEN THE ENVELOPE ONCE SEALED.</B><P>
A minimum of two (2) recommendations is required for certain
degree programs.  Please request that the recommenders complete
the <A Href="recommfm.htm">Recommendation Form</a> and return
them to
you in sealed envelopes.  <B>DO NOT OPEN THESE ENVELOPES.</B><P>

<H3>Required Test Scores</H3><P>
A satisfactory score on the Graduate Management Admission Test
(GMAT) is required of each applicant to the master's program in
major codes 505, 509 and 520, and may be accepted in lieu of GRE
scores for the PhD program in major code 520. Except as just
noted, a satisfactory score on the general portion of the
Graduate Examination (GRE) is required of each applicant.<P>
Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) scores are required
of all international applicants whose native language is not
English and whose secondary education (and beyond) was not taught
fully in English.  Applicants who hope to receive a graduate
assistantship must submit scores from the Test of Written English
(TWE) administered simultaneously with the TOEFL at most test
locations.<P>
GRE and GMAT scores are valid for five (5) years, and the TOEFL
and TWE scores are valid for two (2) years.  All scores must be
sent directly from the <A HREF=http://www.gre.org/>Educational
Testing Service (ETS)</A> in
Princeton, New Jersey. Outdated test scores will not be accepted.
<P>

<H3>International Programs and Services</H3><P>
The Office of International Programs and Services (OIPS) is
responsible for providing all supportive services unique to
international students as well as encouraging students to utilize
the services of all student affairs units on campus.<P>
The staff of OIPS includes a director, an international student
advisor, an exchange visitor coordinator and support staff.<P>
OIPS provides orientation, registration, guidance and counseling,
immigration advising, cultural programming and other forms of
support to international students, international student
organizations, faculty and international exchange visitors.<P>
OIPS cooperates with Clemson Area International Friendship (CAIF)
to provide community programming.<P>

<H3>International Student Financial Certification</H3><P>
U. S. universities are required by law to verify that students
entering the United States on temporary visas have adequate
financial resources to meet expenses.  Clemson University
requires all fees to be paid on the first day of late
registration. Loans and deferred payments generally are not
available to international students. A minimum of one (1) year's
expenses must be available to the student upon arrival.  The
Certificate of Eligibility for F-1 visa (Form I-20) will not be
issued without the receipt by Clemson University of approved
documents verifying funds.  All documentation must be current,
and signatures must be original.  Photocopies or FAX copies of
the documentation will not be accepted.  The deadline for
submitting this <A HREF="fincert.htm">Financial Certification
Form</a>
 is May 1 for the
fall semester and October 1 for the spring semester.
<P>

<P>
South Carolina, with its long and distinguished history, is a state that looks
to the future. In providing a variety of opportunities for its citizens to 
prosper and enjoy their quality of life, the state has achieved a diversified
economy and has made great strides in educational opportunities, largely
through an emphasis on technology, support for research and a close,
cooperative relationship between business/industry and higher education.<P>
<P>
South Carolina is broadly divided into three regions: the Coastal Plain, the
Midlands and the Piedmont/mountain region of the Upstate, where Clemson
University is located. Historic cities, beautiful gardens, the scenic Atlantic
coast, and the state's lakes and mountains provide recreational opportunities
from coast to border. State parks are located throughout the state and are
popular vacation spots year-round. From the Blue Ridge Mountains to historic
Charleston, South Carolina is a truly delightful place to live, work and
study.<P>
<P>
Clemson is located in South Carolina's lake and mountain region. An interstate
highway system is located near the town, and railway and air travel are both
accessible.<P>

     Clemson University was founded in 1889, a legacy of Thomas Green Clemson, who        
     willed his Fort Hill plantation home, its surrounding farmlands and forest, 
     and other property to the state of South Carolina to establish a technical 
     and scientific institution. Today, as at <A NAME=QuickMark></A>its inception,            
     Clemson University is dedicated to teaching, research and public service, and
     to improving the quality of life through education.<P>
     <P>
          Approximately 16,600 students, including 4,100 graduate students, are
     enrolled at Clemson. Students may choose degree programs offered through the
     University's four colleges: Agriculture, Forestry and Biological Sciences, 
     Architecture, Arts and Humanities, Engineering and Science, and Professional                
     Studies.  Programs leading to baccalaureate degrees in 73 fields of study                      
     and 110 graduate programs in 70 areas of study are offered through all four                   
     colleges as well as thirty-eight doctoral programs. <P>
     <P>
          Research is an integral part of most postbaccalaureate education, and
     Clemson provides research opportunities in practically all fields in which
     graduate instruction is offered. Major emphasis includes engineering and
     science, management and marketing, textiles, agriculture and natural resources,
     and quality of life, with strong supporting programs in the liberal arts, social
     sciences and humanities. <P>
     <P>
          Clemson's 1,400-acre main campus is located on the shores of Lake
     Hartwell in the northwestern part of South Carolina at the foot of the Blue
     Ridge Mountains. It is surrounded by 17,000 acres of University farms and
     woodlands devoted to research. Clemson is approximately two and one-half
     hours from Atlanta, Ga., Columbia, S.C., and Charlotte, N.C., and is 30
     minutes west of Greenville, S.C.<P>

<html><head><title>Purpose of Catalog</title></head>
<body>
<a name="Purpose of Catalog">
<H1>Purpose of Catalog</h1></a>
The purpose of this catalog is to provide students with a general description of Clemson 
University and give detailed information regarding the various colleges and departments 
within the University and curricula offered by the University. Inasmuch as the educational 
process necessitates change, the information and educational requirements in this catalog 
represent a flexible program which may be altered where such alterations are thought to 
be in the mutual interest of the University and its students.
<P>
The provisions of this catalog do not constitute any offer for a contract which may be 
accepted by students through registration and enrollment in the University. The 
University reserves the right to change without notice any fee, provision, offering or 
requirement in this catalog and to determine whether a student has satisfactorily met its 
requirements for admission or graduation. The University further reserves the right to 
require a student to withdraw from the University for cause at any time.
<P>
Each curriculum (Form GS2) shall be governed by the requirements in effect on the date 
of enrollment. If a student withdraws from the University and subsequently returns or 
does not remain continuous enrolled (summers excluded), the requirements in effect at 
the time of return will govern.
<P>
<a name="Student Responsibility">
<h1>Student Responsibility</h1></a>
All colleges and departments establish certain requirements that must be met before a 
degree is granted. Advisors, department heads and deans are available to help student 
understand and arrange to meet these requirements, but the student is responsible for 
fulfilling them. If, at the end of a students course of study, the requirements for 
graduation have not been satisfied, the degree will not be granted. For this reason, it is 
important for each student to acquaint himself or herself with all academic requirements 
throughout his or her graduate career and to be responsible for completing all such 
requirements within prescribed deadlines and time limits.
<P>
Except as they apply to undergraduate students only, graduate students are subject to the 
usual procedures and regulations of the University as listed in the general catalog, 
<I>Clemon University Undergraduate Announcements</I>.
<P>
<a name="Equal Opportunity">
<h1>Equal Opportunity in Programs and Activities</h1></a>
Federal laws prohibit discrimination under programs and activities receiving federal 
financial assistance. The statutes listed below are applicable to Clemson University.
<P>
<B>Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964</B>
<br>
"No person in the United States shall, on the ground of race, color or national origin, be 
excluded from participation in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to 
discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."
<P>
<B>Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972</b>
<BR>
"No person in the United States shall, on the basis of sex, be excluded from participation 
in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination under any educational 
program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance."
<P>
<B>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973</b>
<br>
"No otherwise qualified handicapped individual in the United States shall, solely by 
reason of his handicap, be excluded from participation in, be denied the benefit of, or be 
subjected to discrimination under any program or activity receiving Federal financial 
assistance."
<P>
Clemson University conducts its programs and activities involving admissions and 
treatment of students, employment, teaching, research and public service in a 
nondiscriminatory manner as prescribed by federal law and regulation.
<P>
Inquiries concerning the above may be addressed to:
<P>
President<br>
Clemson University<br>
Clemson, SC 29634-5002

<h1>
Clemson University
</h1>
<a name="Introduction">
<h2><I>Introduction</i></h2></a>
Clemson University was founded in 1889 when the General Assembly
accepted the terms of the will of Thomas Green Clemson, conveying
land and other property to the state for the purpose of
establishing a technical and scientific institution. The college
opened its doors in 1893 as Clemson Agricultural College, a
land-grant institution and military school. It has evolved to its
present status as a university emphasizing the sciences and
technology.
<P>
Clemson was initially an all-male military school until 1955 when
women were admitted as residential students. The Graduate School
was formally organized in 1947. In 1964 the college was renamed
Clemson University, a formal recognition of the school's expanded
academic offerings and research pursuits.
Clemson University is a land-grant South Carolina institution
under the terms of the Morrill Act of 1862. It serves the state,
the nation and the international community through teaching,
research and public service activities. Clemson University is
accredited by the Commission on Colleges of the Southern
Association of Colleges and Schools to award the bachelor's,
master's, specialist and doctoral degrees.
<P>   
The general mission of the University was broadened with the
passage of the Hatch Act of 1887, with responsibility for the
S.C. Agricultural and Forestry Research System; the Smith-Lever
Act of 1914, for operation of the Cooperative Extension Service;
and the National Sea Grant Act of 1966. Agricultural research is
conducted not only on campus, but at four substations. Regulatory
programs provide technical assistance, continuing education,
technology transfer and extension activities.
<P>
In accordance with the conditions set forth in the will of Thomas
Green Clemson and the Act of Acceptance by the General Assembly,
Clemson University is governed by a Board of Trustees consisting
of 13 members. Of these, six are elected by the General Assembly
and seven are life members who elect their own successors.
<P>
Clemson University is organized into five colleges: Agriculture,
Forestry and Life Sciences; Architecture, Arts and Humanities;
Business and Public Affairs; Engineering and Science; and Health,
Education and Human Development. Programs leading to
baccalaureate degrees in 74 fields of study and 112 graduate
programs in 71 areas of study are offered through all five
colleges. Doctoral programs currently are authorized in 38
specialties. Research is an indispensable part of most
postbaccalaureate education, and Clemson provides research
opportunities in all fields in which graduate instruction is
offered. The institution's mandate in agriculture and natural
resources, architecture, engineering, textiles, basic sciences
and technologies is extended to address the state's cultural and
economic needs through the health sciences, business, education
and the humanities.
<P>
The fulfillment of Clemson's mission rests with its faculty, who
individually, collectively and in cooperation with all University
personnel gather, interpret and disseminate knowledge; generate
new knowledge independently and in conjunction with colleagues
and students; stimulate creative thought and expression; foster
speculative and critical thought; groom leaders; initiate
progressive change; prepare students to cope with the world as it
is, contribute to developing a better world and appreciate the
interconnectedness of modern life; and advance the common good by
anticipating and devising new solutions for intellectual,
scientific, social and technical problems.
<P>
As a steward to taxpayers, alumni, donors and students, Clemson
University will husband its resources; engage in strategic
planning; implement, direct and review authorized programs,
modifying goals and operations as deemed necessary; and assess
student, faculty and administrative performance regularly and in
accordance with norms upheld by both the University's evaluative
procedures and those of appropriate professional societies.
<P>
The 1,400-acre campus, on the former plantation of John C.
Calhoun, is located on the shores of Lake Hartwell in the
northwestern part of South Carolina. The 17,000 acres of
University farms and woodlands surrounding the campus and an
additional 12,390 acres throughout the state are devoted to
research. The University also owns overseas property used for
teaching and research in Genoa, Italy, at the Charles E. Daniel
Center for Building Research and Urban Studies; and on the
Caribbean Island of Dominica at the Archbold Tropical Research
Center. Clemson is approximately two and one-half hours from both
Atlanta, Georgia, and Charlotte, North Carolina.

<a name="University Visitors Center">
<h2><I>University Visitors Center</I></h2></a>

The University Visitors Center is located in 103 Tillman Hall.
Walking tours are provided by the University Guide Service to
answer questions and to acquaint visitors with the Clemson
campus. Tours last approximately one hour and are preceded by a
10-minute videotape highlighting Clemson University.
Thirty-minute cassette self-guided tours also are available.
<P>
The center is open Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.
From February through November the center also is open on
weekends. The office is closed for selected University holidays.
<P>
For additional information and to verify tour times, call the
Visitors Center at (864) 656-4789.

<a name="Enrollment Opportunities">
<h2><I>Enrollment Opportunities</i></h2></a>

<h3>On-campus</h3>

Total enrollment for the fall semester of 1995 was 16,327. Of
this number, 3,866 were graduate students. Approximately 1,890
were classified as full-time graduate students and 1,980 as
part-time students. The number of male graduate students was
1,920, and 1,950 were female students. Most degree programs
offered by the University are available on campus.

<h3>Off-campus</h3>

By virtue of its land-grant mission and at the direction of the
state Legislature and/or the South Carolina Commission on Higher
Education, Clemson University serves the entire state in certain
academic disciplines such as agriculture, architecture,
industrial education and others. Courses in these disciplines are
offered at various off-campus locations across the state. In
addition, the University serves South Carolina by offering some
master's degree programs at evening off-campus centers.

<h2><I>Telecampus</i></h2></a>

The University Telecampus program coordinates the development and
delivery of graduate-credit courses through electronic media.
This service is provided to increase the educational
opportunities of adults who want professional development or
continuing education courses but cannot attend classes on the
main campus on a regular basis or during hours that conflict with
work schedules. Through a digital satellite television network of
South Carolina ETV, classes are broadcast live from the Clemson
campus to viewing sites in Aiken, Beaufort, Charleston, Columbia,
Florence, Greenville, Greenwood, Orangeburg and Rock Hill. A
two-way audio linkage via telephone is provided so that students
at remote sites may interact with the instructor and students in
the Clemson classroom studio.
<P>

<a name="The Graduate School">
<h2><I>The Graduate School</i></h2></a>

The Graduate School formulates policies and standards and unifies
administrative procedures concerning all graduate work at Clemson
University. This includes graduate admission policies, graduate
programs and the granting of degrees.
<P>
The aims of the graduate programs at Clemson are to provide
comprehensive education in special fields, to offer instruction
in the methods of independent investigation, and to foster the
spirit of research scholarship. Graduate study is much more than
a continuation of undergraduate work. Its true spirit is one of
inquiry and the desire to add to human knowledge. Graduate study
therefore should be contemplated only by students who have
already demonstrated in their undergraduate programs unusual
intellectual attainments and the power of independent thought and
investigation.

<a name="Graduate Curriculum Committee">
<h2>Graduate Curriculum Committee </h2></a>

The Graduate Curriculum Committee acts for the faculty in
reviewing all proposals for curricular changes and recommends
such changes to the provost. It is comprised of a nonvoting
chairperson from the provost's staff, plus the chairpersons of
the graduate curriculum committees of the academic colleges. The
committee is guided by all applicable University rules and
regulations and by the policies established by the Academic
Council.
<P>
The provost and vice president for academic affairs takes the
recommendations of the Graduate Curriculum Committee to the
Council of Academic Deans for its scrutiny and advice. The
provost and vice president for academic affairs then transmits
his or her recommendations to the president for final approval
and informs the Academic Council, in summary form, of those
curricular changes the president has approved. 
<P>
Graduate students and faculty who are not members of the Graduate
Curriculum Committee are free to attend its meetings.

<a name="Graduate Student Government">
<h2>Graduate Student Government </h2></a>

The mission of the Graduate Student Government (GSG) is to
represent the interests of all graduate students at Clemson
University in four vital areas of focus. These are:
<ul>
<li><B>Communication -</b> to act as the liaison between the University
and graduate students with an emphasis on honest and open
communication; 
<li><B>Collaboration -</b> to promote the efforts of graduate students
and the University into one united mission of making the Clemson
experience one of quality education and reward;
<li><B>Development -</b> to provide participatory learning experience
that allows for the enhancement of graduate students' academic,
civic, social and professional development; and 
<li><B>Involvement -</b> to encourage graduate student participation in
the University process through GSG and beyond. 
</ul>

The GSG is composed of all graduate students at Clemson
University. The GSG Senate consists of two representatives from
each academic department. The GSG Executive Board consists of the
president, vice president, secretary, treasurer and chairs of the
GSG committees. In addition, there are board seats for the
executive assistant, the news editor and the assistant news
editor. 
<P>
The GSG elects representatives to various University boards,
commissions, committees or councils that solicit graduate student
opinions.

<a name="International Programs and Services">
<H2><I>International Programs and Services </i></h2></a>

The Office of International Programs and Services (OIPS) assists
all international students and exchange visitors in academic,
financial, social and personal matters relating to their
nonresident visa status. It also serves as the official liaison
between Clemson University and the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service (INS) and the U.S. Information Agency
(USIA). Upon arrival at Clemson University, international
students and exchange visitors should immediately contact OIPS.
The office is located in E-208 Martin Hall, telephone (864)
656-2357. 

<h3>Students</h3>

Among the primary services OIPS provides international students
are (1) preparing and issuing documents (Immigration Form I-20 or
USIA Form IAP-66) for securing visas before they come to the
United States; (2) advising students on INS regulations and
procedures; (3) assisting with completion of paper work to
maintain legal status while enrolled at Clemson; (4) providing
registration assistance; (5) determining employment and practical
training eligibility; (6) generally interpreting University
policy and procedures; and (7) facilitating a smooth adjustment
to Clemson University and the city through initial orientations
and ongoing workshops. 
<P>
Admission services for international students are provided
jointly by the Graduate School and OIPS. International students
who come from abroad or transfer from another school must meet
academic, language and financial qualifications as determined by
Clemson University. The general portion of the Admission Test
(GMAT), Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) and
transcripts of all previous academic studies are some of the
determinants used for appraising academic and language ability.
Financial qualifications are determined by the submission of
financial assessment and bank statements verifying adequate
funding. These documents must be received by the University
before Form I-20 (or IAP-66) is issued. 

<h3>Application Deadlines</h3>

1. <I>Students from Abroad</i>. Completed applications for admission of
prospective international students from abroad must be received
by the Graduate School by May 1 and October 1 for registration in
the subsequent fall and spring semesters, respectively. Every
required item in support of the application must be on file with
the Graduate School by these dates. Thus, international
applicants living outside the United States should complete the
required standardized tests at least three months prior to May 1
or October 1, as appropriate. Documents for a student visa will
be issued no later than June 15 and November 1 for registration
in the fall and spring semesters, respectively. Initial
enrollment of international students in the summer sessions is
strongly discouraged and is permitted only on rare occasions.
<P>
The information below applies to all international students from
abroad.

2. <I>Students Living in the United States</i>. Students in F-1 visa
status will not require Form I-20 until after registering for
classes. After completing the enrollment process, certification
will be made on page 4 of the I-20, and pages 1 and 2 will be
sent to INS to complete the transfer. OIPS will send the student
a Transfer Clearance Form and a Financial Certification Form to
be completed prior to issuance of the Form I-20 or IAP-66.
<P>

</table>
<P>

Students in J-1 visa status wanting to transfer to Clemson's
Exchange Visitor Program must obtain written release from their
present Exchange Visitor Program sponsor on a newly issued Form
IAP-66 from Clemson University and should adhere to the deadlines
above.

<h3>Application Fee and Time Limit</h3>

International applicants must submit a $35 (subject to change) nonrefundable
application fee with the application material. Without this fee,
applications will not be processed. <B>No application fee waivers
are granted by Clemson University</b>. Generally, acceptance under an
application is valid for one year beyond the initial date desired
for enrollment. Academic departments reserve the right to deny
deferred admission because of limited space and/or resources.
Thus, students wishing to defer an enrollment must request and
receive written approval for such action from the respective
department.
<P>
After an application has become invalid, a student must reapply
to the University by submitting a new application, including the
required fee. Students may also need to resubmit all academic
supporting materials requested in the application. 

<h3>Employment and Financial Assistance </h3>

Financial assistance is available to Clemson's international
graduate students through a limited number of highly competitive
instructional and research assistantships. Assistantships are
awarded by individual departments (see Departmental Graduate
Assistantships' on page 21), and the student must write directly
to the department regarding the availability of assistantships.
The student will be notified directly by the department only in
the event of an awarded assistantship. 
<P>
Special employment regulations for international students are
determined by INS. Thus, to ensure compliance with these
regulations, international students must obtain permission from
the Office of International Programs and Services before gaining
employment at Clemson. Nonacademic employment opportunities are
available on campus on a first-come basis. Applications are made
directly to the hiring source upon arrival on campus. Off-campus
employment generally is unavailable to international students and
should not be considered as a means of support. Application for
Practical Training and certain other categories of employment may
be made after one academic year. Further information is available
in OIPS. 

<h3>Academic Requirements</h3>

All full-time international graduate students are required to
carry a minimum of nine hours per semester. Maximum credit hours
are discussed under "Enrollment Limits" on page 26. Students with
assistantships must meet the prevailing requirements for the
assistantship. For specific information, see "Graduate
Appointments" on page 21.

<h3>Visa Requirements for Sponsored Students </h3>

International students will apply for the type of visa required
by their sponsor (government, agency or local department
providing funds for study at Clemson). If the sponsor has no such
requirement and no clear guidelines otherwise are available, Form
I-20 will be issued for requesting an F-1 visa. International
students sponsored by their governments or by an agency promoting
international education cannot change degree objectives without
the written consent of the sponsor. 

<h3>Fees and Expenses </h3>

Health care and related medical expenses in the United States are
costly; therefore, health and accident insurance is required of
all international students and accompanying family members.
On-campus housing is arranged directly by the student with the
University Housing Office. Applications for on-campus housing are
sent by OIPS to the student along with the documents for visa
application. Off-campus housing is arranged entirely by the
student. 
<P>
International students will pay these estimated annual costs (2
semesters and summer) to attend Clemson University.

These costs are estimates for the 1996-97 calendar year and are
subject to change without notice. The amount of funds students
must have on hand to enter the United States (approximately
one-third of the annual cost) is indicated on the visa documents
issued by Clemson to international students. Documents for
obtaining a visa (I-20s or IAP-66s) will not be issued without
the required verification which indicates the student has access
to, as a minimum, the amounts indicated above before entering the
United States.

<h3>Exchange Visitors</h3>

The exchange visitor (hereafter referred to as visitor) is a
foreign national in J-1 visa status who is associated with an
academic department on campus or an affiliated institute or
organization for purposes other than seeking a degree from
Clemson University. The visitor status is formalized by an
invitation from a department of Clemson University to apply for
the exchange visitor status, completion of an Exchange Visitor
Application, acceptance by the inviting department and issuance
of Form IAP-66 from OIPS. Confirmation of English ability and
academic degree is required prior to arrival.
<P>
A monthly administrative fee commensurate with the current costs
of a regularly enrolled international graduate student will be
required unless waived by the department. Visitors will be
assessed a one-time charge of $150* by OIPS. Health and accident
insurance are required for the entire period of stay in the U.S. 
<P>
Services provided by OIPS include assisting the visitor with USIA
requirements; ensuring that visitors obtain insurance; serving as
a liaison on program objectives among program agency sponsors,
academic departments and the visitor; and providing updated
progress reports when requested.

<h1>STUDENT SERVICES</h1>

<a name="Career Center">
<H2><I>Career Center</i></h2></a>

The Career Center coordinates campus visits for hundreds of
representatives from business, industry and government who are
interviewing graduate students for permanent employment and
summer internships. Recruiters are scheduled from September
through April. Clemson University has one of the most
sophisticated placement systems in the country, which allows
students to research employers and sign up for interviews from
any campus terminal connected to the mainframe.
<P>
Graduate students are encouraged to attend seminars on writing
resumes, interviewing and job-search techniques. Individual
career counseling and a computer-assisted career information
system are available. All graduate students are encouraged to
register with the Placement Office one year before their expected
graduation date.
<P>The Career Center is in Room 804 University Union.

<a name="Food Service">
<H2><I>Food Service </i></h2></a>

The University provides several economical meal plans, which are
outlined in the food service brochure. Harcombe and Schilletter
dining halls feature an unlimited seconds policy, while the
Clemson House dining room and the Canteen serve meals on an a la
carte basis. Students dining at the Clemson House may use the
meal card as a cash equivalency or for a predesignated meal at no
additional cost. Meals may also be purchased on a cash basis or
with the Tiger Stripe Account (a declining balance account). 
<P>
In addition to the standard meal plans designed for frequent
diners, the University offers two plans designed specifically for
commuters. The Commuter 5 offers lunch Monday through Friday. Any
40 meal plans provide good value for the student on the run. 
<P>
Meal plans begin immediately after a student obtains a meal plan
at the beginning of the semester and end after the evening meal
on the day of graduation at the end of each semester. The meal
card is personal and may not be transferred or sold.
<P>
Students may change meal plans at the billing of spring semester
fees with no service charge. Students may change meal plans after
the first two weeks and prior to the last six weeks of the
semester by paying a $25 (Subject to change) service charge. Changes may be made at
the Tiger 1 Card Office located in Harcombe Hall on Mondays only.
All adjustments will be prorated. The only exception is for
students withdrawing from the University. Students may upgrade
during the registration period.
<P>
Meals not eaten during a week are not refunded or held in reserve
for use at another time. Only one meal may be eaten during a set
meal period.

<a name="Health Services">
<h2><I>Health Services </i></h2></a>

Redfern Health Center consists of three divisions: Counseling and
Psychological Services (CAPS), Health Education/Alcohol & Drug
Education, and Medical Services. Redfern is an ambulatory
outpatient facility that operates Monday through Friday from 7:30
a.m. - 5:00 p.m. Physician care is available Monday through
Friday from 8:00 a.m. - 5:00 p.m. (Summer hours 8:00 a.m. - 4:30
p.m.). Students are seen at Redfern throughout the day by
appointment. The CU NOW Clinic (a walk-in clinic) is available to
those students who do not have an appointment. During the Fall
and Spring semesters, ASK-A-NURSE telephone services are
available Sunday - Thursday from 4:00 - 8:00 p.m. The student
health center offers a variety of services including: counseling
and psychological services, outpatient ambulatory care for
illnesses and injury, health education/alcohol and drug
education, womens health care, nutritional counseling,
orthopedic clinics and allergy/immunization clinics.
<P>
The $95 (subject to change) per semester health fee (summer session fees are
prorated) covers the services of the University physicians,
psychologists, nurse practitioners and health educators. Included
in the health fee is a $500 per incident excess accident and
sickness benefit available for after-hours urgent care. Students
who pay the health fee pay reduced costs for pharmaceuticals,
laboratory and X-ray co-pays, allergy injections, physical
examinations, orthopedic equipment and womens health care.
Students are responsible for the cost of consultation with
referral physicians and medical or surgical services performed
away from campus. Dental and optical care are not offered by the
health service but can be obtained locally at the students
expense.
<P>
On-campus medical emergencies are transported by the University
ambulance to the closest community medical resource. The
University ambulance is staffed with certified emergency medical
personnel 24 hours a day. Students are required to pay for
off-campus ambulance transportation except for those medical
resources within the city of Clemson for after-hours urgent care.

<h3>Insurance</h3>

The University offers a plan of accident and sickness insurance
designed to help cover major medical expenses. Information on
this insurance plan is sent to all students prior to the
beginning of the fall semester. The health center strongly
encourages students who do not have adequate insurance coverage
to purchase health insurance.

<h3>Immunization Requirements </h3>

The University requires that all new students have documentation
of two red measles (rubeola) vaccinations on or after their first
birthday. Those students who were born prior to January 1, 1957,
are exempt from the measles requirements. A tuberculin skin test
(PPD or Mantoux) is required within the past year. If there is a
history of a positive skin test, a chest X-ray is required within
the past year. A tetanus toxoid immunization is required within
the past ten years. Students not in compliance with immunization
requirements will not be allowed to complete registration.

<h3>After Hours</h3>

During the Fall and Spring semesters, students who have questions
about their health needs utilize the ASK-A-NURSE telephone
service at (864) 656-2233 (Sunday - Thursday, 4:00 - 8:00 p.m.).
A registered nurse is available by telephone to answer questions,
provide health information and schedule appointments for
practitioners at Redfern.
<P>
Students requiring the care of a physician after hours may choose
from area emergency rooms and urgent-care facilities. These
facilities include Clemson Health Center (an urgent-care
facility), Oconee Memorial Hospital, Anderson Area Medical
Center, Baptist Medical Center and Greenville Memorial Medical
Center.

<a name="Housing">
<h2><I>Housing</i></h2></a>

<h3>Graduate and Undergraduate (Semester Option)</h3>
University housing accommodates nearly 7,000 single students in
20 residence halls, three apartment complexes and the Clemson
House, all conveniently located on the main campus and
economically priced for both graduate and undergraduate students.
<P>
All University housing is air-conditioned, and cable television
is provided. Residence hall rooms are equipped with beds, chests
of drawers, desks and chairs. Normally, two students are assigned
to a room unless the single occupancy option is chosen.
Apartments have two bedrooms complete with beds, chests of
drawers, desks and chairs, a living room, bathroom and a kitchen.
Four students are assigned to each of these units.
<P>
Graduate students interested in these accommodations should
contact the Housing Office at least six months prior to their
date of enrollment. While this housing is designed primarily to
meet the needs of undergraduate students, graduate students are
encouraged to apply and are given high priority for assignments. 
<P>
Once the request for housing is received, an application will be
sent. Students attending Clemson University for the first time
will pay a nonrefundable $25 (Subject to change) housing application fee. Students
previously enrolled at Clemson University will be asked to pay a
$95 (Subject to change) advance housing deposit, which serves as a credit against
the semester fees.
<P>
Rental rates per semester are shown below.

<h3>Graduate Student Housing (Monthly Option)</h3>

A significant number of Thornhill Village apartments are
designated as the graduate student area with a 12- or 9-month
lease option available beginning August 1 of each year. Each
Thornhill Village apartment is a two-bedroom unit with a full
kitchen, living room and bathroom. Close proximity to the center
of campus, convenient parking and laundry facilities, cable
television and nightly security staff add to the appeal of this
complex. Special extensions on the lease are available for
December graduates. Each apartment is double occupancy, thus
allowing adequate space for privacy and an area conducive for
studying.
<P>
Graduate students who choose to live in this area sign a lease
and pay a $200 (Subject to change) security deposit. This deposit is refundable
through June 1. After June 1, only those students not enrolling
for the fall semester will be released from the lease agreement.
Monthly payments of $315 (Subject to change) for a 12-month lease and $345 (Subject to change) for a
9-month lease are due on the fifth day of each month. (All
utilities, cable television and local telephone service are
included.) The first months rent is due when a resident checks
in and takes possession of the apartment key.
<P>
Further information can be obtained by writing the Housing
Office, Clemson University, 200 Mell Hall, Box 344075, Clemson,
SC 29634-4075 or by calling (864) 656-2295.

<h3>Family/Faculty Housing</h3>

The University provides comfortable and economical family housing
apartments, including two-bedroom townhouse apartments,
two-bedroom duplex apartments and three-bedroom duplex apartments
for married and single-parent students. All units have washer and
dryer hookups.
<P>

<td>3 Bedroom Faculty House<td>$395* - $495*<tr>
<td colspan=2>* Subject to change<tr>
</table>
<P>

upon request. Students must have a graduate assistantship or
fellowship to qualify for family/faculty housing. Further
information can be obtained by writing the Family Housing Office,
Clemson University, 101 Mell Hall, Box 344075, Clemson, SC
29634-4075 or by calling (864) 656-0829.

<h3>International Students and Exchange Visitors</h3>

Students in F-1 visa status transferring from within the United
States will receive on-campus housing information from OIPS upon
submitting the Transfer Clearance Form. Students coming from
abroad will receive on-campus housing information from OIPS along
with the Form I-20 or Form IAP-66. There being no permanent
on-campus housing available to J-1 exchange visitors, housing
arrangements for visitors not registering for classes are made
with the assistance of the hosting academic department or
affiliated institute/organization.

<h3>Students with Disabilities</h3>

Clemson University is committed to providing equal opportunities
to all students and assisting them in making their college
experience successful and positive. Individuals with disabilities
requesting accommodations must provide current documentation of

<body>
<h1>Residence Requirements</h1>

<a name="Application for Resident Status">
<h2><I>Application for Resident Status</I></H2></a>

Any prospective or enrolled graduate student, whose status
concerning entitlement to payment of in-state tuition and fees is
uncertain, has the responsibility of securing a ruling from the
University by providing all relevant information on special
application forms. These forms can be obtained from the Graduate
School Office and are to be completed and returned to that office
at least two weeks prior to registration for any semester or
summer term for which the student is attempting to qualify for
payment of in-state tuition and fee rates.
<P>
By law, the burden of proof for establishing eligibility is on
the student. Therefore, residence applications should be prepared
in a complete and accurate manner and should be accompanied by
adequate documentation. Once the requisite steps to establish
residence and domicile have been taken, the position and validity
of the claim will be evaluated.
<P>
The residence officer will review the application and supporting
documentation which is provided and render a judgment as soon as
possible (usually at least two weeks). There may be
circumstances, however, that require extensive documentation
which could result in extended review periods for certain
applications.

<a name="Domicile Requirements">
<h2><I>Domicile Requirements</i></h2></a>

South Carolina law provides that independent persons who reside
in and have been domiciled in South Carolina for a period of no
less than 12 months with an intention of making a permanent home
in South Carolina, and their dependents, may be considered
eligible for in-state rates on tuition and fees while attending
South Carolina state-supported colleges and universities. <B>Please
realize that merely residing in the state for a year does not
satisfy the domicile requirement.</b> The 12-month domicile period is
not measured until after the independent person takes positive
steps which establish a legal connection to South Carolina and
reflect an intent to establish a permanent home in South
Carolina. In other words, specific action to affiliate legally
with the state of South Carolina will serve generally as the
benchmark for the beginning of the 12-month waiting period.

<a name="Penalties for Willful Misrepresentation">
<h2><I>Penalties for Willful Misrepresentation</i></h2></a>

Individuals who make willful misrepresentations of fact relative
to their claims to South Carolina residence shall be charged
tuition and fees past due and unpaid at the out-of-state rate,
plus interest at a rate of 8 percent per annum, plus a penalty
amounting to 25 percent of the out-of-state rate for one
semester. Until these charges have been paid, no such student
shall be allowed to receive transcripts or graduate from Clemson
University or any state institution.

<a name="Resident Tuition and Fees">
<h2><I>Resident Tuition and Fees</i></h2></a>

<I>Application for Resident Status</i> - Any undergraduate student or
prospective student whose status concerning entitlement to
payment of in-state tuition and fees is uncertain has the
responsibility of securing a ruling from the University by
providing all relevant information on special application forms.
These forms can be obtained from the Office of Admissions and
Registration and are to be completed and returned to that office
at least two weeks prior to registration for any semester or
summer term for which the student is attempting to qualify for
payment of the in-state tuition and fee rate.
<P>

have only one legal domicile; one is presumed to abandon

dependents, may be considered eligible for in-state rates.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>Independent persons who reside in and have been domiciled in
South Carolina for fewer than twelve months but who have
full-time employment in the State, and their dependents, may be
considered eligible for in-state rates for as long as such
independent person is employed on a full-time basis in the State.<tr>
<td valign=top>C.<td>Where an independent person meeting the provisions of
Section 59-112-20 B above, is living apart from his spouse, or

employed spouse, (2) if the dependent requesting domiciliary
status for tuition and fee purposes is under the legal custody or
guardianship, as defined in Section 59-112-10I above, of an
independent person who is domiciled in this State; or if such
dependent is claimed as an income tax exemption by the parent not
having legal custody but paying child-support, so long as either
parent remains domiciled in South Carolina.<tr>
<td valign=top>D.<td>The residence and domicile of a dependent minor shall be
presumed to be that of the parent of such dependent minor.<tr>
</table>
<P>
<I>Effect of Change of Residency</i> - Section 59-112-30. When the

academic session after expiration of twelve months from date of
domicile in this State.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>When South Carolina domicile is lost, eligibility for
in-state rates shall end on the last day of the academic session
in which the loss occurs; however, application of this subsection

continue to be enrolled at such rate even if the parent, spouse,
or guardian upon whom he is dependent moves his domicile from
this State.<tr>
</table>
<I>Effect of Marriage</i> - Section 59-112-40. Except as provided in
Section 59-112-20 above, marriage shall affect determinations of
domicile for tuition and fee purposes only insofar as it operates
to evince an intention by the parties to make a permanent home in
South Carolina.
<P>
<I>Military Personnel and Their Dependents</i> - Section 59-112-50.
Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, during the period

an intent to establish domicile in South Carolina and if they
have resided in South Carolina for a period of at least twelve
months immediately preceding their discharge.
<P>
<I>Faculty, Administrative Employees and Dependents Thereof</i> -

of State Institutions, and the spouses and children of such
persons, shall be excluded from the provision of this act.
<P>
<I>Abatement of Rates for Nonresidents on Scholarship</i> - Section
59-112-70. Notwithstanding other provisions of this act, the
governing boards listed in Section 59-112-10 A above, are

designate an official to administer the provisions of this act.
Students making application to pay tuition and fees at in-state
rates shall have the burden of proving to the satisfaction of the
aforesaid officials of State Institutions that they have
fulfilled the requirements of this act before they shall be
permitted to pay tuition and fees at such rate.
<P>
<I>Penalties for Willful Misrepresentation</i> - Section 59-112-90.

<I>Regulatory Guidelines</i> - Commission on Higher Education, Chapter
62. Statutory Authority: 1976 Code Sections 59-112-10 to
59-112-100, Determination of Rates for Tuition and Fees.
<P>
<I>Rates of Tuition and Fees</i> - Section 62-600

<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>Resident classification is an essential part of fee
determination, admission regulations, and other relevant policies
of State institutions. It is important that such institutions
have fair and equitable regulations which can be administered
consistently and are sensitive to the interests of both students
and the State. The Commission on Higher Education hereby
establishes regulations for the Statute Governing Residency and
Tuition for Fee Purposes to be applied consistently by all South
Carolina institutions of higher education. These regulations do
not address residency matters relating to either in-county or
international categories used within the State's technical
colleges.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>Institutions of higher education are required by the Statute
to determine the residence classification of applicants. The
initial determination of one's resident status is made at the
time of admission. The determination made at that time, and any
determination made thereafter, prevails for each subsequent
semester until the determination is successfully challenged. The
burden of proof resides with the students to show evidence as
deemed necessary to establish their residency status.<tr>
</table>
<P>

<I>Code of Laws Governing Residence</i> - Section 62-601
<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>The rules regarding the establishment of legal residence for
tuition and fee purposes for institutions of higher education are
governed by the South Carolina Code of Laws.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>As prescribed by the code, residence for tuition and fee
purposes can be established by (1) independent persons, (2)
dependent persons, and (3) independent immigrants, or dependent
immigrants.<tr>

<P>

<I>Definitions</i> - Section 62-602
<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>A "resident student" for tuition and fee purposes is defined
as an independent person who has abandoned all prior domiciles
and has been domiciled in South Carolina continuously for at
least twelve months immediately preceding the first day of
classes of the term for which resident classification is sought
and for whom there is an absence of such evidence in other states
or countries, not withstanding other provisions of the Statute.
In the instances of dependent students and their families who are
citizens or permanent residents, the domicile of the spouse,
parent, and/or guardian for at least the twelve months
immediately preceding the first day of classes of the term for
which resident classification is sought is considered in
determining residency status.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>"Reside" is defined as continuous and permanent physical
presence within the State, provided that temporary absences for
short periods of time shall not affect the establishment of
residence.
<P>
Temporary absences shall be absences which are thirty days
or less. Excluded are absences associated with requirements to
complete a degree, absences for military training service, and
like absences, provided South Carolina domicile is maintained.
Absences of more than thirty days may affect the establishment or
maintenance of residence for tuition and fee purposes. In the
instance of dependents, except for non-resident aliens, where the
spouse, parent and/or guardian "reside" will be considered in
determining residency status.<tr>
<td valign=top>C.<td>"Domicile" is defined as true, fixed, principal residence
and place of habitation, indicating where a person intends to
remain, or to where one expects to return when away. Generally,
an applicant must be domiciled in the State for twelve months for
residency consideration.<tr>
<td valign=top>D.<td>"Independent Person" is defined as one in his/her majority
(eighteen years of age or older), whose predominant source of
income is his/her own earnings or income from employment,
investments, or payments from trusts, grants, scholarships,
loans, or payments made in accordance with court order. An
independent person must provide more than half of his/her support
during the twelve months immediately prior to the date that
classes begin for the semester for which resident status is
requested and cannot be claimed as a dependent or exemption on
the federal tax return of his/her parent, spouse, or guardian for
the year in which resident status is requested.<tr>
<td valign=top>E.<td>"Dependent Person" is defined as one whose predominant
source of income or support is from payments from a parent,
spouse, or guardian and who qualifies for and is claimed as a
dependent or exemption on the federal income tax return of the
parent, spouse, or guardian. A dependent person is also one for
whom payments are made, under court order, for child support and
the cost of the dependent person's college education.<tr>
<td valign=top>F.<td>"Terminal Leave" is defined as a transition period following
active employment and immediately preceding retirement (with a
pension or annuity), during which the individual may use
accumulated leave.<tr>
<td valign=top>G.<td>"Immediately Prior" is defined as a period of time not
exceeding ninety days and immediately preceding the first day of
classes for the term in question.<tR>
<td valign=top>H.<td>"Continue to be Enrolled" is defined as continuous
enrollment without an interruption that would require the student
to pursue a formal process of readmission to that institution.
Formal petitions or applications for change of degree level shall
be considered readmissions.<tr>
<td valign=top>I.<td>"Non-resident Alien" is defined as a person who is not a
citizen or permanent resident of the United States. By virtue of
their non-resident status "non-resident aliens" generally do not
have the capacity to establish domicile in South Carolina.<tr>
<td valign=top>J.<td>"Academic Session" is defined as a term or semester of
enrollment.<tr>

<td valign=top>A.<td>Independent persons who have physically resided and been
domiciled in South Carolina for twelve continuous months
immediately preceding the date the classes begin for the semester
for which resident status is claimed may qualify to pay in-state
fees. The twelve-month residency period does not start until the
independent person begins to take steps which indicate that the
independent person intends to establish a permanent home in the
State. Absences from the State for more than thirty days during
the twelve-month period may affect the establishment of permanent
residence for fee and tuition purposes. Steps an independent
person should take to establish a permanent home in South
Carolina are listed in the section entitled "Establishing the
Requisite Intent to Become a South Carolina Domiciliary." <tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>The resident status of a dependent person is based on the
resident status of the person who provides more than half of the
dependent person's support and claims the dependent person as a
dependent for federal income tax purposes. The residence and
domicile of a dependent minor and other dependent persons shall
be presumed to be that of their parent(s), spouse, or
guardian(s).<tr>

status of the dependent person may be based on the resident
status of the parent who supports and/or claims the dependent
person as a dependent for tax purposes, or it may be based on the
resident status of the parent who has legal custody of the
dependent person.<tr>

Section 62-604
<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>Except as otherwise specified in this section, all
non-citizens and non-permanent residents of the United States
will be assessed tuition and fees at the non-resident,
out-of-state rate. Independent aliens, including refugees,
untainted, and parolees and their dependents, may be entitled to
resident, in-state classification once they have been awarded
permanent resident status by the U.S. Department of Justice and
meet all the statutory residency requirements provided that all
other domiciliary requirements are met. Time spent living in
South Carolina immediately prior to the awarding of permanent
resident status may not be counted towards the twelve month
residency period. Certain non-resident aliens present in the
United States in specified visa classification may be granted
in-state residency for tuition and fee purposes as prescribed by
the Commission on Higher Education.<tr>

<I>Establishing the Requisite Intent to Become a South Carolina
Domiciliary</i> - Section 62-605
<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>Residence status may not be acquired by an applicant or
student while residing in South Carolina for the sole purpose of
enrollment in an institution or for access to state-supported
programs designed to serve South Carolina residents.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>If a person asserts that his/her domicile has been
established in this State, the individual has the burden of
proof. Such persons should provide to the designated residency
official any and all evidence which the person believes satisfies
the burden of proof. The residency official will consider any and
all evidence provided concerning such claim of domicile, but will
not necessarily regard any single item of evidence as conclusive
evidence that domicile has been established.<tr>
<td valign=top>C.<td>For independent persons, examples of intent to become a
South Carolina resident may include, although any single
indicator may not be conclusive, indicia as listed below. The
absence of indicia in other states or countries is required
before the student is eligible to pay in-state rates. Indicia may
include:
<br>
<ol>
<li>statement of full-time employment;
<li>possession of a valid South Carolina voter registration card
and voting in South Carolina elections;
<li>designating South Carolina as state of legal residence on
military record;
<li>possession of a valid South Carolina driver's license, or if
a non-driver, a South Carolina identification card;
<li>possession of a valid South Carolina vehicle registration
card;
<li>continuous presence in South Carolina during periods when
not enrolled as a student;
<li>paying South Carolina income taxes as a resident during the
past tax year, including income earned outside of South Carolina
from the date South Carolina domicile was claimed;
<li>ownership of principal residence in South Carolina; and
<li>licensing for professional practice (if applicable) in South
Carolina.
</ol>
<tr>
<td valign=top>D.<td>These indicia will likewise be considered for spouses,
parents, and guardians of dependent persons who wish to establish
South Carolina domicile. As noted under "Citizens and Permanent
Residents" above, the resident status of a dependent person
matches that of the person who provides more than half of the
dependent person's support and claims the dependent person as a
dependent for federal tax purposes.<tr>

<I>Maintaining Residence</i> - Section 62-606
<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>A person's temporary absence from the State does not
necessarily constitute loss of South Carolina residence unless
the person has acted inconsistently with the claim of continued
South Carolina residence during the person's absence from the
State. The burden is on the person to show retention of South
Carolina residence during the person's absence from the State.
Steps a person should take to retain South Carolina resident
status for fee and tuition purposes include continuing to use a
South Carolina permanent address on all records; retaining South
Carolina voter's status; voting by absentee ballot; maintaining
South Carolina driver's license; maintaining South Carolina
vehicle registration; satisfying South Carolina resident income
tax obligation. Individuals claiming permanent residence in South
Carolina are liable for payment of income taxes on their total
income from the date that they established South Carolina
residence. This includes income earned in another state or
country.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>South Carolina residents (and their dependents) who serve in
the military may continue to be eligible to pay in-state fees as
long as they continuously claim South Carolina as their state of
legal residence during their military service. South Carolina
residents who change their state of legal residence while in the
military lose their South Carolina resident status for fee and
tuition purposes. To re-establish their South Carolina resident
status, such persons must take steps which indicate that they
plan to re-establish permanent residence in the State. These
persons must then physically reside in the State for twelve
continuous months.<tr>

<I>Effect of Change of Residency</i> - Section 62-607

dependent person, except as otherwise excluded, who has been
domiciled with his/her family in South Carolina for a period of
not less than three years immediately prior to enrollment at
State supported colleges and universities may enroll in those
institutions of higher learning at in-state rates and may
continue to be enrolled at such rates even if the person upon
whom he/she is dependent moves his/her domicile from this State.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>If a dependent or independent person has been domiciled in
South Carolina for less than three years, eligibility for
in-state rates shall end on the last day of the academic session
during which domicile is lost.<tr>

<I>Effect of Marriage</i> - Section 62-608
<table>
<td valign=top>A.<td>In ascertaining domicile of a married person, irrespective
of gender, such a review shall be determined just as for an
unmarried person by reference to all relevant evidence of
domiciliary intent.<tr>
<td valign=top>B.<td>If a nonresident marries a South Carolina resident, the
nonresident does not automatically acquire South Carolina
resident status. The nonresident may acquire South Carolina
resident status if the South Carolina resident is an independent
person and the nonresident is a dependent of the South Carolina
resident.<tr>
<td valign=top>C.<td>Marriage to a person domiciled outside South Carolina shall
not be solely the reason for precluding a person from
establishing or maintaining domicile in South Carolina and
subsequently becoming eligible or continuing to be eligible for
residency.<tr>
<td valign=top>D.<td>No person shall be deemed solely by reason of marriage to a
person domiciled in South Carolina to have established or
maintained domicile in South Carolina and consequently to be
eligible for or to retain eligibility for South Carolina
residency.<tr>

<I>Exclusions</i> - Section 62-609

in-state fees for a period of twelve months after their discharge
from the military, provided they have demonstrated an intent to
establish a permanent home in South Carolina and they have
resided in South Carolina for a period of at least twelve months
immediately preceding their discharge. Military personnel who are
not stationed in South Carolina and/or former military personnel

<h1>Graduate Expenses</h1>

<a name="Academic Expenses">
<h2><I>Academic Expenses</i></h2></a>

<h3>Academic Fees</h3>
1. <I>Graduate Assistants</i>. Graduate assistants pay a flat fee of
$460(subject to change) per semester and $154(subject to change) for each summer session. Graduate
assistants may elect to sign a payroll deduction agreement at the
time of registration; however, it should be noted that payroll
deductions are not available during summer sessions. The
deduction will be for academic fees and/or the health fee, up to
the maximum amount due. Details on the deferred payment schedule
may be found on page 20 under the heading Fiscal Policy.
<P>
In order for graduate assistants to qualify for this academic fee
structure and deferred payment schedule, the assistantship
appointment must be made known to the Graduate School by the
employing department and the duties must commence within the
three-day period following the first day of normal registration
in regular semesters. International graduate students are
required to be in proper immigration status before any
assistantship offer is extended or attending benefits ensue.
Should the assistantship begin after the three-day period,
through no fault of the student, the student will receive a
refund on a prorata basis for the difference between normal
academic fees and those charged as a result of the assistantship.
<P>
Likewise, if an assistantship is terminated prior to the end of
the regular semester or session, the student may be liable only
for a prorated amount of the fee reduction already enjoyed. (See
"Termination of Assistantships" on page 22.) 
2. <I>Graduate Fellows and Trainees</i>. Graduate fellows and trainees
pay fees applicable to South Carolina residents, as shown in the
next paragraph. Fellowship and traineeship recipients are
eligible for appointment as departmental graduate assistants. For
students holding both fellowships or traineeships and
assistantships, the fee structure for assistantships prevails.
3. <I>Graduate Students</i>. Semester charges for graduate students are
determined by the credit load, with no distinction between
graduate and undergraduate credits.
<P>
Graduate students enrolled in 12 or more semester hours during a
semester will pay the following:
<P>
<table border>
<td> <th>South Carolina<br>Resident<th>Nonresident<tr>
<td>Academic Fee<td>$1,461*<td>$2,922*<tr>
<td colspan=3>* Subject to change<tr>

<P>
Payment of the above fees mandates a health fee but also provides
certain entitlements. (See "Related Expenses" on page 20.) 
<P>
Graduate students enrolled in less than 12 credit hours during a
semester will pay the following (except as noted otherwise):
<P>
<table border>

<td colspan=3>* Subject to change<tr>
</table>
<P>
Academic fees for classes taught out of state or out of country
are determined on the basis of location.
<P>
4. <I>Postbaccalaureate Students</I>. Postbaccalaureate students pay the
same academic fees as graduate students and are subject to
out-of-state fees, if applicable.
<P>
5. <I>Permanent University Faculty and Staff</I>. Permanent Clemson
University employees may take up to four credit hours free per
semester or summer session. Beyond these hours, they pay the
following:
<P>
<table border>
<td>Academic Fee (per semester hour)<td>$120*<tr>
<td colspan=2>* Subject to change<tr>
</table>
<P> 
A permanent employee (as defined by the Clemson University Office
of Business and Finance) is a person employed full time (37.5-40
hours per week, 9 or 12 months per year) in a regular position,
subject to the full control and responsibility of the University
and receiving full remuneration for his or her services in the
regular University budget. 
<P>Faculty should be aware of the policy restricting pursuit of
advanced degrees as found under University Employees on page
26.

<h3>Auditing Fees </h3>

Full-time students or graduate assistants may audit courses as
part of their schedule. Part-time students are charged according

<a name="Related Expenses">
<h2><I>Related Expenses</i></h2></a>

<H3>Health Fee</h3>
All graduate students enrolling in seven or more credits in the
fall or spring semester are required to subscribe to the health
fee of $95(subject to change) per semester. During the summer sessions, all
graduate students enrolling in four or more credits will be
required to subscribe to the health fee of $34(subject to change) per regular
session. Exemptions to this requirement include students not
taking classes on the main campus, international
visitors/scholars and employees of Clemson University. Graduate
assistants who have authorized a payroll deduction of academic
fees may include the cost of the health fee. Any student not
mandated to pay the health fee may do so voluntarily and benefit
from the services. 
<P>
The health fee provides for the services of the University
physicians, psychologists, nurse practitioners and health
educators. Included in the medical fee is an excess accident and
sickness benefit available for after-hours urgent care. For more
detailed information, see "Health Services" on page 13, or
contact Redfern Health Center at (864) 656-2233.
<P>
The University offers a plan of accident and sickness insurance
designed to help cover major medical expenses. Information on
this insurance plan is sent to all students prior to the
beginning of the fall semester. The health center strongly
encourages students who do not have adequate insurance coverage
to purchase the additional coverage.

<h3>Athletic Contests and University Concerts</h3>

Departmental graduate assistants and graduate resident assistants
are eligible to purchase two season tickets per sport at the
faculty-employee rates. Applications must be completed at the
Jervey Athletic Center ticket office.
<P>
For full-time graduate students enrolled in 12 or more semester
hours, tickets to home football and basketball games are
available at no charge upon presentation of a valid ID at times
and places published by the Athletic Department. Students are
admitted to all other on-campus intercollegiate athletic events,
except NCAA-sponsored championship play-off tournaments, upon
presentation of ID. The Athletic Department will make every
effort to accommodate all students who want to attend an athletic
event. However, when ticket demands are greater than available
seats, the Athletic Department reserves the right to refuse to
admit students if this would endanger the safety of participants
and spectators.
<P>
Graduate students, full-time and part-time, may attend University
concerts. Announcements on campus determine whether admission is
by ticket, by presenting student ID or free.
<P>
The ticket privileges just described do not apply to students
enrolled solely in the M.B.A. program on the campuses of Furman
University or Lander University.

<h3>Vehicle Registration</h3>

Vehicles must be registered immediately upon being brought to
campus. The cost of vehicle registration is $48(subject to change) for one year,
August 15 to August 15. Each additional vehicle is $6(subject to change), and
motorcycle registration is $18(subject to change). Parking permits and further
information may be obtained from Parking Services, Unit 228,
University Square, (864) 656-2270.

<a name="Fiscal Policy">
<h2><I>Fiscal Policy</i></h2></a>

<h3>Settlement of University Fees</h3>

The entire amount of the expense for each semester or summer
session is due and payable at the beginning of each semester or
summer session, and no student is enrolled officially until all
expenses are satisfied. In special cases, the University will
accept, at the beginning of a semester, a non-interest-bearing
promissory note for a portion of the semester residence hall and
board fee. In such cases, the note for the first semester charges
will be due October 1, and the note for the second semester
charges will be due March 1. International graduate students are
not eligible for this promissory note. 
<P>
Upon certification by the dean of the Graduate School and upon
authorization by the student of a payroll deduction for payment,
deferred payment of academic and health fees may be granted to a
student employed as a graduate assistant. The total amount
deferred shall not exceed the total of the graduate assistant
fees for the semester. Payment of the amount deferred is to be
made in six equal installments through payroll deductions
beginning with the second pay period of the semester. Should an
assistantship be terminated, any unpaid balance of funds deferred
is payable immediately as well as any additional fees due. No
deferred payments are permitted for summer sessions for any
graduate student. 
<P>
All other transactions relating to payment should be conducted
with the Office of Business Affairs. All checks and money orders
should be made payable to Clemson University. A personal check
given in payment of University expenses which is returned by the
bank unpaid immediately creates an indebtedness to the
University. 

<h3>Returned Checks/Charge Cards</h3>

A check or charge card given in payment of University expenses or
a check cashed by the University that is returned unpaid by the
bank immediately creates an indebtedness to the University. The
Office of Business Affairs, G08 Sikes Hall, administers matters
related to the collection of all returned items for students and
nonstudents.
<P>
The Bursar's Office will redeposit returned checks in payment of
academic fees for the fall and spring semesters. A $20(subject to change) service
charge will be assessed for each returned item in accordance with
state laws. Students with returned items for payment of academic
fees are also subject to a late payment fee of $5(subject to change) per calendar
day, not to exceed $350(subject to change), beginning the day after the last day of
late registration. If the item was returned to the University in
a timely manner and there was no response by the student or
drawer, a written request to disenroll the student is made to the
registrar. If the request is approved, the percentage of refund
will be applied to the debt. If the item is returned after the
midpoint of the semester and there is no response by the student
or drawer, a decision will be made by the director of business
affairs and the registrar as to the effects of disenrollment. At
this point, the student will owe 100 percent of tuition and fees
even if he or she has been disenrolled. The University may
restrict subsequent payment for academic and other fees by
accepting only cash, certified checks, cashiers checks or money
orders.
<P>
Any individual who cashes a two-party check for payment of
University expenses will be held responsible for that check if it
is returned unpaid by the bank. Checks used as payment for
various University services, such as meal plans, housing, etc.,
that are later returned unpaid by the bank, give the University
the right to cancel such services and cause forfeiture of any
refund.
<P>
Any returned item not collected may be turned over to a
collection agency and the indebtedness reported to a credit
bureau. Costs of collection will be added to the debt.
Transcripts and diplomas will be withheld pending payment, and
the debt may be deducted from state income tax refunds.
<P>
Abuse of check cashing and check payment privileges may result in
the restriction of such privileges for an indefinite period of
time based on the frequency and/or dollar amount, as determined
by the Office of Business Affairs.

<h3>Refund of Fees </h3>

<I>Regular Semester</i>. No refunds will be made on a semesters
academic and medical fees after four weeks from the last day to
register. In the case of a withdrawal from school, the refund
will be based on the effective date of withdrawal as shown on the
official University withdrawal form. Refunds for full-time
students who drop to part time and part-time students who drop
credit hours will be based on the date the course is dropped. To
be eligible for a refund, the request must be received by the
Office of Business Affairs prior to the beginning of the next
term. If a student withdraws prior to the last day to register,
the refund is 100 percent. <B>Beginning with the day following the
last day to register</b>, refunds for periods of four weeks or less
during a semester shall be made on the schedule shown below.
<P>

effective date of withdrawal as shown on the official University
withdrawal form. Refunds for students who drop credit hours will
be based on the date the course is dropped. To be eligible for a

<P>

<h3>Past Due Student Accounts</h3>

Any indebtedness to the University that becomes past due
immediately jeopardizes the students enrollment, and no such
student will be permitted to graduate or register for a
subsequent semester or summer school term. Further, any student
who fails 
to pay all indebtedness to the University may not be issued a
transcript or diploma. 

<h3>Establishment of University Fees</h3>

The annual State Appropriation Act imposes the general
requirement that student fees be fixed by the University Board of
Trustees. The act imposes two specific requirements on the Board:
(1) In fixing fees applicable to academic and general maintenance
and operation costs, the Board must maintain a minimum student
fee not less than the fee charged the previous year; (2) In
fixing fees applicable to dormitory rental, dining halls,
laundry, infirmary and all other personal subsistence expenses,
the Board must charge students an amount sufficient to cover
fully the cost of providing such facilities and services.

<body>
<h1>Student Employment and
Financial Assistance </h1>
<a name="Graduate Appointments">
<h2><I>Graduate Appointments</I></H2></a>

Approximately 1,850 graduate students hold Clemson University appointments. These are 
of two kinds: (1) graduate assistantships requiring, for the most part, half-time 
employment and (2) fellowships or traineeships which require no service to the 
University. 
<P>
Clemson University, as a member of the Council of Graduate Schools in the United
States, subscribes to the following policy inherent in the resolution adopted by the 
Council regarding graduate appointments. In every case in which an appointment for the 
next academic year is offered to an actual or prospective student, the student, if 
acceptance is indicated before April 15, will have complete freedom through April 15 to 
submit, in writing, a resignation of the appointment in order to accept one elsewhere. 
However, an acceptance given or left in force after April 15 commits the student not to 
accept another appointment (at Clemson or elsewhere) without first obtaining a formal 
release from the first party to whom a commitment has been made. Similarly, an offer 
made after April 15 is conditional on presentation by the student of the written release 
from any previously accepted offer. 
<P>
To be eligible for any graduate appointment, a graduate student must satisfy the
appropriate minimum enrollment requirement described in each section below and the 
enrollment limit requirements found on page 29. The University reserves the right to 
withdraw the appointment at any time because of failure to meet these requirements. 
Graduate students also should understand that an appointment may be withdrawn at any 
time for failure to maintain a satisfactory academic status including grades [see 
"Academic Standards (Grading)" on page 28], special examinations and research 
efforts.

<h3>Departmental Graduate Assistantships </h3>

Assistantships are available in academic departments involving primarily instruction, 
research or extension and in nonacademic departments involving primarily 
administration. Application forms may be obtained from the Graduate School or from 
department heads and should be completed and filed early in the academic year before the 
student enrolls. Selection of assistantship recipients as well as notification of the 
appointment, its duration and the stipend are the responsibilities of the employing 
departments. All graduate assistants are granted partial remission of academic and other 
fees and enjoy certain other benefits provided for University staff personnel. 
<P>
1. <I>Eligibility</i>. To qualify for a departmental assistantship, the graduate student must
possess at least a bachelor's degree and be enrolled in a graduate degree program. In 
addition, the graduate student must devote 10 to 30 hours of service per week to the 
University and be engaged in employment that bears a recognizable relationship to his or 
her major field of study. Multiple employment of graduate students by the University 
(graduate appointment and/or hourly employment) is permitted. It is the responsibility of 
the secondary employer to receive permission of the primary employer and the Graduate 
School prior to assignment of any additional work and to ensure that the maximum work 
load of 30 hours per week is not exceeded. Upper limits on academic loads as related to 
hours of service per week are found in the section entitled "Enrollment Limits" on page 
29.
<P>
2. <I>Minimum Stipend</i>. The minimum graduate assistantship stipend must be
commensurate with a rate 1.2 times the prevailing federal minimum wage.
<P>
3. <I>Minimum Enrollment</I>. A minimum enrollment is required for appointment as a
departmental graduate assistant. During the academic year, the minimum enrollment is 
nine semester hours for all assistants. Minimum enrollment in the summer sessions is 
three semester hours per session irrespective of the degree objective. Undergraduate 
credits may be included in the minimum provided they are relevant to the student's 
degree program and required by the advisory committee. Credits in GS 799 may be 
included in the minimum in unusual cases cleared in advance with the Graduate School. 
<P>
4. <I>Employment Schedule and Leave without Pay</I>. Graduate students with 9-month or 12-
month graduate teaching assistantship appointments work on the same calendar as faculty 
with 9-month or 12-month appointments, respectively. Duties over holiday periods for 
graduate research assistantship appointments should be agreed upon by the student and 
the immediate faculty advisor in charge of the research program.
<P>
A graduate assistant may request up to four weeks of leave without pay per semester and
one week of leave without pay per summer session from his or her immediate supervisor 
for illness of a close family member, death in the immediate family, and personal illness 
or hardship. If leave is not approved by the administrator of the graduate assistantship, the 
graduate assistant may petition the Graduate School for approval.
<P>
A graduate assistant is eligible for up to six weeks of maternity leave without pay. The
request for maternity leave must be made to the department at least one month in 
advance.

<H3>Graduate Resident Assistantships</h3>

Part-time employment on the program staff of the residence halls is available to qualified 
graduate students. Preference is given to those who have had a successful undergraduate 
experience as a residence hall assistant. In general, 20 hours of service per week are 
required, and compensation for such employment amounts to a room or apartment, partial 
remission of academic and other fees, and approximately $1,000 per semester. Graduate 
resident assistants are subject to the enrollment limitation found on page 29, and the 
required minimum enrollment is coincident with that of departmental graduate assistants. 
Interested applicants should apply directly to the Housing Office. A personal interview is 
required prior to final selection. 

<h3>Assistantship Appointment Process</h3>

Each graduate assistant shall be provided a document to sign and return to the employing 
department at the time the offer is accepted. The document shall provide a brief 
description of the expectations of the employer, the anticipated beginning and ending 
dates, stipend amount, average hours of service per week, work schedule (where 
appropriate) and the conditions for reappointment, if any. In addition, the assistant must 
be apprised of the financial penalties that may be incurred regarding academic fees should 
the assistantship start after the beginning or be terminated before the end of the semester 
or sessions. (See page 19 under "Academic Fees.")

<h3>Termination of Assistantships</h3>

1. <I>Termination of Assistantship by Student</i>. Normally an assistantship is offered on an 
annual or on an academic year basis. A student may terminate an assistantship at the 
conclusion of a semester or summer session without penalty. However, if the student 
terminates his or her assistantship during a semester, the student may be liable, calculated 
on a prorata basis, for the difference between the normal academic fees and the reduced 
fees assessed as a result of the assistantship. If, in the opinion of the immediate supervisor 
of the assistantship, the termination was justifiable, the administrator may recommend to 
the dean of the Graduate School that no additional charge be made to the student.
<P>
2. <I>Termination of Assistantship for Cause</i>. If, in the opinion of the immediate supervisor
of the assistantship, a student is not carrying out the duties of the assistantship in a 
satisfactory manner, the assistantship may be terminated and the student held liable, 
calculated on a prorata basis, for the reduction in academic fees assessed as a result of the 
assistantship.
<P>
The procedure to be followed before terminating an assistantship for cause follows:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The immediate supervisor should first discuss the problem with the student and
try to resolve the problem. A record of this conversation is placed in the student's 
departmental file.
<li>If the performance of the student remains unsatisfactory, a signed written warning 
from the department head is sent to the student by certified or registered U.S. mail 
detailing the nature of the problem. The graduate dean shall be notified.
<li>If the performance of the student remains unsatisfactory, the department head 
gives the student a written notice of termination. At least two weeks should elapse 
between the written warning and the notice of termination. The graduate dean shall be 
notified.
</ul>
<br>
The student has the right to file a grievance with the Commission on Graduate Studies as 
described on page 29. The assistantship may also be terminated for dropping below the 
minimum credit hours required as described on this page or for failure to meet other 
academic requirements.

<h3>Fellowships and Traineeships</h3>

Approximately 140 outstanding graduate students hold fellowships or traineeships at 
Clemson University. In order for a monetary award to be designated a fellowship or a 
traineeship, it must provide the recipient a minimum of $1,000 for the academic year. 
These awards, received from a variety of alumni, foundation, governmental, individual or 
industrial sources, require no services. Payment in excess of actual educational costs is 
subject to federal and state taxes. 
<P>
Graduate Alumni Fellowships, University Research Fellowships and George R.
MacDonald Fellowships are University-wide awards administered by the Graduate 
School. These awards of $5,000 each for the academic year are made on a competitive 
basis to nominees selected by the departments. Scholarly potential and academic 
excellence are the sole criteria for the awards. 
<P>
Most fellowships and traineeships are administered by the individual colleges and
departments. Some awards, such as the Industrial Graduate Residency Fellowships, may 
limit the student's research to areas of interest to the donor and require a period of 
residency at the industrial site. Detailed information is available in the colleges or 
departments. 
<P>
South Carolina Graduate Incentive Fellowships of $5,000 for master's students or
$10,000 for doctoral students are available to minority graduate students. These awards 
are renewable. Master's students must be citizens of South Carolina. Preference is given 
to new applicants and those who express a commitment to remain and be employed in the 
state for two years. These fellowships are administered by the Office of Access and 
Equity.
<P>
Unless stipulated otherwise by the grantor and/or donor, holders of fellowships or
traineeships are required to enroll in the same minimum credit load as is applicable to 
departmental graduate assistants. Continued receipt of any fellowship or traineeship is 
contingent on the student's maintaining a satisfactory academic status. Normally a 
student cannot hold concurrently two or more fellowships or traineeships (or the 
equivalent thereof) administered by the University, regardless of the funding sources. 
Fellowship recipients are eligible for appointment as departmental graduate assistants. 
The Graduate School reserves the right to rescind fellowship offers when the total 
financial package considerably exceeds normal competitive packages. 
<P>
Fellowships and traineeships usually are offered in early March. Inquiries may be made to
the department of the student's major interest or to the Graduate School.

<a name="Hourly Employment">     
<h2><I>Hourly Employment</i></h2></a>

Employment on an hourly basis for a portion of a semester or session is possible in some 
departments. The maximum credit load is the same as that for graduate assistants found 
under "Enrollment Limits" on page 29. Enrolled graduate students (exclusive of full-
time University employees) may not be employed by the University for more than 30 
hours per week (graduate appointments and hourly employment combined), and no 
portion of the hourly employment shall be used to qualify students for benefits afforded 
those on graduate assistantship appointments.

<a name="Loans">
<H2><I>Loans</I></h2></a>

The Office of Student Financial Aid administers federal financial aid for graduate 
students. Many types of federal aid, such as the Federal Pell Grant, are not available to 
graduate students. However, the Federal Stafford Loan has extended loan limits for 
graduate students, and is available to most students regardless of income. 
<P>
U.S. citizens and eligible non-citizens can apply for the Federal Stafford Loan by
completing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA). The suggested 
deadline to apply is April 1 for the following fall semester.
<P>
Graduate students accepted into a degree program may borrow funds to cover their
established cost of attendance, less any fellowship stipends or fee waivers, up to $18,500 
per year.
<P>
Further information and application forms are available from the Office of Student
Financial Aid, G01 Sikes Hall, Box 345123, Clemson, SC 29634-5123.

<a name="Eligibility for Loans">
<h2><I>Eligibility for Loans</I></H2></a>

In order to qualify for a loan, graduate students must be enrolled in at least five credits in 
a regular semester (Fall or Spring) and three credits for the summer in any combination of 
enrollments. The Financial Aid Office reserves the right to deny loans in the summer 
when abnormal enrollments may be contrary to federal loan regulations.

<a name="Academic Common Market Program">
<h2><I>Academic Common Market Program</i></h2></a>

The State of South Carolina, through its membership in the Southern Regional Education 
Board (SREB), authorizes its public universities to participate in the Academic Common 
Market (ACM). Under this program, students who are not residents of South Carolina can 
enroll in selected graduate programs at Clemson University and pay academic fees 
appropriate for South Carolina residents provided all of the following conditions are met:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The student's state of legal residence is AK, AL, FL, GA, KY, LA, MS, OK, TN,
TX, VA or WV.
<li>The desired program of study is: the Ph.D. degree program in ceramic 
engineering, environmental systems engineering, industrial/organizational psychology or 
parks, recreation and tourism management; the M.S. or Ph.D. degree program in 
engineering mechanics, environmental toxicology or nutrition; the M.A. program in 
professional communication; the M.S. program in applied psychology, applied sociology, 
architecture or textile chemistry; or, the professional master's program in parks, 
recreation and tourism management (MPRTM).
<li>The Coordinating Board in the state of the student's legal residence has selected 
one of the above programs for its residents. 
</ul>
<br>
Programs offered by Clemson University are subject to change without advanced notice.
However, students who are enrolled in a program under the ACM provisions prior to its 
removal by Clemson University are entitled to continue and receive benefits provided 
they are continuously enrolled (summers excepted) and remain in good academic 
standing. The Graduate School should be consulted about any and all matters related to 
the ACM.

<a name="Special Employment Restrictions">
<h2><I>Special Employment Restrictions</i></h2></a>

Graduate students who are employed in programs administered directly or indirectly by 
Clemson University and are found to be in default on payments of student loans will be 
subject to wage withholding (garnish) according to Legislative Authority P.L. 102-164; 
To U.S.C. S1095A et seg.

<html><head><title>Admission Procedures and Requirements</title></head>
<body>
<h1>Admission Procedures and Requirements</h1>

<a name="Procedures">
<h2><I>Procedures</i></h2></a>

<h3>Application</h3>
Applicants may apply by submitting the normal paper application or by submitting an 
application electronically on the World Wide Web. The Internet address for Clemson 
University's Graduate School Netscape server is <a href="http://www.grad.clemson.edu">
http://www.grad.clemson.edu/index.htm</a>. Applicants may check the status of their 
application at this same Internet address.

<h3>Application Deadlines</h3>

Application for admission of United States citizens and residents should be received no 
later than five weeks prior to registration. This means that every required item in support 
of the application (completed application form, application fee, transcripts, letters of 
recommendation and test scores) must be on file with the Graduate School by this date. 
Applicants to programs requiring standardized test scores should complete these 
examinations at least 12 weeks before registration. Unless all admission credentials reach 
the Graduate School at least five weeks prior to registration, an acceptance cannot be 
guaranteed. Students applying to a graduate major significantly different from their 
undergraduate major may anticipate a longer period of time for a decision. A number of 
programs have earlier deadlines or restrict admission to fall semester only. Students are 
advised to contact the department for the deadlines of the program of proposed study. 
<P>
Applications for admission of prospective international students must be completed by
May 1 and October 1 for registration in the fall and spring semesters, respectively. This 
means that every required item in support of the application (completed application form, 
application fee, transcripts, letters of recommendation, test scores and financial 
certificate) must be on file with the Graduate School by these dates and that the actual 
application must have been on file at least four weeks in advance of these dates. Thus, 
international applicants living outside the United States should complete the required 
standardized tests at least three months prior to May 1 or October 1, as appropriate. 
Issuance of Form I-20 or Form IAP-66 for a student visa will be completed no later than 
June 15 and November 1 for registration in the fall and spring semesters, respectively. 
These dates apply to international applicants from abroad. Initial enrollment of 
international students in the summer sessions is strongly discouraged and is permitted 
only on rare occasions.

<h3>Application Fee and Time Limit</h3>

For applicants wishing to enroll in the Graduate School for the first time, a nonrefundable 
fee of $35(subject to change) payable to Clemson University via a money order or a check drawn on a 
United States bank must accompany the application material. Without this fee, 
applications will not be processed. Generally, acceptance under an application is valid for 
one year beyond the initial date desired for enrollment, inclusive. However, departments 
reserve the right to deny deferred admission because of limited space and/or resources. 
Thus, students wishing to defer enrollment must request and receive written approval for 
such action from the respective department. 
<P>
Applicants may apply to two areas without paying an additional $35(subject to change) application fee if
both applications are received within the one year time frame. However, a $35(subject to change) 
application fee will be required for each additional application.

<h3>Disposition of Application Materials</h3>

Credentials or supporting materials submitted for admission to the Graduate School 
become the property of the University and are not returned. Furthermore, no copies will 
be provided to a third party outside the University even if the applicant requests this 
release. Copies will be provided to appropriate offices at the University in the interest of 
academic matters or financial awards relative to the applicant. 

<a name="Academic Requirements">
<h2><I>Academic Requirements</I></H2></a>

<h3>New Applicants</h3>

As a minimum and general requirement for admission to any of the University's 
graduate programs, a prospective student must hold at least a four-year bachelor's degree 
from an institution whose scholastic rating is satisfactory to the University and must have 
the approval of the department head or program coordinator in which the major work is 
planned. Although the quality of an applicant's previous academic record always plays 
an integral role in any admission decision, a general division in requirements, based on 
the degree objective, exists as follows: 
<P>
1. <I>Master of Arts, Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy Degrees</i>. Criteria for
admission to these University-wide degrees include satisfactory scores on the general 
portion of the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE).**
<P>
Applicants to the M.S. degree program in industrial management must submit satisfactory
scores on the Graduate Management Admission Test (GMAT).** Applicants to the 
master's program in economics and the Ph.D. degree program in industrial management 
may submit satisfactory scores on the GMAT** in lieu of the GRE. 
<P>
2. <I>The Professional Degrees</i>. Admission criteria, recommended by the individual colleges
awarding the degree, may include professional experience and/or credentials as well as 
GRE general scores.** Specifically, the professional programs in accounting, business 
administration and health administration require satisfactory scores on the GMAT**.
<P>
International students, in addition to meeting the minimum and general requirement
stated previously, must submit satisfactory scores on the general portion of the Graduate 
Record Examinations** regardless of the degree objective. (However, see items 1 and 2 
above for the master's programs in industrial management, accounting and business 
administration.) A satisfactory score on the Test of English as a Foreign Language 
(TOEFL)*** is also required of international students whose native tongue is not English. 
The Graduate School may waive this requirement if the applicant has a demonstrated 
command of the English language. 
<P>
Admission to all programs is restricted to those students whose academic records clearly
indicate they are prepared to benefit from graduate study. The Graduate School reserves 
the right to require additional quantitative and aptitude examinations as well as personal 
interviews and/or oral examinations prior to reaching an admission decision. Neither an 
academic record exceeding minimum requirements, satisfactory scores on standardized 
tests, nor professional expertise alone will assure a student's admission. Rather, the total 
record must indicate the likelihood of successful graduate study. 
<hr size=25%>
<table>
<td>**<td>GRE or GMAT scores more than five years old relative to date of initial
enrollment will not be accepted.<tr>
<td>***<td>TOEFL scores more than two years old relative to date of initial enrollment
will not be accepted.<tr>
</table>
<P>
<h3>Assessment of Previous Academic Work</h3>

The grade point ratio representing an assessment of an applicant's undergraduate work 
will be based on the last half of the course work listed on the transcript or transcripts. In 
conventional cases, this will equate to the full junior and senior years. As a minimum, 60 
semester hours (or 90 quarter hours) will be examined, and in no cases will a partial term, 
session or enrollment period be utilized. Excluded in the computation are courses graded 
P/F and certain electives having no relationship to a curriculum. Departments are at 
liberty to discount still other courses in assessing an applicant's academic record. Certain 
professional programs may use the total undergraduate grade point average to satisfy 
accreditation standards. In evaluating the grade point ratio of an applicant's graduate 
work, all graduate course work will be used except research and/or courses graded P/F.

<h3>Conditional Acceptance</h3>

Notice of conditional acceptance may be given to highly qualified applicants prior to 
receipt of the degree they are presently pursuing; however, all requirements for this 
degree must be completed prior to enrolling in the proposed graduate program at Clemson 
University. Likewise, conditional acceptance may be given prior to receipt of satisfactory 
GRE or GMAT scores, if required, but such scores must be received prior to or during the 
first semester of enrollment.
<P>
Clemson University seniors lacking less than a full semester of work to complete the
requirements for their bachelor's degrees may apply to a graduate program and, if 
granted conditional acceptance, be allowed to enroll in courses for graduate credit. Refer 
to "Clemson University Seniors" on page 26.

<h3>Applicants Presently Enrolled in Graduate School</h3>

Students enrolled in a master's degree program at Clemson University who wish to 
continue their studies in another master's program, a specialist program or a doctoral 
program after completing their initial degree objective may apply by submitting the 
normal application, color-coded green. This application must be supported by the 
student's advisory committee for the master's degree or other faculty designated by the 
graduate dean who are associated with the applicant's present or proposed program. 
<P>
Students holding both the bachelor's and master's degrees from Clemson University are
encouraged to pursue doctoral programs at other institutions. 

<h3>Change of Degree Program</h3>

Students who have enrolled in a given degree program within the past two calendar years 
may request a change of major and/or degree without submitting a new application. 
Instead, the student must submit to the Graduate School Form GS14 endorsed by the 
department head(s) or program chairperson(s) of the affected degree program(s). All 
program and Graduate School requirements must be met before final approval will be 
granted. 

<h3>Readmission</h3>

A former graduate student who has not maintained continuous enrollment (summers 
excluded), but who is academically eligible to continue in the graduate degree program 
where he or she was most recently enrolled, may be permitted to return. The procedures 
are dictated by the period of absence from enrollment as follows: 
<P>
1. <I>Less than Two Years</i>. The student simply notifies the Graduate School and the program
coordinator of his or her plans to return. 
<P>
2. <I>Two to Six Years</i>. A new application must be submitted and endorsed by the program
coordinator and the Graduate School. The application must show any intervening 
graduate work, and appropriate official transcripts of the work may be required by the 
Graduate School. 
<P>
3. <I>Six or More Years</i>. A new application and all supporting materials will be required;
that is, such persons are considered to be new applicants.
<P>
Former graduate students described above who wish to return to Clemson University to
pursue an undergraduate degree and/or course work with no immediate plans for graduate 
work should contact the Registrar's Office for procedures.

<h3>Academic Renewal</h3>

The student who was dismissed from the Graduate School for a grade point deficiency 
and who has not enrolled for a period of four or more academic years may apply to the 
Graduate School for readmission under special conditions known as academic renewal. 
Under these conditions, the previous graduate credits attempted and quality point deficit 
will not constitute a liability in a new grade point computation. However, no credits 
passed or their attending quality points will be available to the student for a degree at 
Clemson, and any courses previously passed may not be validated by special 
examination. The previous record will appear on the permanent record as well as the 
notation of readmission under the policy of academic renewal.

<h3>Duplication of Higher Degrees</h3>

The duplication of higher degrees is discouraged on the same basis as the duplication of 
the bachelor's degree. Thus, a student holding a master's degree may not as a rule 
become a candidate for another master's degree of the same designation, regardless of 
the field of study. Nor may the holder of a master's degree in a given field, received at 
another institution, become a candidate for another master's degree in the same field at 
Clemson. 

<a name="Medical Requirements">
<h2><I>Medical Requirements</i></h2></a>

Graduate students entering Clemson University for the first time receive a medical history 
form. Prior to registration, the medical form (including immunization documentation) 
must be completed and returned to the Medical Records Department at Redfern Health 
Center. Students will not be allowed to complete registration without meeting 
immunization requirements.
<P>
The University requires that all new students have documentation of two red measles
(rubeola) vaccinations on or after their first birthday. Those students who were born prior 
to January 1, 1957, are exempt from the measles requirements. A tuberculin skin test 
(PPD or Mantoux) is required within the past year. If there is a history of a positive skin 
test, a chest X-ray also is required within the past year. Students not in compliance with 
immunization requirements will not be allowed to complete registration.

<a name="Admission Classifications">
<h2><I>Admission Classifications</i></h2></a>

<h3>Admission to a Degree Program</h3>

Candidates for admission to a degree program will be admitted in one of the following 
categories:
<P>
1. <I>Full Status</i>. The applicant's credentials equal or exceed every minimum admission
criterion prescribed for the particular degree.
<P>
2. <I>Provisional Status</i>. At least one admission criterion prescribed for the particular degree
is marginal. Such applicants will be required to remove the provisional status with a 
satisfactory academic performance during the first semester.* Doctoral degree applicants 
will not be admitted provisionally.
<P>
3. <I>Conditional Acceptance</i>. At least one item required for admission is not available.
<P>
In addition to meeting the minimum and general requirements for admission listed under
"Academic Requirements" (page 24), the student must be recommended for admission 
by the program coordinator or department head and must meet any special departmental 
requirements.

<h3>Admission as a Nondegree Student</h3>

Admission in this category is restricted primarily to those persons who may benefit 
professionally from additional study at the graduate level, for example, public school 
teachers who are required to complete graduate courses for recertification. In general, the 
only supportive material required for such admission is a valid transcript showing an 
appropriate background and confirming the awarding of a bachelor's degree or higher. 
<P>
Students in the nondegree category may not be candidates for advanced degrees and may
not receive a graduate appointment for financial assistance. Should the student 
subsequently be admitted to a degree program, a maximum of 12 semester hours of 
graduate credit taken at any campus (nondegree and/or transfer) may be applied toward 
the degree. In all cases the nondegree student must receive permission from the head of 
the department before enrolling in graduate courses. This classification is not open to 
international students. 
<P>
Students enrolled in a nondegree status are subject to the same academic regulations
regarding continuous enrollment as apply to those in a degree program. Refer to page 28. 

<h3>Admission as a Postbaccalaureate Student</h3>

An applicant may be accepted by the Graduate School as a postbaccalaureate student if he 
or she applies to a specific graduate degree program and does not have the appropriate 
academic background. The applicant must be recommended by the department head or 
program chairperson and must meet all the other requirements for admission to that 
degree program regarding grade point ratio and standardized test scores. A change in 
major between the undergraduate and graduate levels may require a longer review time by 
the department. A student in this category who is denied admission because of failure to 
meet the minimum requirements has access to the same appeal procedure as any other 
student applying to the Graduate School. 
<P>
Applicants will be classified as postbaccalaureate students if they are not qualified to take
at least one graduate course per semester that can be included in the minimum hours 
required for the graduate degree. Additionally, any student required to complete more 
than 18 semester hours of undergraduate credits will be classified as postbaccalaureate. 
Until the required number of undergraduate credit hours is less than or equal to 18 and the 
student is qualified to take a graduate course each semester that can be included in the 
minimum hours required for the graduate degree, he or she will remain classified as 
postbaccalaureate. A department or a student may request postbaccalaureate status even 
though the above criteria are satisfied. 
<P>
At the time a postbaccalaureate student becomes eligible for classification as a graduate
student, he or she must reapply for admission to the Graduate School, and the decision as 
to eventual admission status (full status or provisional) will be made according to criteria 
used by the department and the Graduate School for all other applicants to the particular 
degree program. The postbaccalaureate student is expected to maintain a B average and 
receive no grade lower than a C to qualify for admission to a graduate program. 
<P>
Postbaccalaureate students may enroll in the same number of credits per semester as any
undergraduate student but cannot enroll in graduate courses (600 level or above) or 
receive a graduate assistantship. No degree or certificate shall be awarded to students in 
the postbaccalaureate status, and students who subsequently desire to obtain an additional 
baccalaureate degree must apply through the Office of Transfer Admissions. The 
applicability of credits earned toward the undergraduate degree will be determined by the 
policy pertaining to transfer students. Academic and other fees for postbaccalaureate 
students shall be those applicable to undergraduates with the exception of the application 
fee and admissions deposit. 
<P>
A student possessing an undergraduate or graduate degree who wishes to enroll in
specific undergraduate courses for reasons other than future admission to the Graduate 
School shall not be classified as postbaccalaureate and shall be governed by policies 
established by the Office of Admissions and Registration. 

<a name="Enrollment in Graduate Courses">
<h2><I>Enrollment in Graduate Courses</i></h2></a>

<h3>Clemson University Seniors </h3>

Enrollment in any graduate course is subject to approval by the department offering the 
course and the Graduate School. This approval is required prior to registration and may 
be obtained by completing and returning to the Graduate School office the appropriate 
form (Form GS6, available at the Graduate School office). The total course work load for 
the semester must not exceed 18 hours, and the cumulative graduate credits earned by 
seniors shall not exceed 12 semester hours. 
<P>
Seniors with a cumulative grade point ratio of 3.0 or higher may enroll in 700- and/or
800-level courses and may choose to use these courses to meet requirements for the 
bachelor's degree. However, courses used for this purpose cannot be counted later 
toward an advanced degree. Alternatively, such students may take 600-, 700- or 800-level 
courses in excess of the requirements for their undergraduate degrees and may request 
that these courses be included as a part of their graduate program if they are subsequently 
admitted to the Graduate School at Clemson. Courses cannot be taken at the 600 level if 
their 300- and 400-level counterparts are required for the undergraduate degree in the 
same academic major as the proposed graduate degree. 
<P>
A Clemson senior with a cumulative grade point ratio less than 3.0 may apply to the
Graduate School for conditional acceptance as described on page 25. If accepted, the 
student may enroll in graduate courses for inclusion in a future graduate program, subject 
to approval of Form GS6. The form must be turned in and accepted by the Graduate 
School before a student can preregister or register for graduate courses. 
<P>
In all cases, the credits and quality points associated with senior enrollment in graduate
courses will be part of the undergraduate record. 

<h3>Transient Graduate Students</h3>

A student who has been admitted to a degree program at another institution and who 
wishes to take courses for transfer to that institution may be permitted to enroll as a 
nondegree student in graduate courses on receipt of Form GS8, Transient Graduate 
Student Status, which may be obtained from the Graduate School at Clemson University. 
This form, an abbreviated application to the Graduate School, must be presented two 
weeks prior to registration. A student may earn no more than a total of 12 semester hours 
while in transient status.

<h3>University Employees</h3>

With the approval of the appropriate dean or director, a qualified employee of Clemson 
University may pursue graduate work for credit. However, no member of the faculty or 
staff who has a rank higher than instructor or its equivalent may be considered as a 
candidate for an advanced degree in the academic department where employed. 
<P>
Limitations on the number of hours taken per semester are explained under "Enrollment
Limits" on page 29. 

<h3>Teacher Certification or Recertification </h3>

Initial certification (endorsement) at the graduate level is available only in educational 
administration, reading and personnel services (elementary and secondary counseling). 
Students seeking admission to these programs should hold an appropriate teacher's 
certificate. 
<P>
Those who possess a bachelor's degree or higher and who desire initial certification in a
teaching area must complete the undergraduate courses needed for certification in a 
postgraduate status administered by the Office of Transfer Admissions and may not enroll 
in graduate courses until their eligibility for certification has been established by their 
major department.
<P>
Prospective students should understand that the material in this catalog applies only to
requirements for graduate degrees and has no direct relation to certification or 
recertification for public school teachers. The Graduate School gives no assurance that a 
program for a graduate degree and a program for a certificate, or recertification thereof, 
will coincide. Students interested in professional certificates should, prior to beginning 
any work, confer with the dean of the College of Health, Education and Human 
Development or the appropriate department head in that college. 

<h3>Restrictions</h3>

Enrollment in any graduate course is subject to approval by the department offering the 
course and requires permission of the instructor, whether or not such is specifically stated 
in the course description. To enroll in or receive credit for any courses of the 600 series or 
above, the student (with the exception of certain Clemson University seniors) must have 
been officially admitted by the Graduate School either to a degree program (page 25) or 
as a nondegree student (page 25), or must have been granted conditional acceptance (page 
25). 
<P>
Students may not enroll in 600-level courses for which undergraduate credit has been
awarded, nor can graduate credit be awarded retroactively for undergraduate courses 
already completed.

<HTML><HEAD><title>General Graduate School Regulations</title></head>
<BODY>
<h1>General Graduate School Regulations</h1>
Graduate students are subject to the usual procedures and regulations
of the University, except as these procedures and regulations
apply to undergraduate students only. 
<P>
Immediately upon enrollment, a student should become acquainted
with the degree requirements and the regulations of the Graduate
School published in this catalog. Each advisor and student should
have a current copy of the graduate catalog. 

<a name="Procedures to Follow in Pursuing a Degree">
<h2><I>Procedures to Follow in Pursuing a Degree</i></h2></a>
<P>
The information presented below is not intended as a step-by-step
outline of all procedures to be followed while pursuing a graduate
degree. Rather, it is an explanation of primary factors encountered
during the process.

<h3>The Major Advisor </h3>

A student, with the aid and approval of the department head or
program coordinator, must select a major advisor. This advisor
must be a member of the program faculty offering the degree and
meet the requirements for advisory committee membership described
below. In departments or programs with large faculties, new graduate
students may be assigned to one professor until each student decides
upon a particular interest. This advisor recommends and approves
courses to be taken during the student's first semester.
The course work selected should be of a fundamental or core nature
so the advisory committee will have maximum flexibility to formulate
the remainder of the student's program of study. 
<P>
<h3>The Advisory Committee </h3>
<P>
The advisory committee approves the student's graduate
degree curriculum, supervises the graduate program, administers
the final oral examination, and initiates the recommendation for
the awarding of the degree. Additionally, the advisory committee
may administer qualifying or preliminary and/or final comprehensive
examinations. One member of the committee is designated as chairperson
or major advisor and normally directs the student's dissertation
or thesis, if required. This committee is selected by the student
and approved by the department chair or program coordinator. The
graduate degree curriculum (GS2) and any recommendations made
by the department chair or program coordinator are forwarded to
the dean of the college for approval and then submitted to the
Graduate School.
<P>
A minimum of three faculty members shall be selected for a student
seeking a master's or specialist's degree, and a
minimum of four faculty members shall be selected for a student
seeking a doctoral degree. The majority of the advisory committee,
including the major advisor, must be comprised of Clemson University
faculty from the department offering the particular degree and
who hold full-time positions carrying eligibility for tenure.
If a minor is declared, this area must be represented on the committee.
Committee members of interdepartmental programs shall be appointed
according to bylaws, formulated by the program faculty and endorsed
by the Graduate School, that assure appropriate representation
of the participating departments.
<P>
Part-time and visiting faculty employed by Clemson University
may serve on the committee. Persons not employed by the University
may serve if they have been appointed to an adjunct faculty status.
Part-time, visiting and adjunct faculty may serve as research
advisors and will have full voting status on the outcomes of all
examinations given by the committee. Inclusion of part-time, visiting
and adjunct faculty must not compromise the majority requirements
defined above.
<P>
The student, department and committee members are notified 
of the appointments by means of the approved GS2 form. 
<P>
<h3>Filing of a Graduate Degree Curriculum </h3>
<P>
A graduate degree curriculum (Form GS2) must be filed with the
Graduate School by those students who are in degree programs.
Since fixed curricula normally do not exist for graduate degrees,
this planned program represents the formulation of an individual
student's curriculum as recommended by the advisory committee.
It must adhere to departmental as well as Graduate School policies.
This program constitutes the core of the student's Graduate
Degree Curriculum (Form GS2) and appears on the form at the location
entitled REQUIRED COURSES (GRADUATE LEVEL ONLY). Undergraduate
deficiencies are listed at the designated location. Supplemental
courses, carrying undergraduate or graduate credit and chosen
to broaden the student's academic experience, are not required
on Form GS2. However, if a listing is desirable, such courses
will be listed as departmental requirements at the designated
location. Graduate credit is received only for courses numbered
600 or above; no student shall receive both undergraduate and
graduate credit for the same course. The Graduate School discourages
inclusion of 600-level courses in the minimum hours required for
graduate degrees if these courses are clearly equivalents of undergraduate
courses required for an undergraduate degree in the same major
at Clemson University. Transfer credit appearing in the curriculum
must adhere to the stipulation described under "Acceptance
of Transfer Credit" on page 29. 
<P>
Before a curriculum is approved, it must be reviewed and signed
by the advisory committee. It is then submitted to the department
chair(s) and college dean(s) for approval and is forwarded to
the Graduate School for approval and appropriate distribution
of copies.
<P>
If it becomes necessary to change the graduate degree curriculum,
a revised Form GS2 must be filed. This new form requires all necessary
signatures.
<P>
Candidates for master's or specialist's degrees
should submit the curriculum by the middle of their second semester,*
and doctoral candidates no later than the beginning of their second
year* of study. A $25** late fee is assessed a student whose GS2
is submitted after the deadline dates, and increases at the rate
of $5** per day thereafter (excluding Saturday, Sunday or University
holidays).
<P>
<h3>Admission to Candidacy for a Degree </h3>
<P>
Admission to the Graduate School does not qualify a student as
a candidate for an advanced degree. Such candidacy depends upon
the acceptance by the graduate dean of a written request for admission
to candidacy. This request (Form GS4) may be filed by the student
as follows: for the master's degree, after completion of
15 hours of course work; for the Ph.D. degree, after completion
of a major share of course work and successful completion of the
comprehensive examination (page 37). 
<P>
All students desiring admission to candidacy must have received
full status admission to the Graduate School, have a satisfactory
academic standing, and have on file an approved graduate degree
curriculum (Form GS2). 
<P>
<h3>Application for a Diploma </h3>
<P>
A formal application for a diploma is placed by the student simultaneously
when he or she applies for admission to candidacy (Form GS4).
This order is submitted to the Graduate School and must be resubmitted
should the student not graduate on the anticipated date. A $25**
late fee is assessed a student whose 
<P>
Form GS4 is submitted after the deadline dates, and increases
at the rate of $5** per day thereafter (excluding Saturday, Sunday
or University holidays).
<P>
<h3>Awarding of Graduate Degrees Posthumously</h3>
<P>
A graduate student with a grade point ratio of 3.0 or above and
plan of study (Form GS2) on file, who has applied for graduation
at the end of the semester or summer session and dies during that
period or the subsequent semester or summer session, may be awarded
the graduate degree posthumously provided the faculty 
of the college so recommends.
<hr>
<table>
<td>*<td>An academic semester is defined as a minimum of nine credit hours
of course work not graded pass/fair. An academic year is defined as the
total of two academic semesters.<tr>
<td>**<td>Subject to change<tr>
</table>
<P>
<a name="Academic Regulations">
<h2><I>Academic Regulations</i></h2></a>
<P>
<h3>Permanent Academic Records </h3>
<P>
The student's permanent academic record is a historical
record of the student's academic progress. It is maintained
in the Registrar's Office and contains personal identifying
information, grades and credits. Where appropriate, statements
of a corrective nature, withdrawals, suspension for failure to
meet academic standards, suspension for disciplinary reasons and
graduation data are added. 
<P>
<h3>Academic Standards (Grading) </h3>
<P>
Most graduate courses are graded on an A-B-C-F scale. Thesis and
dissertation research and several other graduate courses are graded
on a pass/fail basis. These courses are not included in the academic
average; however, the grade is placed on the student's
permanent record. Only credit hours for which a grade of pass
is achieved apply toward the number of credit hours required for
the degree. The accumulation of grades of pass in thesis or dissertation
research does not imply completion of the research, but indicates
satisfactory progress only. 
<P>
A minimum grade of C must be made on all course work to obtain
graduate credit. The graduate student must maintain a cumulative
B average in all graduate-level courses (600 level or above) and
in undergraduate courses, excluding those taken on a pass/fail
basis. See "Enrollment on a Pass/Fail Basis," page
29. Students who fail to meet these requirements become ineligible
for graduation and are placed on academic probation. The probationary
status will remain in effect until nine additional semester hours
of graduate credit have been attempted. Students who fail to remove
the probationary status as prescribed are subject to academic
dismissal and will not be permitted to continue in the Graduate
School without the recommendation of the program coordinator and
written approval of the Graduate School. Withdrawal from a course
while on probation will not be allowed unless prior approval is
obtained from the Graduate School. Any unauthorized withdrawal
will be considered as an unsatisfactory academic performance.
<P>
The cumulative B average requirements described above apply independently
to graduate degrees sought at Clemson University; that is, the
grade point ratio computation begins anew after the student has
completed the first degree. However, when a doctoral degree is
pursued after completion of a master's degree in the same
major, the grade point ratio computation continues for both degrees.
<P>
A grade lower than the specified minimum can be raised to count
toward an advanced degree only by repetition of the course. Reexamination
is not permitted. 
<P>
A graduate student must understand that he or she can be dropped
from the Graduate School at any time for failure to maintain an
adequate academic status. 
<P>
<h3>Final Examinations in Graduate Courses </h3>
<P>
Graduate course work specifications vary widely between disciplines.
Evaluation of graduate work is based upon a number of observations,
presentations, tests, papers and/or other measures. The final
evaluation includes an examination at the conclusion of the course,
which in most cases will be written, but may take on other forms.

<P>
<h3>Incomplete Graduate Course Work </h3>
<P>
Except for courses graded on a pass/fail basis, the grade of incomplete
(I) may be given for incomplete work for any graduate course in
which work remains unfinished and the student is unable to fulfill
all requirements because of circumstances beyond his or her control.
This grade is not given in lieu of unsatisfactory or failing grades
received for completed courses for the purpose of improving the
grade later. 
<P>
It is the student's responsibility to contact the instructor
regarding the work required to complete the course. Upon request
by the student, the instructor shall provide a written statement
of the work to be completed. 
<P>
The grade of I will be valid in normal lecture or laboratory courses
for only 30 days after the beginning of the next scheduled session,
excluding summers and irrespective of the student's enrollment
status. Within this period, the student must complete his or her
work or obtain an extension, approved by the instructor and head
of the department responsible for the course, stating the reason
for the request and the length of time needed. Normally, only
one request for an extension for each grade of I will be granted.
<P>
Students receiving a grade of I in courses such as special problems
or other unstructured, independent study courses as designated
by the Graduate School must complete all work and receive a final
grade within one calendar year. At the discretion of the instructor,
the deadline for removal of these incomplete grades may be less
than one year. Under rare circumstances, an extension may be granted.
<P>
A graduate student will not be permitted to repeat any portion
or reregister for any course for which the grade of I has been
given, or register in any other course (except GS 799) for the
purpose of removing the grade of I. Should any work remain incomplete
at the expiration of the appropriate deadlines described in the
previous paragraphs, a grade of F will be recorded on the student's
permanent record. Although the Graduate School will attempt to
bring the deadlines to the attention of the student and instructor,
it is the sole responsibility of the graduate student to comply
with these regulations. 
<P>
Students who receive a grade of I while enrolled in the Graduate
School at Clemson University remain ineligible for graduation
until the incomplete work has been made up and a letter grade
submitted to the Office of Admissions and Registration.
<P>
Grades of I will have a 10-working-day period after the deadline
for the instructor to grade the work and submit the make-up grade
card to the Registrar's Office. Work submitted by the student
after the printed deadline should not be accepted by the instructor
unless an extension has been approved. Requests for extensions,
like the make-up work, should be submitted by the deadline printed
on the make-up card.
<P>
Grades of I that remain after the 10-working-day period will be
converted automatically to an F. Changes after that time will
be difficult and will require a change of grade form that explains
why the grade should be changed. Faculty do not have a right to
change a grade under these circumstances. Failure to report final
grades for work completed on time or to report an extension constitutes
a failure by the faculty to fulfill their obligations to the University.
<P>
<h3>Withdrawal from Courses </h3>
<P>
Withdrawal from graduate course work beyond the first few weeks
of class is strongly discouraged, particularly from those courses
listed on a student's Form GS2. Withdrawals after the first
few weeks of class should only be made for unusual academic reasons
or for pressing medical or personal reasons. Students who officially
withdraw within the first four weeks of classes will have no grades
recorded, while those who officially withdraw after the first
four weeks and prior to the last five weeks will have a grade
of W (withdrew) entered on the official records. Students may
not withdraw within the last five weeks of classes. 
<P>
Permission to withdraw should be obtained from the faculty advisor
on the Schedule Change Form available from the Office of Student
Records. If the advisor does not grant permission to withdraw,
the student may appeal to the department head. A refusal by the
department head may be appealed to the dean of the Graduate School.
The date on which the approval form is filed with the registrar
is the official date of withdrawal. 
<P>
The withdrawal dates described above apply to the regular semesters
only. Reference should be made to page 2 for the appropriate dates
for the summer sessions. 
<P>
Failure to attend classes or verbal notification to instructors
does not constitute withdrawal. Students who drop out of a course
without officially withdrawing as previously described will be
credited with a failure. 
<P>
<h3>Continuous Enrollment </h3>
<P>
Although continuous enrollment is not a formal requirement for
an advanced degree, graduate students are expected to pursue their
degrees with a minimum of interruption. Students who do not remain
continuously enrolled (summers excluded) are subject to the requirements
in effect at the time of return. 
<P>
Only students who are enrolled are eligible to use University
facilities and human resources and/or receive any form of financial
aid. Students who have completed all required work and who find
it necessary to be enrolled during a given semester so as to use
facilities or human resources may enroll in GS 799 for a minimum
of one credit.
<P>
<h3>Enrollment Limits </h3>
<P>
Upper limits on graduate student enrollment per semester refer
to graduate and undergraduate credits combined and should be attempted
only by the most qualified students.
<P>

</table>
<P>
Quarter-time, half-time and three-quarter-time graduate assistants
are defined as those who contribute an average of 10, 20 and 30
clock hours per week, respectively, of service to the University
for the entire semester. A person employed full time is defined
as anyone employed five full working days per week regardless
of the employer(s). A graduate student who becomes employed full
time while the assistantship is in force must notify the Graduate
School and the department providing the assistantship. Graduate
students paid solely on an hourly basis are not classified as
graduate assistants but are subject to the same limitation in
credit loads previously described. 
<P>
For students whose hours of service per week fall between those
defining each student category, the maximum credit load during
a regular semester is found by linear interpolation. Any exceptions
to the maximum credit loads must be requested by the department
and approved in advance by the Graduate School.
<P>
<h3>Enrollment on a Pass/Fail Basis</h3>
<P>
The only graduate courses that may be taken on a pass/fail basis
are thesis and dissertation research and a small number of unstructured
courses in which the pass/fail grading system appears directly
in the course description. 
<P>
Graduate students shall not enroll on a pass/fail basis or audit
any course required by the department or program as an undergraduate
deficiency. All other undergraduate courses may be taken on a
pass/fail basis. This decision must be made by the last day to
add a class and is implemented by the student's major advisor
or department head forwarding a request to the Graduate School.
<P>
<h3>Auditing by Graduate Students </h3>
<P>
Permission for a student to audit a particular graduate course
is at the discretion of the head of the department or the coordinator
of the program offering the course. The principal factors involved
in granting permission are that the auditor must possess the necessary
academic background and space must be available.
<P>
Audited courses do not carry credit, and the fact that a course
has been audited is not noted on the graduate student's
official record. Graduate auditors are not required to stand tests
or examinations. However, the instructor, at his or her own discretion,
may demand or deny the auditor's participation in class
to whatever extent deemed desirable. 
<P>
A graduate student may not satisfy by audit a stated prerequisite
for a graduate course. Additionally, a graduate student may not
establish credit through examination in any course for which he
or she was previously registered as an auditor. 
<P>
<h3>Acceptance of Transfer Credit </h3>
<P>
A maximum of 12 semester credit hours of work may be transferred
from an accredited institution** for the purpose of meeting the
requirements for a master's degree. Credits earned in a
nondegree status at Clemson University are considered transfer
credits because they were earned prior to admission to a degree
program. For the doctoral degree, as many as 48 semester credit
hours of work may be transferred. 
<P>
In all cases, the use of transfer credits must be recommended
by the student's advisory committee and approved by the
department. Under no circumstances will transfer credit be awarded
for research, internship or courses graded P/F, or for courses
in which a grade lower than B, or its equivalent, has been received.
Quality points for courses taken at institutions other than Clemson
University will not be included in the student's academic
average. 
<P>
Credits may be transferred for work completed at off-campus centers
of accredited institutions provided such courses are acceptable,
without reservation, in degree programs at those institutions.
No credit will be given for continuing education units, correspondence,
extension or in-service courses, or for concentrated courses and
workshops that award credits at a rate exceeding one credit per
week. 
<P>
All transfer credits must be verified by an official transcript
from the institution at which the work was completed. Course work
completed outside the six-year time limit may not be transferred
to Clemson University or validated for graduate credit (see "Time
Limit" on page 25 for clarification). Valid transfer credits
will appear on the student's transcript as credits earned.
<P>
It is the student's responsibility to request a transcript
of transfer credits to be sent directly to the Graduate School.
The degree will not be conferred at the close of the term during
which the student has been registered elsewhere for the purpose
of transferring credits. 
<P>
<h3>Independence of Graduate Degrees </h3>
<P>
The requirements for a graduate degree at Clemson University cannot
be met with credits used to satisfy the requirements of another
graduate degree earned at Clemson University or elsewhere. Thus,
the degrees are independent, implying that the formal curriculum
for the degree at Clemson University can contain no credits used
for an earlier graduate degree.
<P>
<h3>Appeals and Grievances </h3>
<P>
The Commission on Graduate Studies hears appeals regarding admission,
degree requirements or other policy decisions affecting the welfare
of graduate students. The appeal must be presented in writing
to the dean of the Graduate School or to members of the commission.
<P>
The committee is comprised of five members as follows: (a) two
members of the faculty appointed for two-year staggered terms
by the respective college dean in collegiate rotation; (b) two
graduate students, representing two colleges other than those
represented by the faculty, nominated and approved by the Graduate
Student Association and appointed by the provost for one-year
terms; and (c) the dean or associate dean of the Graduate School
(or the dean's designee). The chairperson is the faculty
member in the senior year of service on the committee. 
<P>
The Graduate Student Grievance Committee hears all grievances
involving the following: (a) grievances of a personal or professional
nature involving an individual student and a faculty member; (b)
the claim by a student that the final grade in a course was inequitably
awarded; (c) cases where the grievance involves graduate student
employment; and (d) graduate student academic dishonesty. In all
unresolved cases the committee makes its recommendations to the
president through the provost. All proceedings of the committee
are confidential. 
<P>
In cases involving academic dishonesty, the Policy on Academic
Dishonesty below shall be applied, and the grievance shall be
filed within seven days from the date a written charge is made
by the professor. A copy of the charge is to be given to the department
head or dean. In cases involving a protest of a final grade, the
grievance must be filed within 120 calendar days from the date
printed on the grade report for the term in which the student
alleged an inequitable grade was recorded.
<P>
Rules and procedures for the filing and hearing of grievances
are as follows:
<P>
1. Any complaint should first be taken to the faculty or staff
member involved for resolution. If no resolution is reached, the
graduate student should consult with the department head and the
dean or the immediate superior of the staff member to hear the
grievance and act as a referee. The student, dean of the college,
department, and faculty or staff member should make every effort
to reach a solution. 
<P>
 2. If the grievance remains unresolved, the student may bring
it before the Graduate Student Grievance Committee by a written
statement detailing the grievance. All issues to be grieved must
be delineated in the written statement. The statement must be
delivered in a sealed envelope to the Office of the Dean of the
Graduate School within 60 calendar days of the date the graduate
student alleges to have been aggrieved, except in cases involving
a protest of a final grade when the statement must be filed within
120 calendar days from the date on the grade report. The dean
of the Graduate School (or the dean's designee) shall attempt
to resolve the grievance. If no resolution is reached, then the
dean of the Graduate School (or the dean's designee) shall
advise the graduate student in assembling the necessary information
for presenting his or her complaint to the Graduate Student Grievance
Committee. The dean will forward this letter to the chairperson
of the Graduate Student Grievance Committee. Failure of the student
to file a grievance within the 60-day time period will result
in forfeiture of the right to file a grievance under this procedure.

<P>
 3. The committee will attempt to gather all pertinent information
in separate meetings with all individuals able to give information
concerning the grievance. 
<P>
 4. The Graduate Student Grievance Committee will, if at all possible,
handle each case as a confidential matter. 
<P>
 5. The committee will formulate its findings in writing and seek
to obtain signed approval for the recommended solution from all
parties involved. 
<P>
 6. If the committee cannot obtain a solution that is acceptable
to all involved parties, the committee will provide an opportunity
for a hearing on the grievance. Two weeks' notice will
be provided to all parties in the grievance. Either party to the
grievance may petition for a hearing on the grievance. 
<P>
 7. The hearing on the grievance will be informal and closed to
the public. The chairperson of the committee shall take whatever
action is necessary to ensure an equitable, orderly and expeditious
hearing. Minutes of the meeting will be taken, and all parties
to the grievance will be given an opportunity to be heard. Each
party is responsible for having present at the hearing all witnesses
who will speak on his or her behalf. In addition, the chairperson
may request the presence at the hearing of any other person who
has pertinent information on the grievance. 
<P>
Witnesses shall not be present during the hearing proceedings
except when called upon to speak before the committee. The parties
will be permitted to question all individuals present at the hearing
and heard by the committee. If any witness is unable to be present
at the hearing, the chairperson may, at his or her discretion,
accept a written statement from that witness to be presented at
the hearing. The parties shall be accorded the right to assistance
of counsel of their own choice; however, the role of counsel shall
be solely to assist the party, and counsel shall not be permitted
to participate actively in the proceedings. 
<P>
 8. Upon conclusion of the hearing, the committee, meeting in
executive session, shall reach, by a majority vote of those committee
members present, a solution to the grievance. If the chairperson
can persuade all parties to the grievance to accept the committee's
solution, the matter of the grievance will be considered closed
when the solution is effected. 
<P>
 9. If, after the conclusion of the hearing, the chairperson cannot
obtain approval of the committee's recommended solution
from all involved parties, the grievance will be referred to the
president of the University via the provost, with the committee's
solution as the recommended solution to the grievance. When grievances
are referred in this manner, the president shall make the final
decision on behalf of the University. 
<P>
10. The Graduate School shall keep in confidence all records pertinent
to each grievance and pass these records to the Office of the
Provost for filing. Records shall be available to succeeding chairpersons
of the Graduate Student Grievance Committee. 
<P>
11. A majority of committee members shall constitute a quorum
for transaction of committee business; at least one appointed
faculty member and one appointed graduate student must be present.
 
<P>
12. The Graduate Student Grievance Committee shall meet as often
as necessary to dispense expeditiously with grievances brought
before the committee. 
<P>
13. These rules and procedures can be amended by the Commission
on Graduate Studies. Such rule changes will not affect any case
under consideration at the time of the change. Notification of
any amendments to these rules and procedures should be given to
the president of the University via the Academic Council.

<P>
<h3>Grade Protests</h3>
<P>
A student wishing to protest a course grade must first attempt
to resolve any disagreement with the instructor. In failing to
reach a satisfactory resolution, the student may follow the procedure
under "Appeals and Grievances" (page 29). All grade
changes and grievances must be filed within 120 calendar days
from the date on the grade report.
<P>
<h3>Policy on Sexual Harassment</h3>
<P>
Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, provides
that it shall be unlawful discriminatory practice for any employer,
because of the sex of any person, to discharge without just cause,
to refuse to hire, or otherwise discriminate against any person
with respect to any matter directly or indirectly related to employment.
Harassment of any employee on the basis of sex violates this federal
law. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has issued guidelines
as to what constitutes sexual harassment of an employee under
Title VII.
<P>
Unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other
verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature constitute sexual
harassment when the following occurs:
<P>
1. submission to such conduct is made explicitly or implicitly
a term or condition of an individual's employment or academic
standing; or
<P>
2. submission to or rejection of such conduct by an individual
is used as a basis for employment or for arriving at academic
decisions affecting an individual; or
<P>
3. such conduct unreasonably interferes with an individual's
work or academic performance, or creates an intimidating, hostile,
or offensive working or academic environment.
<P>
Sexual harassment of University faculty, staff or students is
prohibited and shall subject the offender to dismissal or other
sanctions after compliance with procedural due process requirements.
In the event a claim of sexual harassment arises, the claimant
may use University grievance procedures that have been established
for faculty, staff and students as appropriate. This policy also
prohibits an employee from sexually harassing a superior and a
student from sexually harassing a faculty member. Employees or
students who feel they are victims of this form of discrimination
are encouraged to consult the Office of Access and Equity, E-103
Martin Hall, 656-3181, for advice and assistance in resolving
complaints.

<h3>Policy on Research Ethics </h3>
<P>
I. Preamble
<P>
Research institutions have a critical responsibility to provide
an environment that promotes integrity, while at the same time
encouraging openness and creativity among scholars. Care must
be taken to ensure that honest error and ambiguities of interpretation
of scholarly activities are distinguishable from outright misconduct.
To address all allegations of fraud or misconduct, definitions,
policies and procedures must be in place to facilitate and guide
such processes. 
<P>
II. Definitions
<P>
A.  Research
<br>
 Research is used in a general sense (as opposed to scientific
research) to yield a policy applicable to all academic disciplines
in the University. 
<P>
B.  Misconduct
<br>
Dishonest deviation from accepted practices in conducting research
activities. 
<P>
  Fraudulent failure to comply with university, regulatory and
funding agencies requirements affecting specific aspects of the
conduct of research. 
<P>
 This definition includes: 
<P>
 Falsification of data - ranging from falsification or
intentional misrepresentation of methods, materials or results
to selective reporting of findings, such as the purposeful omission
of conflicting data with the intent to manipulate the results;

<P>
 Plagiarism - representation of borrowed work as one's
own; 
<P>
 Misappropriation of others' ideas - the unauthorized
and intentionally dishonest use of privileged information (such
as that which might be gained during peer, paper or grant reviews),
however obtained;
<P>
 Malicious and public misrepresentation of a colleague's
ethical research behavior;
<P>
 Conflicts of interest that could influence the researcher's
decisions or conclusions, or which could provide unfair gain to
the researcher;
<P>
 Other misuse of position as researcher for personal gain;
<P>
 Exploitation (such as failure to credit work, misrepresentation
of a research relationship, etc.) of students, or other persons,
for research purposes. 
<P>
 This definition does not include:
<P>
 Non-fraudulent failure or inadequacy of performance, incompetence
or honest error; 
<P>
 Non-fraudulent breaches of contracts; 
<P>
 Employment discrimination, sexual harassment, violation of human
subjects policy or animal welfare policy, or other forms of misconduct
that are the concerns of different, distinctive administrative
policies. 
<P>
C.  Inquiry
<br>
 Expeditious gathering and review of information to determine
if an investigation is warranted. 
<P>
 This is not a formal hearing, but a process designed to separate
frivolous, unjustified or mistaken allegation from facts regarding
the incident. 
<P>
D.  Investigation 
<br>
 A formal examination and evaluation of all relevant facts to
determine if an instance of misconduct has occurred. 
<P>
E.  Disposition
<br>
 The Committee of Investigation shall only determine whether a
breach of ethics has occurred and will not make recommendations
relative to the nature or severity of the action to be taken.

<P>
 If the investigation committee finds that the complaint was intentionally
dishonest and malicious, the committee can recommend action against
the accuser. 
<P>
 In the event that allegations are not confirmed, the institution
shall make full efforts to restore the reputation of the accused;
the accused's recommendations to accomplish this should
be accommodated insofar as is possible. 
<P>
III. Procedure 
<P>
A.  Overall Structure 
<br>
 An allegation or complaint involving the possibility of misconduct
can be raised by anyone. The allegation should be made in writing
to the Faculty Senate president in a confidential manner. Accusations
must be signed. 
<P>
 Charges must be filed within seven years of the date on which
the event in question occurred. If the date of limitation is in
question, the Faculty Senate president, the chair of the Faculty
Senate Research Committee and the vice president for research
shall determine whether the given event occurred within the specified
time limit. 
<P>
 The Faculty Senate president and the chair of the Faculty Senate
Research Committee should accept the accusation only after they
are satisfied that its substance complies with this policy's
definition of "misconduct." At this time, and at
their discretion, they may consult with the vice president for
research relative to the alleged research ethics violation. 
<P>
 A meeting should be scheduled to occur within 20 calendar days
following acceptance of the accusation for the accused to appear
before the president of the Faculty Senate and the chair of the
Faculty Senate Research Committee for the purpose of hearing the
charge(s) and being informed of who authored the charges. The
accused will be asked to plead "guilty" or "not
guilty" to each charge. If the accused pleads "guilty,"
the president of the Faculty Senate will report the facts to the
vice president for research, who will, within 90 calendar days,
prepare a report for the provost. 
<P>
 If the accused pleads "not guilty," or if the accused
refuses to respond, an inquiry, the first step of the review process,
should result. The vice president for research should be notified
of the inquiry. In the inquiry state, factual information is gathered
and expeditiously reviewed to determine if an investigation of
the charge is warranted. An inquiry is not a formal hearing; it
is designed to separate allegations deserving of further investigation
from frivolous, unjustified or clearly mistaken allegation. 
<P>
 The vice president for research will inform the accuser of the
disposition at the conclusion of the investigation stage. 
<P>
 During the initial meeting with the accused for the purpose of
presenting charges, only the Faculty Senate president, the chair
of the Faculty Senate Research Committee and the accused with
his/her lawyer, if desired, may be present. During hearings by
the Committee of Inquiry or the Committee of Investigation, only
duly appointed members of the given committee and the committee's
invited witnesses with his/her lawyer, if desired, may be present.

<P>
B.  Inquiry 
<br>
 The vice president for research and the Faculty Senate president
will appoint, within 10 calendar days of a response of "not
guilty" to charges by the accused, a Committee of Inquiry
of three faculty members with one individual appointed as chair.

<P>
 For any specific allegation or set of allegations, the Committee
of Inquiry will determine if an investigation is warranted. The
Committee of Inquiry will submit a written report to the vice
president for research and the Faculty Senate president within
30 calendar days of the formation of the Committee of Inquiry.

<P>
C.  Investigation 
<br>
 If the Committee of Inquiry so recommends, the vice president
for research and the Faculty Senate president will appoint within
20 calendar days a Committee of Investigation consisting of five
faculty members, other than those serving on the Committee of
Inquiry, to conduct a full investigation. 
<P>
 The Committee of Investigation, meeting in closed sessions, will
review all materials, question relevant parties, and allow for
all parties to present their views separately (without the presence
of the other parties) to the committee. 
<P>
 The Committee of Investigation will prepare, within 90 calendar
days, a report indicating whether ethics violations have occurred;
the report may include estimation of one or more of the following:
<blockquote>
 the scope of the intentional dishonesty perpetrated by the accused;

<P>
 the degree of gain that might accrue to the accused because of
the unethical behavior; 
<P>
 the seriousness of harm intentionally perpetrated against other
individuals. 
</blockquote>
 The estimation shall be used in determining disciplinary action
against the accused. In less serious cases, action may include
a verbal reprimand, or, if conditions warrant, a letter in the
offender's personal file. In more serious cases, action
might include such sanctions as additional supervision of research
activity, loss of merit pay or recommendation against promotion.
In only the most serious cases should dismissal be considered.

<P>
 The report will be submitted to the vice president for research
and the Faculty Senate president, who will forward the report
to the provost. 
<P>
 The provost will review the report and render a decision within
15 calendar days. Any recommendation that may constitute disciplinary
action against a faculty member will be referred by the provost
to the appropriate dean or other administrator as determined by
the provost. The dean or administrator will decide the appropriate
action within 15 calendar days. 
<P>
 If disciplinary action taken against a faculty member constitutes
a grievable action under either Faculty Grievance Procedure I
or Faculty Grievance Procedure II, the faculty member may file
a grievance in accordance with the appropriate procedure. Disciplinary
action against other individuals associated with the University
are subject to applicable grievance procedures. 
<P>
D.  Guiding Principles 
<br>
 Maximize confidentiality and protect the reputations for both
the accused and accuser during the full process. 
<P>
 Assure the respondent a fair hearing and access to reports. 
<P>
 Minimize the number of individuals involved in the inquiry and
investigation phases. 
<P>
 Individuals chosen to assist in the inquiry process should have
no real or apparent conflicts of interest bearing on the case
in question. They should be unbiased and have appropriate background
for judging the issues being raised. 
<P>
 Consultation of University legal counsel is probably necessary.

<P>
 Appropriate funding agencies should be fully informed in writing
at both the outset and conclusion of an investigation. 
<P>
 All detailed documentation of the committees of Inquiry and Investigation
shall be maintained by the Office of the Vice President for Research
for at least three (3) years and must, upon request, be provided
to authorized personnel. 
<P>
 Appropriate interim administrative actions will be taken by the
vice president for research at the outset of the inquiry stage
to protect supporting funds and to ensure that the purposes of
the project are being met. 
<P>
<h3>Executive Interpretation </h3>
<P>
Definitions
<P>
II. B. The Research Ethics Policy clearly restricts action to
matters of research ethics; it does not address such things as
simple ineptitude, non-fraudulent breach of contract or malpractice
covered by existing policy (see exclusions under section II).
Note the following: 
<blockquote>
 The definition includes malicious and public (suggesting that
neither maliciousness nor publicness, alone, is sufficient) misuse
of the research ethics policy itself (reference section II. E.).

<P>
 Exploitation of others includes misuse of colleagues, such as
intentional and malicious failure to credit the work of another,
deliberately misleading other individuals to obtain research goals,
etc. It does not include benign activity that seems to, or may
actually, exploit. 
<P>
 This policy should not be construed to include any activity that
is benign in intent (not malicious, deliberately misleading, etc.).

</blockquote>
II. E. It is the responsibility of University faculty to protect
its research integrity by condemning unethical research activity,
by investigating credible charges of unethical research brought
against the faculty's peers, by taking steps to restore
the reputations of peers that are charged unjustly or in error,
by assessing the damage done by an unethical peer if appropriate
(see section III. C.), and by seeking sanction through University
administrative authorities against those who violate ethical research
practices. Appropriate administrative personnel alone have the
authority to deprive one of property or liberty interests (within
legal constraints). Consequently we feel that the assessment and
pursuit of sanctions against an individual should not be a matter
addressed by this policy. 
<P>
III. A. Charges which do not fall within the purview of this policy
(see section II. B.) should not be forwarded to a Committee of
Inquiry. The processes of Inquiry and Investigation threaten an
academician's most cherished professional possession -
his or her reputation. That reputation should not be threatened
without clear cause, thus charges that do not involve "Research
Ethics" as defined by this document should be pursued through
other channels. For these reasons, the president of the Faculty
Senate and the chair of the Faculty Senate Research Committee,
upon receipt of the charges, should confirm that the charges comply
in substance with this policy's definitions before any
action is initiated. This is not to say that the president of
the Faculty Senate and the chair of the Faculty Senate Research
Committee should judge the legitimacy of the charges or the facts
of the case. 
<P>
Because the vice president for research has an overall view of
University policy and activities that may be valuable at this
stage of the process, the president of the Faculty Senate and
the chair of the Faculty Senate Research Committee, at their discretion,
may consult with the vice president for research prior to rendering
a decision about whether the charges should go forward under this
policy. 
<P>
It is in the interest of the accused and the University to provide
an opportunity to the accused to abbreviate the procedures outlined
in this policy. Specifically, the accused need not be subjected
to the trauma of a peer investigation if indeed he or she would
prefer to admit guilt and be subjected to appropriate administrative
sanction. 
<P>
III. B. A Committee of Inquiry is responsible for determining
whether the facts in the case are contentious (sufficient uncertainty
exists to prevent a determination of innocence without extensive
investigation), or that there is a probability that the accused's
position is or is not credible. 
<P>
A driving concern of the Committee of Inquiry is the protection
of all involved and particularly that of the accused. Toward this
end, a Committee of Inquiry should balance the need for information
upon which to make a decision against the need for confidentiality,
with the balance in favor of confidentiality. The merit of charges
cannot always be made on the strength of charges alone, thus,
to adequately protect the accused against a potentially damaging
investigation, the committee may need to expand its inquiry beyond
the charges and accompanying documentation. At the same time,
it must be realized that the likelihood of trauma and damage to
reputation increases as the scope of an inquiry grows. The pertinent
question is, how far should a Committee of Inquiry go to protect
an unjustly charged individual against a more extensive investigation
given the need to limit the scope of knowledge about the charges?
The answer is that the Committee of Inquiry should limit its efforts
to the minimum needed to establish that the facts in the case
are contentious, or that there is a probability that the accused's
position is or is not credible. Certainly the accused should have
the opportunity to respond to the charges before the Committee
of Inquiry. The Committee of Inquiry may need to seek clarification
from the accuser and may even need to resolve doubts by seeking
evidence from another source. At all times, however, the Committee
of Inquiry should seek to confine the extent of knowledge about
the charges leveled, and consequently should cease its inquiry
as soon as it can conclude that the charges may or may not be
grounded (not that the charges are or are not true). Strategies
may include strictly limiting the number of individuals approached
about the matter, limiting witnesses to individuals who have prior
knowledge of the charges, or soliciting documentation from involved
parties. 
<P>
In addition to determining probability of ethics violation, the
Committee of Inquiry should clarify the charges brought against
the accused. This involves throwing out charges that are frivolous
or ungrounded, and identifying those charges that may be grounded.
A subsequent Committee of Investigation, because its investigation
is more thorough, need not, of necessity, be bound to the scope
defined by the Committee of Inquiry, but should give credence
to its recommendations. 
<P>
III. C. The Committee of Investigation is responsible for determining
whether an ethics violation has occurred relative to the situation
addressed by the charges. Such violation need not be limited to
the specific charges, but should be related to the incidents addressed
by those charges. The person who brings charges may be aware of
only some of the ethical violations associated with a given incident,
thus an investigation needs the freedom to note problems relative
to that incident which it may uncover during the course of investigating
the charges. 
<P>
The Committee of Investigation, like its predecessor, is concerned
with protecting the integrity of the parties involved. Consequently,
it too should balance the need for information upon which to make
a decision against the need for confidentiality. In this case,
however, the balance should favor the gathering of information.
It is important that this committee be correct in its decision
than it is to limit the scope of knowledge about the investigation.
The committee should, of course, cease operation when it has enough
information to make a just decision, but should not jeopardize
justice in the name of confidentiality. 
<P>
<H3>Theses and Dissertations</h3>
<P>
Candidates for advanced degrees receive academic credit for conducting
research and preparing a thesis (master's candidates) or
a dissertation (doctoral candidates) under the direction of the
research advisor. In those Master of Arts or Master of Science
degree curricula requiring a thesis, six credits of research (891)
are required. The thesis option curricula in the Master of Architecture,
Master of City and Regional Planning, and Master of Fine Arts
degree programs require 15, 6-9 and 15 credits of research, respectively.
A dissertation, mandatory for all candidates for the Ph.D. or
Ed.D. degrees, requires 18 credits of doctoral research (991)
exclusive of any research credits earned at the master's
level. 
<P>
The accumulation of grades of pass in thesis or dissertation research
does not imply completion of the research, but only indicates
satisfactory progress. 
<P>
1. <I>Student Responsibility</i>. The student, in consultation with his
or her major advisor, shall provide each remaining advisory committee
member with a copy of the manuscript for initial review. This
action should take place well in advance of, and not less than
three weeks prior to, the final examination and defense of the
thesis or dissertation. Students must prepare the manuscript in
a style acceptable to the Graduate School; a Guide for the Preparation
of Theses and Dissertations may be obtained from the Union Copy
Center at a cost of $4.25(subject to change) per copy. When the manuscript is in
suitable form, the thesis or dissertation is presented to the
Graduate School for review and approval prior to duplication.

<P>
Three copies of the thesis or dissertation, required for hard
binding, must be submitted to the Graduate School by the deadline
date appropriate for the anticipated graduation date. A binding
fee of $24(subject to change) must be paid to the bursar and the completed forms
returned to the Graduate School at the time the duplicated theses
or dissertations are submitted. If the student desires, two personal
copies may be bound at a cost of $8(subject to change) per copy; additional copies
may be bound at a cost of $10(subject to change) per copy.
<P>
For doctoral candidates, a fourth copy of the dissertation is
required for microfilming and is placed by the Graduate School
with University Microfilms, Inc. of Ann Arbor, Michigan. An additional
copy of the approval page, title page and abstract must also be
submitted, with the abstract not exceeding 350 words. Occasionally,
this will necessitate revision of the longer original abstract,
which is retained in all copies. The abstract should be written
and edited in a form suitable for publication and data base retrieval.
The total microfilming fee is $50(subject to change) and must be paid to the bursar
simultaneously with the binding fees. A fee of $35(subject to change) is necessary
if copyright is desired. 
<P>
2. <I>Faculty Responsibility</i>. The research advisor determines when
the manuscript is suitable for initial review by the remaining
committee members. Guidelines for the review process and a thesis/dissertation
review form are available in the departments and the Graduate
School. These guidelines are designed to produce a timely review
by each committee member and to provide a measure of protection
for all affected parties against problems resulting from lack
of communication and/or attention. If the student requests, the
research advisor is obligated to initiate the thesis/dissertation
review form and forward it to the remaining committee members
along with the manuscript. The research advisor must be cognizant
also of departmental practices regarding the quality of the manuscript
at the various review stages and of the wishes of the department
head, as an ex-officio committee member, to exercise the option
of approving the thesis or dissertation in its final form. 
<P>
Committee members should normally complete the initial review
in three weeks or less. Provisions of the guidelines; however,
allow for additional time if necessary. Failure of a committee
member to complete the initial review within six weeks may result
in his or her replacement, provided the student has requested
use of the thesis/dissertation review form. A second review after
revisions should be completed in one week, with provisions being
available for additional time. 
<P>
It should be understood that a vote to pass a student on his or
her performance at the final examination (Form GS7) does not imply
final approval of the thesis or dissertation. Approval of the
thesis or dissertation is given by signing the approval page.
<P>
<h3>Restrictions on Use of Theses and Dissertations </h3>
<P>
Unpublished theses and dissertations submitted to the Graduate
School in partial fulfillment of the requirements for graduate
degrees and deposited in the University library are, as a rule,
open to the public for reference purposes. However, extended quotations
or summaries may be published only with the permission of the
author and the graduate dean. 
<P>
<h3>Publication Policy </h3>
<P>
A university's primary function is the accumulation and
dissemination of knowledge. It is therefore expected that the
results of research performed using University facilities be published
in the open literature (i.e., theses, dissertations, journals,
magazines or books) and that any information obtained may be freely
disclosed by the faculty in the teaching programs of the University.

<P>
Exceptional cases may arise; however, and the guidelines below
shall apply to any sponsored projects requiring that results be
kept confidential. 
<P>
1. The University shall not accept awards that require research
results to be kept confidential forever. A definite term of confidentiality
shall be stated in a written nondisclosure agreement and shall
not exceed one year beyond the date of notification to the sponsor
that a manuscript suitable for publication has been prepared.
Exceptions may be granted by the University administration only
under unusual circumstances; e.g., national security, national
emergency, classified activities or certain confidential agreements.

<P>
2. Students associated with confidential projects must have prior
approval for the use of results in preparing reports, theses or
dissertations in fulfillment of degree requirements. The Graduate
School will normally not accept a thesis or dissertation that
must be held in confidence for more than one year. Documents submitted
in partial fulfillment of degree requirements will be retained
by the Graduate School (or the department in the case of project
reports for nonthesis programs) in accordance with the nondisclosure
agreement. The student's thesis or dissertation defense
shall not be open to those not bound by the nondisclosure agreement.
<P>
<h3>Patents and Copyrights</h3>
<P>
All students enrolling in the Graduate School at Clemson University
do so with full understanding that:
<P>
1. The University has full ownership rights in any inventions,
discoveries, developments and/or improvements, whether or not
patentable (inventions), which are conceived, developed or reduced
to practice, or caused to be conceived, developed or reduced to
practice, by graduate students during the course of their research
activities conducted as part of any Graduate School curriculum.
Any such invention will be handled by the University in the same
manner as set forth in <I>The Faculty Manual of Clemson University</i>,
the pertinent provision for which appears as Part VI E entitled
"Patent Policy."
<P>
2. Copyright ownership of any research work will be determined
by University policy and by policies of organizations responsible
for publishing or distributing copyrighted materials.
<P>
Copies of the policies on patents and copyrights are available
in the individual departments and colleges and in the Graduate
School. Any graduate student who plans to accept a research assistantship
or public service assistantship is encouraged to read the policies
prior to accepting the assistantship.
<P>
<h3>Scientific Research</h3>
<P>
Graduate students conducting scientific research in a student
role at Clemson University do so with the full understanding of
the following:
<P>
1. At the discretion of their employment supervisor, students
may be required, at the initiation of the research efforts, to
maintain and preserve all primary data and materials associated
with the research, and deliver these materials to their supervisor
in complete, cataloged and identified form before the students
will have been deemed to have completed the requirements for their
program of study. Once delivered, these materials may be disposed
of at the discretion of the department.
<P>
2. At the discretion of their employment supervisor, students
may be required to keep a clear, concise and complete research
notebook(s) as an accurate record of their research activities
and deliver these notebooks to their supervisor before they will
have been deemed to have completed the requirements for their
program of study. Once delivered, the notebook(s) may be disposed
of at the discretion of the department.

<P>
<a name="Masters Degree">
<h2><I>Master's Degree</i></h2></a>
<P>
<h3>Course Work</h3>
<P>
The total number of graduate credits required for the degree is
determined by the student's advisory committee, consistent
with the specific program guidelines and Graduate School policy.
These credits constitute the core of the student's Graduate
Degree Curriculum (Form GS2) and appear on the form at the location
entitled REQUIRED COURSES (GRADUATE LEVEL ONLY). Undergraduate
deficiencies are listed at the designated location. Supplemental
courses, carrying undergraduate or graduate credit and chosen
to broaden the student's academic experience, are not required
on Form GS2. However, if a listing is desirable, such courses
will be listed as departmental requirements at the designated
location.
<P>
The Graduate School requires each degree program to consist of
a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate credit with at least
12 semester hours, exclusive of thesis credit, in the major discipline
as defined by the advisory committee, subject to degree program
regulations. A minor outside that degree program, if chosen, shall
consist of at least six semester hours in that area. The following
conditions, appropriate for the types of degrees, must also be
observed:
<P>
1. <I>Master of Arts or Master of Science (Thesis Option)</i>. Each program
includes a minimum of 24 semester hours of graduate credit exclusive
of thesis research and six semester hours of thesis research (891).
At least one-half of the total graduate credit hours required
by the advisory committee, exclusive of thesis research, must
be selected from courses numbered 800 or above.
<P>
2. <I>Master of Arts or Master of Science (Nonthesis Option)</i>. Each
program includes a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate credit,
none of which may be thesis research. At least one-half of the
total graduate credit hours required by the advisory committee
must be selected from courses numbered 800 or above.
<P>
3. <I>Professional Master's Degrees</i>. Each program includes
a minimum of 30 semester hours of graduate credit. Except for
professional programs in the College of Architecture, Arts and
Humanities which require a thesis, research credits (891 or 991)
may not be included in the program requirements.* Any additional
requirements for these degrees are described under the colleges
which offer the degrees.
<P>
<h3>Residence </h3>
<P>
There is no University-wide residence requirement for a master's
degree. However, individual degree programs may establish a requirement,
which will be described and publicized for all prospective master's
degree candidates in the particular program.
<P>
<H3>Time Limit </h3>
<P>
All course work to be credited toward any master's degree
must have been enrolled in and completed within six calendar years
prior to the date on which the degree is to be awarded. For example,
a person graduating in the spring semester must have started and
completed all course work within the 72-month period beginning
with the summer term six years earlier. When recommended by the
student's advisory committee and approved by the graduate
dean, as many as six semester hours of course work at Clemson
University completed outside the six-year limit may be validated
by a <b>written</b> comprehensive examination based on the latest syllabus
and course content. Such examinations will be under the direction
of the department regularly offering the course or courses for
which the student seeks validation. Independent study courses
are not subject to validation. Course work completed outside the
six-year time limit at an institution other than Clemson University
may not be transferred to Clemson or validated for graduate credit.

<P>
<h3>Foreign Language </h3>
<P>
A reading knowledge of one approved foreign language is a departmental
requirement for certain Master of Arts and Master of Science degrees.
The language level expected is a basic reading knowledge equivalent
to that provided by two years of study at the college level. The
requirement may be satisfied by passing a translation test administered
by the Department of Languages or by passing a test similar to
that given as the final examination of a language course designed
for graduate students.
<P>
The Department of Languages will administer the foreign language
translation test four times annually: on the first Thursdays of
November and March and once during the final examination period
of each summer session. The student will be assessed no fee for
the first test administration. A fee of $20(subject to change) will be assessed
for the second and any subsequent administrations. Applications,
available in the Department of Languages, must be filed with the
Department of Languages at least three weeks before the test date.
<P>
On the recommendation of the chair of the Department of Languages,
a student may satisfy the requirement by having completed at least
12 semester credit hours in an approved foreign language with
an average grade of B or better. These credit hours must be earned
from an accredited baccalaureate institution and must have been
completed in total within six years prior to the student's
finishing the graduate degree. The chair of the Department of
Languages may recommend a waiver of the minimum grade and six-year
limitation for any student who can substantiate extensive additional
training in a foreign language.
<P>
<h3>Off-campus Research </h3>
<P>
Although thesis research is normally performed at Clemson University,
it is recognized that Clemson University may not have on its campus
certain specialized equipment or facilities that would be desirable
for advanced training at the master's level. Thus, for
those cases in which thesis or other advanced study is required
and the facilities to pursue such study are not available on the
Clemson campus, permission may be granted for off-campus research.
The requirements to be satisfied in such cases are identical to
those listed for the doctoral degree under "Off-campus
Research" on page 37, with the exception that the off-campus
research supervisor need not hold the Ph.D. degree, provided he
or she is qualified and certified for the supervisory position
by the department and college involved and by the graduate dean.

<P>
<h3>Final Examination </h3>
<P>
Each candidate for the master's degree, after completion
of the thesis, if required, and at least three weeks before the
degree is to be awarded, must pass a final examination. The examination
may be oral and/or written, and is administered by the advisory
committee or a standing committee appointed in accordance with
published program policies. The purpose of the examination is
to ascertain the general knowledge of the candidates with particular
reference to the major and minor subjects and the thesis or departmental
report. The Graduate School will be notified of the time and place
of the examination at least 10 days prior to the time scheduled.
Members of the faculty, as well as members of the Graduate Curriculum
Committee and the dean of the Graduate School, are invited to
attend the examination. Within three days after the examination,
the examining committee, through Form GS7, will notify the Graduate
School of the results of the examination. A student who fails
a final examination may be allowed a second opportunity only with
the recommendation of the advisory committee. Failure of the second
examination will result in dismissal from the Graduate School.
<P>
<a name="Specialist in Education Degree">
<h2><I>Specialist in Education Degree</i></h2></a>
<P>
The degree requirements for professional master's degrees
and the requirements pertaining to residence, time limits and
final examinations for master's degrees also apply to the
Specialist in Education degree. Course work required includes
30 semester hours beyond the master's degree to be selected
from five areas prescribed by the Department of Elementary and
Secondary Education. 
<P>
<a name="Doctor of Philosophy Degree">
<H2><I>Doctor of Philosophy Degree</i></h2></a>
<P>
<h3>Course Work </h3>
<P>
Work leading to the Doctor of Philosophy degree is planned to
give the student a comprehensive knowledge of his or her field
of specialization and a mastery of the methods of research. The
degree is not awarded solely on the basis of course work completed,
residence or other routine requirements. The final basis of granting
the degree is the student's grasp of the subject matter
of a broad field of study, competency to plan and conduct research,
and ability to express himself or herself adequately and professionally
in oral and written language. 
<P>
The advisory committee aids the student in developing a graduate
degree curriculum, which includes the selection of specific courses
and their sequence. Although no minimum course work requirements
exist for the doctoral degree, committees are encouraged to require
courses other than those that directly support the dissertation
research. Work in the minor field or fields, if required, normally
comprises from 12 to 24 hours in courses carrying graduate credit.
A minimum of 18 hours of doctoral research is required. Should
the direction of study or research interest change, the student
may request the appointment of a new advisor. 
<P>
<h3>Residence </h3>
<P>
Residence is a necessary concept in graduate education, particularly
in the preparation of the dissertation. The purpose of residence
is to require the student to spend a specified minimum amount
of time as follows: 
<P>
1. in direct personal association with members of the faculty
of the University; 
<P>
2. under direct tutelage and advisement of a research advisor
and advisory committee in the department or program of the major;
and 
<P>
3. participating in other normal activities pertinent to graduate
education such as seminars and close association with other student
researchers. 
<P>
To receive the Doctor of Philosophy degree, the student must complete
at least 15 semester hours of graduate credit including research
credit hours (991) on the Clemson University campus in a continuous
12-month period. 
<P>
For students employed substantially more than half time, a statement
specifying the manner in which the residence requirement is to
be satisfied shall be formulated by the advisory committee and
be included in the graduate degree curriculum. Also, upon completion
of the final examination, the student's committee will
forward to the Graduate School a statement approved by the department
head and college dean certifying that residence requirements have
been met. 
<P>
<h3>Time Limit </h3>
<P>
Because no minimum course work requirements exist for the Doctor
of Philosophy degree, the time limitation for completion is determined
by the dates by which essential ingredients of the degree are
completed. The following must be passed in the five-year period
prior to graduation: 
<P>
1. comprehensive examination (see page 37), 
<P>
2. foreign language examination, if required by program 
<P>
(see below), 
<P>
3. defense of dissertation (see page 38), and 
<P>
4. approval of dissertation by the Graduate School 
<P>
(see page 34).
<P>
<H3>Foreign Language</h3>
<P>
Certain doctoral programs include a foreign language requirement.
Languages accepted by all departments are French and German. Under
certain conditions, Spanish, Russian or the classical languages
may be accepted. Upon the recommendation of the head of the Department
of Languages, use of other languages may be approved, provided
adequate justification can be presented, the language is not native
to the student and a proper testing procedure can be established.
Any expense incurred in obtaining assistance for such testing
must be paid by the student.
<P>
The language level expected is a basic reading knowledge equivalent
to that provided by two years of study at the college level. The
requirement may be satisfied by passing a translation test administered
by the Department of Languages or by passing a test similar to
that given as the final examination of a language course designed
for graduate students.
<P>
The Department of Languages will administer the foreign language
translation test four times annually: on the first Thursdays of
November and March and once during the final examination period
of each summer session. The student will be assessed no fee for
the first test administration. A fee of $20* will be assessed
for the second and any subsequent administrations. Applications,
available in the Department of Languages, must be filed with the
Department of Languages at least three weeks before the test date.
<P>
The foreign language requirement must be satisfied in a five-year
period prior to the awarding of the doctoral degree and prior
to admission to candidacy for the degree.
<P>
<h3>Off-campus Research </h3>
<P>
Under special circumstances, it may appear desirable that doctoral
research be conducted away from the Clemson University campus.
If such research is to be performed under the immediate direction
of a Clemson University faculty member acting as dissertation
advisor and supervisor, then in order to accommodate the student
as well as to exercise proper and necessary control over this
most important phase of doctoral study, the following additional
requirements will be made:
<P>
1. <I>Written Consent and Research Plan</i>. The student must have the
written consent of his or her dissertation advisor, full advisory
committee, department head, college dean and the graduate dean.
Prior to departure from campus, the student must submit a written
plan for his or her research effort to the advisory committee
for approval. The plan should include a discussion of the problem
and intended scope of the investigation, and should be structured
in terms of a specific time frame. 
<P>
2. <I>Statement from Organization where Research Will Be Conducted</i>.
The advisory committee may require a statement from an appropriate
officer of the organization at which the student will be located
agreeing to (a) the student's plan to complete dissertation
research using the organization's equipment and facilities;
(b) the apportioning of at least 25 percent or other appropriate
amount of the student's employment hours to dissertation
research; and (c) the organization's release of patent
rights or copyrights arising from discoveries or concepts that
evolve during the course of the student's doctoral research.

<P>
3. <I>Travel</i>. The student may be required to travel to Clemson University,
not at the expense of Clemson University, to meet with the dissertation
advisor and advisory committee as often as is deemed necessary
by the committee. Further, the student may, at the discretion
of the dissertation advisor and advisory committee, be required
to return to the Clemson campus subsequent to the performance
of the mechanics of the research for the purpose of comprehensive
review and analysis of the research. 
<P>
4. <i>Continuous Enrollment</i>. The student must maintain continuous
enrollment at Clemson University each semester while the research
is in progress. It will be the student's responsibility
to make suitable arrangements with the department to maintain
this continuous registration. Normally the student will not be
required to register for summer sessions; however, he or she must
be registered for the term that involves the review of the completed
dissertation and/or the final examination. 
<P>
5. <I>Supervision and Reports</i>. When doctoral research is conducted
away from the Clemson campus and under the immediate direction
of a dissertation supervisor who is employed by an organization
other than Clemson University, in order to accommodate the student,
as well as to exercise proper and necessary control over this
important phase of doctoral study, the following requirements
must be met:
<P>
<table>
<td valign=top>(a)<td>An employee, having earned a Ph.D. and being engaged in the
general subject area of the student's research, must be
designated by an officer of the organization to supervise the
student's research work.<tr>
<td valign=top>(b)<td>The employee must be recommended to the provost by the appropriate
college dean for appointment as an adjunct professor of Clemson
University.<tr> 
<td valign=top>(c)<td>A resume of the research supervisor must be submitted
to the student's full advisory committee for its review
and recommendation to the graduate dean.<tr>
<td valign=top>(d)<td>The research supervisor must submit a final statement regarding
the dissertation research, as well as interim reports if the committee
deems such as necessary.<tr>
<td valign=top>(e)<td>The off-campus research supervisor cannot serve as the student's
major advisor.<tr>
</table>
<P>
<h3>Comprehensive Examinations before Admission to Candidacy </h3>
<P>
Prior to taking the comprehensive examination before admission
to candidacy, the doctoral student must have selected an advisory
committee and filed an approved graduate degree curriculum (Form
GS2) with the Graduate School. 
<P>
Satisfactory completion of the comprehensive examination must
occur no less than six months and no more than five years prior
to the date of graduation. For examinations consisting of several
parts (for example, a written plus an oral, or a written in cumulative
format), the date of completion will coincide with the date of
the last examination activity. However, the time span from the
beginning to the end of the examination must not exceed twelve
months, and failure of any portion that negates further examining
will be reported as a failure of the examination. In the event
that the completion date falls within a semester or session but
all degree requirements have been met in a five-year period following
the completion date, the student may receive the degree at the
ensuing graduation ceremony.
<P>
A comprehensive examination is attempted only at the recommendation
of the student's advisory committee after completion of
most of the required course work. The function of the examination,
which may be written or a combination of written and oral, is
to obtain objective evidence of an adequate intellectual mastery
of the areas of the major and minor specializations. This examination
must be administered by the Clemson University program faculty
offering the degree. The examining committee may be the student's
advisory committee or a standing committee appointed in accordance
with published program policies. A unanimous decision is not required;
dissenting members of the examining committee should feel free
to forward a minority report to the Graduate School.
<P>
The chairperson of the advisory committee will inform the Graduate
School of the result, via Form GS5, within three weeks following
the examination. The student's performance on this examination
will determine whether he or she will be recommended for admission
to candidacy for the degree. 
<P>
Should the student fail to pass the comprehensive examination,
he or she may be given a second opportunity if so recommended
by the advisory committee. A second failure shall result in the
student being declared ineligible to receive the Doctor of Philosophy
degree at Clemson University. 
<P>
Some doctoral programs require preliminary or qualifying examinations
prior to the comprehensive examination. Information about these
examinations may be obtained from the individual departments.

<P>
<h3>Final Doctoral Oral Examination </h3>
<P>
The candidate for the Doctor of Philosophy degree must pass a
final oral examination (dissertation defense) at least three weeks
prior to the time of the commencement at which he or she plans
to obtain the degree. The examination will be conducted by the
student's advisory committee, and all faculty members are
invited to participate. The Graduate School will be notified of
the time and place of the examination at least 10 days prior to
the time scheduled. Members of the faculty, as well as members
of the Graduate Curriculum Committee and the dean of the Graduate
School, are invited to attend the examination. 
<P>
This final examination demands a broad and penetrating interpretation
by the student of the research project and conclusions. It may
include examination of the student in the major and minor fields
of specialization. 
<P>
A student who fails a final oral examination may be allowed a
second opportunity only with the recommendation of the advisory
committee. Failure of the second examination will result in dismissal
from the Graduate School.

<h2><I>Doctor of Education Degree</i></h2></a>
<P>
Degree requirements pertaining to residence, time limit, and comprehensive
and final examinations are the same as those for the Doctor of
Philosophy degree. In addition, the candidate for the Doctor of
Education degree must arrange with his or her advisory committee
to engage in an internship appropriate to his or her field of
professional service.

<h1>GRADUATE PROGRAMS AND COURSE OFFERINGS</h1>
<P>
<a name="Special Courses">
<h2><I>Special Courses</i></h2>
<P>
These courses serve special needs for graduate students. They
do not count toward a graduate degree, and no letter grades are
given.
<P>

<P>
<a name="Explanation of Course Listings">
<h2><I>Explanation of Course Listings</i></h2></a>
<P>
Programs are listed alphabetically within the college that offers
them. In certain departments which offer more than one course
sequence, the secondary courses (not leading to a major or a minor)
are listed immediately after those normally associated with the
degree program or departmental name. 
<P>
The list of courses offered under each program includes for each
course the catalog number, title of course, credit in semester
hours, class and laboratory hours per week and, for courses numbered
700 or above, the description of the course. Where courses are
offered on a schedule, there is a designation F, S, SS or N following
the class and laboratory hours, indicating whether the course
is offered in the fall, spring, summer session or as needed. No
designation indicates that the course is taught at least every
year, but not necessarily during the same term. These designations
are projections of the teaching schedules, and many factors can
cause a change. It is the responsibility of the student to check
with his or her department for verification of the scheduled offerings.

<P>
Graduate credit can be earned only for courses numbered 600 or
above. Courses listed in this catalog in the 600-699 series are
taught concurrently in the same classroom setting as the corresponding
300- and 400-series undergraduate courses. These are described
in the general catalog, <I>Clemson University Undergraduate Announcements
1996-97</i>, which may be obtained from the director of undergraduate
admissions. 
<P>
Courses numbered in the 300 and 400 sequence are primarily for
advanced undergraduates but are offered also for graduate credit
when they carry the corresponding 600-level number. Students who
receive graduate credit in such courses must do extra work of
an appropriate nature as determined by the department and are
graded according to graduate standards. Courses numbered 700 or
above are restricted to graduate students and certain qualified
Clemson University seniors.
<P>
Some course listings under certain programs may contain 700-,
800- and 900-level courses with a number, title, credits and hours,
but no description. These courses are administered by departments
other than the one under which they are listed. In these cases,
a note will indicate where the descriptions are located. 
<P>
A secondary listing of a course in parentheses implies that this
course is cross-listed with another program. The course description
appears with the parent course only. 
<P>
The 700-level courses are designed primarily for the degrees that
emphasize professional practice rather than research.
<P>
<a name="Course Prefixes">
<h2><I>Course Prefixes</i></h2></a>
<P>
This list of course offerings is arranged alphabetically and includes
the course prefix used in the Clemson University Graduate School
Announcements.

<P>
Graduate work in agricultural and applied economics enables the student to attain a higher degree of specialized 
professional competence and to secure a greater mastery of techniques for applying quantitative economic 
analysis to agricultural and natural resource problems. Industry, government and universities offer challenging 
opportunities in research, development, education, management and other related areas for persons with advanced 
training.
<P>
Special emphasis in the graduate program is placed on the economics of agricultural production and marketing, 
economic development, analysis of government programs and policies, and statistical techniques used in solving 
economic and institutional problems. Flexibility is achieved through choice of elective courses and selection of 
an M.S. thesis or Ph.D. dissertation topic. There is no language requirement for the M.S. or Ph.D. degree.
<P>
The Department of Agricultural and Applied Economics offers courses in support of the Master of Agriculture 
degree, a nonthesis program.
<P>
In addition to applicants with baccalaureate degrees in agricultural economics and related programs, the 
department encourages applications from students who have a sound background in general economics. In many 
cases, such students may be admitted to full graduate status without prerequisites other than those required of all 
graduate students.

Jose R. Caban, Chair, School of Architecture  
<P>
<table>
<th>Major<tH>Degrees<tr>
<td>Architecture<td>M.Arch., M.S.<tr>
</table><P> 
The Master of Architecture is a professional degree program that develops proficiency in 
responding to contemporary architectural issues through a range of both practical and 
theoretical knowledge, while providing opportunities for creatively challenging the limits 
of the profession. Major emphasis is on design, accompanied in turn by complementary 
course work of a professional focus, as well as elective subjects. Complex studio design 
projects stress social awareness and contextual fit and are responsive to all aspects of 
the architectural process. Practical experience is a requisite part of the overall 
program, which is concluded with a thesis combining literary research with design 
synthesis.  
<P>
Admission to the Master of Architecture program is based on the student's ability to 
respond effectively to the intellectual rigor and creative challenge integral to graduate 
architecture study. This potential is measured by demonstrated proficiency in prior 
academic work and Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) general test scores, as well as 
creativeness of mind, motivation of spirit and maturity of purpose. Normally a personal 
interview is required of candidates whose application material has been reviewed favorably 
by the Admissions Committee. A postbaccalaureate program of preparatory study is available 
to qualified applicants with backgrounds in areas other than design. More detailed 
information concerning application procedures and requirements may be obtained by writing 
or calling the School of Architecture. 
<P>
The duration of study required for the Master of Architecture degree is normally two 
academic years, and degree candidates may elect a concentration of study in either 
architecture, or architecture and health care. The specific study plan of each student is 
determined in consultation with the major advisor and is intended to reflect individual 
educational objectives and career goals, while assuring a comprehensive development of 
professional competency. Requirements for the Master of Architecture degree include 45 
credits of approved course work with a minimum grade point average of 3.00, along with 
acceptance of a thesis of 15 hours. All candidates for graduation are required to have 
1,000 hours of practical experience in an architect's office. 
<P>
The Master of Science degree in architecture is a postprofessional degree program which 
offers the opportunity to achieve advanced learning within the discipline of architecture, 
and to undertake research responsive to increasingly complex challenges attendant to the 
built environment. This is accomplished through a foundation of course work, accompanied 
by directed studies within a selected area of inquiry, and followed by the critical 
examination of a singular aspect of architecture in a research thesis. 
<P>
Admission to the Master of Science degree program is available to students who have a 
first professional degree in architecture, and who possess the intellectual mettle and 
dedication of purpose necessary to respond successfully to the rigor of advanced study and 
independent research. This is measured by academic proficiency in prior work, a well-
reasoned plan of advanced study and GRE general test scores. A personal interview is 
required of all applicants whose application material has been reviewed favorably by the 
Admissions Committee. More information concerning application procedures and requirements 
may be obtained by contacting the School of Architecture. 
<P>
The course work and directed studies required of the Master of Science program may be 
completed in one academic year, after which a variable period of time is dedicated to the 
research thesis. Degree candidates elect to work within one of the following areas: 
architecture and health care facilities, environmental issues in architecture, 
architecture and human perception, or theory and philosophy of architecture. A study plan 
is determined in consultation with the major advisor who, along with the advisory 
committee, periodically reviews the student's work and evaluates the research thesis. 
Credit requirements for the Master of Science degree consist of 24 hours of combined 
course work and directed studies with a minimum grade point average of 3.00, and the 
acceptance of a six-hour research thesis. 
<P>
<B>Architecture Concentration</b><P>
This inclusive course of study leading to the Master of Architecture degree affords the 
student an opportunity to pursue individual academic and career objectives within the 
context of a rigorous professionally directed architecture program. The focus of learning 
is the design studio, where the student is involved in a wide range of theoretical and 
real-world explorations. Advanced studies in technology, theory and professional practice 
complement design work and are accompanied by additional subjects determined in concert 
with the major advisor. 
<P>
Although designated subjects in design and other professional studies constitute a major 
portion of work in this concentration, sufficient elective hours are available to 
establish a study plan responsive to individual interests. The choice of thesis subject 
provides a further opportunity for personal development. 
<P>
<B>Architecture and Health Care Concentration</b>
<P> 
Master of Architecture students in this specialized area of study examine issues of 
programming, planning and design associated with a comprehensive approach to physical and 
mental health care delivery systems. Studio work emphasizes the integration of physical 
design systems with patient care techniques. Theoretical design projects, as well as those 
that lead to built projects, employ both investigative research and architectural 
synthesis. These design studies are complemented by lectures and seminars that deal with 
various aspects of health care, hospital administration and the environment. 
<P>
The architecture and health care concentration is demanding in the scope of its 
professional studies, with most of the course work designated for specific areas of 
learning. The thesis, which normally deals with a particular area of health care, may be 
project or research oriented.

<P>
<table>
<Th>Major<th>Degree<tr>
<td>City and Regional Planning<td>M.C.R.P.<tr>
</table>
<P>
The two-year Master of City and Regional Planning program emphasizes land-use planning and 
development, environmental planning, and issues of the built and natural environments. The 
standard core curriculum is followed by concentrated studies in one of these areas: urban 
design and land-use planning and development, and environmental planning. Specialty 
concentrations can be tailored to doctoral programs elsewhere. Students normally choose a 
concentration for which their undergraduate background is best suited. No specific 
undergraduate area of study is required; options are available for students with or 
without a design background. The result is a rich cross section of students with a variety 
of interests. The relatively small enrollment leads to intensive faculty-student 
interaction. Ongoing public service and research projects provide a real-world dimension 
to the program. Graduates are well equipped for careers in private-sector planning and 
development, as well as public-sector planning and administration.
<P>
The Overseas Center for Urban Studies in Genoa, Italy, is a unique support element in the 
planning studies program. It provides the option of a one-semester overseas study 
experience in an interdisciplinary program of planning studies, design and fine arts. 
<P>
<B>Admission Requirements</b>
<P>
Admission to the graduate program requires the following:
<br>1.	a bachelor's degree from an accredited college or university;
<br>2.	a satisfactory academic record in the last two years of undergraduate work;
<br>3.	an on-campus interview (highly recommended);
<br>4.	three letters of recommendation from employers or personal acquaintances, with at 
least two from undergraduate teachers;
<br>5.	completion of the Graduate Record Examinations; and
<br>6.	one three-credit course in statistics, economics and computer applications (highly 
recommended).
<P>
Deficiencies in any of these areas may be remedied after enrollment in the graduate 
program. Postbaccalaureate status may be recommended in some cases.
<P>
<B>Requirements for Degree Candidacy</b>
<P>
The two-year Master of City and Regional Planning degree requires a minimum of 54 semester

<P> 
The Department of Sociology offers the M.S. degree in applied sociology, emphasizing 
practical and theoretical knowledge in the areas of industrial and organizational 
sociology, and focusing on the acquisition of social research skills, theory application 
and practical field experience. Students are prepared for employment in federal, state and 
local government agencies; in industry and related agencies; and to pursue a doctorate. 
<P>
Applicants must hold a bachelor's degree from an accredited degree program; have completed 
a minimum of 15 undergraduate semester hours in sociology or another social science 
discipline that includes at least one course each in statistics, research methods and 
sociological theory; submit GRE scores on the verbal, quantitative and analytical sections 
(satisfactory scores normally include a minimum of 500 on each section of the test); 
submit three letters of recommendation, at least two of which are from faculty members of 
the applicant's previously attended college or university; and submit a 500-word essay on 
career aspirations and goals, and explain how completion of this program in applied 
sociology will assist in achieving these goals. 
<P>
All students are required to write a thesis and to complete a minimum of 40 hours of 
course work, including SOC 803, 805, 807, 810, 830, 833, 895 and selected electives. 
Students must demonstrate competency in basic statistics in the first semester by either 
passing a departmentally administered competency examination or obtaining a grade of B in 
EX ST 801. Students also must demonstrate competency in multivariate regression in the 
second semester by either passing a departmentally administered competency examination or 
obtaining a grade of B in MTHSC 805. The 40-hour requirement includes a six-hour placement 
in an applied setting. The field placement is coordinated by the student, the graduate 
director and the on-site supervisor. Typically, the internship is completed in the summer 
between the first and second year of the program, but only after completing a minimum of 
12 credit hours of 800-level course work. In exceptional circumstances the graduate 
coordinator may approve the substitution of six hours of appropriate course work for the 
field placement when the student has had work experience comparable to the placement.

R. Larry Dooley, Chair, Department of Bioengineering
<P><table>
<th>Major<th>Degrees<tr>
<td>Bioengineering<td>M.S., Ph.D.<tr>
</table>
<P> 
The bioengineering program is devoted to the application of engineering science, methods 
and techniques to problems ranging from basic biomedical research to applied health care 
delivery. The principle area of concentration is biomaterials, engineering and related 
fields, including biomechanics and research instrumentation. The traditionally strong 
emphasis in the areas of materials and mechanics is directed toward the development of 
materials and devices (including artificial organs) for surgical implantation. Artificial 
intelligence is applied to medical diagnostic problems and to assist in the design, 
evaluation and fabrication of custom implants. Heavy reliance is placed on considerable 
direct laboratory experience. 
<P>
The faculty is augmented by adjunct medical faculty, and most research programs are 
conducted in collaboration with medical, clinical or research-oriented institutions. All 
students have some direct experience with an appropriate aspect of this medical 
involvement. A three-month clinical internship is available to all students through the 
Bioengineering Alliance of South Carolina. 
<P>
Students enrolling in this program usually have a strong background in the more 
traditional engineering disciplines. Some background in general biology and physiology is 
recommended but is not a prerequisite. Students with degrees in science may be considered 
for admission if they can demonstrate proficiency in certain prescribed engineering 
courses. 
<P>
Candidates are allowed flexibility in planning their programs, but they are encouraged to 
seek advice and direction from the faculty because of the rapid evolution of this emerging 
discipline. 
<P>
The master's degree curriculum offers both a thesis and a nonthesis option. The thesis 
option requires a minimum of 30 semester hours including six semester hours of research. 
The nonthesis option requires a minimum of 33 semester hours including six semester hours 
of nonthesis research, special topics or internship, and a report. Both options require a 
final examination.

<body><h1>Environmental Systems Engineering</h1>
Glen T. Daigger, Chair, Department of Environmental Systems
Engineering
<P><table>
<th>Major<th>Degrees<tr>
<td>Environmental Systems Engineering<td>M.Engr., M.S., Ph.D.<tr>
</table>
<P>
Environmental systems engineering is concerned with the
engineering aspects of the control of the environment. Emphasis
is placed on applying fundamental principles of the basic and
engineering sciences through research and design to environmental
engineering problems.
<P>
The M.Engr. program is designed to build on an ABET-accredited
engineering  baccalaureate background, while the M.S. degree
builds on a student's previous engineering or science background.
Students with a baccalaureate degree in any branch of
engineering, as well as chemistry, physics, geology and biology
majors with a strong mathematical background, may be admitted to
the program. Students usually elect to specialize in one of seven
areas: (1) process engineering, (2) hazardous and radioactive
waste treatment, (3) contaminant characterization, (4)
contaminant fate and transport, (5) analysis of natural systems,
(6) environmental restoration, and (7) risk assessment and waste
management. Research master's degree candidates must complete 24
hours of course work and six hours of research culminating in the
presentation of a satisfactory thesis for M.S. candidates or a
special problem report for M.Engr. candidates. An M.S. nonthesis
option which requires 33 hours of course work is available.
<P>
The Ph.D. program is directed toward providing the student with a
comprehensive background in the fundamental aspects of
environmental engineering. The major field of study is generally
interdisciplinary in nature, consisting of course work in several
areas of engineering and the basic sciences. Each student's
research program is tailored to suit his or her personal and
professional goals. Qualifying, comprehensive and final
examinations are required. No foreign language is required.

<body><h1>Industrial Engineering</h1>
Delbert L. Kimbler, Chair, Department of Industrial Engineering
<P><table>
<th>Major<th>Degrees<tr>
<td>Industrial Engineering<td>M.S., Ph.D.<tr>
</TABLE>
<P>
Industrial engineering is concerned with the design, improvement
and installation of integrated systems of people, materials,
equipment and information. It draws upon specialized knowledge
and skill in the mathematical, physical and social sciences,
together with the principles and methods of engineering analysis
and design, to specify, predict and evaluate the results obtained
from such systems.
<P>
The focus of the graduate program is on quality engineering. In
general, students concentrate their studies in one of four areas:
human factors engineering, manufacturing systems, operations
research and quality engineering. They choose supporting course
work from within the department and from other departments. Areas
of research interest among the faculty include applied
optimization, computer-integrated manufacturing, design
methodology, engineering economic analysis, facility planning and
material handling, health care and information systems design,
human-computer interaction, human-machine systems engineering,
industrial ergonomics, maintenance systems design, manufacturing
systems engineering, production planning and control, quality
engineering, solid and hazardous waste management, and systems
modeling and simulation. A variety of laboratory facilities are
available within the department to support research in these
areas.
<P>
Students with a bachelor's degree in engineering or the physical
sciences may be accepted. Those with other backgrounds may be
accepted or may be required to complete successfully certain
prerequisite courses before acceptance into the program. Entering
graduate students are assumed to have competency in the following
areas: mathematics, including calculus, linear algebra,
differential equations, probability and statistics;
calculus-based physics and computer programming. A student with
deficiencies in these areas is required to take additional
undergraduate course work as a condition of admission to the
graduate program. No graduate credit is given for such courses.
<P>
Students may pursue an M.S. degree with a thesis, requiring a
minimum of 24 graduate credit hours of course work, six credit
hours of master's thesis research and one credit hour of seminar.
Alternatively, students may pursue an M.S. degree without a
thesis, requiring a minimum of 30 graduate credit hours of course
work, three credit hours of project work and one credit hour of
seminar. The prescribed credit hours of course work are agreed
upon by the student and his or her advisory committee and are in
addition to any needed to compensate for undergraduate
deficiencies.
<P>
Work leading to the Ph.D. degree is planned to give the student a
comprehensive knowledge of the field of industrial engineering
and a mastery of the methods of research. The advisory committee
aids the student in developing a doctoral degree curriculum. A
minimum requirement of 48 semester credit hours of graduate
course work exists for the doctoral degree. A dissertation is
mandatory for all Ph.D. candidates and requires18 credit hours of
doctoral research.

<P>
Entering students are expected to have courses in linear algebra,
differential equations, a computer language and statistics.
<P>
For the master's program, both thesis and nonthesis options are
available. The curriculum for both options includes foundation
courses (advanced calculus, modern algebra, probability and
discrete computing _ courses often taken prior to entering the
master's program); a breadth requirement (a course from each of
algebra, analysis, computing, operations research and statistics
plus one additional course in operations research or statistics);
and a concentration area (six courses selected to define an
identifiable specialty area). Every student's program is required
to include at least one course, possibly chosen from outside the
Department of Mathematical Sciences, which emphasizes
mathematical modeling. A minimum of 36 graduate hours is required
for the master's degree. In addition, students in the nonthesis
option are required to complete a one-credit-hour project course.
<P>
Students in the doctoral program are expected to satisfy the
master's program requirements prior to receiving their doctorate.
Including master's study, a doctoral program must have two
courses from each of the major areas of the mathematical sciences
(algebra, analysis, computing, operations research and
probability/statistics), and generally consists of 60 hours of
graduate course work. Students are admitted to candidacy for the
Ph.D. degree upon successful completion of a qualifying
examination in three areas chosen from algebra, analysis,
computing, operations research, statistics and stochastic
processes. A student's Ph.D. program must include both a
concentration area and a supporting area.
<P>
The departments of Management (College of Business and Public
Affairs) and Mathematical Sciences jointly offer and administer a
doctoral program in management science. It is described under
Management Science in the College of Business and Public Affairs.
<P>
Mathematical sciences courses at the 700-level are applicable 
to master's degree programs in the School of Education only.

</TABLE>
<P>
Graduate studies in physics and astronomy may be pursued by
well-prepared students in the physical and mathematical sciences
or engineering. As the basic physical science, physics offers
intellectual opportunities of an unparalled nature. Theoretical,
experimental or computer-simulated studies of the physical
universe, ranging from the macroscopic studies of cosmology to
the microscopic world of quanta, are available.
<P>
All graduate student progress is evaluated each spring by the
Graduate Student Evaluation Committee. This committee reports its
recommendations to the faculty, who, in turn, advise the
department chair concerning students' performances. The
recommendation of the faculty may be (1) continuing satisfactory
progress toward Ph.D. candidacy, (2) satisfactory progress toward
the master's degree, (3) unsatisfactory progress toward any
graduate degree. The department chair considers continuance of
the student based, in part, on these recommendations.
<P>
Students beginning graduate studies in physics and astronomy
usually enter the M.S. program. After two semesters,
well-prepared students are ready to begin a research program.
This program most often culminates in a thesis, although a
nonthesis option is available. For the thesis option, 30 credit
hours and a final oral examination on the general area of study
and thesis defense are required. In the nonthesis option, 36
credit hours are required, including six credit hours of PHYS
890. A written report must be submitted on the directed studies.
A final oral examination on the general area and directed
activities completes the requirements for the nonthesis option. A
program leading to the M.S. degree in physics with a
concentration in health physics is available. Six credits of
health physics or biophysics and nine credits of courses in
biology, biochemistry or chemistry are required in this option.
<P>
Study for the Ph.D. degree begins with the general qualifying
examination. A sufficiently high score on this examination may
make it possible for a student to bypass the master's degree. An
oral examination on the general research area is given within six
months after completion of the written qualifying examination. At
least three weeks prior to the convocation at which the student
expects to receive the Ph.D. degree, a final oral examination on
the dissertation must be completed.

faculty and students. Many programs and courses are offered off campus and in the 
evening to accommodate the schedule of public schools, health-care institutions, 
businesses and other organizations. 
<P>
The College of Health, Education and Human Development offers graduate courses in the 
disciplines of education and nursing at various off-campus locations across the state. Off-
campus course schedules for fall, spring and summer offerings for school personnel, 
school districts and other South Carolina agencies are published by the Office of 
Extension and Public Relations. In addition, courses are taught by contract with local 
school districts in the Clemson University service region.
