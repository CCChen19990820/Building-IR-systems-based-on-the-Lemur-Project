						<font size=4><b><i>Momentum investing looks splendid on paper. But individual investors should be cautious.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Friday's big market move confirmed the predictions of sources quoted in last week's "Market Week Ahead." Namely, that the market was likely to have firm support at the bottom and trade up. The only question was how high. <p>
Steve Chronowitz mentioned that the laggard performance of the Dow transportation and utility indexes had made him somewhat
cautious. I checked in with him on Friday, after those subindices had caught up with the rest of the market, and the New York Financial Index had also hit a record high.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
"If you consistently chase stocks that did well in the previous six months, you will realize superior returns."<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Chronowitz expects the market to race back to its all-time highs--and soon. The S&P 500 hit a record high of 681 in May, and that's the level to watch this week. If the market breaks that level decisively, it could go above 700, he says. He also notes that Friday brought us within 100 points of an all-time closing high in the Dow. "If we get through the high--and I think we will--it looks like we'll march quickly to 6000 plus possibly as high as 6150 to 6200." <p>
But he cautions that if the market moves too quickly up, it will be overbought by midweek, and a near-term correction could last a week or two before it continues on. <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Some technicians predict a Dow of 10,000.</font></b><p><p>
If anything, Chronowitz is cautious and conservative compared to other technicians. Ralph J. Acampora, technical analyst at Prudential Securities, released a report last week outlining the case for a Dow of 7000. And Friday afternoon, some commentators were predicting a Dow of 10,000. But this progress won't be the straight ride up we saw last year. "Over the next couple of months, I expect a very choppy market replete with wide swings in the leading averages," Acampora observed.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>A new study shows that momentum investing consistently beats the market.</font></b><p><p>
A rising tide lifts all boats, but some get more lift than others. Three financial economists from the University of Illinois recently demonstrated that momentum investing strategies can consistently beat the market. "If you consistently chase stocks that did well in the previous six months, this strategy will lead to superior returns," says Professor Josef Lakonishok. Some momentum investors look at earnings performance, some look at stock price performance. Lakonishok and his colleagues Louis Bhan and Narasimhan Jegadeesh found that both strategies outperform the market.<p>
The study looked at all domestic stocks listed on the New York, American and NASDAQ exchanges from 1977 to 1993. Ranking stocks according to their stock price performance over the previous six month period, the researchers divided them into 10 groups. The stocks with the highest prior six month returns outperformed the stocks with the lowest by 8.8 percent over the next six months and 15.4 percent over the next year. Ranking them on earnings, the researchers found more modest spreads of 7.7 percent over the next six months and 9.7 percent over the next year.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The momentum strategy looks splendid on paper. But individual investors should beware.</font></b><p><p>
The paper blows another hole in the so-called "efficient market" hypothesis. A market is defined as efficient when all available information about a company is quickly priced into the stock. "The results suggest a market that responds only slowly to new information," Lakonishok told me. "The market is suspicious, and does not take big improvements very seriously."<p>
Individual investors trying to implement the strategy will find it difficult, though. It's a trading-intensive approach, and portfolio turnover could be 100 percent a year. That means that commissions will likely take a big bite out of returns. Diversification is also important, because sometimes momentum carries stocks, even whole sectors, too far to fast.<p>
Lakonishok offers the following advice: "If you implement momentum strategies, you must be careful how you trade. Use discount brokers, put in limit orders, and remember that if your portfolio is not large enough, there's no way to benefit because you want to be diversified. As splendid as it looks on paper it is difficult to implement unless you have a sizable portfolio of at least a million dollars."<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Investors use the momentum strategy other ways.</font></b><p><p>
Investors without the resources to construct their own portfolios
can play the momentum game at the margin, by considering the
stock's recent performance with an eye towards its momentum. 
There are also mutual funds that specialize in momentum investing--but as the Wall Street Journal reported last week, recent market volatility has taken its toll on them.<p>
Next week, we'll take a look at another study by Lakonishok, on value investing. This approach is somewhat more suitable to the individual.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>The recent bad news in the market may not be so bad as some pundits have painted it</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Notwithstanding the much reported forecasts of a crash, it was a quiet Friday afternoon on the floor of the Chicago Board Option Exchange. "Summers used to be like this all the time," reminisced Kevin Berninger, a CBOE floor trader with plenty of time to jaw on the phone, even though the market was open.<p>
When the CBOE is quiet, of course, you can assume that it's quiet almost everywhere. Nowadays, there aren't distinct stock, bond, options, and futures markets. There's just one big market with several visible exchanges. So you can take the big market's temperature by sticking a thermometer in almost anywhere. By Friday, the fever had broken.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
"It's going to continue like this for a couple days then there'll be another selloff," says one CBOE trader.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
After a big drop, a rally back, and another drop, the market's crisis had passed. Volatility had come down, options premiums were lower, and people thought it was safe to put their toes in the water again. "People are coming in, and buying stocks," Berninger noted. "I think they're wrong. It's going to continue like this for a couple days then there'll be another selloff."<p>
Berninger said the market fell not because people were desperate to sell, but because buyers had simply stepped away from high prices. Once prices move up a bit, there are many big pension and mutual funds looking to take profits.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Traders say buyers are willing to come in at the right price. That's what scares the bears.</font></b><p><p>
The same analysis was offered by a trader on the equity desk of a major New York bank. "We see customers picking their spots," he said, "When the market goes down it's because buyers walk away, but they come back at certain levels. Right now, order flow is better to the buy side."<p>
If buyers are willing to come in at the right price, it means that the recent bad news in the market may not be so bad as some pundits have painted it. That's what scares the bears.<p>
Ben Kopin manages the short-selling Lynx fund in Chicago. He returned his investors a negative 6 percent performance until the beginning of June. From June until the present, he has given them a positive 24 percent, thanks to big short positions in technology and health care. But he's skeptical about the prospects for a really momentous decline. "If we go into a 1987 type crash, I will be very happy," he says. "But I've pulled in my horns a little so if we have a significant rally I won't get beat up too bad." That is, he's taken some profits on his short positions rather than adding to them.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Last week's S&P low was an important support level.</font></b><p><p>
The outlook for a market with a fairly firm bottom and a pretty distinct top was more precisely defined by Steve Chronowitz. Formerly the director of futures research for Smith Barney, Chronowitz has been trading on his own account for the past five years. He has quite a reputation among professional traders, and regular readers of this column will understand why he seems to deserve it. When I last interviewed Chronowitz for the March 4 "Market Week Ahead," he predicted that the S&P 500 would go no higher than 680. In May, it hit 681, then fell back.<p>
I checked in with Chronowitz on Friday to see how he read this market. "A lot of cross currents," he said. "After the spike low we had, a majority of traders dumped most of their so-called hot stocks.  Now the market is going through a period of consolidation, with the possibility that we can get a substantial rebound." He sees last week's low of 616.50 as an important support area for the S&P. The NASDAQ index should likewise find support around the 30300 to 30500 level.<p>
"Those levels are important to me," he explained, "As long as we can hold above them short term it looks like the market overall can continue to rebound. But my oscillators show the market bouncing between oversold and overbought very quickly, so that means big up and big down days." <p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>For the time being, it's a stock picker's market.</font></b><p><p>
A rebound doesn't necessarily mean a new bull market. Chronowitz is watching the Dow utility and transportation indices closely. "These are currently lagging the rally and I need them to join in order to adopt a much more positive outlook," he notes. But even if they joined, it would not guarantee new highs on other averages. For the time being, Chronowitz sees a stock picker's market.<p>
The July 16 drop in the Dow brought forth a flood of dire forecasts by famous market timers. Season their words with rock salt, dear reader. The market is doing what markets usually do, namely moving up and down as buyers and sellers both try to make money.<p>
That said, this week will be a rocky ride. July 30 is the release date for the employment cost index and wage data. On August 1, the National Association of Purchasing Management (NAPM) releases its report. Then on August 2, the employment results come out. Strong numbers will boost expectations for a Fed rate hike, send interest rates up, and probably move stock prices down at least short term.<p>

					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Is this a rally or a dive? Either way, smart stock pickers can reap rewards.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Traders are debating whether last week's big fall was the beginning of a correction, or the beginning of a bear market. Some contrarians still hold out hope for a big summer rally, but they are scarce.<p>
"It's certainly not Pamplona, that's for sure," says John Roque, a technical analyst at Lehman Brothers. He expects the market to test last week's lows again--but not right away. "We think the averages have made good temporary lows. Next week will probably be OK."  <p>
<wam-pullquote>We have either embarked on a bumpy ride to nowhere, or a lurching rally. No one is sure, quite yet, which it is.</wam-pulluote><p>
Meanwhile, he and his colleagues at Lehman expect bank stocks to do well relative to the rest of the market. In a faxed report to institutional clients last week, they noted that the Philadelphia Bank Index held fast and firm during the big selloff. The report named Northern Trust, Boatmen's, Citicorp and Bankamerica as "some of our favorites." <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>"On any spikes up, I'd be selling."</font></b><p><p>
It takes a lot of confidence to buy in a market like this one. "I really don't know what's going to happen but I'm nervous about this market and on any spikes up, I'd be selling," said one big New York trader as the market closed Friday. "It may go up before the end of the year. But for the short term I would be fleet of foot." He notes that short interest fell last week for the first time in months. When there are a lot of shorts in the market, they can hold prices up. <p>
Shorts are investors who have sold borrowed stock, expecting prices to fall. When prices do fall they buy back the stock, "covering" their shorts, and make a profit. So shorts have a good reason to buy as prices fall--and their demand can keep prices from falling too far, too fast. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>At these prices, investors can find bargains.</font></b><p><p>
But at Bankers Trust Company, chief trader Anthony Conroy says that it's a stock pickers' market. "Wednesday saw some stocks at crash levels. A lot of companies have been cut in half. <a name="NYSE:ANN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14959"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ann Taylor Stores</b></a> traded at $23, and is down to $11. In technology and the OTC arena, some stocks are just decimated," he says. He doesn't expect a major recovery anytime soon, and looks to see the Dow trade in a range between 5200-5600. <p>
But at these prices, investors can find bargains. Melissa Brown, quantitative analyst at Prudential Securities, expects positive earnings surprises from six small-cap companies this week: <a name="NASD:AMMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12702"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AMRESCO INC.</b></a>, <a name="NASD:ASFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16617"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Astoria Financial</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:COG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10592"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cabot Oil & Gas</b></a>, <a name="NASD:DYTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13249"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dynatech Corp.</b></a>, <a name="NASD:IVCR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13827"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invacare Corp.</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:MNTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14077"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mentor Corp.</b></a> One measure of their quality is the fact that their prices have held rather firm when others were falling. Bargains, of course, can come in many different forms. <p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Two numbers make the case for a short-term market rally.</font></b><p><p>
Can a case be made for a major market rally in the short term? Yes, says Michael Oyster of the Investment Research Institute in Cincinnatti. "We're still pretty positive even after today's pullback," he said Friday. "There's a big opportunity for investors to benefit from the recovery." Oyster's favorite numbers are the volatility index at the Chicago Board Options Exchange, and the put-call ratio.<p>
The volatility index, or VIX, is a measure of how turbulent prices are. It closed above 20 on July 16 and 17, then dropped down again. "Historically, that has preceded pretty strong rallies in the short term," Oyster explains. Since 1986, the earliest year for which the VIX is calculated, this pattern of closing above 20 and dropping back has only occurred 50 times. This is what happened on average to the S&P 100 OEX index in the weeks following such a peak and fallback in volatility:
<b>
<pre>
5 days after peak-fall, up (on average) 0.7%
10 days after, up 1.3%
15 days after, up 1.6%
20 days after, up 1.7% 
25 days after, up 1.9%
</pre></b><p>
Oyster also sees a bullish signal in the put/call ratio, which hit 0.86 last week. This is the ratio of individual equity put options to individual equity call options. Since investors buy put options on stocks in order to protect themselves against, or profit from, a drop in the stock price, a high put/call ratio means lots of pessimism in the market. That is a positive sign for contrarian investors. Oyster says the put/call ratio hasn't been close to this level since October 11, 1990, when it hit 0.85. Here's what happened to the S&P 100 OEX index:
<b>
<pre>
 5 days later, up 3.7%
10 days later, up 5.5%
15 days later, up 4.5%
20 days later, up 4.3%
25 days later, up 7.6%
</pre></b><p>
If that historical pattern repeats itself, the Dow would be around 5800 in a month.<p>
Oyster cautions that there are some differences between 1990 and the present. For example, in 1990, the Fed was lowering interest rates to drag the country out of recession. Now, all debate is over the question of whether the Fed will raise interest rates, and by how much. But he does believe that these indicators point to a big rally just ahead.<p>

The data is mixed, though. While the put/call ratio on individual equities is high, the put/call ratio of options on the OEX itself is not particularly high. That is what keeps some analysts from joining Oyster in his bullish mood. "My reading tells me that people are unsure about individual equities, but they're not buying puts on the OEX. So I don't  think the put/call numbers say we're going to move one way or another," Lehman's John Roque said.<p>
This kind of confusion and disagreement is what makes a market, of course. We have either embarked on a bumpy ride to nowhere, or a lurching rally. No one is sure, quite yet, which it is. In the meantime, stock pickers can reap rewards--provided they can tell the difference between a bargain stock and a broken one. <p>

					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>This week could be the critical moment for the market.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Over the past two weeks, we've seen shocks that ought to have made things very clear. So why are the experts so puzzled?<p>
Back in February, when almost everyone else in the market thought the economy was in recession, one man told me another story. Paul DaRosa, president of Eastbridge Capital in New York, said what looked like a recession was really a mid-cycle slowdown, and the economy  was about to roar back, and interest rates would be going up instead of down. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
"People waiting for a slowdown sound like they're waiting for a repeat of the Virgin Birth."<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Events proved him correct. DaRosa trades bonds. Though this has been a so-so year for bonds, it's been a good year for his firm. <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>What is supporting the market?</font></b><p><p>
I decided to check back with him because of the strange way the bond market has been acting. Bond traders, not the Fed, are primarily responsible for determining interest rates. Interest rates of course affect the stock market, the mortgage market, the currency market, in short, everything and everybody. The data on jobs and wages, combined with the Fed's decision to do nothing at its last meeting, ought to have sent bonds down much farther than they've gone. What is supporting the market?<p>
DaRosa says that bond traders are now split into two camps. One camp says the economy is already slowing down, partly because interest rates have been rising since February. If they're right, the Fed won't need to hike rates in August, and we can look forward to falling interest rates in the second half of the year.<p>
The second camp says that the interest rate rises we've seen so far can't slow the economy down. Interest rates have gone up simply because demand for money has gone up. They're a second-hand consequence of economic growth, and won't of themselves cause a slowdown. Only the Fed can do that.<p>
And what does Darosa think? "I'm a little skeptical about seeing a spontaneous weakening," he says, "People waiting for a slowdown sound like they're waiting for a repeat of the Virgin Birth."<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Greenspan is spending one of his credibility chips.</font></b><p><p>
A lot of bond investors were uncomfortable about Alan Greenspan's decision not to raise rates at the July FOMC meeting. "He has a lot of credibility chips in his pile, but he's clearly spending one now," DaRosa notes. <p>
Greenspan of course testifies before Congress on Thursday of this week, and somewhere in his Delphic pronunciamentos there may be a murky clue to what he thinks. For his part, though, DaRosa expects to see the Fed raise interest rates a modest 25 basis points in August.  (Note: A basis point is one-hundredth of a percent.) <p>
What will that mean for stocks? It will probably be good for the market. "Stocks have displayed a real allergy to inflation," DaRosa says. When inflation is up, the market goes down. The three worst stock market years of recent memory were 1972-'73, 1979-'80, and 1987-'88.  All inflationary years.<p>
Nick Sargen, an economist with JP Morgan's private client group, says that his group is offering clients three pieces of advice about the current market: 1) look for pockets of opportunity, 2) buy protection, and 3) consider the benefits of international diversification.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The pickup in the economy is not necessarily good for corporate earnings.</font></b><p><p>
It's not altogether clear that last week's tech stock carnage will spread to the overall market. Sargen notes that the Dow and the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index are still only about 4 percent to 5 percent below their peaks for the year. <p>
But the bad news from Hewlett-Packard and Motorola Inc. showed that the pickup in the economy is not necessarily good for corporate earnings. Intel's earnings release this week, and Microsoft's next week, could either confirm or contradict that picture.<p>
Technicians point out that the market is getting closer to it's 200 day moving average. Crossing that line signals that the price trend has reversed from rising to falling -- and that the market is correcting.  <p>
In sum, this week could be the critical moment for the market.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>No one was expecting bad news last Friday when the payroll numbers came in.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Friday was not a good day for bad news. The New York Stock Exchange had planned for a light, half-day of trading before an early afternoon close on a day of no news. <p>
If there were going to be news, it was reasonable to expect it would have come before the holiday. The real event of the week, after all, had been the Fed meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday. But the Fed had surprised no one by doing nothing. That was no news. The market had already decided long before that the Fed would not need to raise interest rates. Even before the Fed had finished doing nothing on Wednesday, people were taking off for four-day weekends at mountains and beaches. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
"The economy is moving too fast for the Fed's comfort," says a trader on the NYSE floor who predicted the Dow's dive.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
So no one was expecting news on Friday. Especially not this news.<p>
When the payroll numbers hit desks early Friday morning, there was no doubt that the market would move down. One trader called me a few minutes after the report was out to predict a Dow down one hundred points at the opening bell. "The economy is moving too fast for the Fed's comfort," he said, "People are even  talking about the Fed raising interest rates in an intermediate move, before the August meeting." His prediction was only slightly off. In the first few minutes of trading, the Dow was down 50, and it finished the short day down 114. 88.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>By tomorrow the impact of Friday's report will become clear.</font></b><p><p>
But that's not the end of the story. Because so many portfolio managers were away for the long weekend, sources on the NYSE floor said that the real shakeout would come on Monday and Tuesday of this week. The real impact of the Friday report won't be clear until midweek. But it's a safe bet that stocks won't be surging up and only a slightly less safe bet that they'll be heading farther south.<p>
Expectations of interest rate hikes tend to be self-fulfilling. Whether the Fed raises short term rates or not, the bond traders will demand higher interest rates to protect themselves against inflation risk on long-term bonds. Those higher market rates will be a drag on the stock market, at the very least. Many investors will prefer a high guaranteed return on a bond to a somewhat riskier return on stocks, and move their money from stocks to bonds. Lower demand for stocks means lower stock prices. Traders will anticipate all of this well before the money moves, so prices will be adjusting today and tomorrow.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Pacific Scientific is one stock that was pushed too high and fell too low.</font></b><p><p>
Here's the silver lining to a cloudy market. As the cold wind of rational expectations blows, it strips the rosy fog off the prospects of hot speculative stocks. In some cases it strips off more fog than there really is.<p>
Consider the case of <a name="NYSE:PSX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11146"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pacific Scientific</b></a> (PSX), a stock that ran up to $27 before tumbling recently to around $12. Excessive optimism about a new product, a dimmer for fluorescent lights, sent it up. But the company ran into some problems bringing the new product to market. Now the pessimism is almost as excessive as the optimism was. "If this goes to $11, it's time to mortgage your house and buy," one knowledgeable source, not a broker, not an employee, told me last week. "Between $12 and $13 you've got value, but it's the value of the company, not the froth."<p>
I don't make stock recommendations, but PSX seems to be a good example of a stock pushed too high that then fell too low. When the price fell to $12 1/8 on Wednesday, Richard V. Plat, the company's CFO, bought some more to add to his personal holdings of about a quarter-million shares. "The book value of the stock is $8.90, and if we make 5 percent just on our base business of $300 million, it's $15 million. We have 12.5 million shares out, that's $1.20 per share. I'm not making a prediction but we should be able to do better than 5 percent," he told me. <p>
Broken stocks like PSX can offer bargains--but don't rush to buy. Check the numbers carefully, and watch this market shake out first. <p>

					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Will the Fed follow Japan's lead in a decision not to raise interest rates? Who cares?</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Mark your calendars. This is an important week--a historic week, even. For this is the week that the Fed's monetary policy mavens will deliberate and pronounce on the interest rate question. The prospect of this week has been the single most important force in the stock market for months. Fears of an interest rate hike cowed bulls, baited bears, and became the default explanation for every market move.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The very week of traders' nightmares is upon us. The week the Fed deliberates and pronounces on the interest rate question.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Were prices up? Fears of the Fed had eased. Down? The market feared a rate increase in July--at this week's meeting.<p>
Now that the very week of traders' nightmares is upon us, do they wring their hands anxiously, and bemoan this fateful moment? Nay, nay, dear reader. For the anxious market has turned its fickle eyes to other terrors. As to the Fed meeting--who cares? Not Anthony Conroy, managing director and head trader at Bankers Trust. "The market is expecting a non-event," he says, "If they do anything, it's going to be light."<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>After Japan's decision not to raise interest rates, traders are expecting the Fed to keep any increases low.</font></b><p><p>
The market has found encouragement in the East. "If anyplace at all had an incentive to raise rates," says Conroy, "it was Japan, and they did nothing." Japan's decision not to tighten has an immediate impact on the Fed's decision making. In a global market, capital seeks the most attractive returns. If the Japanese had raised rates, the Fed would have had some leeway to move. But the Japanese did not raise rates. So the Fed has less elbow room. The market has built in expectations of the Fed staying in bounds, with a rate increase of 25 basis points or less. "Fifty or more would be bad for stocks," says Conroy. But 25 is a non-event.<p>
Of course, the Fed only controls short-term rates, and it's long-term rates that matter most for stocks. As long-term rates have risen, Conroy has noticed some outflow of funds from stocks into bonds, and from the speculative technology stocks into big, well established names. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Globally, U.S. stocks are attractive.</font></b><p><p>
However, in the global capital market, U.S. stocks still look very attractive compared to Europe and Japan. Ian Scott, European Strategist with  Lehman Brothers in London, says, "The U.S. market no longer looks as cheap as at the start of this year, and bonds have gone up, but we still maintain an overweight position in the U.S."<p>
Lehman's model portfolio is underweight on Europe and neutral onJapan. Lehman's pricing model takes the trailing dividend yield and divides it by the bond yield in each country. The resulting number gives a sense of the relationship between stock and bond prices. "European markets are trading on relatively low yields which in the past have been associated with low returns going forward," he explains.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>In Japan. share prices have been stimulated by the highest first-quarter GDP in two decades.</font></b><p><p>
Meanwhile, in Japan, the market has been pleasantly stimulated by the highest first-quarter GDP growth numbers seen in more than 20 years. "Theoretically, higher GDP growth means good news and bad news for the stock market at the same time," says Nikko's Hideyuki Omakawa in Tokyo. "Increased corporate profits would be welcomed while a likely interest rate hike is definitely a negative. But share prices seem to have taken the news as positive this time."<p>
However, no one doubts that an interest rate hike will be in the cards in the not too distant future. As long as there was some doubt about Japan's recovery from recession and deflation, the government could pressure the Bank of Japan to keep interest rates low. <p>
Reason: Japan's high deficits mean that the government can't do much to stimulate the economy through fiscal means. The high GDP figures show that there's no need now for any stimulus. But both the Bank of Japan and the government have been busily reassuring the country that no monetary policy change is necessary at this time.<p>
Bottom line: Savvy investors in the U.S. markets will watch Japan for some clues to possible Fed action.<p>

						What a week it was! The market action is confusing even the most experienced traders. "Everybody was afraid of the Fed raising interest rates in July, now they're saying there won't be any rate increase in July, but maybe August, or maybe not at all," says one old hand, a trader for a major New York bank. The seasonal summer slowdown in volume could be a problem, he says. "We haven't been busy, and low volume is like slow death, stocks can just unwind."<p>
Nonetheless he expects a rally that will push the market up a couple of hundred points over the next two or three weeks. "This market wants to move up," he says.<p>
Bob Rack, research director for the Investment Research Institute, saw strongly bullish signals in the put-call ratio--the ratio of put options to call options. (Puts are the right to sell a stock, calls the right to buy one.) "We just registered a put-call ratio of 0.94. That means there are almost as many puts as calls," Rack says.<p>

<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
"Historically when that has happened, the market has gone up on average 2 percent over the next 20 days, almost double the usual market return," he explains. Usually, there are far fewer puts than calls. When the volume of puts goes up, Rack says it's a contrarian indicator. "It means we have excessive fear in the market as people think this is the end of a run and rush out to buy puts. When fear reaches that level it's a good buying opportunity," he notes. (For more from the Investment Research Institute, check out their <a href="http://www.options-iri.com">Web page</a>.)<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>There's good news in the bad news.</font></b><p><p>
John L. Manley Jr., equity strategist at <a name="AMEX:SBT"></a><b>Smith Barney</b>, also sees good news in the bad news. "The problems we're all aware of, such as high values and deterioration of earnings, will cause a correction but not for a while. Why not? Because we're all aware of them, they're not things we need to deal with now. Values are high but could stay high for 10 years. We are seeing small stocks come down sharply. That says we haven't reached the sustained peak and excesses that usually mark the top of a bull market, so we'll probably do well between now and the election. In this century, there's never been a bad market in the U.S. in the six months going into an election." <p>
Manley recommends conservative sector bets, health stocks and tobacco for example. He also likes <a name="NYSE:CAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Conagra</b></a>, which has recently restructured and is trying to get back to a 14 percent growth rate. His stance is based on the expectation of a slowing economy over the next six to twelve months. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Recession? Not until the next millennium.</font></b><p><p>
A recent report from Lehman Brothers says the economic expansion could continue until after the millennium. "I expect this expansion has better than a 50-50 shot of lasting three to five more years," says David Kelly, a senior economist at the firm. "If we get five more years then it's the middle of 2001 before we hit a recession."<p>
Kelly's analysis shows that the economy of the 1990's is more stable than those of the '70's or '80's. There are three reasons why. Thanks to deregulation of banks and interest rates, the housing market is no longer governed by a boom-bust cycle. Meanwhile, information technology has helped corporations learn to manage their inventories better. Finally, different parts of the economy that used to move together now move independently. <p>
So instead of getting a simultaneous crash in housing, inventories and autos, we get separate little busts in each sector. The economy works more like a diversified investment portfolio. And speaking of investment portfolios, if Kelly is right it means very good news for cyclical stocks. "If the business cycle is less significant now than in the past, then cyclical stocks are less risky than in the past. But often, cyclical stock prices incorporate an expectation that earnings will go down when recession hits. If a recession is less likely maybe those stocks are undervalued," Kelly explains.<p>

						There's no time like the present for a quick refresher course on shorting.<p>
"People are nervous about the whole market, and watching rates like a hawk," says one veteran New York trader. So there's no time like the present for a quick refresher course on shorting, with some nice prospective shorts to consider.<p>
Shorting means selling something you don't have but promise to deliver in the future. Shorts expect prices to fall. They sell at today's prices and buy at tomorrow's, hopefully lower, prices. In the stock market, shorting usually means borrowing shares from one investor to sell them to another, but with the obligation to deliver equivalent shares to the lender at some future time.<p>

<p>
Shorting is getting more attractive to individual investors, both as a way of protecting their portfolio and as a way of profitably investing in the downside of markets. Short investors in semiconductor stocks have been reaping rich rewards over the past week. Goldman Sachs helped send Micron farther south by cutting the earnings estimate. Meanwhile, the book to bills numbers for the sector came out last week and showed orders continuing below last quarter's level. This means that these companies will show slowing earnings.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>How to identify good shorts.</font></b><p><p>
Among the tech stock shorts was Christopher May of TLB Partners in New York City. May uses shorts as a leg of a strategy that helped him deliver over 100 percent returns to his investors in 1995. His approach is unusual if not unique. He doesn't particularly care about the overall market outlook, or about the fundamental business in which companies are involved. He uses chaos and fractal analysis to identify non-random price movements in securities. If the stock prices are moving up in a mathematically persistent pattern, he buys, and if down, he sells or shorts. <p>
On Friday, May shorted <a name="NASD:KMAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13912"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>KOMAG (KMAG)</b></a> and <a name="NASD:CUBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17270"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>C-Cube Microsystems (CUBE)</b></a>. "They hit a statistical trigger, prices were going down and the Hurst was going up, so the time series was becoming persistent, the system was becoming less random, therefore more predictable and the direction of prediction was down," he explains.<p>
Of course, that's not the only way to identify good investments on the short side. At the <a name="FUND:HRSMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRSMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Small Cap Contrarian Fund</b></a>, trader Kevin Clark outlined more conventional reasons for shorting these retailers: <a name="NASD:FEET"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17144"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Just For Feet (FEET)</b></a> and the <a name="NASD:DLTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dollar Tree Stores (DLTR)</b></a>. "Just For Feet trades at 64.9 times 1997 estimated earnings. For a retailer we think it's ridiculous. Granted, the company is growing fast. But  one hiccup and it will come apart," he explains. And Dollar Tree? "Insiders have been selling a lot. And at 43 times trailing twelve month earnings, we think it's rich." <p>
Clark says the fund tries to pair shorts with longs. The longs corresponding to these shorts are <a name="NASD:UNIV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10055"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chicos FAS Inc. (CHCS)</wamco> and <wam-co NASD:UNIV>Universal International (UNIV)</b></a>.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>How to short the market.</font></b><p><p>
You don't have to short individual stocks to make money or hedge. If you expect the overall market to go down, you can short SPDRS at the American Stock Exchange. These are shares in a trust that owns the S&P 500 stocks and moves with that index. SPDRS are one convenient way for individual investors to cover their bets when the market actually begins to slide. SEC rules forbid shorting most stocks  as they are falling, but SPDRS are exempt from this rule. "You can short SPDRS in a free falling market," says Jay Baker, managing director of derivative securities at the AMEX.<p>
Meanwhile, several score of options products traded at the CBOE and AMEX allow investors to short not only individual stocks and the overall market but also sectors like technology and health care. More on those in future columns.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>On the international front, copper goes south.</font></b><p><p>
Fraud and skullduggery shook the international financial markets last week. A bond theft scandal in the Russian financial markets left Western investors with $100 million in losses. That news paled beside the sudden exposure of $1.8 billion of losses hidden by a Sumitomo copper trader in London. Regulators, bankers and investors are huddling to avert a global meltdown in the copper market.<p>
Apparently Sumitomo's trader, Yasuo Hamanaka, had single-handedly propped up the international copper price through his long positions. Now that the news of his unsustainable losses is out, the copper price has only one way to go--down. The news can only delight investors in the Quantum and Tiger hedge funds. Those funds, run by George Soros and Julian Robertson respectively, had shorted copper in a mano a mano duel with Hamanaka.

						The market is paying more attention to bad news than good.<p>
Consider the roller coaster the market rode Friday. Good news about jobs implied bad news to come about interest rates and sent the Dow down 87 points by lunchtime. As everyone knows though, the Dow regained all that lost ground to close up almost 30 points for the day, or a little over half a percentage point. What comes next?<p>
Consider Friday's volatile trading a warning. That's the word from Edgar Peters, a portfolio manager at Panagora Asset Management in Boston and author of several books on using the mathematics of chaos and fractals to analyze the financial markets. Peters is expecting the market to become more sensitive to bad news, more volatile, and likelier to fall than rise in the next few weeks. "This usually happens when long-term investors become uncertain and stop playing the game," he says. "When the market is in this state it means it is susceptible to shocks from bad news." Peters says that volume is down considerably. So with fewer players in the market, and those players edgy, the market is paying more attention to bad news than good.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Fridays yo-yo Dow is one indication that no one knows what will be good news and what will be bad news in this market.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Consider what sent the market down Friday morning. News that job growth had been better than anyone expected means two things: 1) earnings will probably be better than anyone expected, and 2) interest rates will probably go up, and certainly won't go down. Now, there are lots of fundamental economic analyses of relationships between earnings, interest rates, and stock prices and they're not unimportant. But in a day-to-day trading situation, the market is purely a psychological game. Traders are trying to figure out how other traders are going to react.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>There will be near-term trouble for investors who are long in this market.</font></b><p><p>
Friday's yo-yo Dow is one indication that no one really knows what will be good news and what will be bad news in this market.<p>
This uncertainty means near-term trouble for people who are long in this market. "We'll probably have some sort of blowoff," Peters says. "I don't anticipate it will be a bear market, certainly not a crash, but at this point even if we had a 10 percent correction it's almost 600 points on the Dow."<p>
Harry Roth, an options strategist at Cowan and Company in New York, also expects the market to fall. Why? Put options, which represent the right to sell stocks and are a way to go short, have been running about 30 to 35 percent of the volume of calls. That's low. It means there are too few bears in the market. "When people aren't interested in buying puts, it means the market is too high and there's too much complacency," he says. Like a good contrarian, Roth thinks the market will go down over the next two weeks.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>If the market goes down, here are four stocks to short.</font></b><p><p>
If the market does go down, shorts will make money. I asked David Tice, manager of The <a name="FUND:BEARX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BEARX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Prudent Bear fund</b></a>, for his favorite shorts. In terms of sectors, he thinks money can be made by shorting high technology and consumer credit stocks. <p>
According to Tice, specific stocks to short are: <a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Micron Technologies</b></a>, on grounds that the memory market is collapsing; <a name="NASD:KLIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13915"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kulicke and Soffa</b></a>, a maker of semiconductor manufacturing equipment, on grounds that the semiconductor industry already has a capacity glut; <a name="NYSE:FUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15687"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First USA</b></a>, the consumer credit card company, on grounds explained in great detail in my article in the current issue of Worth; and <a name="NASD:IOMG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13832"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Iomega</b></a>, on grounds that it is ridiculously overvalued.

						<font size=4><b><i></i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						The S&P hit an all time high just a week ago. Then it dropped back slightly. So where is it going from here?<p>
Jack Schwager heads up the futures research area at Prudential Securities. He says that last week's trading action looks like a classic bull trap. In a bull trap, the market sets a new high then moves to another even higher high. Then, instead of continuing up, it falls back down. <p>
As Schwager reads the charts, last Monday's high can't be sustained. After hitting it, the market spent several days without going up or down decisively, trading sideways, but edging a little lower each day. That's bad news for bulls. "For now, I would be bearish," Schwager says, "I would take an even money bet the market will gap lower Monday."<p>
The drop could be merely a short term retreat that lasts a week or two. On the other hand, it might be more significant--perhaps the beginning of the major market correction that professionals have been predicting, expecting, and fearing for months. For now, Schwager says he's comfortable being long--but not too comfortable.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Are we headed for a short-term retreat, or the start of the major market correction the pros have been predicting?<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
At Lehman Brothers, technical analyst Stephen Shobin thinks
the bull market still has a long way to run. Among other factors, he likes the fact that when the S&P hit its new high, bellwether stock <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric (GE)</b></a> also reached an all time high. "If GE had failed to reach an all time high, that would be a suggestion that something was awry," he explains. A bellwether is a stock that analysts watch to double-check their conclusions about the market. In order for conclusions to be solid, the market and the bellwether must both send the same signals. For now, they are.<p>
Watch out for interest rates, though. If the long bond yield gets much above 7 percent, it will mean trouble for stocks. There's a fundamental explanation for this: When investors can get a high risk-free return in treasuries, they take money out of stock and put it in bonds. But the fundamental economics are secondary. In fact, higher interest rates will be a problem for the market simply because every analyst, trader, and investor expects them to be. If the long bond tests the 7.25 percent level, people will sell stocks because they fear that others are about to sell stocks. And stocks will go down.<p>
What does all of this mean to you, as you blink at your screen?<p>
For young investors in the market for the long haul, it makes
sense to simply ride out the storm. The market could take years to recover from a sharp drop, but if you can wait years, that's no problem. For older investors, close to retirement, hedge your bets on the U.S. stock market. <a name="NYSE:JPM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10812"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>JP Morgan</b></a> is advising private clients to either hedge or take 5 to 10 percent of their funds out of the stock market. Then what? Either keep it in cash money market instruments or invest it in international stocks, particularly European and emerging market equities. The bond market is simply too risky now.

					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i></i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						One hundred years ago today, a Wall Street news sheet began to publish the average stock price of several railroad and industrial stocks. The computation was perfectly suited to an age that had barely seen the invention of the hand-cranked adding machine, let alone the computer. Anyone with a pencil and paper could figure the average by adding up the prices of the stocks at the end of each trading day and dividing.<p>
Charles Dow, who invented this market indicator, believed that investors who paid careful attention to price movements could "beat the market" by timing their investment decisions correctly. Dow's successors devised a whole theory of investing based on fluctuations of the Dow Jones Average, popularly known as "Dow Theory."<p>
A century later, many things have changed. Dow's news sheet has evolved into The Wall Street Journal. The stock markets are much bigger and more complex. Nobel prizes have been awarded to economists for proving that price changes in stocks are random and unpredictable, so that beating the market as Dow suggested is all but impossible. Dow theory is no more than a historical curiosity.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The Dow Jones average stubbornly endures,  even though it no longer provides much information about the stock market.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Yet the Dow Jones average stubbornly endures. Even though it is no longer as easy to calculate. Even though it is no longer a simple average. Even though it  no longer provides much information about the stock market.<p>
"The day-to-day fluctuation in the Dow is meaningless. It's random. Yet every night on the news they tell you the Dow, like this is something you can judge things by," says Mark Cunningham, a money manager with <a name="NYSE:OCC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41946"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oppenheimer</b></a> in New York.<p>
Consider this. The Dow Jones Industrial Average now contains only 30 stocks out of the more than 7,000 traded on various exchanges in the United States. What's more, it gives the most weight to the highest priced stocks, not the most highly capitalized. So the daily moves in the Dow not only don't tell us much about the overall market, but also, what they do tell us may have nothing to do with the overall market.<p>
For example, last week, news from Iraq sent oil prices up, and oil company stock prices with them. The 30 stocks in the Dow include three oil stocks. The jump in oil stock prices alone was enough to send the Dow up to a new record high. On Thursday, as the Financial Times reported, good news for <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> sent that stock up far enough to trim the Dow's 50 point loss to a mere 16 points.<p>
The Dow is eccentric, to say the least. In fact, the Dow often moves in opposite directions from broader indexes.  <p>
No wonder that professional investors are reluctant to put their money on the Dow. Robert Waid, a senior associate with the Santa Monica based financial consulting firm Wilshire Associates says "Many people who only get their financial information from the news media think the Dow is important, but I don't know any people who've hired managers for performance fees to beat the Dow. For every other index, there's somebody being paid on a performance basis to beat it--but not the Dow." <p>
Despite the Dow's shortcomings, it has established such a firm position in the popular imagination that it's unlikely to go away soon. And as long as we keep a few facts in mind, there's no reason why it should.   <p>
Fact one: With the Dow above 5700, a 50 point drop or rise isn't what it used to be. So think in percentage terms, not in point terms.<p>
Fact two: The Dow is an entertaining anachronism, irrelevant for most investment purposes. Investing to "Beat the Dow" is silly.<p>
Fact three: Broad market indexes like the S&P, the Wilshire 5000, and the Russell 2000 are the numbers to watch for real information about the stock market.<p>
Anyway, happy birthday, Dow.

						Last week, the American Stock Exchange began to trade call warrants on a group of technology stocks. Buyers of the warrants get a piece of the action if this basket of stocks goes up in value during the next two years. If history is any guide, there will surely be more such warrants trading soon at the AMEX and other exchanges. So, how do they work?<p>
Warrants are similar to options. An option is the right to buy or sell something at a fixed price during some set period of time. Call options give the holder the right to buy, put options the right to sell. These rights are bought and sold. For ordinary purposes, the option gives an investor the chance to profit whether stocks go up or down. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The new AMEX call warrants allow investors to make a risk-controlled play on the tech sectors future.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Suppose you buy a call option that gives you the right to buy a
stock for a dollar, and the stock then goes up to two dollars, you should be able to sell that right for something close to two dollars. If on the other hand you have a put option that gives you the right to sell a stock for two dollars, and the market price of the stock falls to one dollar, you should be able to sell the put option for something close to two dollars. <p>
So you have all of the gains of actually buying or shorting stocks, but the option price is much lower than the stock price. And if the stock moves the wrong way, the investor's loss is limited to the price of the option. So the option allows investors to capture profits whether a stock moves up or down while limiting losses.<p>
The new warrants at the AMEX are call warrants on the Lehman Select Technology Stock Index. This Index includes 23 stocks from the following technology sectors: software, semiconductor, computer, electronic equipment, telecom equipment, and office equipment. At introduction, the value of the index was set at 100. On May 15, 1998, the value of the index will be calculated. It's not a complicated calculation. Each stock accounts for approximately 4.3 percent of the index. Adding and subtracting the price change on each stock in the two years the warrants have been in force will give a number that will be greater or less than 100. Each warrant holder will receive a payment equal to 1/4 the increase in value of the index. (The stocks in the index are listed at the end of this column.)<p>
By the way, don't rush to buy these or any other warrants on issue. Unless you have a PhD in math from MIT and a Sun workstation or two to run pricing programs. The mathematics of pricing options and warrants is what brought hundreds of nuclear physicists and astronomers to Wall Street over the past decade. It's not simple. As a rule, ordinary Joe investors should wait until these instruments have been trading for a few weeks. By then, professionals will have arbitraged away the most extreme pricing inefficiencies and anomalies and you'll get what you're after--a risk-controlled play on the tech sector's future.<p>
On other subjects, interest rates have been the talk of the markets in the U.S. and in Japan over the past week. In the U.S., the debate continues over whether the economy is overheating or merely doing well. However the debate at the moment seems to favor the unalarmed. Low to moderately low inflation forecasts dominate, and that's good for interest rates.<p>
In Japan, a fall in yen interest rates sent the stock market up. The fall in rates puzzled some, because Japanese central bank officials have been making public statements about the desirability of higher rates. But Hideyuki Omakawa of Nikko Securities in Tokyo explains, "Money traders aren't stupid. After following Mr. Matsushita's wobbling steps in the last several weeks, they finally started to think that BOJ is only playing a game with the market, and has little intention of raising interest rates soon."<p>

						The interest rate window is closed. In fact, it never really opened. Regular readers remember the hopeful window scenario outlined by our economic sources two weeks ago. To recap briefly, the weak May jobs report would convince the bond market that the economy wasn't growing as fast as traders feared. Consequently bond prices would rise, interest rates fall.<p>
Lower interest rates would answer the prayers of mortgage borrowers and would probably help the stock market too. <p>
Well, the jobs report came in weaker than anyone expected, showing a net gain of only two thousand jobs last month. The market all but ignored the favorable news, focusing instead on a very slight rise in hourly raises (six-tenths of one percent) and on the May 2 GDP report that showed the economy growing at a sizzling 2.8 percent in the first quarter. Instead of falling, interest rates rose, and the stock market began to slide.<p>
Interest rates matter to all investors of course. But they matter to mortgage borrowers especially. What should they do now? Economists who follow the mortgage market are split on the interest rate outlook, but they offer remarkably similar advice to borrowers. <p>

<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Eileen Neely, senior economist at Fannie Mae, expects interest rates to fall slightly later in the year, winding up at 7.6 to 7.7 percent by year end. David Lereah, chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association, is more pessimistic. "My outlook for near term is upward pressure on rates. I expect the Fed to come in and tighten, raising short term rates in the July meeting," he says. Lereah also sees rates falling slightly after that, ending the year at about 8 percent.<p>
So what should home buyers do? The answer depends on the length of time they plan to own the house, and on their tolerance for risk. Buyers who plan to stay in their homes for awhile have nothing to lose if they lock in at current rates. The lows we saw in February aren't likely to return, but current rates are still low by historical standards. Moreover, refinancing is cheap and easy, just in case interest rates surprise everyone by falling steeply.<p>
Lereah recommends that borrowers with a shorter horizon look at a "three-one" mortgage. These offer rates about a quarter of a percentage point below a 30 year mortgage. They lock in a rate for the first three years, then change to a floating rate mortgage. Both Neely and Lereah say that the annually adjusted floating rate mortgages are risky propositions at present.<p>
What does the interest rate outlook mean for the stock market? Low rates and expectations of Fed ease in the first quarter helped stock prices up in December, January, and February. When interest rate expectations shifted, stocks took a dive. Now the market is pricing in expectations of a Fed tightening in July. Near term, expect a tug of war between the hopes implicit in a high growth economy, and fear of the Fed.

						Are you getting what you pay for from your mutual fund? Probably not, according to a recent study.<p>
One big reason investors buy mutual funds is to get the benefit of professional management. But the average professional money manager under performs the market, according to a new study by Martin Gruber, chairman of the finance department at New York University's Stern School of Business.<p>
Gruber found that professional management on average does more harm than good. He started out trying to determine why mutual funds, especially actively managed funds, have grown so rapidly when their performance on average lags behind index funds. (Index funds don't try to beat the market, they just try to track the market by buying a representative sample of securities in an index--like the S&P, the Morgan Stanley EAFE, or the Wilshire 5000--and holding them.)<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
According to a new mutual fund study,  the worst performers charged the highest management fees.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Along the way, Gruber turned up some surprising facts. Most important is his discovery that past performance can indeed predict future results. So investors who put money in funds that performed well in the past can beat the market. <p>
But handle this insight with caution. "It doesn't mean that investors should buy the fund that did well last in the past," Gruber emphasizes. "What I found is that a group of firms that do well one year are more likely to do well than poorly in the future. But buying the top fund doesn't guarantee you'll get the best performance next year."<p>
A small group of sophisticated investors apparently understands this already. They invest in funds actively--moving their money often in search of the best performance. And they make money at the game. In fact, Gruber found that sophisticated investors can even beat index funds.<p>
But not by much--on average, the strategy of actively investing in top performing funds only yields a quarter to a half percent a year more than mere indexing. Moreover, the active strategy is risky, and the passive is virtually risk free. Is a third of a percentage point worth the risk? "There's no answer," says Gruber. "It depends on the individual."<p>
Interestingly, Gruber also found that investors who pay extra for professional management not only don't get what they pay for, but sometimes get the opposite. Investors in load funds do worse than investors in no-load funds. And of the 270 funds he studied, the worst performers charged the highest management fees.<p>
Index fund investors also have to watch fees carefully. They can pay as little as 0.17 percent or as much as 1.25 percent. Since index funds merely track the market, investors who pay high fees get no more for their money than investors who pay low fees.<p>
Gruber's study, entitled "Another Puzzle: The Growth in Actively Managed Mutual Funds," will be published in the "Journal of Finance" in July.

						A window of opportunity for mortgage borrowers may begin to open later this week. Some economists expect the April jobs report, due out on Friday, to show weaker job growth and a slower economy than the February and March reports indicated. "That will rally the bond market and the bond market rally in turn will lower mortgage rates," says Evelina Tainer, chief economist at Indosuez Carr Futures in Chicago.<p>
Eileen Neely, an economist with the mortgage finance agency Fannie Mae in Washington, also expects mortgages rates to go lower. She  says that rates on 30 year fixed rate mortgages are unlikely to reach February's bottom of 6.94 percent, but she expects to see long term fixed mortgages available at 7.50 percent by mid summer. That's considerably better than the 8.05 percent we saw in the second week of April. In fact, rates have already begun to descend. They had eased down to 7.95 percent by the third week of April.<p>
Since questions about mortgages rates come up frequently on the "Market Week Ahead" message board, it's worth looking a little more closely at the factors that have been pushing rates up lately.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Home buyers and refinancers have little to lose if they commit to a mortgage rate.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Through the final months of 1995 and into January 1996, monthly job reports and other economic data showed the economy growing slowly. Bond traders expected the Fed to continue lowering interest rates until the economy picked up steam. That was good news for bond holders because when interest rates slip lower, higher interest rate bonds get scarcer and more valuable. <p>
The bond market is closely related to the mortgage market. In fact, through a process called securitisation, many mortgages end up being bought and sold just like bonds. Bonds and mortgages went at low interest rates to reflect the weak economic outlook.<p>
In February and March, the bond market got a couple of rude shocks. The jobs reports showed the economy growing much faster than anyone had thought. The bond traders no longer had any reason to expect lower interest rates. In fact, they began to fear inflation and the Fed's sovereign remedy for it: higher interest rates. These fears were heightened by price reports that showed dramatic jumps in commodity prices.<p>
Hopes and fears showed up quickly in bond prices. Interest rates surged. But economists like Tainer and Neely believe the market overreacted to the February and March reports. They say that the government shutdown in December, the blizzard of the century in January, and a strike at <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GM</b></a> all played havoc with the employment data. "In the first quarter we had such a slew of special factors that even looking at three months' job data  doesn't give you a good assessment of the economy," Tainer says.<p>
Evidence is now emerging to show that the economy is not in fact growing all that fast. A report on durable goods orders that came out last Thursday showed an increase of 1.4 percent. That would ordinarily indicate economic growth. But Neely says, "All of that was in transportation and defense. If somebody orders three jets from <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a>, it can skew the numbers. But if you look at non-defense capital goods, the report was unchanged in March after being down both in January and February."<p>
The bottom line is that, as usual in the market, no one is really sure what is going on. But home buyers and mortgage refinancers have little to lose if they wait for Friday's job report before they commit to a mortgage rate.

						Not since bull-shaped Jupiter abducted Europa to Crete has a horny bovine covered so much ground so fast.<p>
From Amsterdam to Zurich, almost every market in the world was up last week. German interest rate cuts performed CPR on a blue-lipped economy and the Frankfurt market twitched encouragingly. Rate cuts in Amsterdam lifted the Dutch bourse, and the mere expectation of lower interest rates in Spain sent Madrid's market to a high for the year. Meanwhile, in the Far East, Seoul's stock market hit new highs despite North Korean troop movements and war threats. <p>
But the most important news comes from Tokyo. Domestic Japanese insurance companies and pension funds have finally started to put their money into the Japanese stock market. "In the short term, Japanese stocks continue to be a good buy," says Hideyuki Omakawa of Nikko in Tokyo. "The only concern, which I point out over and over, is the possibility that the Japanese economy may lose its momentum in the latter half of this fiscal year."<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The good news is that even if the solons fail to put together a budget agreement, their failure wont hurt the market.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Two factors could take the wind out of Japan's economic sails. The government's economic stimulus package, which has driven the economic recovery, will largely be spent by mid-year. Moreover, private consumption could be dampened by a plan already approved by legislators to raise the consumption tax rate to 5 percent from the current 3 percent in April 1997.<p>
Meanwhile, in the United States, the jobs report that so shocked the market earlier this month has been fully priced in. No major reports are due for a while, and if Washington has any short-term effect on the market, it's likely to be for the better. <p>
That's not entirely good news though.<p>
This week, Republican legislators will be meeting to decide what to do about the budget. The biggest question on their minds: if a deal is struck, who will get the credit? If it looks as if the President will get credit for meeting Republicans more than halfway and resolving the budget debate in a statesmanlike fashion, don't expect the Republicans to agree to a deal. Especially if all they come away with, politically speaking, is the blame for cuts in popular programs.<p>
The good news is that even if the solons fail to put together a budget agreement, their failure won't hurt the market. The market is on the whole level headed and realistic about these things. It has already priced their failure into stocks and bonds.<p>
Suppose, on the other hand, they're able to put aside petty partisan squabbles and work together for the good of the country? "The market will act extremely favorably because that will be a surprise," says Kim Wallace, a senior political analyst with Lehman Brothers in Washington.<p>
Perhaps not coincidentally, a puzzling event in the currency markets last Thursday was noted by Miek Ballow, an analyst with Indosuez Carr Futures in Chicago. On the day that Germany's Bundesbank announced lower interest rates, the dollar fell slightly. Ordinarily, the dollar should rise if interest rates go down elsewhere. "I didn't see a good explanation for it, so I'd be nervous about being long on the dollar," he says.<p>
Here's one possible explanation: Politicians of both parties convinced the electorate and investors that the budget was a critical imperative. Then they failed to do anything about it.<p>
Investor attention has been focused on other things, notably the economic outlook. Now that the budget is coming back into focus, investors are already worrying about inflation and debating the need for Fed tightening. <p>
Well, either Fed tightening or inflation will be the only possible outcome if Congress and the President aren't able or willing to grapple with the budget. If fiscal authorities do nothing, then discipline over inflation must be exercised by monetary authorities -- the Fed -- or not at all.<p>
I'd be a little careful about the dollar, too.

						Is inflation back? That's the focus of fear for the markets now. To recap briefly, oil futures prices surged to five-year highs last week. Also, the Commodities Research Bureau index, published by Knight Ridder, was at eight year highs. Bond and stock prices fell as traders worried that the consumer price data to be released Friday would show surprising jumps in prices.<p>
The surprise Friday was that while prices were up, they weren't shockingly high. Meanwhile, Fed chairman Greenspan suggested fears were of an overheating economy were overblown. Bond prices and stock prices lifted slightly.<p>
The gods must be crazy.<p>
As recently as two weeks ago, investors could make a case that February's job statistics were an anomaly, goosed up by one-of-a-kind quirks like the furloughed bureaucrats slouching back to their cubicles after the December government shutdown and all the temporary jobs created by snow removal opportunities.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Two weeks ago, investors could make a case that Februarys job statistics were an anomaly.  No one is saying that now.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
But no one is making that argument anymore, at least not in public. Last week the frightful question was: when will the Fed raise interest rates to stem this inflationary boom?<p>
When I spoke with an equity strategist at one big European bank last week, he described his outlook with a word that no one has used since the mid-'70s -- stagflation. Roughly speaking, stagflation occurs when lots of people are out of work and everything gets more expensive. He pointed out that oil prices have gone from $13 per barrel to almost $25. Wheat and corn are also high. "I think commodities as an asset class are going to come back," he concluded.<p>
No one would be happier about this prospect than Grant Schaumburg, president of Mount Lucas Management, a commodity trading firm based in Princeton, N.J. "I would love to see it," he said. "But I can't imagine we are going to see anything like the '70s. We don't have the fundamental monetary factors, the major inflation, nor do we have the fundamental shortages we had then."<p>
The grain price increases are easily explained by the fact that government stockpiles are down, and there's a drought in the Midwest. Oil prices are tougher to account for, Schaumburg said. <p>
But Nick Sargen of <a name="NYSE:JPM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10812"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>JP Morgans</b></a> private client group pointed out that while oil prices are high, the forward market is backward. That is, the price of oil for future delivery is lower than the price of oil for delivery today. This means that oil traders are expecting prices to fall, not rise. <p>
"I'm willing to say that if the U.S. is picking up and if that sleeping giant, Japan, is picking up then there's potential for further increases in commodity prices," Sargen said. "But how realistic is the threat of inflation? My conclusion is it's overdone."<p>
The question of inflation nonetheless will set the tone of the coming week's trading.

						There's a new way to play the international markets game--and it couldn't be timelier.<p>
On March 11, Morgan Stanley and the American Stock Exchange, launched "WEBS." They were inspired by "SPDRs" (pronounced, "spiders"), which were introduced in January of 1993.<p>
Arachnophobes, fear not, SPDRs and WEBS are simply securities that allow an individual investor to buy and sell whole stock markets, instead of simply buying and selling individual stocks.<p>
They're like shares in an index fund. SPDRs--Standard & Poor's Depositary Shares--are domestic, based on the S&P stock index. WEBS--World Equity Benchmark Shares--are based on the Morgan Stanley Capital Index, and are much more interesting than SPDRs.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Eyeing emerging Asia, but dont trust China in 1997?  Now you can buy Singapore and Malaysia, and short Hong Kong.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Why? WEBS enable individual investors to do something that can't be done any other way: buy and sell countries. Seventeen countries, to be precise. And buy and sell them at market prices.<p>
When big institutions spread their money around the world, they often do so by buying a basket of stock that stands as proxy for a country's stock market. Instead of picking a few German stocks, in the hopes of beating the market, they buy the whole market on an indexed basis.<p>
That's not easy for individual investors to do. Most international mutual funds own the securities of several countries. Specialized open-end funds are rare. Moreover, when you buy or sell mutual fund shares, your transaction is priced as of the end of the trading day. So if the market happens to be declining when you decide to sell, you get the low end, not the high.<p>
Of course, closed-end funds allow you to buy into particular countries, some of them well off the beaten track, but they're usually not indexed. That means that when you buy, you get the manager's picks, for better or worse.<p>
WEBS expand your opportunity set by giving you a quick, easy way to buy or sell the following countries: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Italy, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, Netherlands, Singapore, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom.<p>
Suppose you like the prospects for emerging Asia, but don't trust China in 1997? You can buy Singapore and Malaysia, and short the Hong Kong WEBS.<p>
Though I'm no market timer, it's nice to have these new securities around now. Emerging markets stock prices ran up toward the end of last year, but since early February they've pulled back hard. The explanation: as this year opened, most investors bet their money on continued Fed easing. Low U.S. interest rates give investors a reason to look for high returns elsewhere. <p>
But the Fed didn't continue to ease. Investors who'd bought the emerging markets expecting a quick turn have sold off. That means there are good opportunities for longer term investors.<p>
Not every country is a good buy. Maryam Mansoury, emerging
market strategist at Lehman Brothers, says that there are new signs of healthy growth in Latin America. "In most countries it's not consumer led growth but infrastructure and investment led growth," she says. <p>
In Mexico, she expects falling inflation and economic recovery to brighten the fortunes of the financial and cyclical sectors. Argentina and Brazil are fundamentally attractive, but some investors might balk at political risks to recent economic reforms. "We're selective on approach, and we still think Asia will outperform Latin America in the near term," Mansoury notes.<p>
Now, thanks to WEBS, you can be selective too.

						Remember all the talk about the liquidity-driven bull market? You know, the theory that stock prices were being pushed ever higher by baby boomers pouring money into mutual funds?<p>
You couldn't have missed it. Why, the Wall Street Journal even did a front page story a few weeks back where they went coast to coast interviewing all kinds of ignoramuses, schlemiels, chowderheads, dunces, dopes, suckers, and dupes who had the bald effrontery to just keep pouring cash into equity mutual funds no matter what. Even though the market was way, way too high -- so high, only amateurs could buy at those levels. People who had never been in the market before! Can you imagine?<p>

<p>
The professional investor's nightmare: households yanking savings out of the market at the first sign of a correction, turning the correction into a crash.<p>
No wonder the savviest mutual fund managers were sitting on cash, refusing to put it in the market. And missing the rise. And proving once again that Josh Billings was right. It's better to know nothing than to know what ain't so.<p>
The liquidity-driven bull market is one of those things we know that just ain't so.<p>
In fact, according to recently released Fed data, households sold more stock than they bought last year. In fact, on balance, they took $80 billion out of the market. Yet the market was up 38 percent. <p>
Think about that. How can household money pouring into mutual funds drive a speculative frenzy when in fact households are taking more out of the market than they are putting in?<p>
People own stocks two ways. They buy them through a broker, and own them directly, or they buy them through mutual funds, and own them indirectly.<p>
A lot has been written about the inflows into mutual funds being at historic highs, making a lot of people nervous. But now we know that households haven't been pouring new money into the market at unprecedented rates. They've been yanking their savings out of the market for a year by selling off stocks they owned directly. Yet the market keeps going up anyway.<p>
Well, if it's not sucker cash in a spec frenzy, what is pushing this market to unprecedented highs?<p>
Lehman analyst Jeffrey Applegate suggests there's only one possible explanation -- the fundamentals, earnings and interest rates. "Embedded in this worry about households causing a crash is the view that households are jittery, naive, and fairly stupid," he says. But households know enough to buy on the dips.<p>
Where does that leave us for the near term? Well, we're well into the time when companies preannounce earnings disappointments. Except for a few garish red smears (<a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a> for example), there's not much being preannounced.<p>
"I'm not worried about a bad quarter," says Prudential's Melissa Brown. She expects that the earnings growth in this market will shift from cyclicals to stable growers, like consumer staples and health care.

						Do you expect tobacco companies to be out of business in the United States in two years? If not, buy their stock.<p>
A recent report by Sanford Bernstein analyst Gary Black shows just how badly publicity has burned the coffin nail makers. The current price of <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> stock makes sense only if you expect the domestic tobacco business to last two years. If you expect it to last longer, it's a bargain.<p>
A realistic price for Philip Morris (NYSE: MO), according to Black's calculations, is around $104.35. The stock now trades at around $86.75.  <a name="NYSE:RN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13122"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>RJR Nabisco Holdings (NYSE: RN)</b></a> is trading at $30, but should be about $38.73. Black's advice -- "Hold your nose and buy on weakness."<p>
The current market prices wildly overstate the likelihood of damage from the pending lawsuits. Black expects the suits to be dead ends. Moreover, scientists who say that tobacco companies manipulate nicotine levels are merely stating the obvious. A cancer stick is a manufactured product. One pack of Marlboros tastes pretty much like the next. But there's a big difference between Marlboros and Merits. The difference is the recipe. Yes, a recipe, where every ingredient is measured and controlled.<p>
<wam-pullquote> The current prices of  <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> stock makes sense only if you expect the domestic tobacco business to last two years.</wam-pullquote><p>
To make a Marlboro, you need 16 milligrams of tar and 1.1 milligrams of nicotine. A Merit has 1 milligram of tar and 0.1 milligrams of nicotine. Says Black, "They have to be able to vary the level of nicotine by choosing various blends of tobacco. But nobody in the industry takes existing blends and shoots nicotine in to keep people addicted." <p>
JUNK BONDS: Other smoke in the news -- Illinois incinerators burned high yield investors. The incinerators were originally intended to burn trash, generate electricity, and (by selling the electricity) pay the $484.2 million in bonds that financed their construction. Problem -- these projects weren't economically viable without a state subsidy. On March 15, the governor signed a bill withdrawing the subsidy. Now the market fears a default on the debt -- which was, in all fairness, unrated and high risk from the get go. <p>
Lesson -- it's unwise to invest in any project that can't stand on its own economic feet.<p>
MARKET OUTLOOK: We warned you to hang on for a bumpy ride this year. And sure enough, it's white-knuckle time. If your heart is in your throat, take comfort in these words: "It's perfectly normal to have markets move like this. Nothing weird is happening," says Bluford Putnam, chief market strategist for <a name="NYSE:BT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bankers Trust Company</b></a>. <p>
INDICATORS: A cryptic message posted on the Market Week Ahead bulletin board last week said that utility stocks were the key to predicting interest rate moves.<p>
Well, not quite. Utility stocks used to be pretty good indicators. But deregulation and competitive pressure have ruined them for that purpose. Investors looking for the key to interest rates might consider, instead, the New York Financial Index. "A breakdown in the bond market probably will be ephemeral if it's not accompanied by a similar breakdown in the New York Financial Index, and a move to a new high unconfirmed by the New York Financial Index will lack tenure," says Steve Shobin, a technical analyst at Lehman.

						I'm writing this column at 5:30 a.m. EST on Monday morning.<p>
Of course, the question on everyone's mind this morning--is this the big one?<p>
Already I've heard half a dozen broadcasters repeat that Friday's 171 point drop in the Dow was the market's third biggest fall ever.<p>
Don't believe it. In fact, the Dow hardly slipped at all on Friday.<p>
Perspective is everything. The Dow's 171.24 fall brought it down just a shade over 3 percent. Since the turn of the century, the Dow has fallen by 3 percent more than 302 times.<p>
Far from being the third worst loss in market history, Friday's tumble doesn't even rank among the top 100.<p>
Friday's drop was no surprise to regular readers of Market Week Ahead. Two weeks ago I predicted that market would trade in a very volatile manner and close about 2 percent lower. Friday's move puts us right where we said we'd be--not exactly 2 percent, but close enough.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The Dows Friday tumble is far from being the third worst loss in market history.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Now what?<p>
The U.S. stock market will fall farther this week, then climb back. As Nick Sargen of JP Morgan's private client group says, "This is not the end of the bull market, but a temporary correction, maximum 5 to 10 percent."<p>
It would take one of two things to turn the equity bull into a bear--a threat of Fed tightening, or clear evidence of looming recession. And neither is likely.<p>
Inflation is under control, so there's no need for a Fed tightening. And Friday's panic was over an employment report that said more people were working. So it's clear we're not in recession.<p>
But that's just stocks. What about bonds?<p>
The bond bull is dead.<p>
Almost everyone in the bond market had taken for granted that the economy was moving into recession and March would bring another Fed easing. (For newbies, that means that the Fed would lower interest rates. When interest rates go lower, the price of bonds goes
higher.)<p>
Because this view was so widely held, bonds were already trading close to the prices at which they'd be trading after the Fed's expected easing in March.<p>
We offered readers a contrarian view: Paul DaRosa, president of Eastbridge Capital. DaRosa said in this column that the economy was not in recession, but in a mid-cycle slowdown, and would likely roar back.<p>
I called him Friday in the middle of the panic to check in. He wasn't ready to take full credit for being right--yet. "All the facts tell you now is that you're not in a recession," DaRosa says. "They don't say anything about a boom."<p>
He expects that bond prices will fall even more. Big pension funds, insurance companies, banks, and other institutions own a lot of bonds. "People who run these funds are going to meet with economists, give it the big think, and probably sell more on
Monday," he says.<p>
A wild card in the deck is China. China's face-off with Taiwan--a face-off that has included firing missiles, and brought in U.S. warships--could push Asian investors toward a safe haven. A fresh flow of dollars from Asia to North America could buoy U.S. markets and ease the recent pain.<p>
Money that leaves Asia has to go somewhere. Some will go to gold. Some will go to U.S. stocks and bonds.<p>
Added to the money American investors are already pouring into mutual funds at history-making levels, flight capital from Taiwan and Hong Kong will be like a shot of adrenaline to a hyperactive kid.<p>
In fact, this move could already be starting. The Tokyo and Hong Kong markets both sold off today. Hong Kong was down 7.3 percent.<p>
Early news reports blamed the selloff on Friday's fall in New York and Japan's budget impasse.<p>
But a late Reuters report said that China's saber rattling had unnerved Hong Kong investors. Investors there are speculating that China might seize one of Taiwan's outlying islands if the wrong man wins Taiwan's presidential elections.<p>
Watch the China-Taiwan conflict. It will matter to the markets here.

				<blockquote>
					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i></i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Friday, 15 minutes after the close, I was on the phone with Jesse Stamer. "My head's just spinning after today," said Stamer, a primary dealer for options on several technology companies at the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE).<p>
By now you know that tech stocks flew south on Friday. What a cold spring:  <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq</b></a> and  <a name="NYSE:LSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13932"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LSI</b></a> and  <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a> announced lower earnings, a research firm lowered its rating on  <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>, and, boom, selloff--the TXX, an index of 30 technology stocks at the CBOE went down 6 percent.<p>
You know that they fell. But the key is how they fell. "It was like going down stairs, very orderly, no panic," Stamer says. "I usually like to see people panic. That means a top or a bottom." <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Tech stocks are descending in an orderly manner,  meaning the worst isnt over yet.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
That orderly progress means the worst isn't over yet. Stamer expects the TXX index to drop as much as 10 percent farther this week. A lot of funds and institutional investors are still heavily invested in technology stocks. On Friday, these institutional investors were buying lots of "put" options. (A "put" option is the right to sell stock for a certain price within a certain period of time. As stock prices fall, "put" option prices tend to rise because the option's owner has locked in a selling price. They're like insurance policies.)<p>
Two weeks ago, Paul Kandel, senior sector manager for technology and telecommunications at the Dreyfus Corporation made a prediction in this column. He said that he expected consumer technology to falter this year. But he was bullish on business-to-business technology stocks.<p>
Despite Friday's action, he hasn't changed his view.<p>
But Intuit took a hard hit. In addition to its direct consumer sales of personal finance software, Intuit sells software through banks. Isn't that business to business?<p>
No, says Kandel. The ultimate user of Intuit's software is the computer-banking bank customer. So Intuit's software sales to banks are consumer sales after all. "Nothing we've heard has changed our thesis," Kandel concludes.<p>
Tech stocks aside, most traders I talked with Friday think that the long bull market in stocks will continue. Anthony Conroy heads global investment management and trading for <a name="NYSE:BT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bankers Trust Company</b></a>. He summed up the sentiment: "Could we see the Dow at 6000 by the end of the year? Absolutely. I just don't see where else to put your money right now." <p>
But 6000 isn't what it used to be. It's less than a 10 percent rise from the roughly 5500 level where the Dow now stands. This is not the stuff that dreams are made of.<p>
Last year it was hard not to make money on stocks. Everything was going in one direction--up. This year is different. Fits and starts.<p>
"You have to be very adept, willing to swing on a dime when markets move so quickly back and forth," says Steve Chronowitz, a technician who trades futures on his own account from New York.<p>
Chronowitz sees a support level for the S&P index at around 630. If it falls to that level, it will move up again. He expects the market to run back towards its recent high of 667. If it breaks through that level, it could move as far as 680 this year.<p>
That's less than 10 percent.<p>
Great Expectations? Not.

						What's next for this market? Over the next 12 days, expect the Dow to go down about 2 percent, then to start moving back up very bumpily, but not very far. It probably won't crash before the year ends, but volatility is here to stay. Get used to seeing the Dow up or down 50 to 100 points in a day.<p>
I feel pretty confident in that prediction. It has the weight of history behind it. <p>
Last week's market action was so chaotic that instead of calling my usual round of contacts on Friday, I phoned just one man. One man with an incredible machine.<p>
His name is Michael Carr, and he's an analyst with Logical Information Machines in Chicago. The company makes a database and software package called Market Information Machine (MIM).<p>
But that doesn't do it justice. The MIM holds decades, and decades of historical price information on virtually every market. MIM can answer almost any statistical question about the markets within seconds. It costs about $3,000 a month to use this package, so most users trade for big banks and hedge funds. <p>

</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
I apologize in advance for the clutter of numbers that follows. Unfortunately, the only language MIM talks is numbers. And what the MIM has to say is too important to ignore. <p>
For example, have you noticed the oddly uncoordinated movement of the stock and bond markets lately? The bond market has fallen about 5 percent in the past month, while the stock market is up about 8.5 percent. I asked Carr if that had ever happened before, and what it means.<p>
He fed the query into the MIM and a few seconds later, out popped the answer. The markets have only behaved that way once before in history. The date was August 14, 1980. We decided to see where the market was a random 44 days later. It was up 6.75 percent--but it didn't go straight to get there. "It was an extremely volatile time," Carr says, "It didn't finish either tremendously up or tremendously down, but it went up and down a lot, in a very choppy sideways pattern." That pattern continued for about a year, and then the market fell sharply.<p>
Carr fed a few more queries into the MIM. They all pointed to volatility. For example, between February 13 and February 16, the Dow Industrials were down about 100 points, but the Dow Transportation index was up. The MIM told us that has happened 19 times since 1933. On average, three volatile months later, the market was up 7.29 percent.<p>
But don't take my word for it. Check this out. On Friday, February 23, some unusual events lined up together. The three day move in the Dow Industrials had been greater than 2.25 percent. The three day move in the Dow Transportation Index was over 3.5 percent. Treasury futures had moved less than .75 percent in three days. That has happened only 17 times since 1980. Sixteen of those times, the market moved lower over the next week and a half. On average, it lost a little over 2 percent.<p>
Watch the market this week and next to see if history will repeat itself.<p>
Now, just like the New York Times, I have a correction to make. My apologies to Paul Kandel, senior sector manager with the Dreyfus Corporation. In last week's column, I said he was with another fund management company. The column has been corrected in the archives.

						Happy New Year. On February 19, the Year of the Rat began. It will be the Year of the Box for technology investors, though. After a couple of years of not spending much on technology, businesses are upgrading at last.<p>
What does it take to succeed in technology stocks this year? I asked Greg Smith, chief investment strategist at Prudential Securities. He said, "You have to be in parts of the technology sector that sell to businesses, not consumers." Smith likes <a name="NASD:FORE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42045"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fore Systems</b></a>, a leader in automatic teller machine equipment and software, <a name="NYSE:SGI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11735"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Silicon Graphics</b></a> for its "pretty strong business-to-business sales," and <a name="NYSE:CA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10383"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Computer Associates International</b></a>. <p>
Paul Kandel, senior sector manager, technology and communications, with The Dreyfus Corporation in New York, sees the same trend. He calls it the "intranet" boom. There's no doubt about the need for businesses to improve internal communications and data transfer--that's what the "intra" in "intranet" means.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The year of the Box begins.  Heres what to expect in tech stocks.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
The intranet will be good news for the stocks of traditional, heavy iron companies like IBM, DEC, Hewlett Packard, and Sun Microsystems, Kandel says. Also poised to benefit are server and router companies. Kandel likes Auspex Systems, which makes high speed data transfer servers. Cisco and Bay Networks are also poised to benefit. Though their stocks already look pricey by some standards, Kandel isn't deterred. "They're certainly not overvalued. There's still a lot left in both stocks. They appear rich on PE basis but the fundamentals remain very strong," he says.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Should I cash my CD's and invest in stocks?</font></b><p><p>
This question appeared on the Market Week Ahead message board last week. On Friday, I put it to Derek Sasveld, a financial consultant with Ibbotson Associates in Chicago. "Of course, it depends on what the money is for," he said, "But if it's for some fifteen or twenty year retirement horizon, get it invested in the market." <p>
Sasveld reasons that CD rates are slow to go up, quick to go down, and probably won't even pay enough to protect you against inflation. Long term investors should be in stocks and shouldn't worry about the market falling. "I understand the nervousness of investors when we've had great returns over the past 18 months. But for long term investors, there is no bad time to invest," he says.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Japan watch: Loose lips sink ships</font></b><p><p>
Two items of good news last week. A report in an economic journal said that Japanese companies had increased capital investment in 1995. Moreover, department store sales were up for the first time in 47 months.<p>
So why didn't the market jump for joy? Some blame Finance Minister Kubo. He told a Diet session that pensioners were suffering from low interest rates and said something should be done. The market heard this as a warning that the Ministry of Finance intended to raise interest rates. Result--a sell off of stocks and bonds.<p>
The Japanese markets are also wary of some big geopolitical developments. The food and energy crisis in North Korea is so severe that Kim Jong Il's own wife has reportedly fled the country. A total collapse of order in North Korea is possible. <p>
This would mean waves of refugees pouring into South Korea, and possibly even Japan. As if that weren't bad enough, Korea and Japan have been trading hard words over a barren island both claim. Stir into this mix China's threats of military force against Taiwan. This week's lunar New Year's vacation may be the last spot of quiet for a while.

						First, the good news. If you've been kicking yourself for not refinancing your mortgage in 1993, when you could get 30 year fixed rate loans at 6.5 percent and no points, put your feet back on the ground. Paul Ullman, a vice president with Alliance Capital in New York expects another burst of mortgage refinancing to kick in over the next three to four months.<p>
Ullman manages mortgage securities portfolios. He says the fixed, 30 year mortgage rate "is almost down to 1993 levels. Right now it's 7 percent without any points." Moreover, advances in online technology even since 1993 have made the paperwork side of refinancing faster, easier and cheaper. So, brace yourself for a spate of dinnertime phone calls from telemarketers pushing cheap money. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Does the present economy mean were on our way to recession, or is it just catching its breath?<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
But the good news for home owners isn't good news for investors in mortgage securities.<p>
When interest rates fall, old, higher interest treasury and corporate bonds gain in value. But when homeowners retire their old mortgages and take out new ones at lower rates, investors in mortgage securities get their principal back. They have to reinvest at lower rates. The result, says Ullman: mortgage funds will eat dust if the bond market races for glory.<p>
But that's a big if.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>This year's bond market looks a lot like 1986's--and 1976's, for that matter.</font></b><p><p>
"It's not a good time to buy bonds. That would be my advice," says Paul DaRosa, president of Eastbridge Capital in New York, an extraordinarily honest man. "I would probably have said the same thing last summer and you would have lost your shirt listening to my advice," he volunteered when we spoke Friday after the close.<p>
DaRosa has a sense of history, and what he sees going on now, in 1996, reminds him of what went on in 1986, and for that matter in 1976. In fact, in the middle of every business cycle since World War II, there's been a little slowdown. It lasted one to three quarters, and then the economy roared back along with the inflation rate.<p>
Does the present slow economy mean we're on our way to recession, or is the economy just catching its breath? The answer to that question is what divides the bond market into buyers and sellers. "I read the situation as a midcourse slowdown, but I'm probably in the minority," DaRosa says.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Stocks are "expensive enough," but there are some cheapies. Buyer beware.</font></b><p><p>
What about that stock market? Well, as everyone knows by now, a seat on the New York Stock Exchange sold for a record price of one and a quarter million dollars last week. The previous record price was paid about a month before the 1987 crash. Hmmm. No wonder the professionals are nervous.<p>
"I don't think stocks are too expensive now, but I think they're expensive enough," says Melissa Brown of Prudential Securities in New York. A heavy duty number cruncher, or "quant" in the market argot, Brown says there are pockets of cheapness in a generally expensive market. <p>
Beware of them. They're cheap for a reason.<p>
For example, stock prices of companies in basic industries--paper, chemicals, aluminum, steel, and so-called consumer cyclicals like cars --are low in relation to their earnings. What does this mean? The market doesn't expect those earnings to hold up. In order for the stock prices to surge up, there will have to be dramatic improvements in earnings. "I think that's going to be tough
to find," she says.<p>
She's not alone. "We're looking for ways to hedge against a dramatic correction in the market. A 500 point correction shouldn't be out of the question," says Arnie Staalof of Bloom-Staalof, a Philadelphia-based broker dealer. Specifically, Staalof is considering put options either on individual stocks or groups of stocks.<p>
A put option is a low-risk way to benefit from a fall in stock prices. Investors who already own stocks often use put options as a sort of insurance policy. If the market collapses, they lose money on their stocks, but they gain on their put options. It's a little like getting a check from the insurance company when your house burns down. Better it doesn't burn down, but if it does, much better to have the check.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The Japanese are getting emotional over the "jusen" crisis.</font></b><p><p>
Meanwhile, in Japan. The debate over the "jusen" crisis is gathering steam. "Jusen" is the Japanese version of America's S&L crisis. Hideyuki Omakawa of Nikko Securities in Tokyo says that all of the major TV networks there have run long special reports on the problem within the past week.<p>
"More people are now interested in the issue, but they are emotionally involved," he sighs. Japanese voters don't want their tax money to bail out S&L crooks, but the government claims that
a bailout is critical to the stability of the financial system.<p>
"In the stock market, the only buyers are non-Japanese investors, like US pension funds," Omakawa says, "Japanese institutions are selling."<p>
He thinks the buyers are a little optimistic. If the bailout bill fails to clear the Diet, he expects a big fall in stock prices.<p>
On the other hand, the rule of thumb in the Japanese market is that the foreigners make the big money. So stay tuned.

						Welcome to the first Market Week Ahead column. Look for me every Monday with insider market intelligence.<p>
Nervous about this market? So are investors from New York to Tokyo.<p>
The U.S. stock market is nervous, and confused, after Friday's menacing employment report, which showed that two hundred thousand jobs or so disappeared in January, the worst drop in ten years.<p>
<wam-pullquote>Is Fridays employment report a spectral finger pointing towards an economic slowdown?</wam-pullqoute><p>
Did a lot of people stay home from work because they were snowed in? Or was Friday's employment report a spectral finger pointing towards an economic slowdown? President Clinton's best and brightest say that the economy is strong. If it hadn't been for the snow, more people would have been at work.<p>
That's what bond investors are afraid of. Economic growth and inflation lead to higher interest rates. On Friday, it looked as if bondholders were trying to get out while the getting was good. Bond prices fell because sellers were more eager than buyers.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>A metal shows its mettle--but is it an accurate reflection of inflation's direction?</font></b><p><p>
Meanwhile, gold prices are acting as if the economy is booming toward inflation. Inflation makes cash worth less, so investors fled to gold, sending up its price both Thursday and Friday.<p>
Economic growth? Inflation? Logically, stock prices should have gone up too--but they didn't. In fact, they fell on Friday despite the fact that the Fed cut interest rates earlier in the week. The fall had more to do with the job report than the Fed's interest-rate cuts, suggesting the market thinks the economy is cooling off and that the Fed may have more cutting to do.<p>
So what if the bond and gold markets are wrong about inflation? What if the employment numbers mean that employment is really down? Then the economy is slowing, and corporate earnings will be down. That could take some steam out of stocks. The market's fall on Friday may be a preview of next week's coming attractions.<p>
Nicholas Sargen plots investment strategy for <wam-co NYSE:JPM>JP Morgans<wam-co> richest clients. "Uncertainty about earnings is the new dimension we're dealing with," he said on Friday afternoon, after the close. <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Low interest rates on bonds and money market accounts are helping stocks defy gravity.</font></b><p><p>
This market has been funny, though. It keeps defying gravity. Stock prices don't seem to have any relation to earnings at all. They're just being pushed up by all the new money flowing into equity mutual funds.<p>
How long can it last? As long as interest rates on bonds and money market accounts are so low, they give people sticker shock. "This is the same kind of situation that fueled Japanese equity markets in the 1980s" says David Diamond, who manages small capitalization stocks for The Boston Company. "Regardless of earnings, stocks went up and continued to go up for ten years."<p>
Then they crashed when the Japanese central bank raised interest rates.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Japanese investors are keeping close tabs on politics at home and here.</font></b><p><p>
Friday evening, I talked to Hideyuki Omakawa, who manages the international capital markets desk for Nikko--Japan's third largest brokerage. He said that next week could be the turning point for the Japanese market.<p>
The Diet, Japan's Parliament, is the key. Lawmakers are considering a plan to solve Japan's "S&L" crisis, a $60 billion (6.14 trillion yen) millstone around the market, through a taxpayer-financed bailout. "The political debate is now at its height," Omakawa says. He predicts that if the Diet can agree on a plan, the Japanese stock market will rise. If not, it will fall. <p>
The U.S. presidential race is also on the minds of Japanese investors. The recent strength of the dollar has been good news for Japanese exporters, but not so good for big U.S. companies. Some U.S. corporations are said to be discreetly pointing this out to people in Washington. In a very politically sensitive year, they might find someone there who shares their pain.<p>

						On Friday, New York attorney general Dennis Vacco threatened to sue AOL for fraud. His announcement, which gave AOL five days to show why he shouldn't proceed, followed Thursday's meeting by 20 states' attorneys general concerning possible fraud actions against AOL.<p>
Apparently this is one of those good news/bad news situations. The good news is that AOL's new  pricing plan, a flat rate of $19.95 per month, is popular--the service signed up half a million new subscribers in December. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
It's worth noting that shortly before this controversy hit, Salomon Brothers touted AOL as a "buy."<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
The bad news is that people who sign up for the new pricing plan have actually been trying to use the service. And they can't. Unless listening to a busy signal counts as use. Advertising and taking money for a service that people can't use counts as fraud in Mr. Vacco's book. Other states are considering suing, too. Moreover, according to the Financial Times, five civil class action suits have already been filed by angry subscribers.  <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Is there a pattern of deception?</font></b><p><p>
Golly, fraud is serious. Vacco says that AOL had used "persistently and repeatedly deceptive business practices." That could almost be read as an underhanded reference to AOL's erstwhile accounting practices. Is it deceptive to count sales expenses as assets and thereby report high earnings even while cash flew out the door?<p>
But that was last year's news, and AOL solved it by taking a little adjustment to the books, pace all you unfortunate buyers of AOL stock at its pre-adjustment highs. Hmm. <p>
Could there be a pattern here? Buyers of stock don't get what they expect, and buyers of the service don't get what they expect, either.  No, that would be wrong. In fact, I read in the Financial Times that Mr. Stephen Case said in a message to subscribers that AOL was "working night and day" to add capacity and make it possible for people who pay for the service to get what they paid for. Maybe I could have read this message online, but then, it's been pretty tough getting on the system lately.  <p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>There are parallels between Apple's plight and AOL's.</font></b><p><p>
It's worth noting that shortly before this controversy hit, Salomon Brothers touted AOL as a "buy." There's been no immediate reaction by analysts to the fraud suit threats. Watch this space for updates.<p>
It is hard, given all of the recent talk of Apple Computer, not to see some parallels between Apple's plight and AOL's. Both companies were more about a vision of changing the world than about the boring humdrum of numbers. Let us hope that parallels go no farther.<p>
Lehman Brothers analyst Kimberly Alexy has downgraded Apple again, to "neutral" from "outperform." In July, she had generously elevated Apple in the expectation of a financial turnaround. "We simply cannot feel confident about Apple's ability to deliver even conservative revenue expectations," she writes. The company's announcement of a first-quarter revenue shortfall of $300 million led her to lower her fiscal 1997 estimate of a positive 0.67 EPS to a loss of $1.90 per share. The NeXT O/S is at least a year away, and Apple clone makers like Power Computing and Umax are seducing customers.  <p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>What do you think of Apple's long-term prospects?</font></b><p><p>
Meanwhile, at Merrill Lynch, analysts Lucianne Painter and Leslie Thornbury "question Apple's long term viability as both a PC hardware and software provider." They have further lowered their expectations of the company's prospects in fiscal 1997 and now expect a loss of $3.25 per share.  <p>
Why? "Essentially our revised financial outlook reflects our opinion that demand for the Macintosh platform (rather than specific products) is waning substantially, and that once-loyal Mac customers are abandoning the platform," they write.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>Financial stocks both here and abroad had a bang-up year.
</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Opportunity continues to knock in the financial sector. Global consolidation of the financial industry, and lowering interest rates make the banking and insurance industry look like good bets in 1997. <p>
A Salomon Brothers report on international bank stocks, published January 15, notes that bank stocks beat the market worldwide during the second half of 1996. In almost every stock market except Japan's, bank stocks turned in better performance numbers than the market as a whole--and the markets generally did pretty well themselves.  <p>
**Overseas bank stocks reported eye-popping increases.**<p>
The report notes that the best performers (in local-currency terms) were FPB Bank in Hong Kong, which more than doubled. Sweden's Nordbanken came in second. Citicorp was up over 53 percent for the year. But Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya surged 60.4 percent.<p>
Other bank stocks up more than 60 percent include Argentina's Bansud, up 61 percent in U.S. dollar terms; Brazil's Unibanco and Itau, up 78.1 percent and 61.5 percent respectively in local currency term.   <p>
In this company, Mexico's Banacci and Bancomer both look like laggards. They "only" climbed 24.7 percent and 44.5 percent respectively last year. Salomon nonetheless rates both a "buy."<p>
**U.S. banking and financial favorites.**<p>
Back in the USA, Merrill Lynch analysts pulled together a short list of banking and financial favorites for 1997. They include: <a name="NYSE:NOB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11095"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Norwest Corp. (NYSE: NOB)</b></a>; <a name="NYSE:EWB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16079"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>E.W. Blanch Holdings Inc. (NYSE: EWB)</b></a>; Conseco; <a name="NYSE:TIG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16065"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TIG Holdings Inc. (NYSE: TIG)</b></a>; <a name="NYSE:FTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13523"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Frontier Insurance Group Inc. (NYSE: FTR)</b></a>; <a name="NASD:PHBK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14405"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Peoples Heritage Financial Group (Nasdaq: PHBK)</b></a>; and <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan (NYSE: CMB)</b></a>.  <p>
Why should bank and financials stocks continue to do well globally? Consolidation and restructuring, privatization and deregulation are going on everywhere. Moreover, global interest rates are falling. That means of course that banks can get their raw material (money) at a lower price.<p>
**Authorities in Asian and Latin America are helping banks and similar institutions develop.**<p>
In the emerging markets of Latin America and Asia, there are additional forces favoring banks.<p>
To wit: you can't have a modern economy without phones and electricity. So in order to meet their development targets, the countries in these regions have to build, rebuild or expand their telecommunications and power grids. <p>
In Asia, power needs alone are estimated to require a trillion dollars of investment over the next decade. To date, most countries have relied on foreign investors to provide the lion's share of the capital they require. But there's a limit to what foreigners can and will invest. So authorities recognize that they have to develop banking, insurance, and similar institutions. The job of these institutions is to pool and invest domestic savings in order to finance growth.<p>
It's nice to be needed. This, of course, is good news for financial stocks.  <p>
**Tax and budget measures in Japan may have a depressing effect on bank stocks.**<p>
Egregiously immunized against the general epidemic of good news is Japan. There, the average bank lost a quarter of its share price value in second-half 1996. The Japanese banks still haven't recovered from the hangover of the 1980s. There are plenty of bad loans still on the books. <p>
Nor does it look as if they'll manage to grow their way out of the problems in the near future. Taxes are going up in 1997, while government spending is going down. This is an excellent combination for slowing an economy down, but not a great combination for booming bank business. <p>
Merrill Lynch Japan analysts Bijal Shah and Trevor Greetham suggest that the Bank of Japan may cut interest rates to offset the depressing effect of the tax and budget measures. This could give stock prices a shot in the arm. But increasing the supply of yen would likely lower the price of yen relative to the dollar. So what foreign investors make on the stock they could lose on the currency. <p>

				<font size=6><b>97/01/06--Dollar Driven Bull?</b></font><br>

						<font size=4><b><i>Dow 7000 in '97? Sure, says a prominent Wall Street strategist.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>

						Maybe the skeptics are wrong. Maybe the rules have changed. A close perusal of a stack of year end research reports by key Wall Street strategists leaves one with a strange sense of the debate. Maybe the stock market will continue to climb forever. Or maybe the bull only has another year to run.  <p>
At Prudential, technical analyst Ralph Acampora predicts the Dow will hit 7,000 in 1997. That's a year earlier than he had previously predicted. Meanwhile, at the same firm, equity strategist Greg Smith sees the dollar's strength drawing more foreign money to the U.S. markets. "Of course, the point when foreign investors flock to U.S. markets en masse might be considered an early-warning sign of an approaching peak, but it could also be very profitable for investors here first!", Smith writes.<p>

 <p>
As Smith sees the world, European investors will be drawn to the U.S. because of the European Monetary Union (EMU). Europeans have been trying to pull their currencies into tighter alignment for years, with the ultimate but usually unspoken objective being a single currency. The so-called "speculative attack" on the European currencies in 1992 briefly delayed the program. Bureaucrats are trying to put it together again by 1999.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Foreigners aren't investing much in the U.S. market.</font></b><p><p>
The nations of Europe have all engaged in greater or lesser degrees of number fudging in order to meet the strict criteria of EMU. So there's every reason in the world to expect currency instability in 1997 and 1998. "As Europeans become less certain of the value of their strong currencies, the dollar looks better and better," notes Smith. Smith also sees a strong possibility that Japan's financial institutions will pour money into U.S. markets, too. They need high yielding investments to patch the holes in their asset base.  <p>
Interestingly, as Smith points out, U.S. Treasury data show that foreigners aren't investing much in the U.S. financial markets. Smith reads this optimistically -- it means there is room for foreigners to put a lot more capital in the U.S.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Advice for investors: Watch the dollar.</font></b><p><p>
But other sources indicate that  Europeans believe the U.S. market is absurdly overvalued and the Japanese, having been stung before, are more cautious, and also a lot poorer than they used to be.  <p>
The dollar's effect on the stock market is never simple. A strengthening dollar certainly makes U.S. investments even more profitable to foreign holders who translate their dollar holdings into local currencies. But the same strengthening dollar can make dollar-based U.S. companies less competitive, and less profitable.<p>
Best advice for investors -- do watch the dollar. Currency instability in Europe coupled with a strong dollar will at the very least help big money center and investment bank earnings. These institutions have not been very active in the foreign exchange markets lately, but that will change if currencies get more volatile. <p>

						By John Koten<p>
Our recent stories about the true meaning of wealth ("<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9611C01.html">Looking for Andrew Carnegie</A>" in November and "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701F02.html">King of Bangor</A>" in this issue) remind me of the fable about the man who always thought of money. This man was reasonably well off. Yet there were still so many things he wanted and couldn't afford.<p>
Each night he'd go to bed and dream about these things. His dreams made him restless and unhappy. <p>
But then one night he had a new dream. In it, a spirit appeared and told the man that if he went down to the river the next morning, he would encounter an old monk carrying a rock. The spirit said that the monk would happily hand over this rock -- and that once this happened the man would find himself rich beyond his imaginings. He would be able to get everything he ever wanted.<p>
The next day, the man woke up excited and raced down to the river. Sure enough, a monk was sitting by the water's edge. The man nervously approached the monk and asked, "Do you have a rock you can give me?"<p>
The monk replied: "Yes, as a matter of fact, I do have a rock. I found it just the other day." Reaching into his pack, he said, "Here, take it. I don't really need it." The man stared at the rock in disbelief, for the monk had just handed him the largest diamond he had ever seen. He raced back home with his new possession and hid it where he thought no one could find it. He was ecstatic. Now I'm rich, he thought.<p>
But over the next few days, the man found he had great difficulty sleeping. He tossed and turned. His thoughts were continually on the diamond. What if I lose it? Or what if someone tries to steal it? The man felt more unsettled than he ever had before.<p>
Finally, overcome with anxiety and exhausted from insomnia, he returned to the river with the diamond. "Take it back," he told the monk. "It's not what I really want. What I want is something else you have -- the ability to give such a beautiful and valuable thing away. For that, and only that, is true wealth." <p>

						Welcome to Worth's 1997 Investing Guide. This is the second year we have produced this special issue, a free bonus to our subscribers. Once again, it's our way of saying thanks for your support, including the encouraging and often helpful comments so many of you passed on to us during the past year. Your feedback is appreciated.<p>
The coming year promises an array of challenges and opportunities for investors. The market will, as it has for some time, continue to test our optimism. From a historical perspective, stocks are anything but cheap. Yet attractive alternatives to equities -- even at their current levels -- remain few and far between. More than ever, investors need to choose wisely, as our senior financial editor, Jim Jubak, explains in this issue's lead article, "What Comes Next." For specific tips, check out the stock selections from our regular panel of top mutual-fund managers and newsletter writers ("<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9700F07.html">Top Picks for 1997</A>").<p>
Washington, meanwhile, has vowed to address Medicare, Social Security, and capital-gains taxes in the coming year -- all areas of considerable interest to our readers. Morey Stettner provides further details in "Against All Odds."<p>
Elsewhere, Todd G. Buchholz, who writes regularly about overseas markets for Worth, identifies the major global trends for 1997. Staff writer Paul Davies offers select advice from some of America's best financial planners. And Nick Ravo, a regular contributor on real-estate issues, explains why the outlook for the housing market is finally starting to look up.<p>
Throughout this special issue, you'll encounter the witty and often striking photography of Geof Kern. Geof, who lives in Dallas, is one of the most celebrated professionals in our business. He has won virtually every award that can be bestowed on a photographer, and we are delighted to have this opportunity to showcase his work.<p>

						What do the rest of us think about our charity, or lack thereof?<p>
By John Koten<p>
Early a year ago, contributing editor Richard Todd got the assignment to explore the nature of charitable giving. We asked him to consider a few questions, such as why do some people give money away and others not? Is charity learned or innate? Is money given out of guilt or hope of heavenly reward? Are philanthropists better people than the rest of us?<p>
**What is the motivation behind giving?**<p>
To report the story, which begins on page 69, Dick went to different parts of the country and into the homes and offices of experts and thoughtful people of all kinds -- philanthropists, tax lawyers, sociologists, fund-raisers, and philosophers. He found that there is no monolithic thinking on the subject -- the motives for giving are mixed. But the result of giving money became manifestly clear. As one philanthropist explained, "An enormous sense of abundance came over me. You would think you would feel depleted, but no, it's just the opposite."<p>
This election year is an apt time to think about philanthropy because the debate over whether the country needs less government or more -- and even more basically, over what government is for -- concerns the charitable impulses of the nation as a whole. Programs for the arts and the poor have been under considerable attack. But who should fund the arts? The government? Private individuals exclusively? Who will help the poor if the government will not? The rich?<p>
**Carnegie intended charity as a means to help the less-fortunate outside the marketplace.**<p>
The robber barons of the past sought through enormous acts of charity to place "ladders on which the aspiring can rise," as Andrew Carnegie put it. If neither the wealthy nor the government will build these ladders, are we as a society happy to tolerate a world that is left entirely to the marketplace?<p>
It's not big news that many of the very rich have been disappointments to philanthropic and nonprofit organizations. The question is, what do the rest of us think about our charity, or lack thereof? The answer should tell us much about whether we are truly rich or poor.<p>

						This tale is about how things work -- or don't work -- in this land of ours<p>
By John Koten<p>
I have been an Andrew Tobias fan for a long time. Few magazine writers can bring Andy's level of intelligence and wit to the telling of a story. So naturally I was pleased when last year he agreed to sign on as a Worth contributing editor. It also happened that I had a specific story in mind that I hoped he would write -- a first-person account of his efforts to fix our nation's auto-insurance mess.<p>
I got more than I bargained for. Andy's tale, which appears in this issue, is about car insurance. But it is also a story about Ralph Nader, trial lawyers, big business, grassroots politics, and the American voter. It's a story about how things really work -- or don't work -- in this land of ours.<p>
With the possible exception of Michigan, virtually every state in the U.S. has an auto-insurance system that costs far too much and provides little in the way of benefits to people who are seriously injured. There's nothing new about this. Consumer advocates have been saying so -- loudly -- for a long time. Yet almost every effort to bring about reform has either failed or been sabotaged. Why?
Well, for one thing, because a very powerful group of people (trial lawyers) likes the way things are now just fine. They make a lot of money.<p>
Another reason is that the solution to the auto-insurance mess (adopting true, as opposed to fake, no-fault auto insurance) runs counter to a concept that has become ingrained in our culture -- the appealing notion that when anything bad happens someone else must be to blame and made to pay. The problem is most accidents are just that -- accidents.<p>
True no-fault systems haven't been able to find a place in our blame-based society. They apparently have no place even in the worldview of a liberal thinker like Ralph Nader -- perhaps because he's staked a career on fingering "the bad guys." Yet as Andy's story so eloquently demonstrates, we are all worse off as a result.<p>

						By John Koten<p>Clint Willis's cover story for this issue, "Going Small," offers a number of stock recommendations. Readers tell us that they like this kind of piece -- some because they enjoy seeing the process of stock picking explained in detail and others because they are simply eager for good tips.<p>But there's always the issue of timing. Some readers get angry when the price of a stock has changed since our publication date. This happened with Clint's last piece,  "Finding the Next <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>," published in our June issue.<p>We shipped this story to the printer on April 10, updating the stock prices at the last moment. Printing was completed on April 26, and the issue was mailed on April 30. Subscribers began receiving their issues as early as May 1. Newsstand buyers, however, waited two more weeks. (Not our preference: Newsstands won't put monthly magazines on the shelves until the middle of the month.)
I won't tell you that I always like the lead time of a monthly magazine. But we do some things that competitors sometimes don't. First, we concentrate our most time-sensitive material in the "Need to Know" section, which, because of the technology involved, closes just days before the magazine is printed. Second, we mail the magazine immediately, rather than timing the postal date to coincide with the newsstand date. Third and most important: We recommend stocks that make sense as long-term investments.<p>Let's look for a moment at <a name="NASD:ISIP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14081"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Isis Pharmaceuticals</b></a>, the company we told you may become the next Microsoft. When we put the magazine together, Isis was trading at about $11 a share. On May 2, by which time subscribers should have received the magazine, it was at $13.75. On May 14, when the magazine reached newsstands, it was up to $18.63. As I write this, on July 22, Isis is trading at $16.62. I understand that it's painful to miss a price move. Nevertheless, this kind of short-term fluctuation isn't very important in terms of the kind of investing this magazine endorses.<p>As always, you can write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, or send me a fax at 212-980-4307.

						By John Koten<p>Rich communities don't always conform to popular stereotypes about wealth. Take No. 209 on our list of America's 300 richest towns: North Barrington, Illinois -- a distant suburb northwest of Chicago. I happen to know this place fairly well; it's where I spent much of my childhood.<p>North Barrington was, and is, a nice place, with rolling hills, a couple of golf courses, pleasant homes, and well-tended yards. There are basketball hoops in the driveways and barbecues in the backyards. The residents are mostly hardworking and family oriented. They include doctors, lawyers, business executives, airline pilots, and architects.<p>North Barrington, however, hardly resembles anything you'd see on Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous. It's certainly not a Palm Beach or a Beverly Hills. It doesn't have butlers, or chauffeurs, or long-term guests living in pool houses. <p>It isn't even as showy as nearby Barrington Hills (No. 95 on our list) or South Barrington (No. 52). Barrington Hills has a prestigious country club, horse trails, and five-acre zoning. South Barrington, a relatively new community, is dotted with huge baronial houses, many of which look as if they were mail-ordered from Neiman Marcus. Walter Payton, the former star running back for the Chicago Bears, lives there. No one of comparable fame lives in North Barrington, as far as I know.<p>In North Barrington, success buys refuge and conformity, not status and ostentation. This is undoubtedly true of many of the towns on our list of 300 (including No. 1 Rolling Hills, California, with its one-story, identically painted homes). It also may be a reason it isn't always easy to spot some of the pockets of wealth in this country: Some people actually prefer to use their money to live relatively normal, quiet, and anonymous lives.<p>A note to the more than 35,000 entrants of the first Worth stock-picking contest: We'll announce the winner in the September issue.

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING  <p> By John Koten  <p> Life would be simpler if investing in the stock market was just about the numbers. Do your homework. Buy low. Sell high. Ride a nice cycle of profits and losses, with emphasis on the profits. But life's not that simple, of course. As two quite different stories in this issue show, investing is as much about hopes and dreams and power as it is about figures.   <p> A lot of hopes are riding on the amazing stock market of 1996. Baby boomers, for one, are hoping that it will bail them out of all their difficulties, pay for their children's education, help them start new businesses, and provide for retirement ina style that won't be embarrassing. It's a whole new world for a generation that once eschewed capitalism. So far, it's paying off in spades.   <p> But, as Jim Jubak asks in his cover story, will it last?  <p> That may depend as much on the character of investors as on anything. Will boomers panic if prices fall? Will they cash out of their 401(k) plans and flee to Canada? Or will they stay put and hope for the best? I think it will be the last of these. Say what you will about baby boomers, but they aren't fickle. This is a generation that still listens to the Rolling Stones and even thinks it still looks good in blue jeans. It will take more than a correction to pry these folks loose from the marketand from the chance to fulfill their dreams.  <p> "The Master Passion," by William Green, is the story of another kind of stock-market investor: a miser. Orville Wood was not a famous misernot a Hetty Green or a Silas Marnerbut he had the miser's love of money and an overwhelming, passionate fear of sharing it, even with those closest to him. Wood was fascinated by the stock market. He read investment newsletters, took correspondence courses in economics, and, for most of his 102 years, kept meticulous records of his trades. He was proud of his investments and never let his family forget how he had suffered and saved. What he did forget, or never admitted, was that he owed his success mostly to a stock market that kept going up.  <p> As always, I am interested in your thoughts on Worth. Call me at 212-223-3100, fax me at 212-980-4307, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.   <p> <p>

						April 1996  <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING  <p> By John Koten  <p> "Interactive" is a word in search of a definition at most magazines. That's because the only motivation they have for incarnating themselves on-line is that everyone else is doing it. But at Worth, we have a different perspective on cyber-space.  <p> As this month's two cover stories make all too clear, the financial markets are less well policed than ever, and no oversight institution can ensure the safety of your investments. That, increasingly, is up to you. To do it, however, you need information about market trends, companies, CEOs, the global economy and cyber-space, being infinite, is a marvelous medium for getting all of it to you, whenever you need it.  <p> Worth recently launched the second upgrade of Worth OnLine, which we provide via <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>. Designed by our cyber-guru, Lewis Schiff, with editorial direction by Worth general editor Peter Edidin, this version provides enhanced graphics, expanded bulletin boards, and daily features about the markets, stocks, and mutual funds. Readers can also subscribe to our new E-mail newsletter.  <p> This is a part of Worth's continuing commitment to help our readers be the best-informed and most effective investors they can be. Please check it out, if you haven't already. To subscribe to America Online, call 800-827-6364, extension 0341.  <p> In another variation on the theme of interactivity, I am pleased to report that we have received more than 20,000 entries for our stock-picking contest, which was announced in our February issue. The deadline for entries will have passed by the time you read this, but we are planning to hold another such contest within the next few months. We'll let you know the winner.  <p> I am also pleased to note that Worth columnist Susan Lee's "Hands Off: Why the Government Is a Menace to Economic Health" (Simon& Schuster) will be published this month. Lee, an economist, makes a lively argument that government attempts to control or fine-tune the economy are doomed to fail, sometimes disastrously. <p> As always, I'm interested in your thoughts on Worth. Call meat 212-223-3100, fax me at 212-980-4307, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Forward Thinking<p>FORWARD THINKING<p>W. Randall Jones <p>Words have a way of losing their meaning when they're repeated carelessly. Before kids took to tossing it around as a synonym for "good," "awesome" sparked the imagination. "Counterintuitive" conjured images of brave and original thinkers until investors began attaching it to virtually every half-baked stock-market play imaginable. And now that we're about to enter yet another campaign season, the meaning of one of my favorite words is surely about to be drained: "values."<p>Those who follow my column know that my wife and I have spent the last two years renovating our home in a suburb just outside of New York City. It hasn't been easy. A couple of times I felt that I had surely changed places with the Cary Grant character in the movie Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House. I wondered how Connie and I and our three boys were going to outlast the ongoing invasions of workmen, the blizzards of dust, and the early-morning serenades of the circular saw. <p>But the headaches and the heartaches have finally paid off. No, not in any financial sense, because we'll probably never get as much money out of this house as we've now put into it. But how do you place a dollar value on the place where your children grow into adults? How do you run a profit-and-loss analysis on sitting with your family in a place that's exactly as you'd hoped it would be? You simply don't.<p>A home is a sanctuary. It's where you build the relationships that make life's journey worthwhile. It's where you know everything's place. It's where memories carve themselves into the walls.
From an investment standpoint, I view my newly finished home the same way I'd view art. If it appreciates in value, I'll consider myself lucky. But the return I'm shooting for from this investment is the pleasure I derive from it. That pleasure, and the even greater gratification I receive from watching my family enjoy the house, are things I value deeply.<p>Speaking of value, our goal at Worth is to offer you more with each new issue__sharpening our focus, improving our presentation, and seeking new sources of information to bring you the best financial intelligence around. I hope you feel your investment in Worth is living up to this goal__and providing the value you expect.<p>As always, I'm interested in how you think we're doing. You can reach me by phone at 212-223-3100, send me a fax at 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth Magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING <p>Join me in Vienna for a conference on the hottest global investments <p> By W. Randall Jones   <p> I like to think of it as the "smush scenario." The lines in our lives are blurring. Consider that 60 million Americans now work out of their homes and that folks now go into bookstores to relax on comfortable couches, read magazines, and sip cappuccino as if sitting in their own living rooms. Redefinition is everywhere. <p> The next category for an overhaul, in my mind, is the vacation.The grand old concept of an indulgent three-week sprawl is a19th-century notion. The new concept is the learning vacation, an elegant blend of business and pleasure.   <p> My wife, Connie, and I are planning such a venture in June, and we're inviting you along. The occasion is a seminar on global investing called "Seeking Safe Harbors: How to Profit From Global Diversification." Sponsored by Worth and Investments SeminarsInc., it's in Vienna, Austria, June 3 to 9, 1996.  <p> I'll be speaking about Worth's views on where the hottest global investments are and why we're so bullish on them. But I'll also be listening to 20 of the world's leading experts on global investing. Among them will be Worth's own global economist Walter Russell Mead; Paul Melton, editor of The Outside Analyst; Mark Skousen, editor of Forecasts and Strategies; and Allen Keyte, editor of World Affairs Review.  <p> I've always thought of Worth as a collaboration among all of us who share a passion for the tangible and intangible world of finance. This investment summit will give us a chance to meet many of us for the first time. More than 30 workshops are planned think of it as a stimulating investment salon. In Vienna, we can nod to Freud, psychoanalyze the global markets, and put the world's economy on the couch. If you'd like to join us, please call 800-226-0323, or if you harbor any thoughts about Worth you'd like to share, I'm at 212-223-3100; fax, 212-223-1597. My address is 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.  <p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING <p>Think about your own dreams as you read this issue. Where doyou fit in?  <p> By W. Randall Jones  <p> Even our dreams are subject to inflation. Each year, the RoperOrganization conducts a survey asking Americans how much annualincome they would need to fulfill their dreams. This year's averageresponse was $102,000. In 1992, the figure was $83,800.  <p> We wanted to know more--not just about the price people puton happiness, but also about what happiness means to them. Wedispatched more than a dozen writers and photographers acrossthe country to talk to people. The stories and photographs thatresulted from this exercise appear in "The Sum of Our Dreams." <p> Diverse as they are--one participant sought just $1,000 a year;another wanted $60 million--several clear patterns did emergefrom the responses. One is that the more money people have, themore they believe they need. Another pattern: The less moneypeople have, the more likely they are to think of others as theyarticulate their dreams. The well-heeled immediately rattledoff a list of things they wanted for themselves. The less well-offcited things they wanted for their loved ones--to help a brotherget out of debt, to help a wife get an education. One man saidhe'd like to buy pickup trucks for his grandchildren.  <p> What does this tell us? Perhaps self-centeredness is part ofwhat it takes to get rich in this country. Perhaps success itselfbreeds greed. Or maybe the well-off spend too much of their timeassociating with other people who are well-off--and lose touchwith the many folks they could conceivably help.  <p> I'll leave it up to you to debate these issues and to thinkabout your own dreams as you read this issue.  <p> As always, I am delighted when I hear from you about how Worthis doing. You can reach me by phone at 212-223-3100 or by faxat 212-223-1597, or you can write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue,New York, NY 10022.

						January 1996--Special Issue <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING  <p> By W. Randall Jones and John Koten  <p> Welcome to worth's 1996 investing Guide a special bonus issue that provides an advance view of the financial landscape for the year ahead.  <p> Why a bonus issue? It seemed like a good way to say thank you for helping us make this one of the most successful new magazines in years. Since our launch in February 1992, Worth has surpassed every target we've set for it whether the measure is subscription sales, newsstand purchases, or advertising revenue. In 1995, our total paid circulation surpassed the 500,000 mark. We have been adding readers at a faster rate than any other major financial publication.   <p> The contents of this special outlook issue cover a broad spectrum from the complexities of investing in an election year to the outlook for collectible wines and colored diamonds. We're especially pleased with the story "Top Picks for 1996," which is essentially an expanded version of our regular What They're Buying Now and What They're Recommending features. This time, we asked our 12 eminent panelists to name their top two stock picks for 1996 as well as to explain their outlook for the market as a whole (the story begins on page 53). Keep in mind that these folksare not the stock touts you see in other money and business publications, but highly successful fund managers and newsletter writers who put their mouths where their money is for Worth's audience.  <p> We also asked ten highly respected financial planners to tell us the single most important strategy or tactic they will advise their clients to adopt in the upcoming year. Their insightful responses begin on page 74. Elsewhere, Todd G. Buchholz, whoregularly writes about overseas markets for the Need to Know section, takes on the task of identifying the major global trends for 1996 (page 42). Elizabeth Macdonald, our tireless monitor of all things involving taxes, brings together the smartest ideas for approaching April 15 (page 87). Nick Ravo stays closer to home, writing about the outlook for the U.S. housing market (page98).  <p> Regular readers know that we are anything but market cheerleaders, but as you read this issue, you'll discover we're pretty optimistic about the future. As we researched the prospects for the year ahead a task that included surveying 20 key U.S. industries (see page 66) we concluded that the outlook isn't nearly as gloomy as some prognosticators would want us to believe. The U.S. economy is a dynamic and vital enterprise it rarely pays to underestimate its vigor.  <p> We hope the same can be said of our magazine. As always, we're delighted when we hear from you about how Worth is doing. You can reach us by phone at 212-223-3100 or by fax at 212-223-1597,or you can write to us at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY10022.  <p>

 FORWARD THINKING <p>
Our next issue will feature expanded coverage of investing and personal business  <p>
 By W. Randall Jones and John Koten  <p>
 Close readers of this magazine will notice some new names in our pages this month, including Jim Rogers and Susan Lee. Peter Lynch, meanwhile, is taking the month off after completing features for our last two issues. Peter will be back next month.  <p>
 Change is important to a magazine. It helps keep the contentslively and fresh. But readers also appreciate familiarity. Part of our job at Worth is to find the right balance between the two. Our approach is to simply try to make each issue better than the last, constantly building on the things that you, the readers, tell us you like.  <p>
 Last year, we put months of effort into contructing the methodology--and computer spreadsheets--we used for selecting our top mutual fund picks for 1994. This year, we spent another two months refining and building on that system. The result is an even better fund package--a 28-page guide that begins on page 105.   <p>
 Nevertheless, not all change can be gradual and evolutionary. Sometimes a leap forward is called for after a long period of development and planning. We intend to take just such a leap in our next issue. The December Worth will feature expanded investing and personal-business coverage--located in two new sections in the back of the magazine. We'll also be launching a refined cover design, adjusting the size of the magazine slightly to make it easier to read, and doubling the size of the popular What They're Buying Now feature in our Need to Know section.  <p>
 These changes are possible, in part, because of the success of our magazine to date, as our paid circulation climbs past the 500,000 mark. And they are intended to expand on the things that helped us to achieve this remarkable progress.   <p>
 From the beginning, a dialog with our readers has been critical both to our growth as a business and our "growing up" as a mature publication. We want to do everything we can to continue this conversation, so please keep sharing your thoughts with us. You can reach us by phone at 212-223-3100, by fax at 212-223-1597, or you can write to us at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY.10022.

						October 1995   <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING  <p> By John Koten  <p> I got my first credit card at the age of 15. I didn't ask for it. It just came in the mail a product of the great credit card wars of the late 1960s and early 1970s. At the time, banks were scrambling to sign up customers for this new form of money, and many were throwing caution to the wind. They sent cards to convicts, babies, and even folks who were long deceased.  <p> My first charge card arrived courtesy of the First National Bank of Chicago, which I later learned had mailed out more than 2 million unsolicited cards in a single postal fusillade. I was honored to be so trusted by such an important financial institution and proud to have something so adult as a credit card in my wallet as I boarded the school bus each day.  <p> But I hardly qualified for the $1,500 credit limit that came with my card. Between mowing the neighbor's lawn and caddying at the local golf course, I barely earned $30 a week. I was certainly in no position to be making monthly payments and paying 18 percent interest. The First National Bank never lost money on me, because I didn't use the card until years later. But the bank was forced to write off millions of dollars of bad debt that resulted from its overeager marketing.  <p> I mention this because I suspect we may be due for another big wave of this sort of folly as banks stampede to sell their brands of another new type of money. The imminent arrival of digital cash (also known as electronic cash, or E-money) poses many of the same challenges credit cards did more than 20 years ago.  <p> This time the stakes may be even higher. As Alan Deutschman points out in his profile of digital-money guru David Chaum, which begins on page 94, there is widespread disagreement among financial institutions and other experts about how this new form of money should work. Privacy issues loom especially large. Whatever else, I think it's safe to anticipate a few bloopers by financial institutions and wise to keep a close eye on your teenager. As always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts about how Worth is doing.Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.  <p>

Worth magazine/Forward Thinking<p>FORWARD THINKING
We need to slow down, and some of us are beginning to do just that.<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Americans live in what may be the world's fastest-paced society. It makes sense that it would be this way--given that most (but not all) of us are descendants of folks who willingly transported themselves halfway around the globe in search of a better life.<p>Moving fast comes naturally to us. It feels good--whether we are blasting down the highway, racing downfield with a football, or charging up the corporate ladder. This trait, of course, has also helped the U.S. become the most industrious and powerful nation on earth. But life in the fast lane takes its toll. Sometimes we move too fast for our own good or for the good of those around us. Caught up in a footrace through life, we scamper past the signals that are there to tell us what we need to do for ourselves or what our spouses, children, or friends need from us.<p>Psychologists know that manic behavior is often an avoidance tactic--a way of escaping our problems and the pain that accompanies them. To a manic, the stimulus of frenetic activity provides a protective shield from pain. We all know people who are like this to varying degrees, because we live in a manic society.
To be more in touch with real life, we need to slow down. Some of us are beginning to do just that. The trend is called downshifting--and it is chronicled by John Brant in a feature this month. <p>Downshifting isn't necessarily an easy thing to do. The more a fast-paced life is motivated by the desire to escape problems and pain, the more discomfort is likely to bubble to the surface when the fast pace disappears.<p>Nevertheless, a new survey by the Merck Family Fund found that 87 percent of the people who chose to downshift described themselves as happy with the resulting change in their life. Think about it: How many alterations have you made in your life that offered such high odds of success?<p>As always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts about how Worth is doing.

						By W. Randall Jones  <p> The American middle class has always looked to the very well-off as a source of inspiration for its dreams. After all, it's not enough just to want to be rich; it's also nice to know what you're going to do if you ever get there. Imitating the behavior of the wealthy, even without the appropriate bank account, is common. It's as if there's a need to practice up, just in case.  <p> Nevertheless, what's good for the rich isn't always what's best for the rest of us. Take the subject of inherited wealth, the focus of this month's cover story. Until quite recently, the practice of leaving something grand enough to be called an estate was pretty much confined to the wealthy. Middle-class inheritances consisted of the family homestead, perhaps a business or a farm, and a few heirlooms but little in the way of invested assets or cash, and certainly nothing requiring complicated estate planning. <p> But the postWorld War II economic boom began to change all that. As more and more people began to accumulate wealth, accountants, lawyers, and financial-services companies began marketing trusts and other estate-planning tools to an ever wider clientele. The passing of the baby boomers into middle age, and their parents into their senior years, has brought the whole thing to a fever pitch. Today, it's practically conventional wisdom that inheritance is for everyone but the poor.  <p> Does this make sense? Is leaving an inheritance really the best way to handle what's left after a lifetime of earnings? Will you really get more enjoyment out of your money after you're dead than while you're alive?  <p> At Worth, we believe that raising such questions is a fundamental part of our mission. We know our readers make up their own minds about how to handle their money and their lives, that's why we don't tell you month in and month out what to do with your money now, as some magazines do. But we believe it's important that everyone understand the assumptions underlying financial trends, and the consequences of following along.  <p> As always, I welcome your comments. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.  <p> <p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING <p>Why in the world would any company want to list its shares on Nasdaq?  <p> By W. Randall Jones  <p> This month, Gretchen Morgenson, Worth's executive editor, takes on the National Association of Securities Dealers for its shoddy oversight of the Nasdaq stock exchange. After finishing her compelling story, some readers may wonder: Why in the world would any company want to list its shares on Nasdaq?  <p> For some companies, the answer is simple: There's no choice. Because of its lesser listing requirements, Nasdaq is the only place certain small, untried companies can get on the map. To these folks, listing on the New York or American exchange is a goal for the future.   <p> But many larger, well-heeled companies also list on Nasdaq, even though they could easily move to the NYSE or AMEX. This is puzzling to investors who rightly believe that a company's CEO should be interested in the well-being of its shareholders. <p> Nasdaq would say that companies choose to list with it because its multiple-dealer market provides greater liquidity more cash to go chasing after stock. But there are some other reasons, as well.  <p> <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI Communications</b></a> could easily move to the NYSE, yet it has a very cozy relationship with Nasdaq. Perhaps that's because in 1993, the telecommunications giant won a $150 million multi-year contract to run Nasdaq's phone operations. What's more, Bert C. Roberts of MCI sits on the Nasdaq board, while Gordon Macklin of the NASD is an MCI director.  <p> MCI may be an unusual case. A more common reason companies stick with Nasdaq is that a number of major market-maker firms, eager to profit on the high spreads in a Nasdaq stock, sometimes work behind the scenes to increase a stock's profile among investors by getting research reports published on the stock. This can raise a company's profile fast.  <p> Chief executives who are concerned about their shareholders and the prices they pay to buy and sell stock should have cause for concern when they've finished with Morgenson's piece. If they don't well, that in itself is cause for concern.  <p> As always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts about how we're doing. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. <p><p>

						May 1995
Worth magazine/Forward Thinking<p>FORWARD THINKING<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>In February's issue, we identified Alan Greenspan as the person investors should watch most carefully in 1995. The Federal Reserve chairman is arguably the most powerful figure in the global economy. His decisions directly affect our financial lives in a way no other public figure can match.<p>Yet information about the man himself, his beliefs, and his actions inside the Fed can be hard to come by. To give our readers more insight, we asked Michael Lewis to delve behind the scenes and produce an in-depth profile of the Fed chairman. The resulting feature, which begins on page 58, is one of the most fascinating financial stories I've ever read. <p>Alan Greenspan is clearly on a mission--a mission many of his supporters don't fully appreciate or understand. Certainly he has played an important role in stabilizing the U.S. economy and increasing the confidence levels of the business and investment communities. But at the same time, Greenspan has moved to insulate himself and the Fed from answering to any other authority.<p>I don't know about you, but when I see a man taping meetings without some participants' knowledge, withholding information from Congress, and running public policy as a personal fief, I start to worry. History is replete with stories of leaders who thought they knew better than everyone else. That has usually been their downfall. I'm wary of anyone who tries to place himself beyond accountability, especially a man who influences my financial destiny.<p>Here at Worth, I'm the one who's accountable--to you, our readers. Because of that, I'd like to raise an issue you may have read about lately: ethics in personal-finance journalism. I'm not interested in airing other magazines' dirty laundry, but I do want you to know our own conflict-of-interest policy. It's simple, it's rigorously enforced, and we think it's the strictest in the business. In short: No one who works for Worth may benefit from advance knowledge of what we plan to publish. This applies to staff members, consultants, contributors, vendors ... anyone who earns a buck from the magazine. We believe such a policy is a prerequisite for credible advice. As always, I'm eager to hear your thoughts. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Forward Thinking<p>FORWARD THINKING
Our problems are large, but to the rest of the world, the U.S. still looks good<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Compared to what? it's a critical question when it comes to assessing the prospects for U.S. markets. Especially right now. In a global economy, everything is relative and perspective is key.<p>Say you live in Des Moines, Iowa. The outlook for the U.S. economy might not appear so bright from where you sit. President Clinton seems reasonably well-meaning, but is he an effective leader? Not really. Will the Gingrich-led Republicans really make our government leaner and more effective? It's hard to tell. Meanwhile, the cost of your adjustable-rate home mortgage just spiked up another few bucks, you know several folks who have been looking for work for quite a while, and your farmer friends are scared to death about impending cuts in agricultural price supports. You keep hearing that inflation may be just around the corner, but you also wonder if all these interest-rate increases could actually end up causing a recession.<p>Are these reasons to be concerned? The answer is yes. Is our country faced with major economic and social challenges? Again, the answer is yes.<p>Yet increasingly, an even more important matter that people need to consider__at least as investors and perhaps as citizens, as well__is, How does our country look compared with the rest of the world? How big are our problems compared with those of Mexico? Or Japan? Or Cuba?<p>I'm not highlighting these questions because I think Americans are spoiled and ought to spend more time counting their blessings. I point them out because these days investment dollars increasingly flow to areas of relative strength in world markets.<p>The outlook for U.S. stocks depends not only on how our economy is performing, but also on how it is performing relative to the economies of other nations. At the moment, as this month's cover story explains in greater detail, the relative outlook is actually pretty good.<p>It's the sort of perspective you can count on Worth to provide. We'll leave it to others to miss the forest for the trees. As always, I'm happy to hear your thoughts about how we're doing. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p><p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING <p>Maybe Newt should give the IRS a tax credit to go out and buy new computers  <p> By W. Randall Jones  <p> As sound bite-thirsty gop conservatives try to close on their "devolutionary" Contract With America, the arguments on Capitol Hill have focused on how much of their self-proclaimed revolution the party of Gingrich will be able to accomplish, and how much is worth accomplishing.  <p> This is fine grist for the pundits, who can now wonder out loud whether Newt's notion (later retracted) of giving every man, woman, and child in America a government credit to go out and buy laptop computers is responsible social and economic policy. Term limits, gun control, welfare, and health reform are important issues. But what if government can't even collect the money it requires to administer this society, much less change it?   <p> To get the trillion or so dollars a year it needs each year, government relies almost totally on one institution: the Internal Revenue Service. (Tariffs and other fees provide a few bucks as well.) But the service, once held in something like superstitious awe by taxpayers, has had a hard time of late. Antitax sentiment throughout the country has undermined the legitimacy of its mission, and the ongoing transformation of our economy has complicated the job of revenue collection.  <p> Electronic cash and commercial transactions, the decline of large corporations and the rise of small entrepreneurial ventures, for which "headquarters" can be wherever one of Newt's laptops is present--all this is making life tougher for the IRS, which can barely keep its own crumbling computer system up and running.  <p> For the first time, responsible voices are questioning whether the IRS and the present tax system are about to be rendered obsolescent by an electorate that doesn't want them around anymore, and whether advances in technology will make it easy for many of us by the year 2000 to hide the money we earn from the IRS's once omnipresent gaze.  <p> Our cover story takes readers beyond the day's headlines to investigate a crisis that could change the way our government and our society operates. It's a story that matters, a story for Worth. As always, I'm happy to hear your thoughts about how we are doing. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.  <p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Forward Thinking  <p> FORWARD THINKING <p>The markets are about far more than money--as our list of market movers proves  <p> By W. Randall Jones  <p> It proved somewhat humbling, trying to identify the 50 people with the most influence on the U.S. markets. Wall Street is a place where virtually every facet of American life intersects in one way or another. Toss in the effects of developments in other countries--whether economic or political--and the range of activity mirrored in the daily percolation of the markets begins to seem almost boundless.  <p> Here's one piece of evidence: Fewer than half the people who made our final list are involved directly in an investment activity. Among others, our list includes judges, politicians, industry titans, media representatives, and economists. Wall Street is well represented, but so are Tokyo, Baghdad, and Omaha, Nebraska. <p> To cynics, stocks, bonds, and other investments are only about greed, power, and money. Yet to anyone who cares to look past the dollar signs, there is far more to see--a wide panorama of human endeavor and social evolution. Ideas. Laws. Technology. Psychology. Nature. They all play a role. Each can rise to dominate at any given moment. Yet over the sweep of time, none is necessarily most powerful.  <p> The range and depth of the markets ultimately is what makes them so interesting to observe. It's also why our definition of market mover involves more than the ability to make the Dow jump on a given day.  <p> The inevitable lesson of this package is that informed investing requires more than just a sharp eye on the ticker tape. The economy doesn't tell the whole story. And neither does the rise and fall of stocks. In the worst market, there are always still some winners. In the best market, there are always some losers.   <p> The best investors share this with the people on our list: They keep their eyes open and never stop learning. Part of our job at Worth is to help with this never-ending task. It's one reason the range of subjects we cover in each issue is broader than that found in other personal-finance magazines. As always, I'm happy to hear your thoughts about how we are doing. Call me at212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. If you'd like, wish us a happy birthday. It's our third--a happy day I'm told 95 percent of all new magazines never see.  <p>  <p>

Worth magazine/Forward Thinking<p>FORWARD THINKING
But enough about us. Here's some impressive research about you, the readers.<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Magazines normally reserve this space for hearty self-congratulations. It is here we boast of our latest accomplishments and heroic acts in the face of tight deadlines, et cetera, et cetera.<p>I'll get around to my share of this in a moment. But first, I want to break with tradition and offer congratulations to another group--to you, our readers. Why? Because I just finished reading the 1994 Mendelsohn Affluent Survey, which reports on the reader demographics of the major national magazines. Each year the Mendelsohn organization surveys thousands of citizens to find out who peruses what. Within our industry, this research is widely considered the most accurate tabulation of its kind. It can be scary, as well:  A competitor of ours in the personal-finance category refuses to participate, presumably for fear of the results.<p>This year, the findings divulged some fascinating things about the readers of Worth. First, Mendelsohn told us that you are an exceptionally smart audience. In fact, a larger percentage of you attended college than the readers of any other periodical published in the U.S. More than the audiences of magazines like The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Forbes, Business Week, and Fortune. More also than the readers of the Wall Street Journal and Barron's. <p>The survey also told us that you folks are doing quite well financially. Worth's audience beat every other major U.S.-based publication in average household income. In fact, we learned that as a group you are even more well-heeled than our 1993 readership, which also finished first in the survey. I won't be crass and invade your privacy by publishing any figures here. You already know how successful you are. What you might not have known, however, is what good company you are in as readers of this magazine.<p>So congratulations for all your success. I wish even greater accomplishment for you in the future.<p>Now it's time for me to blow our horn, too. After all, we're the ones who attracted you smart, successful types. What's more, our circulation rose 49 percent during the 12 months between the last two Mendelsohn surveys. I'm also very pleased to report that an increasing share of our new readers are women.<p>We intend to keep doing the things that have helped us attract the best magazine audience around. If you know of any way we can improve on this mission, please drop me a line at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. My fax number is 212-223-1597, or you can call me at 212-223-3100. One of the advantages of having a smart audience is the quality of the feedback we get.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Departments<p>FORWARD THINKING
Be the boss when it comes to your money. The best advisors are more effective with a knowledgeable client.<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Our readers ask us a lot of questions. which stocks should I buy? What's a good way to pick a mutual fund? Do I really have to pay all those taxes? How much of my portfolio should I invest overseas?<p>We do our best to respond to these questions and concerns, not only individually but in the stories we run in the magazine. Such is the case with this month's feature on America's best financial advisors. Wherever we go, it seems, people want to know: How can I find an expert who can help me get my personal finances in order?<p>Our answer to this question begins on page 60, in "A Skeptical Guide to Financial Advisors." <p>We approached the subject, as the title of the story suggests, with a certain ambivalence. We understand why some people might need an advisor to help them with their finances. Planning for the future, restructuring investment portfolios, establishing trusts, developing tax strategies--these are crucial issues, and we believe in expert help. But when it comes to issues involving money and investments, we also believe strongly in self-reliance.<p>Why? Partly because we think it's the only way anyone can be sure his or her personal finances are getting the full attention they deserve. Advisor or no advisor, you still have to be the boss when it comes to your money. And a boss who is absent or doesn't understand the issues is asking for big trouble. That's why even the best financial advisors operate more effectively with a knowledgeable client.<p>Making good decisions about money can certainly be a headache. It also requires a lot of time and energy--commodities not always in abundant supply. But these aren't reasons to turn full responsibility for your personal economic affairs over to a stranger. We suggest that you use a financial advisor as a kind of partner. Don't let the buck stop somewhere else.<p>Of course, we should acknowledge a certain conflict of interest. After all, this magazine is in the advice business, too. So we're writing about the competition here.<p>But which would you rather read: a list of top financial advisors compiled by an industry booster, or one compiled by grudging skeptics? We hope your answer is the latter, because that's what we're all about.<p>As always, I am happy to hear from readers about any aspect of the magazine. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p>

Our intention is to provide readers with a concise snapshot of the current financial climate--one not available anywhere else<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Since we launched it a year ago, Need to Know has become one of the most popular features in Worth. Earlier this year, supportive comments from readers prompted us to expand the section to four pages, adding more information about mutual funds and a map that tracks the performance of global markets. Those additions were introduced in our May issue.<p>This month we've expanded Need to Know again, and in a big way. We've added five more pages and a dozen new charts and graphs. Three pages now focus on stocks, two on mutual funds, and one on bonds and other fixed-income instruments.<p>Our intention is to provide our readers with a concise yet relatively complete snapshot of the current financial climate--an intelligent summary not available anywhere else. While designing the expanded section, we sought out some of the best financial minds and collectors of data around. We're particularly pleased with our source for information about the flow of money into mutual funds. AMG Data Services, a supplier of financial data based in Arcata, California, found a way to help us get our readers the most up-to-date information available in a monthly financial publication. Have a look at Mutual Fund Laboratory on page 31.<p>That's just one example. Another is Jim Stack, the president of InvesTech Research, a market-research firm in Whitefish, Montana, who has helped us create a new market indicator that uses the performance of utility and brokerage stocks to forecast the direction of the market. You can find Stack's indicator, The Composite Bellwether, in Market Radar on page 26. Goldman Sachs, <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>, Standard & Poor's Compustat, CDA/Investnet, and Value Line also agreed to provide critical information for the new section.<p>Another change: We've thrown open Need to Know's Ten Stocks column to outside players. This month, on page 27, Louis Navellier, publisher of MPT Review, picks ten issues to consider, while David Tyce, who writes the newsletter Behind the Numbers, picks ten to avoid. <p>Timeliness is critical to us at Worth and is an especially important part of Need to Know. The section is the last component of the magazine we produce, and it's shipped to the printing plant on a different timetable from the rest of Worth's pages. We hope you'll like the result. I'd be interested to hear your thoughts about the expansion of Need to Know or about any other part of our magazine. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p><p><p>

It's impossible to be a well-informed citizen without some knowledge of economic policy<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>In this issue, we're pleased to feature a story adapted from Joseph Nocera's The Sunny Side of the Street, to be published this fall by Simon & Schuster. The book dramatizes what Nocera calls the "the money revolution," a profound set of changes that has turned the U.S. from a nation of savers into a nation of investors. As revolutions go, this one hasn't been violent, but it has had an epic sweep. Nocera shows us the visionaries and savants who have introduced a progressively more anxious nation to credit cards, mutual funds, and discount brokers. <p>Many of the changes of the money revolution, Nocera argues, can be traced to the inflationary period of the 1970s, a time when Americans had to become financially nimble in ways they never had been before. Both economically and socially, the age of inflation etched its impact on America every bit as sharply as the Great Depression did 40 years earlier. Inflation can certainly be ruinous, especially for those who live on fixed incomes. Yet to the extent that the age of inflation forced us to raise our awareness about economics and personal finance, it was a good thing, too.<p>Today, it's impossible to be a well-informed citizen without at least some knowledge of how government economic policy can affect our ability to earn a living and provide for our own future. A global economy will reward nations that manage their finances well, and it will punish those that don't. Voters will have to know how to elect leaders who can get the job done.<p>As individuals, we also now hold more responsibility for our personal economic affairs. Few of us will want to count on the government to take care of us when we retire. So it is up to us to manage our money effectively amid a changing economic landscape.<p>This message is especially timely right now. Many economists believe that in five years we may look back on 1994 as the year that inflation returned as a menace to the economy. Federal Reserve Board chairman Alan Greenspan is in the midst of an aggressive campaign to stop inflation before it can gain any kind of foothold at all. His remedy--higher interest rates--has been painful and has stopped both the stock and bond markets in their tracks.<p>Will Greenspan's strategy work? Only time will tell. To date, history has shown that the only thing that halts inflation is a jarring recession. Whatever happens, investors will need all the navigational help they can get. And that's a big part of our job here at Worth. As always, I'm happy to hear your thoughts on how we're doing. Call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. <p><p>

						<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Imagine you're at a fashionable dinner party, chatting with someone you've just met. Within a half hour, you've already touched on your difficult relationship with your parents, debated sexual ethics, and explored your problems with organized religion. This is what passes for small talk in our liberated age. Then, without thinking about it, you ask your new friend how much he or she makes. <p>You've never seen a conversation come to an end faster. <p>This, of course, would never happen.  Money, as contributing editor Donald Katz wrote in a cover story for Worth last June, is "the last taboo," a subject so full of fear and loathing that we keep our financial anxieties hidden away in a sort of emotional safe-deposit box. A line from that story is the inspiration for the cover story in this issue. "The rise of a money culture every bit as rich as a culture of sexuality," Katz wrote, "has been attended by no Kinsey Report." <p>As a magazine, we've always tried to stress the personal dimension of personal finance, so it seemed clear that we needed to answer Katz's implied challenge. Teaming up with Roper/Starch Worldwide, one of the country's top market-research organizations, we sent a legion of pollsters across the country to help us draw a road map of America's financial psyche. The results are eye-opening. As a nation, we are still struggling with the legacy of the '80s and the realities of the '90s. We see money as touched with magic but also as the back door to sin. <p>The report also proves a hunch that we've always had: that successfully managing money is as much a matter of psychological makeup as intelligence or education. Thanks to some high-powered analytical techniques, Roper's statisticians were able to prove that some of us are virtually coded to accumulate money, while others are emotionally disabled when it comes to staying in the black. <p>Of course, the ability to manage money effortlessly is no guarantee of happiness. In fact, the drive to accumulate can be just as damaging as the compulsion to spend wildly. What's important is to understand why you treat money the way you do--and, in some cases, to change attitudes and behavior.<p>Not that we recommend going around asking strangers how much they're worth--it might be a few decades before that's acceptable--but we do think it's healthy to bring these issues out into the open. Reticence about financial matters often hides deeper and more troubling emotional issues. As always, I'd love to hear what you're thinking--and feeling--about the subject. Feel free to call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p>

Financial decisions may be influenced as much by emotional considerations as rational ones<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Sometimes good story ideas leap from personal experience. Last year, before moving to New York, our editor, John Koten, spent 26 weeks commuting between his home in Chicago and our magazine offices. At the time, he recalls, the reaction he got from most people wasn't "Gosh, that must be a tough grind," but rather, "Wow, think about all the frequent-flier miles you'll rack up." Such is the current passion over airline promotions.<p>Yet when his weekly commutes ended, the outcome was hardly a bonanza of free junkets to Maui. Six months of flying had yielded exactly one ticket free and clear. (The statement showed his frequent-flier account was still 500 miles short of his second bonus award.) "I admit I didn't do all the tricks for building mileage that some people do--like taking flights with a lot of stopovers--but still, one free ticket didn't seem like much of a discount for all those hours in the air," Koten says. "It made me want to ask: What's an airline mile really worth anyway?"<p>The answer to that question begins on page 60. <p>Our cover story about frequent-flier programs certainly isn't typical of what you might find in a personal-finance magazine. Then again, neither is our tale about John Sculley's embarrassing career move, our look at fashion in the workplace, or our recounting of the murder of a stockbroker at the hands of one of his clients. <p>These stories reflect our view that there is more to covering the world of money that just picking stocks or reporting the latest mood swing on Wall Street. Money issues touch virtually every area of our personal lives, and financial decisions are often influenced as much by emotional considerations as rational ones. That's why we aren't interested in being just another copycat magazine in the field. There are enough of those already. <p>Our mission is to try to provide our readers with a deeper level of understanding through thorough reporting and compelling storytelling. There's nothing wrong with giving instructions on how to play the frequent-flier game. But the first step is to ask how valuable these promotions are to begin with. The results are surprising.<p>We also welcome your ideas, as always, and with this issue we are making it even easier to get in touch with us.

						<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>In this issue, we turn once again to electronic investing--a topic to which we also devoted a feature story last month. Why so much coverage of a single subject? Because it's clear to us that computers are rapidly becoming a tool few serious investors can do without. We've said repeatedly that successful investing requires thorough homework using timely and unbiased information. As the pros on Wall Street have known for years, computers help to do this better. Now the boost is available to amateurs too, through improvements in financial software. <p>Last month, we looked at ways for investors to use computer networks such as the Internet to research companies and swap tips. This time, we present a nitty-gritty guide for readers who want to use their home computers to help them invest better. If you're a beginner, we tell you what equipment and software you need to get started. Next, we explain how to research a stock or evaluate a mutual fund on your own. More advanced users will find tips to expand their repertoire. To prepare this package, our staff conducted hands-on reviews of more than 100 top financial software programs. A listing of our favorites begins on page 91, along with explanations of what the programs do and how to use them.<p>Worth is committed to covering electronic investing better than any other magazine. We'll keep you up to date on new software and services, including the growing array of programs that write checks, manage the family budget, and help taxpayers complete their 1040s. For computer-using readers, we're also committed to providing the best on-line service. Worth was one of the first national publications to make its contents available on America Online, the fastest growing of the major on-line networks. America Online customers can read Worth stories, get answers to common financial questions, and send messages to our staff. Have a problem with a broker, insurance company, real estate agent, or tax advisor? Send a message on-line to the Worth Advocate (a.k.a. senior writer Andrew Gluck), and he'll try to help solve it. In coming months we plan to expand our on-line services dramatically, in response to the hundreds of suggestions we've received.<p>Of course I'm always happy to hear from our readers by more conventional means, too. You can call me at 212-223-3100, send a fax to 212-223-1597, or drop a line to 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. This issue also contains a reader-response card on which you can return your comments postage-free. I promise to read every one. How's that for interactivity?<p><p><p>

						<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>From the start, worth's mission has been a straightforward one: Revolutionize the journalism of personal finance. Take a subject that previously looked drab and breathe some life into it. We knew we could accomplish this partly through crisper writing and partly by focusing more deeply on the human dimension behind our stories.<p>But an equally important aspect of this task is to bring greater sophistication and intelligence to the job. Just jazzing up the copy won't do. We want you, our readers, to regard Worth as a truly helpful ally in your lives.<p>The way we report and write about publicly traded securities is a good example. Before any stock gets mentioned in Worth, in either a positive or negative context, we do thorough background research on the company and its performance history. We keep a sharp eye out for factors that could influence future performance, even if they have nothing to do with why we chose to write about the stock in the first place. Each selection must also clear several editing hurdles before it gets into the magazine.<p>In this regard, we're fortunate to have a group of highly talented editors with backgrounds in both financial journalism and professional stock trading. Our ace in the hole, of course, is Peter Lynch, perhaps the most highly regarded stock picker ever. I recently checked the record of the ten stocks that Peter mentioned in his inaugural column for us back in August 1992. A portfolio with an equal number of shares in each stock--all in the savings-and-loan industry--would have been up 39 percent as of mid-January this year. Not too shabby for just 18 months.<p>We also have a good record so far with the "Ten Stocks to Avoid" feature we launched in the October issue of Worth. As of December 30, the October list had underperformed the market by 9.4 percentage points, the November list by 4.3 percentage points, and the December list by 0.5 percentage points. (As you might expect, the underperformance is greater for the earlier periods, because the stocks have had more time to move.)<p>This isn't to say that we'll be right short-term with every stock. Our December/January issue, for instance, carried a story on the promising outlook for CompUSA. At the time we wrote this, the stock was at $27 a share. It rose for a short period but then fell to $18 by the middle of January. <p>Although we won't hesitate to point out unique opportunities for our readers, we generally take a long-term stance toward stocks, basing our views on fundamental analysis. I welcome your feedback about our stock coverage or any other aspects of Worth. I can be reached at 212-223-3100, fax 212-223-1597. Or write me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022. <p>

 <p>By W. Randall Jones<p>We at worth are especially proud of this issue of the magazine. With it, we enter our third year of publishing--a considerable achievement in a difficult time for our industry. Yet Worth has done more than just survive; it has prospered in a way that has exceeded even our most optimistic expectations. <p>By September of this year, our circulation will surpass 400,000 paid subscribers, making Worth one of the fastest-growing magazines around. We also recently began broadcasting the Worth approach to personal finance on CNBC. We appear every Wednesday night at 7:30 eastern time on the Money Talk program. These accomplishments have helped confirm our belief that a magazine that brought a fresh approach to writing about money and finance would find an enthusiastic audience. <p>We're particularly proud of our February issue simply because it is our best yet. With each passing month, we've listened carefully to you, our readers, and instituted improvements to better address your needs. We've sharpened our writing, introduced new columns and features, and refined our design. We've also added more talent to our staff. I hope you'll agree that these efforts have produced an even more striking, innovative, and intelligent financial magazine.<p>We certainly have no intention of becoming complacent. Our basic format and design won't change, but we will continue with other improvements as we proceed into our third year. At its best, a magazine is like a good friend. It's there when you need wise counsel, smart advice, and even entertainment. Friends need to grow, but they also need to do so in a way that deepens their relationship.<p>Our mission at Worth is to transcend the didactic and formulaic approaches that historically have dominated the craft of financial journalism. We seek to add a more human dimension, one that recognizes the importance of financial success but that also recognizes other values in life--values that run deeper than the size of a person's bank account.<p>This approach is certainly reflected in the mix of features we chose for this issue. Our cover story, by Gretchen Morgenson, looks behind the current momentum-investing fad on Wall Street and challenges its wisdom. "A Farmer's Battle," by Donovan Webster, tells the story of a true American hero: an Iowa farmer battling to save 3,200 acres in the wake of the Mississippi flood. This is financial journalism at its best--the only kind you'll find in Worth.<p>As always, I'm interested in your thoughts about the magazine. Readers can write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022, or call 212-223-3100. My fax number is 212-223-1597.<p> <p>

Family Plan: Bringing charity closer to home<p>By W.Randall Jones<p>Most of my friends are very charitable, giving people. For the most part, though, it's checkbook charity. I have to admit that I'm no exception. It's a way to assuage the guilt of being financially comfortable when so many Americans aren't. Plus, it's easy and time-efficient. No muss, no fuss.<p>But it's not enough. True charity isn't just about charity balls and checks to worthy foundations. So my family and I decided to try something different for the holidays. Our plan: To help a less fortunate family celebrate Christmas this year. <p>The first step for the Jones family was to discuss the idea together. We all agreed that this was something we wanted to do. Chance, our four-year-old son, suggested we set up a charity bank in the family room. Cole, who's ten, said that he and Chance would each place 50 percent of their allowance in the bank every week until Christmas. My wife and I agreed to make an equal contribution for Chip (he's only six months old, so an allowance is a bit premature). We also said we'd put in double the total for the three boys each week. The money would go toward gifts for the family that we would "adopt" for Christmas.<p>We found this family by contacting a social-service agency in Georgia, where we spend Christmas with our relatives. (No national groups I know of offer this as a service, and it takes some digging to find local organizations that do. One place to start might be with your church.)<p>We've already talked with our adopted family on the phone to get to know them better. In the process, a remarkable thing happened. Suddenly, instead of watching the commercials during Saturday-morning cartoons and saying, "I want that," my kids are saying, "I wonder if Dave would like that G.I. Joe?" They are actually more excited about going to buy gifts for our "Christmas family" than they are about their own wishes. <p>I learned a life lesson in this small act of charity. Kids are natural givers; they just need the encouragement and help to do it. I think this just may be the best gift I'll give them this Christmas. <p>Here's wishing you the happiest of holiday seasons. As always, I'm interested in what you think about Worth. I can be reached at 212-223-3100, fax 212-223-1597. Or write to me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p> <p><p>

The Deeper Meaning of Money<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Maybe it's because I publish this magazine. Or maybe it's because I'm getting older. But I find myself increasingly aware of the way money attaches itself to almost every deep emotional issue in life: love, acceptance, freedom, expectation, control, you name it. And I'm learning that when conflicts arise over money, there is almost always a deep-seated emotional issue involved. It is a signal that something significant is amiss--and needs to be addressed.<p>During our 13 years of marriage, my wife, Connie, and I have renovated several homes. Despite the fact that we are two strong-willed people, these projects always have gone quite smoothly. The old saying"Build a house, tear down a marriage" seemed like folly to us. But that was before our latest project. Suffice it to say that this time harmony in our household was a little harder to come by. Our poor architect must have thought we'd lost our minds because we kept revising our instructions. And we weren't sure why either of us were behaving this way.<p>Finally, Connie and I decided a good heart-to-heart talk might help. Sure enough, in the course of our discussion, it turned out some important issues between us had been neglected. She was upset because we were relying more heavily on her money to pay for the renovations. Giving up a major portion of her savings threatened her sense of freedom and independence, she said. I was angry because I felt my contribution toward paying for the house in the first place wasn't being given enough weight. Why it was so easy to view my income as "our" money, but not her income? Was there even such as thing as "our" money? <p>I am sure we are far from the first couple to have such a discussion. The important thing was that just sharing these feelings made a big difference. Eventually, we devised a new plan. We're now splitting the cost of the renovation, and I'm happy to report our dream house is proceeding on schedule.<p>The broader role of money in our lives is a major focus for this magazine, and something that sets us apart from our competitors. As always, I'm interested in hearing how you think we are doing at Worth. I can be reached at 212-223-3100, fax 212-223-1597. Or write me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p><p>

Cybertalk: What is interactivity really about?<p>By W. Randall Jones<p>Last month worth wrote about investment opportunities in the new interactive age. The interest was astounding and understandably so. It's a sexy and potentially profitable subject, and few sophisticated people truly understand the intricacies of this technology revolution. We know we'll be able to shop directly from home and to call up Casablanca any time we feel like hearing Rick say, "Louie, this could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship. "But I've been thinking--is this what interactivity is all about? <p>When you laugh out loud at The Catcher in the Rye or cry at Madame Bovary, that's interactivity. When you get so mad or so touched that you sit down and write a letter to the editor, that's interactivity. When you can't get a Chopin nocturne out of your mind--or a ballad by Elvis, for that matter--that's interactivity. <p>To me, buying a pair of cubic-zirconium earrings seems pretty passive in comparison. I think genuine interactivity is feeling the heft of David McCullough's biography of Harry Truman. And what about a truly great conversation with an old friend? You can't have a relationship like that with an 800 number.<p>The problem with the interactive future foreseen by communications gurus is that it isn't interpersonal. We need to interact with the big issues that define our future. We need to hurl philosophy back and forth at each other and not accept predigested information that passes for insight.<p>I've experienced the computer bulletin boards and the two-way dialogue that goes on between people who communicate via invented names and passwords but never really know each other. It's intentional. It's high-tech armor. To me, that's a technological cop-out for a lack of courage--the courage to put yourself on the line and accept responsibility. I get nervous when we celebrate technology for depersonalizing the individual. Don't get me wrong; I couldn't live without my Macintosh PowerBook, and I've been seduced by the new Newton personal digital assistant as well. But I'm hooked on these technologies only because they make me more productive and give me more time for real interaction with my family, friends, and other things, like a great novel. Or a great magazine. I'd love to hear how Worth is measuring up to your standards of interactivity. I can be reached at (212) 223-3100, fax (212) 223-1597. Or write to 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By W. Randall Jones<p>As we go to press, America is abuzz with talk about our health-care crisis. In Washington, hundreds of consultants, PhDs, Rhodes scholars, and Hillary are ordering in Domino's and pulling all-nighters as they sort through this intractable mess. But in their spare time, I wish they would turn this awesome brain power to another crisis__our financial health-care crisis. It's more damaging and more expensive than anyone has realized.<p>Think for a moment about the untold billions wasted because so many people don't understand what personal finance is all about. Even many sophisticated men and women don't understand the language or grasp the concepts.<p>The effect on our economy is devastating. It accounts for so many bankruptcies and mountains of personal debt__as well as millions of divorces. It's why smart people make stupid investments, why there's always a market for scams, why we don't make the right decisions about funding college or retirement, or buying a Warhol. (Speaking of such, this issue has a terrific piece on bottom-fishing in the art market.)<p>And wouldn't the S&L swindle that our children and grandchildren will pay for have been harder to put over on us if every American knew how to read a financial statement as well as we know how to read a box score?<p>We all agree that no one should be deprived of adequate health care. But we also must have access to adequate financial health care. I see a national Financial Health Care program that makes sure every family understands the basics of personal finance, has regular fiscal check-ups, including second opinions when required, and has objective help to turn to. (How about FMOs, Financial Maintenance Organizations, alongside HMOs?)<p>Like preventative medicine, investments in financial health will pay in the long run. We'd learn to invest smarter and save more. There would be fewer business failures; too many good ideas flounder because of financial failures. I also believe there would be far fewer divorces on every socioeconomic level: It isn't just the Kramdens who battle about budgets.<p>In its own way, Worth has sought to address the situation. Our objective is a new mastery of personal finance, helping readers rebalance their lives by controlling their financial destiny, instead of letting their destiny control them. We accomplish this by exploiting fresh territory with our own unique compass. This month's cover story, which examines the very real risk of a mutual fund panic, is a perfect example. Never ones for untempered pessimism, we offer sane steps you can take right now to build a bomb shelter around your portfolio. I'd love to hear from you about our July/August issue, or anything else that's on your mind. Call me at 212-223-3100 (fax 212-223-1597) or write me at 575 Lexington Avenue, New York, 10022.<p> <p><p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Options  <p> WELL SUITED  <p> By Tish Durkin  <p> Assuming that clothes make the man, the ultimate wardrobe coup must be a suit made expressly for the man (starting in the posh neighborhood of $1,400). The secrets of sartorial splendor: <p> Total fabrication. Even the finest men's retailers can carry only so many patterns and fabrics in so many styles. Custom tailors, on the other hand, are apt to boast hundreds of patterns, in an equally dizzying array of fabrics.   <p> A wearable lightness that's freeing. To appreciate the difference between a technologically "engineered" suit and one made by hand, you needn't notice that the collar is perfectly laid in or the shoulder stitching superbly spaced. Just breathe. "It feels like you're wearing a shirt--light, comfortable, zero restriction," says Skip Cuddy, a consultant at clothier Louis, Boston.   <p> The invisible army. Quiet but relentless needle-and-thread brigades preserve man's right to things like button holes that never fray and lapels that don't lie flat but roll. "We didn't like the thread for our handmade button holes; two-ply was too limp, four-ply too coarse," says Joseph Barrato, CEO of Brioni USA, which seconded a force of tailors to remove the problem ply.  <p> Only you. Say the word, and Nancy Hilton/Dormeuil (800-506-4400), a recently established alliance of French finery and American service-with-a-smile, will appear at your office (or at an airport during a layover). "Do you like to look dark and stately? Corporate but cool?" asks company president Nancy Hilton. Describe your ideal self, and six weeks from now you'll be putting on his trousers. <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Options  <p> TAP LESSONS <p>On-site breweries provide all you need to make beer  <p> By Robert Sullivan  <p> I have always been interested in brewing beer at home, on account of my close relationship with the end result. But I'm leery of the various processes, not to mention the necessary subcultural interests. ("Open Fermentation: It's OK to Leave the Lid Up," a recent article in the home-brewing journal Zymurgy, says, "The debate about open vs. closed fermentation will no doubt continue as long as there are interested brewers to debate.") I come from the school that believes weekends are intended for higher purposes than boiling kettles of greenish wort on the kitchen stove. Recently, however, I discovered an interactive brew-your-own alternative so new that it has yet to pick up a compellingly trendy name. At this point it is called on-site brewing.  <p> On-site brewing is to beer what Kinko's is to copying; the on-site brewer supplies you with everything you need, from hops to malt to the big copper kettles. You brew, go home for two weeks while the soon-to-be beer ferments, and return to carbonate and bottle your private label. It appears to have originated in 1986 in Ontario--where today there are about 140 on-site brewing facilities--as a response to the high cost of Canadian beer--a six-pack of Molson can run six bucks. Recently, Cask Brewing Systems, a Canadian firm, has sold on-site brewing systems in St. Louis, Chicago, not to mention Perth and Melbourne, Australia.  <p> I did my first on-site work at  the Glisan Street Brewhaus in Portland, Oregon. The Brewhaus is the first of its kind in Portland, which has been called the microbrew capital of America by the country's leading beer writer, Michael Jackson (no relation). I brought along my friend Mark, who is a passionate home brewer and even a sometime reader of Zymurgy. Naturally, Mark was skeptical about the on-site concept.  <p> When we arrived at the Brewhaus, we were given a few minutes to sample some of the 90 recipes we might choose from. We settled on a pale ale, not unlike Bass Ale (the recipe list includes brand-name flavor analogies for neophyte brewers like me). We began the process, and Mark raised a red flag, concerned about my not witnessing the entire pitching, the part in which they east consumes the fermentable sugars in the corn syrup. "You're missing a really critical part,'' he said.  <p> We next prepared chocolate malts and roasted barley, in accordance with our easy-to-follow recipe sheet. We then chose our hops, each batch sporting elysian names like Willamette, Irish Moss, and Ringwood. Doug Steele, the co-owner of the Brewhaus, shuttled us along, never allowing us to miss a step in the procedure. Eventually, Mark found a few nice things to say about the Brewhaus's sterilization. Sterilization is a huge part of home brewing.  <p> About an hour after arriving at the Brewhaus, we dropped our grains into a cheese cloth sack--a kind of beer tea bag--which we then lowered into the copper kettle. Every few minutes, we stirred the hopped mixture, called the wort. Feeling expert, I leaned over the kettle to inhale what would soon be my beer. <p> And then something happened that assured me of the rightness of on-site brewing (the rightness for me, anyway): I overheard Mark in conversation with another home brewer. They were talking about bad batches. Vile smells. Friends who had become violently ill. Here were home brewing's dirty little secrets. As it turnedout, the guy that Mark was talking to had come to the more sterile on-site brewing environment on the recommendation of his doctor. His doctor!  <p> After storing the beer in the Brewhaus's refrigerated room, we went away for two weeks while the yeast did its work. When we returned, our beer was carbonated mechanically. Home brewers tend to let the yeast do the fermenting, adding a little extra for the months or so between capping and consuming, so mechanized carbonation was another sore point with Mark. But he was brought around again by the quality of our product, which was smooth, copper-colored, 5 percent alcohol, and, as billed, "100% chemical free.'' It was also very good. It took an hour to bottle 12 gallons of pale ale, and we could have shaved 15 minutes off that if we hadn't stopped so many times to sip and congratulate ourselves. <p> In the end, Mark said the only thing he really missed was the smell of beer on the days he brewed as it wafted through all the rooms of his home. I would not miss sterilizing pots, and the smell of my beer in the Brewhaus was enough for me, not to mention my family. But when we were finished and split the bottles, Mark and I found common ground on the matter of quantity. Suddenly,12 gallons of such a fine, smooth ale didn't seem like enough.- <p> BEER BASICS  <p> At these on-site breweries, expect to pay about $100 for five cases of beer if you bring your own bottles; add $30 if you don't. <p> The Beer Store, Boulder, Colorado (303-494-7000); Brew City, San Francisco (415-929-2255); Brewworks, Hermosa Beach, California(310-376-0406); Custom Brew Haus, St. Louis (314-726-2739); Glisan Street Brewhaus, Portland, Oregon (503-223-9566).  <p>  <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Options  <p> SHUTTERBUGS  <p> By Lauren Goldstein  <p> Mary Ellen Mark and Bruce Weber each own one; Annie Leibovitz has three. Contax expected professional photographers to snapup their point-and-shoot titanium cameras with precision Carl Zeiss lenses. But the Contax T series has attracted a large following among non-professionals as well, and the reason is its retro good looks.   <p> The success of the line--launched in the early '80s--has focused other makers, including the more affordable Ricoh and Pentax, on the growing market for compact retro-styled cameras. Nikon's new Ti cameras were influenced by the styles of the '50s and'60s and include one feature that perhaps should have never been discontinued in the first place--the analog display panel for a perture, focus, and exposure readings. "People feel better about analog displays," says Frank Fennell, a Nikon marketing manager. "It is emotionally pleasing to be able to see all the controls at once." Late last year, at the urging of professional photographers, Contax introduced the G1--the first compact with "auto-everything" and interchangeable lenses. Retro cameras like the G1, Konica's Hexar Rhodium, and Nikon's 35Ti combine all the ease of a point-and-shoot with the quality of a single-lens-reflex camera. "The average person on vacation" wouldn't notice the differences between a picture shot with a conventional point-and-shoot and one shot with a single-lens-reflex camera, says Fennell. "The Ti is for those who can."  <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Options  <p> LET IT RAIN  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> Big and bright umbrellas aren't just for the golf course anymore. For good reasons, too: The colors are enough to lighten the darkest rainy-day blues, and anything designed to keep caddie, player, and bag all dry at once is ready for the streets.  <p> Size, though, can have its drawbacks. "Golf umbrellas are not something we recommend," says Mark Murray, the owner of Seattle's Weather or Not. "You can't know where other people are." Of course Murray still sells golf or jumbo umbrellas, along with opera umbrellas, waxed-cotton brollies from Scotland, V-shafted "double brellas," and a slew of designer bumbershoots. "Umbrellas are a strange mix of personality and need," says Murray. "They let you persevere, but you can do so with style."  <p> Designers are helping the humble umbrella overcome its gray history--Nicole Miller and Moschino are two of the more prominent figures unfurling colorful, witty patterns--but the issue of etiquette remains muddy: Who gives way when umbrella carriers cross paths? "It seems to be the law of the jungle," says Murray. Even at the genteel Swaine Adeney Brigg, holder of the royal umbrella warrant for the Queen Mother in England, there's no clear answer. "I don't know," says Marc Russell, a deputy manager at the company's London store. "But I think if it's a lady coming, you lift yours up."  <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Options  <p> COURAGE 101  <p> By Christina Frank  <p> I once lopped an entire week off a two-week vacation by taking the train round-trip from New York to San Francisco. I Amtraked it not to save money, not to take in the scenery, but because I was convinced that to fly is to die. Then I learned that people like me could be helped. I enrolled in a crash course for the aerophobic.  <p> Saturday, 8 a.m.: I arrive at a Holiday Inn near Newark Airport for American Airlines' weekend AAirborn seminar. I meet 13 other fearful fliers who are sitting in a circle along with Sandra Brown, a counselor who leads the group, and Michael McKenzie, a pilot with American. Brown asks each of us to tell the group why we need the course. Two people knew someone who died in a plane crash. One woman said her kids kept wondering why their friends get to vacation at Disneyland while they go to cities like Trenton, New Jersey, and Wilmington, Delaware. The AAirborn approach is to train us to think about flying as logical, rational people. Brown starts by offering us some comforting statistics. We learn that the chances of dying in a domestic plane crash are 1 in 11 million, but those of being killed while walking are 1 in 26,000, and while driving, 1 in 5,000.  <p> Then McKenzie's on. Believing that knowledge is power, he presents an extensive slide show and lecture, giving us more facts about the mechanics of flying, pilot training, and the rigorous FAA standards than we ever wanted to know. Turbulence, he stresses repeatedly, "is not a safety issue; it's a comfort issue." Later, he takes us on board a stationary aircraft, explains all the controls in the cockpit, and introduces us to "George," the autopilot. Brown teaches us numerous relaxation exercises involving deep breathing and positive imaging. She then gives us each a rubber band, which we are to wrap around our hands and snap violently if a catastrophic thought (such as "Isn't it so obvious that a planeload of fearful fliers is going to crash tomorrow?") enters our heads. At 6 p.m., our fretful minds somewhat soothed, our palms sporting enormous welts, we go home to do things--like eat (1,200 deaths per year)--that are much riskier than flying. <p> Sunday, 8 a.m.: In three and a half hours we're scheduled to take an hour-long flight to Raleigh/Durham. Two classmates decide they're not ready to get airborne. The rest of us talk about how we're feeling. I'm tense. Brown gets on the plane to talk us through our anxieties, while McKenzie quizzes us: "What's that noise?" To which we respond in unison, "That's the landing gear retracting."   <p> Once on the ground, we all admit that the flight wasn't so bad. One woman claims to be completely cured. The rest of us are still anxious, but significantly less so. We are given a diploma, a hug, and a pin. The return flight is even easier, with more chatting and less snapping and breathing than before. When we land, I, as always, feel tremendous relief. But armed with loads of statistics, exercises, and my trusty rubber band, I know that the next time I plan to travel long distance, I won't be calling Amtrak.  <p>  <p>WHAT IT COSTS: $495.  <p> WHAT YOU GET: An abbreviated course in aerodynamics and FAA regulations; a stress gauge; a round-trip flight to a nearby city; two continental breakfasts and one lunch.  <p> WHAT YOU MIGHT BUY INSTEAD:   <p> * A round-trip ticket to St. Thomas and a six-week supply of Xanax. <p>* 83 Bloody Marys. <p>* 2-1/2 round-trip tickets from New York to Los Angeles on a Greyhound bus. <p>* A rental car for nine days.  <p> BOTTOM LINE: Don't expect miracles, but do expect to improve. Most major airlines offer seminars. For information on this one, call 800-451-5106.  <p>  <p> <p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>THE TOAST OF SOUTH AFRICA
Americans take up the cause of Cape-grown wines<p>By Karen MacNeil<p>Most restaurant diners have never scanned a wine list with the hope of finding something delicious from South Africa. That's beginning to change. In 1994 U.S. importers brought in an estimated 80,000 cases of South African wine, representing more than 200 different labels. While that's peanuts compared with a winery like Robert Mondavi, which alone sells more than a million cases a year, it's amazing considering that five years ago the number of South African wines sold here was zero.<p>South Africa is one of the oldest and most prominent wine regions in the New World, with a wine-making tradition that is three centuries old, yet the wines have remained largely unknown here because of trade sanctions imposed in response to South African apartheid. In the last year, thanks to the sales muscle of about a dozen determined American importers and an extremely weak South African rand, South African wines have begun to turn up throughout the United States, both in wine shops and in top restaurants like New York City's Lespinasse and the Dining Room of the Ritz-Carlton in San Francisco. "South Africa has the makings of the next California or Australia," says Ronn Wiegand, publisher of the journal Restaurant Wine.<p>When the first advertisement for the Cape Wine of the Month Club appeared in the Wine Spectator last August, the telephone rang off the hook for weeks, according to club president John Gorman. The club evaluates and rates all commercially available South African wines and then sells them, usually at discounted prices. They retail for between $6 and $20 a bottle. "At those prices, the best Cape wines stand shoulder to shoulder with the best wines in the world," says Gorman.<p>Cape Classics, one of the earliest importers and marketers of South African wines in the United States, brings in nine Cape wines from small estates. When Andre Shearer (a white South African) and Jabulani Ntshangase (a black South African) founded the company in 1992, apartheid was still an open wound. Yet at a time when the very words "South Africa" could make people edgy, Shearer and Ntshangase could already imagine hip dinner parties at which guests sipped Glen Carlou chardonnay or Pierre Jourdan Brut, a sparkling wine from the Cape's Franschoek Valley.<p>Cape wine makers are both geographically and climatically blessed. The Cape of South Africa is the only wine region in the world that is tucked between two oceans. Cool breezes off the Atlantic and Indian oceans moderate the generally hot climate. Most important, the best vineyard areas are situated on cool, high slopes, so the grapes mature slowly and evenly--a virtual prerequisite for wines of depth and character.<p>The top wine districts are Stellenbosch, Paarl, Constantia, Durbanville, and Franschoek (area of origin is generally listed on the label). In South Africa, as in the United States, wines are named for the grape varietal from which they are made. The most popular South African white wine is chenin blanc, locally called steen. The leading red grape is cinsaut (cinsault in French), which in France is a meaty component in many southern and Rhne wines. In 1926, Cape cinsaut was genetically crossed with pinot noir in a South African laboratory. The result was pinotage--a wine varietal not grown anywhere else in the world.<p>In most wine regions, one or two grape types always seem to produce the best wine: the riesling grape in the Mosel, for example, pinot noir in Burgundy, sangiovese in Tuscany, cabernet sauvignon in the Napa Valley. In South Africa, the star is sauvignon blanc. Madeline Triffon, sommelier of Detroit's Rattlesnake Club restaurant, praises South African sauvignon blanc for its fresh, grapefruity flavor. "While we make very good cabernet and chardonnay," says Peter Koff, founder of Fairest Cape Importing, another importer of small, prestigious Cape estate wines, "South Africa makes the most extraordinary sauvignon blanc in the world. We can easily rival New Zealand, which is renowned for that grape."<p>South African wines have also had their critics. New York Times wine reporter Frank J. Prial, for example, found "too much oak" in many South African wines, particularly the chardonnays. In 1993, the journal The New York Wine Cellar found "far too many" Cape wines to be "watery" and said that some revealed "flaws typically displayed by wines from producers with limited experience." Koff diplomatically suggests that some Americans have grown accustomed to what he calls the "bouncy, up-front fruitiness of California and Australian wines." South African wines, he says, are much more lean and taut, like European wines. He pauses. "Maybe that's bad wine making. Or maybe that's adhering to centuries of tradition."<p>
CAPE GRAPES<p>For American consumers who use California wine as their benchmark, Cape wines will come as something of a shock. These wines have their own distinct personality--a personality that takes some getting used to. South Africa's wildly herbal, razor-sharp sauvignon blanc, for example, makes California sauvignon look positively tame. As for Cape chardonnays, expect big, heavy-handed wines with the full-throttle sweetness that comes from lots of toasted oak. With Cape red wines, an unusual smokey/bacony aroma and flavor are often present. The cabernets and pinotages are usually lean wines, with more pronounced tannin than generous fruit. Here are some suggestions:<p>* Zonnebloem Sauvignon Blanc ($10)
* Villiera Estate Sauvignon Blanc ($9)
* Thelema Mountain Sauvignon Blanc ($13)
* Glen Carlou Chardonnay ($17)
* Louisvale Chardonnay ($15)
* Meerlust Rubicon ($16)
* La Motte Estate Millennium ($11)
* Villiera Estate Cru Monro ($15)
* Rozendal Farm ($16)
* Blaauwklippen Zinfandel ($15)
* Middelvlei Estate Pinotage ($9.50)<p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>POWER SEATING<p>By Lauren Goldstein<p>Those ceremonial office chairs once found in the executive suite are being retired. Modern executives need seating better suited to long days at the computer. According to Ergonomic Living by Gordon Inkeles and Iris Schencke (Fireside Books, $16), that extra foot at the back of older chairs "conveys a regal impression at the expense of the executive's health. A high backed chair pushes the upper back forward while forcing the lower back to bend backwards." <p>These aren't idle concerns. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration plans to propose mandatory standards for ergonomically correct workplaces this year, including recommendations for desk chairs. The most important is that an office chair be easily adjusted. "The body was made to move," says Barbara Silverstein, special assistant for ergonomic programs at OSHA. The Picto from Wilkhahn automatically adjusts the angle of its seat and backrest to the weight, posture, and movements of the user. Another consideration is lower-back support. The Sapper chair, from the Knoll Group, is being reissued with additional lumbar support and cushioning. Herman Miller's radical new Aeron chair is made of a meshlike fabric covering a frame that distributes weight evenly on the seat. It's so unusual that the Museum of Modern Art in New York City acquired one for its permanent collection. "It's got an unsettling and mechanistic aesthetic that is perfectly suited to these times," says Paola Antonelli, associate design curator at MoMA. "It's also the most comfortable chair you can dream of."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>PLATONIC RELATIONSHIPS
Still have some things to learn about life? Try a tutor.<p>By John Marchese<p>Not long ago, Bill Tonelli decided to talk to someone one day a week about life and what it all means.<p>"I figured everyone else in New York had their therapist," says Tonelli. But the weekly sessions he arranged were a bit different. For one thing, he didn't go to a plush, paneled office with overstuffed furniture but to a tavern just off the campus of Columbia University.<p>And instead of talking about himself, he discussed Plato and Nietzsche and Bertrand Russell. Across the table was a Columbia Ph.D. candidate in philosophy, whom Tonelli had hired to guide him through a reading list in Western philosophy--a subject he had overlooked in college. He paid his tutor $25 an hour and bought the beer.<p>"I figured this was kind of like therapy for people who are ill-suited to it," says Tonelli, a magazine editor. "Supposedly, the point of philosophy is to teach us how to live, which is also the point of therapy."<p>Over the past few decades adult education has become a major growth industry. It has filled college classroom seats during a drought of traditional students and has helped adults get credentials or socialize. But for someone who wants to learn a subject for the sheer joy of it, tutoring might be the best way to go about it.<p>For years, University of Chicago president Robert Maynard Hutchins and his colleague Mortimer Adler taught the great books in Socratic style to titans of Chicago industry, in what became aptly dubbed the Fat Man's course. A few years ago, then media wunderkind Chris Whittle hired three different Harvard professors to tutor him in preparation for a possible political life in his home state of Tennessee until business pressures forced him to stop the sessions. Lately, Hollywood lawyer Bert Fields has been throwing monthly history dinners with a former history graduate student and radio talk-show host leading the discussion.<p>But you needn't be wealthy to be tutored. Pricewise, it's a practical way to learn. A three-credit course in Columbia's School of General Studies (which caters to older students) would cost about $1,600. A dozen sessions with a $25-an-hour tutor comes to $300.<p>The best place to look for a tutor is at a local university. (Don't bother calling the tutoring companies that advertise in the Yellow Pages. They're geared to high school students.) Call the chairman of the department you think is most appropriate for your subject and ask if there are tutors available. If you're having trouble figuring out which department to approach, try the college's public-relations department. Most keep lists of faculty experts on various topics. But don't expect to a get a senior professor from a prestigious university--unless you're willing to pay rich man's prices.<p>"If I were to tutor a student, they'd have to prove they were really serious, and I'd probably charge what it would cost to take a course--maybe $250 a shot," says one Ivy League professor and former department chairman. He means per session, which is steeper than most psychiatrists. "But," the professor added, "my graduate students would be delighted to supplement their income."<p>Michelle Heaps, a student who works in the tutoring department at the University of California at Berkeley, says the going local rate for a graduate-student tutor is $15 or $20 an hour, which often buys plenty of enthusiasm. "There are people here who just can't stop talking about the subject they are studying," she says.<p>But it's not just hungry graduate students who would be good and willing tutors. Some professional practitioners need extra money. Want help writing that novel? Most cities have writers' organizations that can recommend teachers, or you could call a novelist for lessons. In Philadelphia, Rachel Simon (author of the well-reviewed novel The Magic Touch) used to teach writing at several universities but has recently redirected her efforts toward finding private students. She charges $60 a week for a writing lesson and critique. When she tutors students, she says, "I feel they're getting a real education, and I'm able to be a real teacher."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>MOVIE MAGIC<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Coming to a theater near you is . . . well, a new kind of theater. Not since the 1950s, when moviegoers were reeled in by such innovations as 70-millimeter film and CinemaScope, has the competition to sell tickets been so technological. Virtual reality, 3-D headsets, moving seats, even computers that let viewers determine the plot, are some of the lures that theaters are using to fill seats.<p>Sony's eight-story-high Imax screen in New York City grossed more than any other single commercial screen in North America over one weekend shortly after opening last fall. And that was before it had Hollywood features to exhibit. This spring the theater premieres Wings of Courage, directed by Oscar winner Jean-Jacques Annaud and starring Val Kilmer and Elizabeth McGovern.<p>Imax, Iwerks, and Showscan are the movers and shakers in another type of theater experience: ride films, in which movable seats are synchronized with onscreen motion. Examples include RoboCop: The Ride and Back to the Future: The Ride (see Options, July/August 1994). Last summer Showscan signed an agreement with United Artists Theater Circuit to bring the technology to multiplexes around the country.<p>Interfilm offers yet another theater experience: audience control of the action. This interactive approach involves lots of shouting and pressing of buttons on specially outfitted armrests. At various moments during a program audience members press one of three buttons, shaping the material into a 20-minute film (the price of admission includes three viewings). The company's first interactive feature, Mr. Payback, starring Christopher Lloyd and written by Bob Gale, the screenwriter of the Back to the Future movies, opens this month at about 50 theaters.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>CIGAR CHIC<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Jack Nicholson, David Letterman, and Madonna aren't the only ones puffing on cigars with insouciance. The premium-cigar industry, with sales up 30 percent last year, is growing faster than you can ask, "Mind if I smoke?" Restaurants acknowledge the trend, too: New York City's Tatou recently opened an upscale cigar lounge. To get a good table, you'd better smoke the best. Here's how to choose:<p>Is it fresh? Like fine wine, premium cigars must be pampered. A reputable cigar retailer like Wally's in West Los Angeles houses its finest in humidors. You gauge freshness by gently pinching the cigar's middle: It should give a bit and feel slightly oily. <p>Check for craftsmanship. A quality cigar is never predrilled for inhaling. Each has a flap of tobacco at the rounded end; you slice it off before lighting up. The wrapper should consist of one whole leaf with visible veins.<p>Size matters. "Many women opt for the thinner cigarillo," says Craig Nelson, founder of the Cigar of the Month Club (800-700-7661). But it's not all image: Size and shape affect taste too. A thick cigar delivers cooler smoke and fuller flavor.<p>Easy does it. Most Dominican and Jamaican cigars make for mild beginner smokes. An Ashton ($4$11.50), an Anniversario No. 2 ($15), or a Nat Sherman's VIP ($4$5) offers mellow taste. Later, try the Honduran Zino Mouton Cadet ($4$6). As for the fabled Cuban cigar, you'll have to wait for Fidel's fall or buy abroad. Black market Cubans are often poor-quality counterfeits.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>A BETTER WHEY
The country's finest restaurants say "Cheese"<p>By John Mariani<p>If you've recently noticed an odd but familiar odor wafting through the air of the better restaurants in your city, you are probably sniffing one of the more blatant--and delectable--examples of an ongoing backlash against the nutritional terrorism of the past decade. After years when the idea of serving fat-rich, cholesterol-laden Camembert, Stilton, or Gorgonzola at the end of a meal was regarded as the height of coronary folly, many of the best restaurants in America are now offering an array of superb cheeses.<p>"American chefs are coming out of the closet now with cheeses," says cheese maker Jonathan White of the Egg Farm Dairy in Peekskill, New York, which supplies top New York City restaurants like Chanterelle, Le Bernardin, and Aureole. "I think the last straw for people was the study showing that margarine is as bad or worse for you than butter. That broke the back of Americans' guilt over fat, and with more and more terrific cheeses now available, people are willing to sample them at fine restaurants. The interest is exploding nationally."<p>"The demand is definitely growing every year," says Chantal Plasse, an expert on French cheese at La Ferme Imports in San Francisco who has trained restaurant staffs on how best to handle, serve, and promote fine cheeses. "Four years ago when I talked to chefs about cheese, it was like speaking Chinese. There was just no demand. But I'd get them to buy just one good cheese and promote it as a special item, and it sold. Now cheese is becoming very important to many of the best chefs in America."<p>At mad.61, a vast restaurant and retail shop in the basement of New York City's uptown Barney's department store, more than 40 cheeses are on display, including a wide range of rarely seen Italian imports like Toma di Carmagnola and Brezzi, English classics like farmhouse Appleby Cheshire and Keen's Somerset Cheddar, French regional cheeses like Vacherin Mont d'Or from the Jura, and superb American types like Coach Farm Chevre, Vella Dry Jack, and Teleme. Since many diners are reluctant to add an additional course to their meal, chef Marta Pulini suggests trying cheese as the main course. The menu lists eight separate cheese plates to help them choose.<p>Americans still only eat about half as much cheese per capita as the French, Italians, and Greeks do, although we are eating 30 percent more than we did ten years ago--mostly as pizza toppings. But restaurateurs are finding that once their customers sample a good cheese, they become hooked on the idea. At Chicago's new Zinfandel, chef-partner Susan Goss serves a farmhouse sampler consisting of three American cheeses, like Yerba Santa Alpine Chevre from California, Granville Cheddar from Massachusetts, Chicory Farms Catahoula from Louisiana, and Loomis Great Lakes Cheshire from Michigan, together with marinated greens and grilled country bread. To encourage diners to try them, Goss offers cheese as an appetizer. "The attitude that European cheeses are always better is changing because of some very dedicated American cheese makers," she says.<p>Tom Colicchio of New York City's hottest new restaurant, Gramercy Tavern, agrees. Each evening he offers 15 cheeses in three-, five-, and seven-variety tastings. Set on a beautiful serving tray in full view of diners as they enter and accompanied by a terrific array of dessert wines, beers, and ciders, the selection of cheeses changes nightly. Many of them are American, like Indiana's Capriole Banon goat cheese aged in chestnut leaves. "I'm a big fan of American cheeses," says Colicchio. "I think American cheese making is where wine making was 25 years ago in this country, and I want to serve the very best we can find."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>BY THE BOOK
Daily planners let busy people schedule in style.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Forget about the Newton. Corporate dons and divas still prefer bulging daily planners over electronic organizers to take control of their lives and signify social stature. A casual flip through the pages in front of clients and colleagues reveals who you know, where you eat, and how often you are called upon to RSVP.<p>More than 10 million Americans rely on these compact calendars to plot their every move. Cindy Crawford manages her own schedule with an organizer, and some ultra-harried types have it even better -- Donna Karan's assistant carries her planner for her. Jerome Want, managing director of Organization Strategies in New York, prefers a paper planner to an electronic one: "It makes a better record when filing taxes, and it won't ever break down."<p>Consultants aren't alone in touting the day planner. Taste makers from Giorgio Armani to architect Michael Graves know that the book you carry reveals as much about you as what's written on the pages. They both offer sleek leather books that marry fashion with function. Timberland is joining them with a line of desktop agendas designed for their customers' rugged tastes. But the most prestigious of planners can't be bought. The embossed, cobalt blue, bound leather book of Paris's Hotel Ritz is bestowed upon its VIP guests. According to spokeswoman Celine Canot, the hotel fields about ten requests per week for the planner during the first months of the year. "Of course," she says, "we are highly selective about who we send one to." Bien sur. <p><p><p><p>

THE WHEEL WORLD
Perks -- not big savings -- are driving buyers to take delivery of new cars in Europe.<p>
By Stephan Wilkinson<p>
Anybody old enough to recall only the good things about MG TDs, Porsche 356s, and Fiat Topolinos also remembers the golden age of buying a car in Europe -- with a dollar so strong an American could save as much as 25 percent by purchasing an auto on foreign soil. The downside, however, was the risky, time-consuming work involved: haggling with a Gauloise-smoking European car salesman, finding a seedy shipping agent, delivering the car to a pier in Rotterdam, and venturing to deepest Brooklyn to retrieve it.<p>
Times have changed. Today, European "tourist delivery plans" are easy-on, easy-off. Dealers do much of the legwork. Buyers can save as much as 12 percent off the list price of the identical car bought domestically. But the most compelling allure may be having a new car ready and waiting in Europe for your next vacation. This provides the opportunity to take your new roadster for a spin on the autobahns and Alpine passes for which it was designed. Here's a rundown of the major programs:<p>
BMW (800-932-0831) As with most European-delivery programs, you should order your car two or three months ahead of time and pay in full five weeks before pickup. You can save as much as 10 percent, and the purchase price includes a month's insurance, paperwork, shipping, and delivery (from 18 European drop-off points between Madrid and Oslo) to your local dealer in the United States.<p>
MERCEDES-BENZ (800-367-6372) Savings on a new Benz generally run about 6 percent in this, one of the oldest and easily the most popular tourist programs. "The company makes less money," says Fred Heiler of Mercedes-Benz North America, "but we do it because people who go to the plant, see cars exactly like theirs being made, and drive away in one -- we think that instills really strong long-term customer loyalty."<p>
PORSCHE (702-348-3000) Pickup and drop-off are available free solely at the factory in Stuttgart, Germany. Run-of-the-mill customers, if the term applies to any Porsche pilots, get a factory tour and lunch, but three times a year -- during April, June, and September in 1995 -- Porsche Cars North America organizes special tours that include two days of wining and dining, a visit to Porsche's R&D center, and test-track rides with factory test drivers.<p>
SAAB (800-582-7222) You don't have to go to the factory to pick up your new Saab; there are 11 other delivery locations in Europe and the U.K. But if you do make the trek to Trollhattan, Sweden, Saab will send a limo to pick you up, and you'll be fed and bunked in a lovely manor house overnight and sent on your way (usually after a factory tour) with savings of about 10 percent, maps, itinerary, and good Swedish cheer. <p>
VOLVO (800-631-1667) Save 8 to 12 percent over U.S. list, plus an extra $510 if you retrieve your car at any of ten East and West Coast ports. "But oddly enough, we have a pocket of people in Minneapolis, some of our best customers, who use this program year after year," says Nancy Nelle, manager of overseas delivery. Volvo has three free drop-off points in Europe (Antwerp, Belgium; Bremerhaven, Germany; and Goteborg, Sweden) plus another 22 that will accept the car for shipment at slight extra cost.<p>
FERRARI (201-816-2600) The simplest program of all. You don't save a single lira. "But we'll tailor the arrangements however the customer wants," says Ferrari North America's Michael Jacklin, "and I have yet to meet a person who didn't wax rhapsodical about the factory tour, lunch at Cavallino [the Ferrari "house restaurant"] across the street from the factory, and the Italian roads. It truly inspires people." Cost of the lunch? A minimum of $120,050 for an entry-level Ferrari 355. <p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>SOMETHING WILD
Americans flock to game birds, an alternative to turkey.<p>By Susan Kuchinskas<p>It's not your forefathers' thanksgiving. Interest in fowl like quail, pheasant, and guinea hen has risen over the last few years. The USDA reports its inspections of game birds have increased 65-fold since 1983. The turkey may not be in danger of losing its status as a holiday icon, but it's clear that consumers are searching for tasty, exotic alternatives.<p>Nutrition is one reason people are reconsidering their Butterballs: Game birds tend to have less fat and more protein. The muscovy duck, for example, which nests in trees, doesn't need body fat to keep warm and has well-developed breast muscles, making it lean and meaty. Size is another factor in the alternative fowl's popularity. Forget turkey soup and turkey sandwiches. Two quail, with an average weight of about six ounces each, serve a single eater; a goose, at eight to twelve pounds, makes a very nice meal for four.<p>Ariane Daguin, co-owner of D'Artagnan, a New Jersey wild-game importer, reports that her sales of game poultry are up 30 percent over the last few years. She credits top restaurant chefs with encouraging American eaters to be adventurous and teaching them that gamy flavors are not a negative. "A real game bird is not going to be anything like a domesticated bird," says Thomas Keller, chef-owner of the French Laundry in Yountville, California. "It's going to have that rich, almost liver-type flavor to it." Keller regularly puts squab on his menu. Its subtle flavor appeals to cautious palates -- compared to wild pigeon or grouse, it's positively tame.<p>The taste of wild game changes throughout the year as the birds' diets change, but they are at their flavor peak around the holidays. "Fall is the best season, because they've eaten all the different berries and seeds," says Daniel Boulud, owner of Restaurant Daniel in Manhattan. "Some eat a lot of juniper, and that flavors the meat in a nice way." <p>A wide variety of game birds is now available by mail from the sources below. Though prices vary according to purveyor and season, expect to pay around $2.50 per bird for quail and $5.50 per pound for pheasant. The ultimate indulgence is to have poultry jetted in from Scotland; prices start at around $6.95 each for wood pigeons, which weigh less than a pound, and reach $15 for pheasants, which usually weigh in at two pounds. Count on additional charges for express shipping.<p>D'ARTAGNAN (800-327-8246) Wild game from Scotland; free-range chicken, turkey, game birds, and game meats; sausages, terrines, and foie gras specialties.<p>DURHAM NIGHT BIRD (800-225-7457) Domestic free-range game and poultry; pates, terrines, pancettas, and sausages.<p>FOGGY RIDGE GAME BIRD FARM (207-273-2357) Free-range pheasant, quail, partridge, wild turkey, geese, and ducks.<p>POLERICA GAME EXCHANGE (800-426-3872) Domestic free-range game birds, including guinea, partridge, quail, squab, and poussin. <p>WILD GAME (312-278-1661) Wild Scottish partridge, wild American turkey, wood pigeon, venison; natural free-range Amish chicken and turkey; poussin.<p>WYLIE HILL FARM (802-586-2887) "Farm-raised" natural free-range pheasant, quail, partridge, and guinea hens; quail eggs.<p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>HABLA MEXICO CITY?
Navigating a trip to Latin America's hottest business center.<p>By Susan Enfield<p>HOTELS: CHECKING OUT WHAT'S IN<p>$
---------------
The HOTEL IMPERIAL (705-4911 -- all phone numbers in 525 area code; doubles from $120) is a 1904 landmark that subsequently housed Mexican president Venustiano Carranza and the U.S. embassy (not at the same time). Newly renovated, it's a popular  base for those working with government or banking headquarters in the nearby historical center.<p>Studio-apartment-like rooms with kitchenettes and a location on one of the Zona Rosa's poshest promenades make the MARCO POLO (511-1839; doubles from $165) a favorite with travelers in creative fields.<p>$$
---------------
Pink and blue postmodern on the outside, luxuriously ersatz art deco on the inside, the HOTEL MARQUIS REFORMA (211-3600; doubles from $205) is riding the NAFTA wave. Rooms are fully booked two weeks in advance by those who can't survive without the  services of a bilingual secretary or a dedicated fax line.<p>The CAMINO REAL (203-2121; doubles from $200) is no longer the capital's most technologically up-to-the-minute hotel, but its funky, distinctly Mexican atmosphere makes it hands down the most fun. Among its charming idiosyncrasies are the city's  best outdoor swimming pool and an endlessly meandering roof garden.<p>$$$
---------------
Built around a parklike inner courtyard, the newly opened FOUR SEASONS HOTEL MEXICO CITY (800-332-3442; doubles from $225), with its elegant Spanish colonial-style exterior, is the perfect refuge for Wall Street types to recuperate after a long day  in the world's smoggiest metropolis. <p>The CASA VIEJA (282-0067; doubles from $250) is so impeccably decorated that it recently made the cover of Mexico's leading architectural magazine. This exclusive hideaway shelters a hotel-phobic elite including Virgin Atlantic's Richard Branson.  Designed for longer-term stays, ten apartments boast more than the comforts of home: VCRs, CD players -- and pre-Columbian artifacts.<p>
RESTAURANTS: PLATS DU JOUR<p>$
---------------
Ceiling-rattling serenades by a mariachi band make late dinners at the candlelit hot spot LA CIRCUNSTANCIA (529-4140; dinner for two, about $50) feel like a fiesta. Cordon Bleu-trained chef-owner Roberto Santibanez renders traditional dishes  practically unrecognizable: Try the blackberry-based mole sauce and vol-au-vent of huitlacoche (a black corn fungus prized by the Aztecs).<p>An urbane, Chanel-suited crowd and a bar serving 16 different tequilas "macho style" -- in a chili-powder-rimmed shot glass with a spicy O.J. chaser -- make LOS ALCATRACES (281-4909; dinner for two, about $50) popular with local yuppies. Bring a  dictionary to translate the menu, which is a flowery paean to Alta Cocina Mexicana, the current rage for updating Mexican standards with exotic ingredients.<p>$$
---------------
With a chef from the original location in New York, REMI (282-0062; dinner for two, about $85) manages to replicate the food, including Venetian risottos and ravioli, in the most sophisticated room in town, overlooking Chapultepec Park. <p>With sister restaurants in Merida and Ticul, LOS ALMENDROS (531-6646; dinner for two, about $65), an upscale Yucatan cuisine purveyor, serves up hearty exotica like venison fajitas, jalabi (wild pig), and pork pibil (slow roasted in a banana leaf)  in a breezy, patiolike setting.<p>$$$
---------------
The just-opened branch of Spago may receive its stiffest competition from LA GALVIA (281-2310; dinner for two about $100). The food, from gravlax to shellfish chile relleno, is a favorite with the business elite. The menu changes seasonally, greens  are organic, and desserts are made to order. One of very few top restaurants confident enough to dispense with traditional coat and tie requirements.<p>At CICERO CENTENARIO (521-2934; dinner for two, about $100), step through the lace-curtained doors of a 300-year-old hacienda and experience the pleasures of life as a pre-revolutionary patron. Who cares if some of the Mexican and continental  specialties seem a tad old-fashioned? <p>
SHOPPING<p>Skip the cavernous new Centro Comercial Sante Fe and the shops on Mazaryk Street; the boutiques there sell the same designer merchandise you can buy at home. Focus instead on handmade wares. Tucked away in a courtyard in fashionable Polanco, LAS ARTESANIAS (Oscar Wilde No. 29) is a one-stop source of expertly selected, top-quality regional handicrafts: talavera, or traditional ceramic ware, from Puebla and Guanajuato; painted wooden animals and black pottery from Oaxaca; copperware from  Michoacan; and woven rebozos, or shawls, from San Luis Potosi. Prices are better than at FONART, the government-owned store.<p>Ask any local where to buy silver, and you're likely to get the same answer: TANE (Campos Elisios No. 218). The imposing vaultlike boutique doesn't exactly shout "bargain," but savvy Districto Federale matrons insist the handmade jewelry and  flatware is not only heavier and purer here, but often competitively priced.<p>A no-frills showroom on a Zona Rosa side street, TEMOAYA (Hamburgo No. 235) is the place to find all-wool tepates, or traditional Mexican rugs. Handwoven with 140,000 knots per square meter, the colorful, indigenous patterned rugs are somewhat cheaper than fine Orientals.<p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>BASIC BLACK TIE
With a tuxedo in your closet, looking good is a mere formality.<p>By Tish Durkin<p>If clothes make the man, the tuxedo makes the gentleman. The perfect gentleman -- if you know the rules. Which, incidentally, are:<p>BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL. For an Oscar acceptance the rainbow's the limit. Otherwise, the only color is no color at all. Your tuxedo must blend to perfection at formal-wear free-for-alls and in corporate cultures where chalk stripe is a crime. (Whenever you've gotta be you, just go crazy with a colorful cummerbund.)<p>SIZZLE, DON'T SHINE. Spend $400-plus on a fine, lightweight wool -- or $1,500-plus on the finest. Skimp with a reflective, polyester-enhanced number, and they'll give you a drink order.<p>CHERISH YOUR CHOICES. Peak, shawl, or notched lapel? According to Kevin Lonergan, Brooks Brothers formal-wear buyer: The top-selling notch is safe; the peak is a notch higher up on the lapel; and the rounded shawl is "fashion-forward" and tuxedo-specific -- but they're all correct. Vents or no vents? "Never vents! Too sportif!" growls Werner Baldessarini, head designer for Hugo Boss. Trouser pleats or no trouser pleats? These days pleats are in.<p>TWIST AND SHOUT. Or at least stand and sit in your prospective garment. "Men do more in a tuxedo than other suits," says Richard Cohen, president of the menswear maker Zegna, so though a tux should fit like any suit, it should feel even better. For purposes of the smooth move, think twice about that dramatic double-breasted model: it "sort of crumbles when you sit down," says Harvey Weinstein, chairman of Lord West, America's largest manufacturer of formal wear. A single looks good open or closed.<p>RELAX. So long as you get a size that fits in a form that flatters, any tuxedo is guaranteed to make you look much more handsome than you really are. So just clap on a tie, slap on the Aramis, and go get Ginger Rogers. You, after all, have turned into Fred Astaire. <p><p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>ANCIENT CHINESE SECRETS
Using art and design to attract luck and prosperity.<p>By Myriam Weisang Misrach<p>Every deal that the company tried to complete died, but it wasn't the management team's fault. No, the problem was the conference room. It was shaped like a coffin. Then there was the case of the entertainment executive who feared he was about to suffer the fate of his predecessor, who was forced out because of extravagant spending. Solution: Install a planted window box to keep money from flying out of his office window.<p>These stories are told by Sarah Rossbach, a New York-based expert in feng shui (pronounced fung shway), the complex Chinese system of architecture and design used to bring about good luck and prosperity. Rossbach's full consulting calendar is proof that the latest dabbler in ancient Chinese philosophy is perhaps the least likely: corporate America. She has brought feng shui, a blend of Buddhism, Taoism, astrology, numerology, and common sense, to employees at <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>, Ogilvy & Mather, Grey Advertising, and Peregrine Capital Management. <p>Rossbach recommends how and where walls, windows, and even buildings should be placed, but sometimes the feng shui solution is merely a matter of furniture placement: Make sure the door to your office opens fully, or it may block your career. <p>Because feng shui often involves little time and expense, it's quite easy to practice. Rossbach's latest book, "Living Color: Master Lin Yun's Guide to Feng Shui and the Art of Color" (Kodansha, $18), is just reaching bookstores. Who knows? Perhaps it's not the weak dollar or the unpredictable stock market that's thwarting you after all. Maybe it's just the direction your chair is facing.<p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>WARMING TO CASHMERE
What to look for when buying something warm and fuzzy.<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Cashmere, the champagne of cloth, has never come cheap, but this fall it will be even more of an extravagance as unprecedented demand sends the price of raw materials skyward. Here's what separates the cream from the crop: <p>A MONGOLIAN BIRTH CERTIFICATE. Long before it's spun into sweaters, cashmere gets its start as the thermal underwear of Kel goats, from -- you guessed it -- Kashmir. Though lushly lingeried goats can be found in a number of freezing, arid places, the best do their shivering in Inner Mongolia.<p>THE RIGHT FLUFF. The hand, or feel, of a good cashmere is soft. But soft is a theme with variations. The same tight weave that gives cashmere remarkable warmth for its weight also gives it a firmness of feel. How firm is up to you -- but the fabric should be far from flimsy. In the store, "it should look even and flat; the fibers should run in one direction," advises Pier Luigi Guerci, president of cashmere manufacturer Loro Piana USA, which wouldn't let a substandard strand near its warehouse.<p>PERFECT PURITY. Though good things can come from blending cashmere with silk or wool, the same can't be said of blending it with paper pulp or cat's hair. A 100 percent cashmere label should reassure you, but not if it's accompanied by a suspiciously low price. "If I saw 100 percent cashmere for $100," says Luigi Leonardi, executive vice president of Maniffature Associate Cashmere USA, "I'd bet my last dollar that it's not pure."<p>AN UNIMPEACHABLE SOURCE. Don't assume that great designers have great taste in textiles -- if you want fine as well as famous, ask whose cloth Donna or Calvin cut from. Ballantyne or Loro Piana are among the very best answers. <p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>SALAD DAYS
A New York restaurant's recipe for lasting success.<p>By John House<p>Ever since it opened its doors in 1959 on the ground floor of Manhattan's landmark Seagram building, the Four Seasons has been serving up more than just meals. It's there that many diners first learned that not all American wines are sold by Gallo or the gallon; it's there that health-conscious dishes came to be known as spa cuisine (owners Tom Margittai and Paul Kovi registered the term as a trademark); and it's there that the first official "power lunch" was confidently consumed.<p>So it's no surprise that innovation is a prominent theme in John Mariani's "The Four Seasons: The History of America's Premier Restaurant" (Crown, $35), written with Four Seasons general manager Alex von Bidder and published this month. Undeniably, the book is in one sense a valentine, an extra-large tip from media magnate Si Newhouse (who owns Crown) to the people who usually feed him at midday -- along with many of his higher-placed employees. But Mariani's research makes his effort something else as well. In telling the story of architect Philip Johnson's only restaurant commission, a place designed to serve as an expression of "power, money, modernism, sophistication, eccentricity, and iconoclasm," Mariani provides an overview of American eating habits in this century and a sociological gloss on New York since the 1950s, those innocent days when fish was still cooked all the way through and the greens preferred by educated palates were Bibb and oak-leaf lettuce.<p>Given the restaurant's long standing as a stage for displays of wealth and business might, Mariani (a regular contributor to Worth) had no shortage of scenes to recount, such as the original owners' wrangling with Mark Rothko over a series of paintings for the private dining room and the celebrity-stocked party for John F. Kennedy's 45th birthday. There are also a number of revealing observations -- for instance, the fact that the $4.5 million price tag for the Four Seasons (which at one point was in danger of being named Season-o-Rama or Season-Go-Round) was $1.5 million more than the cost of the Guggenheim Museum, which opened the same year. And what would a book like this be without recipes? Try to tackle the curried swordfish and pickled vegetables or a cappuccino souffle, and revel in how powerful it makes you feel<p>--------------------------------------<p>Bite Map: 
A Cross-Country Guide to Eating Lunch<p>By Jason Nixon<p>The power lunch may have been invented at the Four Seasons in New York City, but it's being eaten around the country.<p>ATLANTA. Downtown, the City Grill (50 Hurt Plaza, Suite 200; 404-524-2489) is popular with politicians and the financial crowd. Ted Turner has been known to take his lunch there, too. A hipper, less clubby choice is the Buckhead Diner (3073 Piedmont Road; 404-262-3336), where Elton John, Halle Berry, Whitney Houston, and top executives from nearby Coca-Cola dig into grilled salmon BLT's.<p>BOSTON. Locke-Ober (3-4 Winter Place; 617-542-1340), over 100 years old and still in its prime, continues to pack in the Brahmins and those who wish they were. Aujourd'Hui at the Four Seasons hotel (200 Boylston Street; 617-451-1392) and Lydia Shire's Biba (272 Boylston Street; 617-426-7878) are also big draws.<p>CHICAGO. In the River North area, locals flock to Gordon (500 North Clark; 312-467-9780), where chef Mark Dorian, formerly of Manhattan's Union Square Cafe, lures the power-hungry with artichoke fritters and roasted-vegetable sandwiches. Catch 35 (35 West Wacker Drive; 312-346-3500) and Nick's Fishmarket (1 First National Plaza; 312-621-0200) are other contenders.<p>DALLAS. At lunch, most of the power is wielded at private clubs like the Tower Club or the Crescent Club. Nonmembers prefer the Mansion on Turtle Creek (2821 Turtle Creek Boulevard; 214-559-2100) for red jalapeno Caesar salad with shrimp diablo "tamale."<p>DETROIT. The Rattlesnake Club (300 River Place; 313-567-4400) brings executives from the adjacent Stroh Brewery for Lake Erie pickerel and, if they are feeling indulgent, white chocolate ravioli. Detroit mayor Dennis Archer prefers the more opulent Opus 1 (565 East Larned Street; 313-961-7766).<p>LOS ANGELES. Robert Shapiro and Alan Dershowitz have strategized at the Grill on the Alley (9560 Dayton Way; 310-276-0615), the Beverly Hills boite modeled after San Francisco's famous Tadich Grill. Mortons (8764 Melrose Avenue; 310-276-5205) was strictly an evening spot until it recently changed locations. Now Sharon Stone, Bill Block of ICM, and Lili Zanuck can be seen munching on Thai chicken salad at lunch.<p>SAN FRANCISCO. Wolfgang Puck's L.A.-based Spago is as famous for its celebrity clientele as its California pizzas; Postrio (545 Post Street; 415-776-7825) imports Puck's winning formula to the Bay Area. <p>WASHINGTON, D.C. It's strictly surf and turf for the capital's powerful lunchers. Perhaps the hottest seat in town right now is "Rosty's Rotunda": Dan Rostenkowski's table at Morton's of Chicago (3251 Prospect Street NW; 202-342-6258). <p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>PSYCHIC FORECASTING<p>By Ellen Tien<p>You are not a particularly mystical person -- the only crystals you own are affixed to Swiss precision timepieces. So when a friend recounts an experience with a psychic reader, you're naturally skeptical. Recently, I had my first mental online experience with the other world. My personal accessor: Mary T. Browne, a Manhattan psychic and author. Her client list, she says, is long and includes corporate CEOs, presidents of countries, a slew of muckety-mucks in finance and publishing, and an Oscar-winning actor. <p>HOW IT WORKED: We met in the living room of her modest apartment, where she kindly offered me a spot of tea. Then she got straight to business. For roughly 60 minutes, I frantically scribbled notes as she gazed to her left and, without any clues or prompting from me, recited a dazzling array of info-bites about my life. After this mind-bending performance, she urged me to make inquiries. I asked if she had anything stronger than tea. <p>THE REALLY UNCANNY PART: She was disconcertingly accurate. She named the exact location of an apartment I was thinking of buying and warned me of plumbing problems that were later confirmed. She supplied (true) information about friends and relatives -- facts I hadn't previously known. She offered shrewd career and personal advice. <p>NET EFFECT: What the. . . ? The cynical New York brain doesn't really track stuff like this. Still, once I stopped searching for trick mirrors and strings, the session was highly enjoyable. My reading focused on the present with some forays into the past and a few projections into the foreseeable (for her, anyway) future. Browne does not dispense financial tips, nor will she issue direct orders. Rather, as with a doctor or lawyer, you're paying for expertise. She gives you her professional opinion; you do with it what you will. Granted, this is an inexact science. Then again, so is meteorology, and no one seems to be storming the Weather Channel, shrieking fraud. <p>THE UPSIDE: You leave with a clearer overview of yourself. A good reading is a self-affirming experience -- it untangles some of the bigger snarls in day-to-day life. Although the experience is not entirely unlike psychotherapy, a therapist concentrates on why it is, while a psychic identifies what it is. Also, a shrink makes you hunt for answers, whereas a psychic does the hard labor for you. <p>HOW TO MAXIMIZE THE UPSIDE: Don't play coy. When a doctor asks you where it hurts, you don't reply, "Maybe my shoulder, maybe not -- you tell me." <p>THE DOWNSIDE: You may not like what you hear. What's more, there are plenty of charlatans out there, so you have to choose wisely and well. <p>HOW TO MINIMIZE THE DOWNSIDE: Get referrals. In Browne's words, "This 1-800 stuff has got to stop! Forget fortune tellers in the yellow pages -- go to a metaphysical bookstore and do some homework." <p>WHEN TO GO: Most clients schedule appointments when they have an important decision to make. "If you need emotional help, see a psychologist," Browne advises. "But if you want some insight into the gift of prophecy, see a psychic -- seriously, respectfully, and with a sense of humor." <p>IS IT WORTH IT? In my case, yes indeedy. <p><p>WHAT IT COSTS:
-> $200 a session.<p>WHAT YOU MIGHT BUY INSTEAD:
-> One 50-minute personal prediction from a live psychic on the Psychic Hotline. 
-> Three sessions with a psychotherapist.
-> Twenty-five Magic 8 Balls. <p>BOTTOM LINE:
-> If you don't have a decade to spare on psychoanalysis (and you're not searching for your inner anything), a psychic reading can be the tonic for life's big decisions (Mary T. Browne, 212-242-6080).<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>NO MAN'S LAND
The emerging cosmetics market for the other 49 percent.<p>By Gully Wells <p>If nature abhors a vacuum, then there is nothing more challenging to capitalism than a market in desperate need of saturation. When the guys in Atlanta who run <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> look at a map of the world and see China, I think we all know what runs through their minds. And when the giant cosmetics companies look at the male half of the human race, a similar thought process takes place. There are literally millions of men out there who have yet to be converted to the true faith. Many men have been persuaded to buy aftershave and cologne, but apart from that, they are pretty basic animals: shampoo, deodorant, and shaving stuff.<p>Why are men such pitiful consumers when it comes to grooming products? Maybe they don't care what they look like (obviously untrue). Or perhaps they are less credulous than women are when it comes to advertising (c'mon). Since men are every bit as vain and deluded as women in other aspects of life, there must be some other explanation. I suspect the secret lies in borrowing: The reason men don't shop for cosmetics is that they use their significant others'. I'll admit to a bit of borrowing in my time. Somebody else's nice new razor is always useful, a firm toothbrush works wonders on mascara-clogged eyelashes, and Eau Sauvage has long been my perfume of choice. But it only recently occurred to me that this borrowing could be a two-way street (a concept that has not escaped marketing genius Calvin Klein, who launches CK One, a unisex fragrance, this month). After a few weeks of entirely random research among some of the men I'm acquainted with, here's what I discovered.<p>However much men care about their looks, they are mostly unwilling to spend more than a few minutes on a basic grooming routine. "How long is this going to take?" was the question I heard most often. When it comes to the newest wonders of the cosmetics business, alphahydroxy fruit acids, the answer is anything up to two months. These are the main components in Estee Lauder's skin treatment, Fruition, described by the company as a "megaleap into the future of skin care. . . a stratospheric fusion of nature and science only glimpsed in dreams." Unfortunately, it was only glimpsed on my husband's face for two consecutive nights, and the promised "42 percent increase in evenness of skin tone" sadly never materialized. The truth is that men crave instant gratification (no news to most women, I realize), so products that work in seconds, not months, seem to be the answer (by the way, Fruition does make an excellent shave cream). <p>Foaming cleansers that can be used in the shower while shaving -- like those made by Clarins, Shiseido, and Borghese -- were a big hit with the men I surveyed. The addition of a shaving brush brings back atavistic memories of old-fashioned barbershops. My initial polling showed that 86 percent of men have been known to borrow a moisturizer from a woman in their life. And when they are temporarily and inexplicably without a woman, they will actually go out and buy a moisturizer for themselves -- an encouraging sign. What they like is something light that also includes some sun protection, like Clarins Fluide Multi-Confort SPF 15. The other brand that seemed to work for men was Chanel, which probably has to do with the packaging. I suspect that most men go for outward appearance (another big surprise) and that Chanel and Prescriptives (plain gray and white) look better on the shelf than the gilt-encrusted packages of the more extravagant women's lines. <p>One area of men's faces that deserves attention is the eyes, which are always the first to go. Too little sleep, too much alcohol and smoke, and just too many years: It all adds up. But Clarins's Eye Contour Gel claims that it will "help reduce the appearance of puffiness and dark circles." The operative words are help and appearance, which is why my guinea pig, his tiny tube finished, threw in the towel and said he thought he'd rather start saving for the knife.<p>Which brings us abruptly back to reality. Men may be easing their way into the beauty business through women's products, but they will never be ideal customers. Impatient, craving the instant high (and, incidentally, horrified by what women are willing to spend on magic potions), they are not in this for the long haul. They are essentially '90s consumers: the basics, preferably of good quality, and then get me out of here. Looking at that map of the world, I think I'd put my money on Coke in China.<p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>EXTRA TERRESTRIALS
There's a whole world of globes out there.<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Globes are spinning everywhere. decorators and interior designers, installing cachet more than accuracy, are snapping up antique globes for their worldly clients; new globes are exerting their own pull. Bryan Hollingsworth of globe maker George F. Cram attributes the rise in new globe sales to stabler world borders in the last couple of years, an increased emphasis on geographical literacy, and companies' growing tendency to look abroad. "They need to know where their customers and suppliers are," he says.<p>Such global awareness helps explain the decorative success of New York City's Mappamondo restaurant, which is crowded with globes. "People love it," says manager Jessica Seal. "They get a globe and put it on a table and talk about where they've been."<p>Antique globe dealers talk about where they're going. George Glazer, who specializes in 19th-century globes and prints, says globes remain a bargain compared to fine art. But the appearance of even a few more collectors -- such as fashion mogul Gianni Versace, who displays dozens of old globes in his Milan house -- may push the antique globe market into a new orbit. <p>Already, according to Robert Israel of Kentshire Galleries, a pair of globes that sold for $10,000 six years ago can go for five times that amount today. Still, Israel advises people not to invest, but to buy for enjoyment. "Of course," he says, "likely as not, globes will be a good investment." <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>CHIPS OFF THE OLD BLOCK
Reissues of classic furnishings are affordable, but not as collectible.<p>By Susan Kuchinskas<p>Everything old is new again, literally, in the world of 20th-century furnishings. Since auction prices have soared and collectors have picked flea markets and antique stores clean of vintage pieces designed by masters like Stickley, Wright, and Eames, manufacturers are meeting consumer demand by making more. <p>Reproductions are good news for those who simply wish to curl up on an icon of modern design. But for collectors of vintage furnishings, this trend makes things a little trickier, calling into question the whole concept of an "original" piece. For the novice collector it's often difficult to tell the difference. When shopping, be sure to find out whether the piece is a knockoff or an officially sanctioned reproduction that bears the designer's imprimatur.<p>The past five years have brought reissues of Mission Oak furniture designed by Gustav and Leopold Stickley, silver tableware designed by William Spratling, and licensed reproductions of furniture, textiles, and accessories by Frank Lloyd Wright. Last January, Herman Miller reintroduced designs from the '40s and '50s by Charles and Ray Eames and George Nelson. <p>A recently made piece may cost more than a vintage one, according to Lisa Light of the Manhattan-based home-furnishings emporium Zona, because the cost of labor is higher today. But at least, as one collector says, it doesn't take longer to furnish your house than it does for your children to grow up. Want a Frank Lloyd Wright Husser House dining table with eight barrel chairs? No problem: You can order them for around $13,500 by calling the manufacturer. Compare this with the $442,500 Christie's got at auction for the original set in June 1993.<p>What's the difference between buying an Eames folding screen made in 1954 and the same screen made in 1994? The facile answer is about $2,700 (more for the vintage piece). But while the appearance may be identical except for signs of wear, variations in construction make repros unacceptable to the collecting purist. <p>Frank Lloyd Wright furniture is made by Cassina in the "aesthetic spirit" of his work, rather than as replicas, using fully contemporary construction methods and cherry wood. Arkitektura/In-Situ has produced Eero Saarinen-designed seating for several restaurants and adjusted the pitches of the chair backs for greater comfort. Modern glues and connections make them sturdier than the originals.<p>Construction of the 11-piece Heywood-Wakefield reproduction collection is a blend of old and new methods. While door hinges come from the original supplier, some designs are adapted, like increasing table sizes and adding a personal-computer option to a desk. "We're not aiming at the collectibles market," says Leonard Riforgiato of Heywood-Wakefield. Herman Miller is using a manmade fiber for the joints of the Eames folding screen and a different method of bonding the shock mount for the molded plywood chairs. Details like these should make it easier to tell the new products from the vintage. On the other hand, production of Spratling silver place settings and tableware remains practically unchanged from the '30s and '40s. Many of the original artisans still work in Spratling's Taxco, Mexico, factory. <p>Then there are the items that never went off the market. Alvar Aalto's Scroll Chair for ICF has been in continuous production in Finland since the '30s, made from trees in the same birch forest outside Helsinki, although the clear finish now has a different formula. Yet the chairs from the '30s and '40s are highly prized by serious collectors, even though they typically sell for less than new ones. <p>To ensure that buyers know what they're getting, some companies, like Stickley and Spratling, date each piece. The Frank Lloyd Wright Foundation's stamp clearly marks pieces as reproductions. But the distinction is not always so clear. The revived Heywood-Wakefield line is stamped with a mark very similar to the original. As it is, vintage collectors can be incredibly picky when trying to date things. "Some of our collectors are very detailed, very anal," says Dominic Longacre, owner of AD/50 in San Francisco. "Labels, colors, wood, glides, even the screw rubber mount, all those things make a chair worth more or less."<p>"This is a continuing problem in the business," says antiques dealer John Sikorski. "An educated collector might know the difference, but most people who are buying these collectibles are not necessarily aware of the fact that they changed the spring, or the color of the mark is different. The industry could make it much easier if there were a bold mark, but [some of] these outfits are trying to capitalize on a trendy situation." Sikorski, who hosts a radio show on WUFT-FM in Gainesville, Florida, often breaks the bad news to callers who are sure they've got a valuable original.<p>Of course, to the serious collector, becoming an expert on screw mounts or joints is half the fun. These die-hards spurn anything that wasn't produced in the era of its designer, and that should keep prices of the originals steady. In fact, the spate of reproductions is a good sign for collectors, according to Nancy McClelland, a vice president at Christie's auction house in New York City. "This should be encouraging to the marketplace, not threatening," she says. "I think it's a clear indication that the style is broadly recognized and appreciated and that it is here to stay."<p>Reissues of classic specimens may bolster the market for collectibles by increasing awareness and demand for the designs. Dealers hope sophisticated consumers will come to crave the level of workmanship shown in these archetypes. While true believers hold out for the patina factor, buyers more concerned with style than provenance might opt for the reintroductions, which, according to Riforgiato, may "stabilize some of the wackiness in the collectibles market."<p>Dealers say reproductions will probably never have the collectible value of the originals. Acquire them because you love them. It's also reassuring to know your furniture is replaceable. Go ahead, put your feet up.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>BACK TO GLAMOUR
Diamonds become fashionable again.<p>By Giselle Benatar<p>Diamonds could be the first artifact of the flashy '80s to successfully shed the stigma of excess and become a signature of genuine style and authentic hipness. In today's glamour-obsessed fashion climate, the lustrous stones are again very much of the moment. <p>The blue-chip French fashion house Chanel recently launched an extravagant collection of fine jewelry based on original designs worn by its famous founder. The pieces will be sold in jewelry boutiques adjacent to the company's clothing stores at up to $500,000 (for an exotic diamond camellia necklace). "Chanel loved diamonds because they represent the highest value in the smallest volume," says spokeswoman Arlette Thebault.<p>A more casual approach to diamond classics comes from maverick American designer Marc Jacobs, the same man who turned grunge into a fashion statement. Jacobs's new line of diamond jewelry, available at Neiman Marcus, consists of delicate diamond clusters -- dazzling sprays of stars and moons or Arabic numerals. "The attitude here is very different from what I call those precious old-fashioned diamonds," says Jacobs. "I wanted to take this classic material and treat it in a way that's very mundane and looks almost thrown away." Jacobs even suggests women might use the cluster pins to advertise their telephone numbers, and at its June menswear collection, the cheeky Italian design team Dolce & Gabbana showed its controversial Mafioso-style men's suits with flashy diamond chokers (suggesting that diamonds may also be a man's best friend). <p>The new diamond jewelry might be fun to flaunt and beautiful to admire, but there's no guarantee it will make an equally alluring investment. Unlike "timeless" diamond pieces, the latest fashion-driven settings and stones may not retain their value over time. "If it's a fashion piece, you should buy it today because you want to wear it today," says Tom Heyman of the New York jeweler Oscar Heyman and Brothers. "With that type of piece there's no way to tell whether it's a lasting fashion or a flash in the pan." Given the temporary nature of fashion, in other words, even the eternal stones aren't necessarily forever.<p><p>

A new class of urban bikers is hitting the road -- but not, mind you, before going back to school.<p>By John Marchese<p>I was a mild one. I drove a sensible four-door foreign car, with the tires properly inflated and my seat belt buckled. High-altitude elevator riding was the closest I came to excitement in transport.<p>But lately, each time I noticed a gray hair or that another pair of pants had really shrunk, I got bike thoughts. For the first time, I caught myself staring at motorcycles as they passed -- not just cursing their noise but looking and longing and thinking: That could be me. It wasn't long before I met Paula.<p>"I have this romantic vision," said Paula Petrella, who works in the business-affairs department of a film-distribution company in Manhattan and was playing hooky for a day in order to learn how to ride a motorcycle. "You know, the whole fantasy -- the wind in my hair, the open road, all of it."<p>She didn't have to tell me. I was in class with her, another eager student taking a cram course in fantasy.<p>We were seated in plain brown metal folding chairs in the back room of Trama's Auto School in Queens, New York, listening to brief lectures and watching videotapes on the joys of motorcycling. It was the first of three grueling days of instruction offered by Trama and approved by the Motorcycle Safety Foundation.<p>Among my classmates were lawyers (including one who happily announced one morning that he'd been out the night before with clients who looked like the cast of The Godfather, Part IV), city bureaucrats, and composers. Not the sort of people who fit the image. But Marlon Brando's bad boy in The Wild One never was quite true, and in recent years the snarling face of biking has changed even more.<p>According to information compiled by <a name="NYSE:HDI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harley-Davidson</b></a>, the average rider buying a bike is 38 years old and has a median income near $53,000. In big cities, upscale biker gangs with names like the Rolex Riders in Los Angeles and the Gotham City Riders in Manhattan have become common. The Gotham City Riders are Wall Street types who do such antisocial stuff as volunteering at a soup kitchen and roaring out to Kennedy Airport once a year to meet the first shipment of Beaujolais Nouveau.<p>In New York, the person to see to get the riding skills to join such a dastardly bunch is Gasper Trama (pronounced like trauma, which, he admits good-naturedly, is an unfortunate name for someone in his line of work)<p>Trama has been teaching motorcycle skills since 1966 and is licensed by the MSF. His three-day beginner course costs $350. (For information, call 718-847-2015.) He supplies the bikes and helmets; no special clothing is required, though leather is always appropriate. In 50 states around the country, courses like these are offered in affiliation with the state, and usually prices are lower, averaging around $150, according to an MSF spokeswoman. The foundation has a hotline number (800-447-4700) to refer prospective riders to a local course. Also, Discover Today's Motorcycling (800-833-3995) will send booklets on purchasing, insuring, financing, and learning to ride a motorcycle.<p>Gasper Trama is a small, perky New Yorker with the bouncy personality of a Catskills comedian. He's also got about as many corny jokes, most of which pertain to what will happen to you if you do something stupid while riding a motorcycle. Trama has become something of a motorcycle instructor to the stars, having taught Alan Alda, Scott Baio, and Sonia Braga for film roles. Other students for his private lessons (which cost $45 an hour) have included Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner and a member of the Forbes family, whose patriarch turned motorcycling into a form of business and self-promotion.<p>A few years ago, before she was planning to leave for a trip around the world on a motorcycle with investor and author Jim Rogers, Tabitha Estabrook took Trama's course (see sidebar "Tour de World" below). She'd never driven a bike before and was about to embark on a 65,000-mile journey that would get her into the Guinness Book of World Records. "If you're going to do it," she says, of learning to ride a motorcycle generally, not necessarily for long distances, "make sure you take this course. There's no other way to learn these things, except by lots of errors on the road. And I think it's always better to have more trial and less error."<p>Three days with Trama on an old coast guard airfield in Brooklyn taught me that riding a motorcycle can be trying, mostly because riding is paradoxical. It is both easier and harder than you would think. The thing that at first seems difficult is actually pretty easy -- keeping the motorcycle up. As long as there's power from the throttle, the bike wants to stand. The hardest thing is keeping that power under control. Working the throttle, the clutch, the brakes, and the shift takes coordination of both hands and feet -- like playing the drums. <p>"Is it challenging to ride a motorcycle?" Trama asks. "Every second!"<p>I estimated that during Trama's course, I spent 57,600 seconds on a bike -- a full 16 hours. The MSF requires its course providers to supply a total of at least 15 hours (class and riding) of instruction. Trama takes it up to about 24 hours. He builds skills like a kid playing with blocks. We started on the the bikes by pushing one another around and coasting. And we spent what seemed at first like an inordinate amount of time learning the proper sequence to turn the bike on and off. There was a lot of riding around in circles, just to get the feel of easy turning. We spent hours learning to stop correctly.<p>But by the third day of the course, when we were speeding through turns and veering quickly to avoid simulated obstacles, the need for such simple skills became obvious. When the complexity of the riding situations increases, instinct must take over. If you've learned the correct way right from the beginning, you're way ahead. I can't imagine that people ride without a course like this. Tabitha Estabrook said she'd been riding every day for a year when she encountered an unexpected hairpin turn in an Australian beach town. One of Trama's drills came back to her, taking her safely through the corner.<p>A few weeks have gone by since I learned to ride, and my fantasies these days focus on the classified pages, where I'm searching for a certain BMW cycle for a good price. Now if I could just find someone to teach me how not to turn gray.<p>Sidebar:
Tour de World
---------------
"Whenever I travel," writes Jim Rogers, "because of who I am, I notice promising investment opportunities."<p>In 1990, at the age of 47, Rogers decided to really do some traveling -- scooting on his BMW motorcycle across Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia, and South America, and back home to the Upper West Side of Manhattan. He rode with a tall, leggy blonde half his age named Tabitha Estabrook and with a world view formed by a small-town southern boyhood, education at Yale and Oxford, and years of driving himself to success on Wall Street.<p>The result of this two-year, 65,000-mile journey is "Investment Biker: On the Road With Jim Rogers" (Random House, $25). The book is part adventure story, part travelogue, part love story, and part primer on world markets. What Rogers lacks in skills as a close observer and a writer he makes up for in his feel for the intersecting lines of culture, history, geography, and economics. And the book is propelled by the sheer preposterousness of his journey.<p>Whether dodging bureaucrats in China, land mines in Angola, civil war in Central America, or traffic jams in Philadelphia, Rogers, like many travel writers before him, was ultimately looking for an epiphany: "I wanted to scrap my old life completely and start a new one. If I could just find the right road. . . "<p>He didn't quite get an epiphany, but he picked up a few useful things. Rogers, who is frequently seen discussing the markets on CNBC, now has money in a number of countries he biked through.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>TIMELESS OPTIONS
Here's what to look for when buying a mechanical timepiece.<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Quartz watches are tellers of time, but mechanical watches, like handblown glass in a paper-cup world, are pieces of history, works of art -- and, of course, symbols of status. Here's what makes them tick:<p>BATTERIES NOT INCLUDED. Mechanical watches pack their power in a mainspring, wound either manually or automatically -- by handshaking, wrist-flipping, or finger-pointing.<p>WHEELS IN MOTION. Mechanical watches keep time via a positively Pentagonian maze of wheels, gears, and gadgets -- at least 130 of them, not including "complications" (chronograph, perpetual calendar, minute repeater ... ). <p>HUMAN HANDS. Quality of workmanship doesn't define the mechanical watch -- but it certainly distinguishes it from a quartz one. All high-end mechanical watches are finished with painstaking care by highly trained, surgeon's-handed watchmakers, not too different -- in spirit at least -- from the Swiss cabinotiers of the 18th century.<p>A KING'S RANSOM. A Patek Philipe gentleman's watch starts around $7,800 and can run to $400,000. And that's not counting the cost of cleaning it every few years -- up to $2,000. "The more you pay for a watch," says David Marold, general manager of UTAC America, distributor of such luminaries as Bertolucci and Breguet, "the more it costs to maintain it."<p>AN ILLUSTRIOUS PAST. There is something deeply right about a watch that has kept time in essentially the same way for hundreds of years. "A mechanical watch," says veteran clock watcher Mort Gershman, is "a true watch, a watch in its purest form."<p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>THE PERSONAL GOLF PRO<p>By David E. Outerbridge<p>I'm as passionate about my golf game as any other novice, and as easily frustrated. On a good day golf seems like the game I was born to play, but on a bad day my shots careen off center like drugged gulls in an errant wind. <p>It was after a bad day that I called the United States Senior Golf Academy (USSGA) in Melbourne, Florida, and signed up for some intensive study. The academy guarantees five days of instruction with a teaching ratio of three to one or less for $1,685. For a $295 premium, it offers one-on-one instruction -- the same ratio that pro Nick Faldo gets from his coach David Leadbetter.<p>I indulged in one-on-one lessons from Tim Peightal, a licensed class-A PGA professional who gave me eight hours a day of advice, monitoring, correction, drills, video analysis, and coached play. During my week at the school I found that one-on-one offered two important advantages for absorbing all this tutelage. First, there was complete flexibility within a day's schedule. I was never fettered by anyone else's need to stick with any one element of the game. For example, when I demonstrated an ability to get out of a bunker, we abandoned that part of the curriculum.<p>The second advantage to one-on-one instruction became clear during the afternoon playing lessons. As we drove to our next shot or waited for a group in front to clear the green, Peightal would ask, for example, what my "swing thought" had been on the prior shot. This allowed him to tailor his instruction and suggested a line of questioning from me.<p>There was also time for mini lectures. One afternoon Peightal talked about the average player's fixation with the driver and corresponding lack of regard for the putter. As a putter is used more than twice as much as the driver, Peightal spoke of the importance of the putter's being well-suited to the player. Mine, he said, was not, and he explained why. Then, after our round, he redesigned my putter, cutting two inches off the shaft, adding an oversize grip, and placing strips of lead tape on the blade. I putted better thereafter.<p>On the last day, as Peightal added one final piece of instruction and an accompanying drill, all the changes and partial improvements of the week suddenly came together. I now understand the golf swing. I understand its physics, its feel, its dynamics, its parts, its whole. When I make a bad shot I can self-correct. My practice has become productive -- I'm not just smacking balls and hoping for a good shot. I am analyzing, refining, and grooving proper techniques.<p>Is this kind of result worth five days of hard work? Ask any golfer you know. <p>WHAT YOU GET:
-> Over 42 hours of personal golf instruction.
-> One video of you on the course with advice narrated by your instructor.
-> Seven days of lodging and most meals.<p>EXTRAS:
-> None. It would be overload.<p>WHAT YOU MIGHT BUY INSTEAD:
-> Seven Big Bertha War Bird clubs with graphite shafts.
-> One and three-quarter days of a two-day retreat with David Leadbetter. 
-> Eight rounds of golf at Pebble Beach.<p>BOTTOM LINE:
-> The United States Senior Golf Academy is for all ages and skill levels. The students during my week all stated that their games were much improved. The one-on-one feature is a bargain, but requires a commitment to very hard work. For information, call 800-654-5752.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES
Soured by wine speculating, savvy buyers are sniffing out bargains that are selling (surprise!) at retail.<p>By John Mariani <p>Back in the woozy, high-flying days of the 1980s, wines appreciated like just about everything else. Then, like just about everything else, they didn't.<p>And those who bought wine futures -- wines not yet released, purchased in advance at the wine store on the assumption they will cost much more upon release and later on -- found themselves holding on to cases of wines that never grew in value. "The futures market has gone bust," says Peter D. Meltzer, writer for Wine Enthusiast. "The last three vintages in Bordeaux -- 1991, 1992, and 1993 -- all turned out below expectations in terms of quality, so there's no point in shelling out dollars now in the belief that such wines will go up in price. There's just too much wine around right now."<p>In an ironic twist, this slump in the futures market has sent savvy oenophiles into wine shops in search of bargains on less hyped wines that offer not just splendid drinking for the long term but prices you may not see again in the future. "There's a lot of good wines from unfashionable vintages that have developed well," insists Darrell Corti of Corti Brothers in Sacramento, California, "and it's our job as wine sellers to find such wines. The '86 Burgundies were not fashionable when they came out, but many of them have matured into wonderful wines."<p>Corti is currently selling Rene Engel's '86 Echezeaux and Clos de Vougeot for about $40 -- below what they cost when they first came out in most wine stores. "Even the much-criticized '84 vintage in Bordeaux has turned up wines like Chateau Talbot and Gruaud-Larose that were hard, mean, and nasty when they were released but are now coming around beautifully."<p>Since the wines of Bordeaux have for so long been the benchmark for wine collectors, that is where many of the bargains lie in today's saturated wine market. Robert Parker, publisher of the immensely influential newsletter the Wine Advocate, notes that there are still large stocks of 1988 Bordeaux out there just ripe for the grabbing. <p>"They were not at the level of the '89s or '90s, so they were dumped to raise cash," Parker says. "Now they are very reasonably priced, especially those from the northern Medoc and Pomerol. It's a classic vintage, and they'll easily go on for another ten years."<p>Wine merchant Michael Aaron, chairman of Manhattan's prestigious Sherry-Lehmann, feels this is a great time to stock up on bargains from Bordeaux. "If you're looking for good wines to drink now and lay down for the future and aren't interested in investment, there are some fabulous wines out there," he says. "I'd buy the '83 Talbot at $25 a bottle and Ducru-Beaucaillou for $35. Even the highly regarded '85 Talbot is now just $23, Ducru is $40, and Duhart-Milon is $25. These wines will very soon disappear from the market, so now's the time to get them." Last year the retail list prices for the same '85 vintages were, respectively, $35, $51, and $34.<p>For the wine lover willing to make the calls and snoop around in reputable shops, there are now some remarkable old wines that may sell for even less than more recent vintages.<p>"Buying futures is stupid unless you can buy them inexpensively," says Corti. "And the rare, expensive, much-hyped wines of the past always find their way back into the trade. Right now you can find wines like Richebourg '61 for $3,000 a case and La Tache '59 for $4,200. That may sound expensive, but it's actually less money than the '89s are currently selling for."<p>And what of wines from countries other than France, including those from America's own backyard? Most wine experts shrug and say that California wines are made to be sold and drunk at the time they are released and are not for putting away. "California whites should have a pull date on them," jokes Parker, who thinks the best bargains out of California right now are '90 and '91 zinfandels (though he'd avoid the '89 and '88 vintages). "The so-called 'Rhone Rangers' [California wines made in the style of France's Rhone Valley with the same grapes, such as Syrah, Mourvedre, and Grenache] are usually made by maverick producers and the wines have less prestige than cabernet sauvignons, so they're selling cheaply, for $8 to $15."<p>There are also a number of beautifully crafted Italian wines now priced to sell in an oversupplied market. Old Brunello di Montalcino used to cost $40, $50, and up until more modern wineries started to produce lighter, fruitier versions, so that now an '88 Brunello from a fine producer like Altesino, at $26, is a steal for a wine that will get better and better through the next decade.<p>Since Italy's DOCG (Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita) laws prohibit producers from labeling wines like Brunello, Barolo, or Chianti Classico if they don't meet certain quality standards in certain vintages, a great deal of good wine from the top producers' very best vineyards must be sold off under inexpensive, secondary labels. "People were calling 1992 a disastrous vintage" in Tuscany, says Corti. "So a great Chianti producer like Antinori puts his best wines under his lesser 'Santa Cristina' label because he can't sell them as 'Chianti Classico.' Believe me, at about $9 a bottle, these will be terrific buys and make for good drinking for years to come." <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>FITNESS IN THE BAG<p>By Lauren Goldstein<p>What's easier to pack than a personal trainer and works muscles just as hard? The Lifeline Portable Gym, a low-tech (and low price--about $60) exercise kit bought for road workouts by actors Paul Newman and Leslie Nielsen and the man who guards Madonna's fat-free body. The two-pound Lifeline Portable Gym, which consists of a lifting bar, treadmill belt, and elastic cable, is just one of many portable resistance-training regimens available now. Resistance equipment such as Dyna-Bands (three-foot strips of latex) and hand paddles for use while swimming can yield the "same results for aerobics and toning that you would get at the gym," says Amie Hoff, a personal trainer at Equinox Fitness Club in New York City. <p>For a cardiovascular workout while traveling, Gray Cook, a physical therapist with the Stewart Physical Therapy Group in Salisbury, North Carolina, suggests the old-fashioned method of jumping rope, or hooking the Lifeline up as a treadmill. By wearing the Lifeline's belt and running against the resistance of the rubber tubing, joggers can create the effect of heading uphill. Most Olympic ski teams use this resistance to simulate skiing by jumping from side to side.
Exercise helps to alleviate the stresses and strains of travel. "The most important thing," says Cook, "is to be consistent. And to eliminate as many excuses as possible." Because without the services of your personal trainer, the only person to push you on the road is you. <p>

Worth magazine/Options<p>BLUES POWER
From postage stamps to restaurants, the blues is becoming big business.<p>By David Hochman<p>Suddenly, millions of Americans are getting the blues. This month, the U.S. Postal Service is issuing eight 29-cent stamps honoring legendary blues musicians like Muddy Waters, Howlin' Wolf, and Billie Holiday. <p>The first-class tribute arrives just as the blues is becoming big business across the country. Hohner USA, the world's largest maker of harmonicas -- so closely associated with the wail of the blues -- has almost doubled its sales since the mid-'80s. The Blues Foundation in Memphis, Tennessee, reports that since 1990, attendance at blues festivals has increased more than 1,000 percent, while the number of blues albums being released annually is up more than 50 percent. <p>"We're witnessing an extraordinary return to roots music right now," says Hard Rock Cafe founder Isaac Tigrett, whose House of Blues clubs in New Orleans, Los Angeles, and Cambridge, Massachusetts, are helping thirtysomething music lovers recover from a decade-long barrage of techno music, fluffy pop patter, and hip-hop. "When MTV came along, it cut off the baby-booming market," says Tigrett, whose partner in the venture is Blues Brother Dan Aykroyd. "Now people are desperate for something that's real, has depth, history, and emotion. That's why they turn to the blues." House of Blues showcases both local talent and legends. <p>Blues guitarist B. B. King also recognizes the selling power of the blues. After the success of his Blues Club and Restaurant in Memphis and Universal City Walk in Los Angeles, King's partner, Tommy Peters, says they will open clubs across the country. "We're not out to change the world," he says. "We just know that listening to the blues does something wonderful to people, and we'd like to spread that around." <p><p>

London's townhouse hotels are in a class by themselves.<p>By Randall Fuller<p>With room rates often beginning well above $300 a night, London's premium hotels are enough to give anyone a stiff upper lip. Fortunately, there is a new class of small, stylish hotel that offers the same bespoke British service and more charm -- for about a third less cost. Dubbed townhouse hotels, these newcomers attract traveling cognoscenti such as Kevin Costner, Bette Midler, and Ralph Lauren. Discreet from the outside -- often a bronze plaque is all that distinguishes them from their Victorian neighbors -- their rooms are the perfect setting for sumptuous, Anglo-style pampering.<p>After visiting more than 25 of the London upstarts, we chose 8 of the best, including the one generally credited with starting it all, Blakes (44-71-370-6701; doubles about $187). Opened by fashion designer Anouska Hempel (Lady Weinberg) in 1983, this South Kensington mansion is still the benchmark by which others are judged. The compact lobby -- a tropical fantasy of rattan furniture -- sets the tone for each of the 50 rooms, which Hempel has treated as 50 theater sets for her active imagination. The results have attracted the fashion aristocracy (Gianni Versace and Issey Miyake are regulars) and those they dress.<p>The Pelham (44-71-589-8288; doubles from $216) is just a short walk away from Royal Albert Hall. Upon entering, you immediately notice the umbrellas lined up in anticipation of blustery English weather. Dozens of such comforting details grace the 37 rooms here: The drawing room, paneled in 18th-century pine, is redolent of apples; a complimentary leather bookmark accompanies the wide selection of books on your nightstand; and the mahogany-trimmed bathtub with heated towel racks is perfectly designed to soak away your jet lag.<p>One of the newest townhouse hotels is the Franklin (800-473-9487; doubles about $202), an impressive three-house establishment just around the corner from fashionable Brompton Cross. David Naylor-Leyland and Alasdair Hadden-Paton, who also own Egerton House down the street, have outfitted the Franklin with the kind of period detail Yanks have come to expect in a Merchant-Ivory production. Secretarial services are also available, making it easy to conduct business in Edwardian style. Request room No. 11 for its French windows overlooking the lovely enclosed Egerton Garden.<p>The 25-room Draycott (44-71-730-6466; doubles about $225) has a light-filled lounge for sipping drinks and junior suites that feel like guest bedrooms in a country manor. Guests have included actresses Uma Thurman and Penelope Ann Miller and photographer Annie Leibowitz. Visitors will appreciate complimentary memberships to a health club and the tony Vanderbilt Tennis Club, as well as nanny service.<p>Around the corner, on the site of what was once the Chelsea Cricket Grounds, is Eleven Cadogan Gardens (44-71-730-3426; doubles about $198). Housed in four red-brick mansions, the hotel's 60 rooms attract film stars and diplomats. Perhaps it's the ineffable atmosphere of a private ancestral home: Eleven Cadogan Gardens is crammed with overstuffed chairs, imperious grandfather clocks, and oil paintings of dour grande dames perched above the wainscoting. Unlike such homes, however, this one provides a chauffeured Rolls-Royce to guests running late to the theater; just call room service.<p>The Beaufort (44-71-584-5252; doubles about $238), located in a leafy cul-de-sac less than 100 yards from Harrods, has carved out a niche for itself as a haven for business travelers, especially women. The Beaufort's billing system is unique to the townhouse category: A single rate includes all drinks (including champagne), breakfast, and health club. The hotel also employs the almost unheard-of practice of billing telephone calls at cost.<p>Chelsea is still London's nexus of money and fashion, so it's not surprising that two of the most imaginative hotels are located here. The whimsical Sloane Hotel (44-71-581-5757; doubles about $180), whose postmodern lobby (picture a leopard-skin sofa, stacks of antique Vuitton luggage, and a Napoleonic uniform hanging opposite the marble fireplace) is but a harbinger for the ten highly variegated rooms. The owner, Sue Rogers, has handpicked the hundreds of antiques throughout the hotel, but for enough money you can acquire her impeccable taste: Every stick of furniture in the hotel can be purchased and shipped home.<p>Finally, there is the muy trendy Sydney House (44-71-376-7711; doubles about $165). Try room No. 11, a tongue-in-cheek take on British imperialism, with cane furniture, tiger-skin pillows, and prints of Victorian-era Egypt composed as though in a fashion shoot. There's a room in the basement dining area set up for business meetings, and "deep cleansing and stress-reduction treatments" for hair can be arranged through a nearby salon. Be sure to request a room away from noisy Sydney Street.<p><p>

The lowdown on five invigorating new convertibles.<p>By Stephan Wilkinson<p>In a world filled with soap-bar sedans and can't-tell-'em-apart sport utility vehicles, a convertible can put playfulness and distinction into what might otherwise be just another rolling appliance. It's why ragtop drivers often wave to each other, a revival of the rite in which 1950s sports-car owners indulged as they declared their individuality.<p>Your hand won't get very tired: Only about 1.8 percent -- 155,000 -- of the cars sold in the United States last year were convertibles, so you'll be a member of an exclusive club. Still, not counting aftermarket customizations or such six-digit anomalies as the $269,000 Rolls-Royce Corniche, there are 20 production convertibles available to domestic car shoppers this summer, up from nearly zero in the mid-1970s, when manufacturers' fears of sweeping regulations on rollover safety stampeded them into discontinuing drop-top development. Here are five worth owning.<p>
MAZDA MIATA - base price $17,000<p>Mazda's biggest challenge with this latter-day classic is how to renew it annually without infringing on what is already a near-perfect two-seat roadster design. For this, the Miata's fifth year, the company has added an invisible 200cc to the engine displacement, which ups the horsepower and torque some 10 percent, but nobody has messed with the stunningly clean styling or simple interior. In some cars, you can go 90 and think you're doing 60; the Miata's strength is that 60 feels like 90, with your elbow inches from the yellow line and your butt back near the rear wheels. Still, the Miata is a toy car. Unless you're in high school, you won't consider it a primary or even a secondary vehicle, since the trunk is big enough for only a backpack and there's barely room in the cockpit for two seats. If you have teenage kids, buy it for them so you can borrow it once in a while.<p>
VOLKSWAGEN CABRIO - base price $19,975<p>When convertibles slowly returned to the market in the late 1970s, the Volkswagen Rabbit soft top, destined to be the valley girl's chosen mount, was the first modern one. The new-for-'95 VW Cabrio -- a convertible Golf -- inherits that original Rabbit's spunk, style, practicality, and value. You'll never mistake its tall, chunky bulk and psychedelic seat fabrics for a domestic or Japanese product -- the Cabrio is decidedly Euro-brash -- but it's an honest four-seater. It offers the security of a relatively unobtrusive roll bar and is suffused with a delightful lightness of touch, steering, and handling. While its four-cylinder, 115-horsepower engine hardly makes it a high-performance car, agile responsiveness and supple handling make the VW Cabrio far more fun to drive than it deserves to be.<p>
BMW 325i - base price $38,800<p>The current three-series BMW is the best-handling production car in the world, so finely sized, tuned, and balanced that it redefines four-wheel precision. The six-cylinder engine is a jewel, virtually a turbine with pistons, and the lined cabriolet top is Germanic in fit and operation. Twist a single release handle, push a button, and the windows partially retract while the top slides automatically into its metal-lidded boot. Pedestrians will applaud, but if 40 grand seems a stiff initiation fee, BMW recently introduced the identically bodied 318i convertible for a base price of $29,900 with a 1.8-liter four-cylinder engine and manual top.<p>
PORSCHE 911 CARRERA CABRIOLET - base price $68,200<p>Porsche's rear-engine, air-cooled staple, the 911, reengineered and restyled for the 1995 model year, is two machines: a sober, tractable around-town car at ordinary speeds, and a crazed race car when pushed anywhere in the direction of the rather extreme limits of its performance. If the BMW is a scalpel, the Carrera can be a Glock 9mm. Don't fool around with it if you don't know what you're doing. As a convertible, the Carrera provides a top-down driving experience close to what you'd have gotten at Le Mans or Sebring in the good old days -- but in a car you can also drive to the mall.<p>
JAGUAR XJS - base price $79,950<p>The XJS is less the inheritor of classic Jag roadsters' genes than it is a modern-day Duesenberg: the most mass, metal, and hood length that can be set aside for the ostentatious carriage of two individuals. (The vestigial back '"seats'" are good only for parcels and Yorkies.) In ordinary driving conditions, it quickly becomes apparent that this is a big car, with reason to require the torque of a six-liter, 278-horsepower V12 engine, redesigned for '94. At 55 mph, the XJS has all the panache and best qualities of a '60s Caddy convertible. Urge it anywhere toward triple-digit speeds on an empty two-lane, however, and you'll experience the quality that makes Jaguars so special: the sinuous, silky handling and supple road holding that turns a two-and-a-quarter-ton boulevard boar into the ride of a lifetime.<p><p>When convertible fever strikes, it's time to get a grip. The perceived need to drive around in an automobile that can be reopened with a steak knife in order to take fullest advantage of melanoma opportunities and engage in face-to-face repartee with squeegee men has created a considerable fleet of ragtops that, after the first 3,000 miles, are never again driven alfresco. "A convertible is the perfect rental car,'" my all-too-practical wife insists. '"You drive around Miami with the top down for two days, turn it in at the airport on Monday morning, and you're all done."<p>That's not bad advice: Consider renting a convertible -- any convertible -- for a weekend before you take the plunge. You might find that not being able to hear the radio, re-erecting the top every time you park at the mall, and driving with the sun in your eyes half the time gets old fast. Then again, you might not.<p>

						<p>By Laurence Hooper<p>Used to be I was scared of roller coasters -- made so by my mother, who warned once that screaming curves and sickening drops were a sure way to trigger hidden heart defects. Only on pain of teen ridicule did I finally break with her advice. I recall it as I recall other first times: excruciating in buildup, exhilarating in release, and over far too soon. As my car slowed to a halt, I knew my mother was wrong. Roller coasters are about life, not death.<p>No wonder my heart fluttered, then, upon learning about a new type of roller coaster, Back to the Future: The Ride. The high-tech coaster fuses a movie with a flight simulator to immerse passengers in a make-believe world -- virtual reality, in a way, but without the goofy goggles. Speed and thrills are still the drug. But participants never actually move: They "ride" through a movie that streams around them as their car is jolted by a moving platform. The hurtling sensation is so convincing that some may retch with motion sickness. Not even a real heart defect could stop me from trying this.<p>Such futuristic rides are popping up all over -- in theme parks, obviously, but also in casinos. Steven Spielberg will unveil a Jurassic Park ride before long, taking the form to new heights. Right now, however, the quintessential version is the Back to the Future ride, the main draw at the Universal Studios theme parks in Orlando, Florida, and Hollywood. For me, it was the sole reason to visit Universal Studios. That meant I would pay $29.95 and stand in line for 90 minutes, all for a ride that lasted just about 5 minutes.<p>Back to the Future begins entertaining riders while they're still in line. Televisions go behind the scenes of the eponymous hit movie and its two sequels and also set up the ride's premise -- that riders are 21st-century volunteers in a time-travel experiment. Amusing signs deconstruct 21st-century gadgets, including the time-traveling DeLorean car used in the ride. One snag: If the wait is more than 40 minutes or so, the line snakes beyond this waiting area. On my first visit, this meant my friends and I had to kill almost an hour doing some low-tech chatting.<p>Once inside the waiting area, though, things go quickly. Somehow the line never stops moving, and the patter from the TVs is soothing and sometimes funny. The last 20 minutes or so are spent inside the main pavilion where the ride's plot unfolds: Biff Tannen, the heavy from the movies, is running amok in the building. As ride time approaches, eight "volunteers" are ushered into an intimidating staging area where their task becomes clear: They must chase Biff and his stolen DeLorean through time and bring him (you guessed it) back to the future.<p>Anyone who's seen the movies will remember that the DeLorean is rigged so it can fly. This makes for a truly thrilling ride. Imagine a darker, scarier version of the famous IMAX movie To Fly, but with viewers physically thrown around by each bone-juddering turn, lurching dip, and terrifying crash. The feeling of motion is utterly convincing. When the DeLorean "brakes," riders are thrown forward just as in a car that has been speeding. When it plummets from the sky, they instinctively brace just as in a plunging roller coaster. Some effects are a tad cheesy, but the overall feel is exactly as intended: Riders are inside a movie, participating in the chase scene. By ride's end, I felt drained by an experience like none I'd ever had before. And I was ready for more.<p>WHAT YOU GET: The best roller coaster ride of your life and a glimpse into entertainment's future. Also, entrance to everything else at Universal Studios.<p>EXTRAS: Souvenir T-shirt, $14.95; "acid hat" from the second Back to the Future movie, $19.95; toy remote-control DeLorean, $49.95. <p>WHAT YOU MIGHT BUY INSTEAD: Entry to Six Flags Magic Mountain park for Batman the Ride, a state-of-the-art "real" coaster, plus a small snack. Two thirds of a copy of <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>'s Flight Simulator computer game. Nine rentals of the Top Gun video, plus popcorn. Twenty-three miles in a New York City cab.<p>BOTTOM LINE: If you've never done it before, it's worth every penny. But a second visit reveals that the experience doesn't have the repeat power of either of its components, a roller coaster or a blockbuster movie. Wait instead for Jurassic Park: The Ride.<p><p>

By Francis Gasparini<p>It's said that everything comes back in style if you wait long enough. Monks and nuns have waited several hundred years to become au courant again, but from clothes to music to leisure time, the contemplative life (or at least the contemplative lifestyle) is finally making a comeback.<p>The revival was first seen on fashion runways, with loose flowing garb based on monastery wear created by designers like Donna Karan, Geoffrey Beene, and Calvin Klein. The interest has also fueled the resurgence of medieval plainsong: <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a> Classical, Erato, and Angel Records have all released Gregorian chant albums; Angel's offering, Chant, has sold over a million copies and reached the top ten on the Billboard pop chart.<p>The new monasticism is not solely a Catholic or even a Christian phenomenon. In the mountains of California's Ventana Wilderness, the Soto Zen Buddhist monastery Tassajara (408-659-2229) offers restorative hot springs as well as an introduction to non-Western methods of meditation. Rooms at Tassajara range from spartan wooden cabins to antique-furnished stone rooms whose patios offer sweeping views. Guests can participate in workshops on yoga and vegetarian cooking or simply relax and enjoy the setting. "We get lots of high-powered executive types who are escaping their cellular phones," says Jim Jordan, Tassajara's treasurer.<p>In Darien, Connecticut, the Catholic Sisters of Saint Brigitta run the Vikingsborg Guest House (203-655-1068) as a sort of blessed bed and breakfast for the world-weary. Like many apostolic retreats, Vikingsborg offers few diversions besides optional masses. Vikingsborg and Tassajara are also ideal for reflecting on the significance of monk mania. Does it signal a reawakening of spirituality, or is it merely another fad?<p>

How do vegetable chips taste? We rate the crop.<p>By Lauren Picker<p>Colorful chips made from vegetables are mushrooming in popularity, snagging gourmet market shelf space, and gracing the plates of many trendy restaurants. While the latest snack-food fad commands only a few million dollars in annual revenue so far -- peanuts compared to the $4.4 billion potato-chip market -- veggie chips are quickly "establishing a niche in the market," says Al Rickard of the Snack Food Association. With an unearned healthful image and the aesthetic appeal (and sometimes the taste) of potpourri, veggie chips offer a new frontier for snackers who don't mind the bite of high prices. A taste test, from yuca to just plain yuck:<p>TERRA CHIPS (*****) Founded by a pair of New York City caterers who offered veggie chips in lieu of crudites, this brand boasts sales that are doubling yearly. No wonder: Its award-winning batata, parsnip, taro, and yuca chips ($4.79 for six ounces) are crisp, crunchy, and not too salty -- pleasing to the eye and the palate. A new flavor, spiced sweet potato ($2.99 for six ounces), has real zing.<p>BARBARA'S (****) Way ahead of the curve with visually striking sweet-potato chips a decade ago, Barbara's chips ($1.99 to $2.49 for five ounces) remain a mixed bag. The sweet-potato chips are yammy but hardly yummy, while tortilla chips made with corn, brown rice, and beans are unremarkable. Still, Barbara's True Blue potato chips are truly delicious, and the crunchy taro flavor, sold under the Ray's brand, is an all-round pip of a chip.<p>ROUTE 11 (****) This small fry's mixed-vegetable chips ($9 to $12 for a decorative six-ounce tin) are a tad less crisp and a touch more greasy than those of its nationally distributed competitors. Still, the manufacturer from Middletown, Virginia, holds its own.<p>PEDDLERS OFFBEAT ORIGINALS, sold as Harry's Garden Vegetable Chips on the East Coast (***) Sturdy but light, these veggie-flavored tortilla chips are great chips to dip. But the truth about these "incredibly hip chips" ($1.99 to $2.39 for eight ounces) is that some are hipper than others. Carrot caraway, for example, is way tasty -- even though it is mostly corn. But the pea-soup-colored mixed veggie is a dud. And of the mild bean, one taster said, "Yes, I can eat just one."<p>SARATOGA (** 1/2) Packaged in a shiny foil wrapper, these chips (about $4.50 for six ounces of mixed veggie; $3.25 for sweet potato) are a pale imitator of Terra Chips. Chewing them requires some serious jaw action -- and what exactly is a malanga, anyway?<p>MAINE COAST SEA VEGETABLES (*) These so-called sea chips ($1.98 for six ounces) are made from tortillas flavored with dulse and kelp seaweed. About as appetizing as they sound. Strictly for the hard-core health nut; all others snack at their own risk.<p>VEG OUT (*) The only good thing about these chips ($4.95 for 5.5 ounces), which include carrots, squash, and green beans, is that 0.5 percent of sales are donated to the National Foundation for Teaching Entrepreneurship. <p>

						<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Brittany's may be more delicate, and Australia's may have more spine, but when it comes to lobster this summer, if it's not from Maine, it's treason. Here's how to sink your claws (and teeth) into the ultimate Homarus americanus:<p>SHAKE THAT SHELLFISH. The lobster hunter's first task, says Eric Ripert, executive chef at New York's Le Bernardin, is to "check if it is alive" -- and literally kicking, a sure sign that it has eaten off the ocean floor in the not-too-distant past. Always pick your prospect up. The angrier it gets, the fresher it'll taste.<p>CHECK THE ANTENNAE. After about a month in the pen, lobsters start eating each other alive. They regenerate lost parts, but as Augusta Seafood's Florence Benedict says, "it's nice to know they have everything." Long antennae indicate that the owner hasn't been locked up forever.<p>HIT ON THE HAIRY-LEGGED WOMAN. Crustacean connoisseurs worship the lobster goddess for her roe, or coral, which turns red when cooked. You can tell it's a female by the hairs on the tiny paddle fins under her tail end. (Male lobsters are relatively bald.)<p>TAKE IT HARD. Hard-shell lobsters generally have more meat than the oft-shedding soft. To get a particularly hearty one, feel the first ring of the belly. "If it's firm and bumpy," says Ripert, "it's full of meat."<p>BEWARE OF THE FEATURE CREATURE. When you're hungry, a giant can be tempting. But before throwing money at that uber-crustacean, remember: quality before quantity. With lobsters over three pounds, the meat tends to be tough. Besides, you have to fit it in the pot.<p><p><p>

All you need for outdoor fun in the coming season <p>By Elizabeth Royte<p>SAILBOAT:
Racing with the wind
In 1992, William Koch and Buddy Melges successfully defended the America's Cup with their radical America3, a $5 million, 75-foot boat. Now ordinary yachtsmen can sail like a high-rolling consortium of investors and naval architects in the Melges 24, a racing sailboat with many of the innovations of the America3 but at one third the length and 1/130th the price. The Melges 24 has been clocked at more than 20 knots downwind, an impressive speed for a boat its size and shape. It handles with the responsiveness of a smaller boat, thanks to the 624-pound bulb at the end of its keel, which lowers the center of gravity and gives greater stability. The mast, keel fin, rudder, and tiller are made of carbon composites--lighter than metal but remarkably strong. It also has a kelp cutter, a steel blade that runs along 
the front of the keel and slices through accumulated aquatic debris, stuff that might, heaven forbid, slow you down. Melges Boatworks: 414-248-6621; $38,500.<p>
In-Line Skates
Protect the innocent<p>In-line skating is the fastest-growing sport in the country. Problem is, few of the newest devotees know how to stop. Rollerblade's new Active Braking Technology, available on five models, promises to take the terror out of terminating. It works like this: Instead of lifting the toes to activate the heel brake--the old method--the skater simply slides her braking foot forward. The change in foot angle puts pressure on the skate cuff, which lowers a braking device to the ground. The brake height adjusts to match skill level and skating style. Bladers already confident of their stopping skills will find ABT gives them better speed control on hills, a development that ought to please the world of innocent bystanders. Rollerblade: 800-232-7655; $149-$339.<p>
Bicycle
The shape of things that have almost come<p>For almost a year, cyclists have waited as if for the Second Coming for the radical new Cannondale V 4000. Finally, it's almost here. Available in August, the V 4000 may just be the lightest mountain bike in the world with both front and rear suspension. Alex Pong, the bike's iconoclastic designer, compares his creation to a modern jet. Here's why: Not at all tubular, the frame of the V 4000 is more like a fuselage, made of aluminum machined away on the inside to leave only ribs and skin. The result weighs just over 20 pounds (compared with about 27 pounds for a conventional bike). The frame comprises four panels, so if you dump, it's easy to replace parts. It's also easy to install them; almost the entire bike uses identical screws, which means you need only one wrench. Among other ways this bike is visibly different from anything else in the shops today: The identical front and back wheels mount to the frame on one side only. Cannondale: 800-245-3872; $5,000-$7,000.<p>
Golf clubs
The new Iron Age<p>In 1991, <a name="NASD:CLWY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11387"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Callaway</b></a> golf introduced its oversize big Bertha metal woods, and the earth moved under the feet of duffers 'round the world. Now, with much hype and fanfare, Callaway presents two lines of Big Bertha irons. Other companies offer oversize irons, but Callaway is betting that its will provide more consistent hitting over different parts of the club head. "It's too soon to tell whether Big Bertha irons will be as effective as the woods," says Golf Digest equipment editor Ed Weathers, "but expectations are high and retailers have ordered a lot." Callaway calls Big Bertha a "distance weapon" in keeping with the militaristic theme: Big Bertha was a World War I cannon alleged to have fired cannonballs 94 miles with a fair degree of accuracy--longer than any fairway golfers will encounter. Callaway: 800-228-2767; $125 and $170 per club.<p>
Tennis Racket
Head strong<p>The wilson sledge hammer 3.8si may be the weirdest-looking racket on the court, but it's also--at 9.2 ounces--the lightest. In fact, it's the lightest performance racket ever made. Wilson whittled mass from the handle and shifted it to the head, a move that brings power and control to the player's swing. With the head wider at the top than the bottom and strings that splay out in a fan shape--two more design innovations--the sweet spot gets moved up about an inch and a half on the racket face, which is good news for average players. Wilson: 800-946-6060; $320.<p>
Biodegradable Backpack
The greenest way to carry granola<p>When James Cox, a former product designer at the North Face, communes with nature, he doesn't want petrochemical products to mar the experience. Looking for an alternative to synthetic outdoor gear, he designed a day pack constructed of undyed, untreated, organically grown hemp, wool-felt shoulder straps, linen webbing, and staghorn closures. The end result, says Cox, is "bomber"--strong as Cordura nylon, comfortable to wear, and water-resistant, too. When the pack has reached the end of its natural life, you can mail the brass hardware back and get a 20 percent discount on future purchases. Then return the hemp to the nitrogen cycle: It will compost nicely in your backyard. TerraPax cost more than conventional day packs, but then again, says Cox, "they're not subsidized by the environment--by oil spills like Valdez." TerraPax: 800-308-3772; $130.<p>
Kayak
Bring the family<p>Little kids and big kayaks don't always mix. Children get tired of pushing around 16 feet of boat. They get discouraged, and they start to whine. Aquaterra has improved the dynamics of family paddling with the new Umiak designed for smaller and lighter paddlers. It weighs only 35 pounds, compared with at least 50 pounds for a typical adult model. The integral skeg--a small rear fin--gives sure tracking; the low absolute profile means the boat handles well in rough weather. The Umiak comes with bungee deck rigging fore and aft, grab loops, reflective tape, and foam walls to aid flotation. The makers of the small Umiak are also thinking big about the future of kayaking: They'll recycle any old kayak you send them, grinding it down to make parts, and will even pick up the freight charges. Aquaterra: 800-845-0762; $479.<p>
sleeping system
Fed approved<p>You don't need a bad suit, mirrored shades, and a high-level security clearance to play federal agent. The FBI tested Envirogear's Cocoon, and this high-tech sleeping system passed. Backpacker magazine's equipment editor also gives it thumbs up. The Cocoon is a sleeping bag, tent, sleeping pad, and ground cloth in one. Filled with down, it has two inflatable chambers: one a four-inch mattress, the other a blanket whose warmth increases as you pump in air. Unlike conventional bags, the Cocoon's insulation never gets compressed; also unlike conventional bags, the Cocoon is designed to be comfortable in a wide range of temperatures--as cold as 45 degrees below zero and as warm as 70 above. When wrestled into its stuff sack, it measures 9 by 17 inches, and it weighs just eight and a half pounds--a far cry from the accumulated weight of everything the system replaces. Envirogear: 607-753-8801; $395.<p>
Fishing Rod
A proprietary resin system runs through it<p>Thanks to the fall of the Berlin wall, americans will make longer and more accurate casts this summer. G. Loomis, looking for a lighter graphite for its already famously light fly rods, persuaded a defense contractor feeling the peacetime pinch to supply a fiber that shaves 25 percent off the lightest rod on the water. Assembled as Loomis's GLX Anti-Gravity line, these rods transfer more energy from the casting stroke to the fly line, have the highest strain rate in fishdom, and come out of a bend with alacrity, so vibration is damped and casts are smoother. Loomis claims the GLX casts as responsively at 15 feet as at 50. "With the GLX, a mediocre caster will be much better," says an enthusiastic company spokesman, quickly adding, "Well, he'll look better." G. Loomis: 800-662-8818; $440-$535.<p>
Surfboard
In the older, fatter green room<p>Imagine you're a little heavy and, perhaps, a little out of shape for cranking speed out of your ultrathin short board. But you're too cool to make the leap to the conservative long board. David Parmenter's remedy, the Stubb Vector, is a dignified compromise, a slight variation on standard hybrid boards with an emphasis on speed and carving. The Vector is about the same width as a hybrid (21 inches), the same or shorter in length (from 6 feet 5 inches to 7 feet), but less thick, making it more responsive. "It's the perfect board for aging surfers," says Surfer magazine editor Ben Marcus. "You know, guys in their 30s." Available at Moondoggies: 805-541-1995; $350.<p>

						<p>By Suzanne Costas<p>As Cole Porter observed, some get their kicks in a plane. But with air travel a lot like going Greyhound these days, it takes more than a ride in a commercial jet to keep spirits soaring. Thrill seekers can now experience what it's like to be a fighter pilot firsthand. Actor Alan Thicke, <a name="NYSE:ODP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Office Depot</b></a> president Mark Begelman, and motivational guru Anthony Robbins have all climbed into the cockpits of real fighter planes to engage in mock combat maneuvers. For $35,000, Hammacher Schlemmer even flies you to Moscow to put you on board a MiG.<p>What started in Fullerton, California, in 1989 with a company called Air Combat USA has mushroomed nationwide. American T-34-A Mentor and SF-260 SIAI Marchetti fighters don't break the sound barrier like the Russian MiGs do, but the price isn't as lofty: only about $750 per person for one hour in the air. After a preflight briefing (no experience required; veteran pilots do most of the actual flying), you get airborne, pressed into the seat by a force of up to six Gs.<p>Basic maneuvers like high and low yo-yos and gunsight tracking are all part of the fun. Laser-beam gun systems, billowing smoke (a valid kill sends a cloud out the back of the target plane), and in some cases explosive sound effects all simulate aerial combat. Don't forget the Dramamine: Assuming your stomach holds out, you'll attempt the intensively competitive dogfighting flyboys call "the knife fight in a phone booth." <p><p><p>

Eating at your hotel is no longer a last resort<p>By John Mariani<p>It used to be the conventional wisdom that the food at a resort didn't need to be very good, because no one went to a resort to dine in the grand manner. But with the increased competition for leisure-time dollars, a fine dining room on premises has become one of those amenities sophisticated travelers demand, and resorts have finally responded by paying the same attention to their cuisine as they do to their golf greens. Instead of hiring over-the-hill banquet chefs with names like Franz und Hans, resorts are making an effort to attract real talent.<p>For those who believe that no vacation is complete without a great meal at the end of the day, here's a guide to some of America's finest restaurants--which happen to be in some of America's finest resorts.<p>AUBERGE DU SOLEIL. There are few more beautiful views in America than the one from the veranda of this Napa Valley retreat. You look out over the rolling hillsides and gardens of the 33-acre property and watch the sun set over the vineyards. The air is fresh with the smell of grapes. You watch a hawk arching downward through the pines while sipping on a chardonnay produced within miles of where you sit. Because this is in the middle of wine country, the people who come here bring a very sophisticated appetite with them. Chef David Hale's Californian cuisine includes original dishes like sun-dried-cherry-stuffed quail served on wild-rice gnocchi in a bourbon pan sauce, grilled double venison chops with smoked potato hash and an apple-bacon sage sauce, and apricot-pine nut tart (707-963-1211; dinner for two, about $75).<p>RANCHO BERNARDO INN. The first thing you notice as you enter this resort just outside San Diego in the San Pasqual Mountains is the inebriating smell of oak burning in the fireplace. Your appetite will be racing. Head straight for El Bizcocho, a dining room with adobe walls framed in limed wood, dotted with some exquisite antiques and artwork. Settle in behind a wide, candle-lit table, and wait to be approached by the sommelier to discuss the 650-label wine list, and then be served a superb meal by chef Thomas Dowling. The menu here has a distinct international cast. The sauteed prawns with tomato concasse and ginger beurre blanc, the lobster bisque with Armagnac, and the roast rack of lamb with fresh herbs show the classic range of this fine dining room (303-920-6330; dinner for two, about $80).<p>THE BOULDERS. Many guests to this Arizona resort are drawn by the golf course--one of only 17 in the United States to receive a gold-medal award from Golf magazine. The landscape is breathtaking, eerily quiet except for the sound of coyotes howling at dawn. And at the resort's two dining rooms, the starkly elegant Latilla room and the more casual Palo Verde, chef Chuck Wiley has proved himself one of the most inventive cuisiniers in the West. He loves working with the flavors of the Southwest at Palo Verde, with bright dishes like achiote-chile-basted veal chop with pumpkin-seed cream and red pepper orzo, and Southwestern-style "bouillabaisse" made with grilled nopal cactus. At Latilla, he works magic with local game like pan-seared buffalo loin with vegetable potato hash and juniper-berry sauce. At twilight, from the window of Latilla, you may see the family of bobcats that lives in the towering rocks above you (602-488-9009; dinner for two, about $90 at Latilla, $75 at Palo Verde).<p>THE LITTLE NELL. Aspen is lovely enough in the winter, but I much prefer it in the summer, when the entire valley is dotted with wildflowers and the mountains are not so forbidding for exploration. The dining room at the Little Nell is set within full view of the majestic Aspen Mountain. Here chef George Mahaffey (formerly of the Bel-Air Hotel) turns out cuisine as spectacular as the scenery itself, drawing on the traditions of Colorado cookery while marrying it to the finesse of a classic European dining experience. Mahaffey's menus offer dishes like grilled golden trout with seasonal greens, corn spoonbread and green onion-morel mushroom compote, blackbuck antelope osso buco braised in mole with cilantro-vegetable rice, and blueberry and almond tea cakes with vanilla-buttermilk sorbet and mixed-berry sauce (303-920-6330; dinner for two, about $80)<p>GRAND WAILEA. There are places on earth so rich in natural beauty that fine restaurants seem rather beside the point. The island of Maui is a stunning case in point, for one doesn't go there expecting to find any gastronomic experience to match the sunrise over Haleakala Crater. Yet increasingly Maui is home to some of Hawaii's most inventive restaurants, led by Kincha at this lavish resort. The $22 million restaurant has tatami rooms and a serene rock garden set with 800 tons of stones brought from Mount Fuji. The best way to sample chef Tsuyoshi Yoshida's artistry is to have him create a multicourse kaiseki dinner composed of dishes like deep-fried sea urchin and broiled corn with shoyu flour, lobster broiled in an earthenware hibachi, and steamed abalone with vinegar sauce (808-875-1234; dinner for two, from about $150).<p>THE GRAND BAY HOTEL. If you seek respite from the glitz of Miami Beach, check in to this Coconut Grove resort. At the Grand Bay Cafe, the chef is Pascal Oudin, who worked with Michelin stars Roger Verge, Michel Rostang, and Alain Ducasse. Oudin's training shows in his marvelous melding of native Floridian ingredients into simple but revelatory dishes like plantain-wrapped baked pompano with a chartreuse of scallops and eggplant with champagne-caviar sauce, Florida lobster ravioli flavored with sea urchin and American caviar, and crisp striped sea bass with crushed black pepper and a red wine reduction (305-858-9600; dinner for two, about $85). <p><p><p>

By Will Dana<p>This month William Wegman's ABC (Hyperion Books for Children, $17.95), the fanciful dog photographer's third picture book for children, is published. Wegman's trademark weimaraners pose across glossy pages, dolefully contorted into the letters of the alphabet. Is it art? Or whimsy? Or, perhaps, very clever marketing? ABC, like Wegman's sly retellings of the Little Red Riding Hood and Cinderella tales, is at the forefront of a new wave in children's publishing: books that appeal as much to the adults who buy them as to the kids they are bought for. "Children see Wegman on Sesame Street," says Howard Reeves, an editor at Hyperion, "and the grown-ups see his work at the Whitney."<p>Fine-art children's books are taking off now for two reasons. First, children are becoming harder to please. "TV has educated kids so that when they see illustration, they aren't content with something superficial," says Emily Andrews, a collector of original children's-book art in Portland, Oregon. "They want content and detail." For their part, parents want to buy books that reflect their own view of the world; hence many of these books rely heavily on a postmodern cultivation of willed naivete; they are silly and fun but also knowing and droll. Take, for example, Henrik Drescher's Pat the Beastie, an arch, spiky parody of Pat the Bunny.<p>Original art from these books is also gaining status among adults, spawning a new field of collection. In Los Angeles, Every Picture Tells a Story..., an art gallery and bookstore, sells the art from children's books to customers such as Robin Williams, Harrison Ford, Tim Allen, and Phil Collins. Until the gallery was founded in 1989, there was little market for this work. Today, pieces by contemporary illustrators like William Joyce and Tim Burton fetch between $500 and $16,000, and vintage work can be far more expensive. One of Ludwig Bemelmans' original illustrations for his Madeline books brought $30,000.<p><p><p>

						<p>By Glenn Helmers<p>When speed skater Dan Jansen finally raced to Olympic victory this winter, he did it in Oakley sunglasses. His shades were as streamlined as the hooded racing skin he wore. While these new specs may already be the frames of choice among the athletic set - Nike head honcho Phil Knight wears Oakleys just about every day - they certainly aren't the only game in town. This season, vintage styles are also coming on strong.<p>Even L.A. Eyeworks, known for its avant-garde designs, is looking backward for a change: The current collection boasts a series of totally modern interpretations of vintage shapes, such as the Felix, an anodized version of a 1950s tortoiseshell staple. But the '90s are about basics, and plain metal sunglasses like those worn in the military have never looked so good. Recast in metals such as silver, pewter, even nickel, often in brushed raw finishes, they are the benchmark of cool for shielding the eyes.<p>

In the trenches with a top <a name="NYSE:XRX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11657"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Xerox</b></a> sales team.<p>By John House<p>Anyone who's been on the receiving end of a skillful sales pitch knows that "the coitus of commerce," as author David Dorsey calls it, can seem an awful lot like date rape. Even the most practiced seducers sometimes confess to seeing it that way and will own up to pangs - however fleeting - of remorse. So why, apart from the obvious need to make a living somehow, would anyone keep at it year after year? And what, after typically sacrificing marital harmony, self-respect, and a healthy stomach, are salespeople getting in return?<p>One of Dorsey's aims in The Force (Random House, $23) is to offer a glimpse at some individual answers. For a year, he lived among a group of top salespeople in the Cleveland office of Xerox, sitting in on the pep-rally staff meetings, tagging along on plaintive sales calls, listening to incessant interoffice harangues. More important, he got to follow some of his subjects home, giving him the chance to see how the triumphs and dissatisfactions of their workaday lives played out around the kitchen table. The result is a kind of de-Mametized Glengarry Glen Ross - a mercantile drama without the misanthropy and the expletives, featuring sales manager Fred Thomas as the flawed but essentially decent but dogged hero. "All along," Dorsey writes of one especially trying encounter with a potential customer, "Fred played the puppy dog, warm and ingratiating. When he got outside onto the sidewalk, though, Fred wanted to smash something, possibly some portion of Salter's facial anatomy. Fred had learned his share of boyhood lessons. He didn't need Salter's advice on maturity and patience. He needed the man's signature."<p>What keeps the Cleveland office humming is a combustible mix of ambition, anxiety, loyalty, and shame, and Dorsey vividly conveys the taste of each. He shows exactly what Fred's "force" is all about: both a canny sales squad and the willpower to push each deal to a profitable close. But Fred depends on the force in another sense as well, and for this his Yoda is Frank Pacetta, the district manager. Though Dorsey describes him as a "corporate puppet" and a bit of a martinet, Frank manages to inspire his staff, whether by gathering everyone into a huddle at yet another raucous company-paid outing or by grabbing a sales rep in a jubilant headlock, all the while spouting quotations from Dylan and the Band. Fred doesn't miss the deep insincerity in his boss's noisy cheerleading, but something about it nourishes him all the same.<p>On the whole, Dorsey is far better at sketching the Cleveland contingent's tics and totems (like the troll doll that sits each month on the desk of the manager with the worst results) than he is at articulating the moral he keeps stretching to find. His effort to weave a church sermon based on the Parsifal story into his own theme of the salesman's quest falls particularly flat. "It sounded so simple," he writes. "Just ask a single question every day, like a ceaseless prayer: What is your sorrow? Don't put it into words. Put it into action.... What if Fred were to do exactly that with his customers? Wasn't that supposed to be the way things worked?"<p>For the most part, though, the platitudes can be overlooked amid the numerous telling vignettes, as when Fred asks his wife to dance at a corporate outing: "This is what she wants - a dance, a genuine touch. This modest gesture, without ambiguity, without any multiple layers of meaning and intent, means more to her than any of Fred's words at dinner.... Fred has quit talking and started doing something." Seeing the Thomases try to puzzle out their future serves as counterweight not only to most of Fred and Frank's bombast, but to some of Dorsey's as well.<p><p>

						<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Mountain bikes attack the earth, and touring cycles roam it, but hybrids just want to have fun. Here's why a hybrid - part road bike, part off-roader - is the best bike for most riders.<p>Your aching back. Unless you have a race to win, there's no reason to crouch over drop handlebars (which are good for aerodynamics, but tough on the back). Flat handlebars let you sit up comfortably and take in the scenery. The shifters sit right next to your hands.<p>Tireless tires. Hybrid tires are stout (at least 32 mm in width, with a good tread), so you can hop curbs and ride trails. But they're fast and smooth enough for short road rides. <p>All due speed. Triple chain rings up front give you enough gears for hill, dale, and dusty trail.<p>Not rock bottom. Narrow, firm seats are strictly for Tour de France types. A hybrid's gel saddle is easy on  the, um, pressure points.<p>Multiple personalities. Most hybrids come with braze-ons for the attachment of racks and bottle holders. Add a lighting system and fenders (not cool, but crucial in rain), and you're set. As soon as you get your helmet, that is.<p>Cheap thrills. Although the best hybrid will cost the moon ($5,000), a fine one can be had for a song (about $250).<p><p>

						<p>By Carla Koehl<p>It's becoming as easy to get a massage these days as it is to get a meal at <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> - and at roughly the same price. So as more and more storefront services such as the Great American BackRub offer $9.95 rubdowns, why would anyone want to drop thousands of dollars on a massage chair? To find out, I sank into the top-of-the-line chair, the Get-a-Way Chair Premiere II ($2,595) from HWE.<p>Like the best traditional body massages, the rollers and vibrators of a Premiere II actively exercise the muscles they contact, reviving them in a way that's akin to a meditation session - and leave you feeling as if you've been through a form of mild hypnosis. The sensation is of someone rolling a huge, firm rubber ball from your lower back all the way up to your neck, focusing on the spots you choose and vibrating on command. The overwhelming urge, of course, is to drop everything you'd planned to do for the next half hour, sit back, and wait for your eyes to glaze over. <p>True, it takes just two hands to give a great traditional massage, but re-creating the stimulating effects of one is slightly more complex. "It was like making a car," says HWE vice president of marketing Mark Wollman of the chair's development. From original concept to final product took almost three years and about $2 million in research and development, a half-billion-dollar factory in Japan, and a design team of six. The chairs are so comforting that American Airlines and Air France furnish several of their airport lounges with them to help passengers ease the back pain associated with long flights. <p>The streamlined Premiere II has the added advantage of being a piece of furniture you can stand to look at. And once you've fought the kids for the chair, sat down, turned on the massage mechanism, and flipped to The McLaughlin Group, you'll have no trouble remembering why you bought it.<p><p>The $2,595 Back Rub: What You Get <p>-> Cassette player installed in the chair's left arm and speakers hidden inside the headrest <p>-> Leg rest that vibrates on command<p>-> Option of reclining to sleeping position <p>Extras <p>-> $150 for the optional three-year warranty<p>-> About $18 a year (more or less) added to your electricity bill, assuming one hour of use per day <p>What you might buy instead<p>-> 324 rubdowns at the Great American BackRub in New York City <p>-> 98 reflexology treatments at Ten Thousand Waves in Santa Fe<p>-> 43 full-body massages at Georgette Klinger's salons nationwide <p>-> Two leather Barcalounger chairs from Bloomingdale's <p>Bottom line <p>No matter how much these things cost to make or buy, and no matter how high-tech they become, no one's going to give up their weekly Swedish body massages to own one. That's because nothing compares to the human touch. Still, giving up just a year's worth of spa treatments will pay for a Premiere II - a device that's expected to last at least ten years and ultimately is best used to fill the gaps between visits to a masseuse. The Premiere II is available only at the <a name="NASD:SHRP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14704"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sharper Image</b></a> (800-344-4444).<p>

						<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Creative caffeine alert: there's a brand-new beverage buzz. It's tea. Yes, despite its 5,000 years of age and well-known function as the nectar of English nannies, the "cup of humanity" has remade its image for the nineties. It's postmodern. "I have pipes on the ceilings and linens on the table," boasts Miriam Novalle of the sleek new T, a tea salon in the basement of the Guggenheim Museum SoHo in New York City. (She also has 650 eccentric teapots and her own fragranced black teas, from Whispering Heaven to Zen Blend and back). It's posh. "There's a new snob appeal about Darjeeling," says Jason Goodwin, author of the historical tome A Time for Tea--and no wonder; the best "single garden" varietal can go for $200 a pound. It's Parisian--or Muscovite or Delhian, as you please. Lisa's Tea Treasures, franchising nationwide as we sip, serves total teas from all of the above. It's potent. Disciples will swear on a stack of unfermented leaves that green tea fights cancer--but properly served, any tea should combat the strains of life.<p><p><p>

It's getting better and cheaper. Sorry, cable slaves.<p>By Stephan Wilkinson<p>The future, they tell us, holds 500 channels of television for every zombied man, woman, and child.<p>With a ten-foot satellite dish in my backyard, I tell them, I'm already two thirds of the way there. Each week, Satellite TVWeek, the size and thickness of Rolling Stone, clogs my mailbox, its pages plump with the offerings of some 330 channels of video. <p>Superstations. HBO. Pay-per-view movies summoned from 24,000 miles away by simply keying in a phone number. Nonstop sports, some as arcane as female bodybuilding and kick boxing. Porn channels. The Arab Network of America. An Inuit channel. Mexican vaudeville. News in Japanese. Home shopping. A whine of infomercials. And that favorite of satellite geeks everywhere, live prebroadcast feeds of network news. <p>Granted, the big black dish makes our lawn look like a NASA launch pad. But by May, you'll be able to see much of what's available to owners of gargantuan C-band dishes via a new and much more compact DBS (direct-broadcast satellite) system built and launched last December by Hughes Communications. The DBS satellites transmit on the Ku-band (pronounced "kay-you") to rooftop or even windowsill dishes only 18 inches in diameter.<p>I'm not about to trade in my big dish, but others will have reason to weigh the relative strengths of the two technologies. The little DBS dish will start at $1,000 installed, which is about a quarter of the price of the best big systems. On the other hand, monthly programming costs will run nearly twice the cost of equivalent C-band program packages. And at a time when C-band will be creeping steadily toward that couch-potato nirvana of 500 channels, DBS will be offering about 150. Finally, it's predicted that competition from DBS could cut as much as $1,000 from the price of more expensive C-band setups by year end.<p>As for transmission quality, DBS marketing has touted the "laser disc-sharp" pictures and CD sound available through that brand-new system's digital transmission technology. Big-dish C-band pictures and sound currently are conventional analog transmissions, though the C-band spectrum will be shifting increasingly to digital transmissions by the end of this year. But unless you have a studio-quality TV monitor or a rare HDTV (high-definition TV) set rather than a conventional 525-line screen, it's debatable whether you'll be able to tell the difference. "I've seen analog, digital, and laser disc pictures side-by-side on conventional screens, and they all looked pretty much the same to me," says Satellite TV Week editor James Scott. Nobody is sure yet what an actual DBS transmission will look like, for it depends in part upon how much "digital compression" the broadcasters choose to use: More compression means more channels but less sharpness. Knowledgeable industry observers predict the image will be more like good VHS videocassette displays than of true laser disc quality. <p>Some satellite-industry observers compare the coming of DBS to an earlier revolution in radio. "When FM first came out, a few manufacturers introduced FM-only sets," says Greg Gudorf, director of marketing for the leading decoder manufacturer, GI Communications. "Those quickly died out, because consumers wanted not just good music but the AM option for news, traffic, and sports. Analog C-band satellite delivery is today's AM, and the new Ku-band stuff is equivalent to FM. With digital transmission coming to C-band in late '94, I think what we have is the new guys launching the equivalent of FM only, while C-band will give you the choice of both AM and FM."<p>Your options? Frankly, the channels that will be available on DBS--about 35 cable and major networks, 50 to 60 channels of pay-per-view films, about 30 each of special interest and sports--will be varied enough to make the best of conventional cable TV seem painfully limited. And there's no denying that an 18-inch dish on the roof sure beats planting something on your lawn that looks as though it ought to be talking to a fleet of AWACS jets. <p>Still, for the first year and a half or so, RCA will be the sole source of antennas and decoders, and there is a limited choice of programming from two broadcasting packagers, DirecTv and USSB. The world of C-band, on the other hand, is wide-open and competitive: more than a dozen manufacturers of receivers, half a dozen choices of major dish builders, and more than 26 different program packagers. If you like to be in control, C-band retains a lot of appeal. <p>For the true TV maven, nothing beats a big dish. If you want everything that's broadcast, you need a cumbersome, expensive, C-band frequency dish. Depending on where you live, that means a diameter of anywhere from 5 to 12 feet; the farther you are from Kansas, the bigger the dish, since the TV satellites consider ground zero to be Middle America. Assuming you already have a television set, you'll also need to spend from $1,700 to $3,000 for a good satellite system (the antenna and associated electronics, a receiver that also decodes scrambled pay-TV signals, and installation) and up to $4,000 for a superb one. Nor does it stop there. Trust me, you'll be shopping for professional monitors, projection TVs, and five-speaker home-theater setups within hours of seeing your first satellite signal.<p>Though some channels are still unscrambled, you'll also pay monthly or annual charges just as you would for cable. But there are advantages. Those charges often are as much as 50 percent less than cable fees, and while cable subscribers get only a single HBO channel, you'll have a choice of five (plus three Cinemax and three Showtime options). Another plus is that you're free of your local cable company's quirks, outages, and monopolistic attitude.<p>The downside: It isn't cheap; zoning regulations or housing-association rules sometimes forbid big, ugly dishes; and the dish site has to have an unobstructed view of the southern sky for the antenna to "see" the satellites (even foliage will block the signals from space). <p>Nonetheless, for the complete video-equipment junkie, there's one killer reason to get a dish, whether it's a big C-band microwave funnel or a pizza-pan DBS platter: Those of us who have been fighting zoning boards and worrying about foliage will be getting HDTV years before cable TV supplies it to the rest of the country. <p><p><p>

The sounds are classical, but the marketing is MTV <p>By Dean Robinson<p>The scene in the film Philadelphia in which Denzel Washington and Tom Hanks listen to Maria Callas has struck a surprising chord with audiences. And it's sent them out to music stores to buy. To capitalize on the rush, the classical-music department of a New York City HMV record store even posted a sign above a display of Maria Callas Opera Arias CDs: "As featured in the new movie Philadelphia."<p>Record stores, like the rest of the classical-music industry, will take whatever help they can get--the age of the sound bite has been rough for highbrow music. Concertgoing has declined, magazines have folded, and over the last two decades the number of commercial radio stations playing classical has been reduced by half. It's increasingly difficult for people interested in classical music to learn about what they like--unless they hear it on TV or in the movies.<p>Record labels are also singing a new tune. "We're promoting classical music much like rock and movies--using MTV marketing," says Rob Enslin, one of the creators of a CD line called Counter Culture, which includes a Beethoven sampler titled What Does a Deaf Guy Hear? Other classical labels have been releasing CDs that repackage and rearrange the core classical repertoire in progressive ways. These range from Deutsche Grammophon's Mad About series to Angel/EMI's Heavy Classix compilations and its interactive line The Key to Classics. Most of the individual discs have the famous parts from well-known works. Mad About Tchaikovsky, for example, includes the 1812 Overture and pieces from Swan Lake and The Nutrcracker. Heavy Classix rumbles with a Sturm und Drang snippet from Wagner's The Valkyrie. Even the cover graphics on these CDs are a bold departure from the expected: Sensual Classics and Sensual Classics II resemble the jackets of steamy romance novels.<p>Stores are also catering successfully to those unfamiliar with classical music. At HMV, where the Philadelphia display was a success, there are plans to install a large movielike marquee that will tell customers how to find other classical music they hear in films. The main branch of Rose Records in Chicago has not only a film-music section but also a beginners' section, with many selections determined by the number of novice requests the staff receives.<p>Despite fears by some within the industry, customers seem to be biting. A spokesman for Deutsche Grammophon claims that the entire Mad About series has sold close to a million copies. And, according to Enslin, "Symphonies are contacting us and saying, 'Hey, can we have a Counter Culture night?'" Sandra Hyslop, editor of Symphony magazine, acknowledges the efforts orchestras are making. "It's such a period of change and exploration," she says. "There's a willingness to look at imaginative ways to get an audience to come in and listen to music." She could just as easily be talking about the entire classical-music industry. Not bad for a bunch of stodgy folks. <p><p>Sound Advice:

						<p>By Alexis Bespaloff<p>Even someone with only a casual interest in wine must occasionally deal with a wine list when entertaining friends or business associates, and the finer the restaurant, the longer the list. Here's how to make some good choices.<p>Arrive early. Try to get to the restaurant a few minutes before your guests, choose a red and white wine within your budget, and confirm with the sommelier that the wines are actually in stock. That way, you won't be poring over the list just when you should be paying attention to your dinner companions.<p>Don't overlook the bubbly. You may find a decent sparkler from California or the Loire that's actually less expensive than the best chardonnay, and nothing creates a festive mood at the start of an evening more effectively than a glass of sparkling wine.<p>Think American. Generally, the California selections on any wine list will be less expensive than those from France. Bordeaux and Burgundy may range from $35 to $60 and up, while some good California labels will be available at $25 to $35. And the California selections are more dependable because there is less vintage variation.<p>Experiment. When your guests order an assortment of dishes, sauvignon blanc, with its assertive taste, might be closer to an all-purpose white than the more popular chardonnay. (The French equivalents are Sancerre and Pouilly-Fume, from the Loire.) And young cabernet sauvignon can be quite tannic and puckerish, whereas a softer pinot noir is easier to drink.<p>Don't underpay. Muscadet, Beaujolais, Soave, and Valpolicella are likely to be the least expensive wines. Although the wholesale cost of most brands of these four popular wines is about the same--$6 or so--the price on a wine list may be as high as $20. If you pay $1 or $2 more, you're likely to get a wine whose price more accurately reflects its cost and is thus a better buy. <p>

						<p>By Glenn Helmers <p>Today, gardening enthusiasts are as prevalent as dandelions and crabgrass. Gardening is the most popular leisure activity in America, according to American Demographics, with 61 million people rooting around in the dirt for fun.<p>But fun with seedlings, pests, and other earthly delights requires more than a green thumb. A thorough manual is a must (suggested reading: The American Horticultural Society Encyclopedia of Gardening, Dorling Kindersley, $59.95), as are good tools.<p>The basic trousseau of tools--spade, fork, rake, trowel, watering can, hat, sturdy pair of gloves--has not changed much since doyennes of the field like Gertrude Jekyll worked her garden in Victorian England. But necessities for the well-heeled gardener are now practically luxury items, crafted to exacting standards and packaged with as much romance as French perfume. Take the Catamount Cart, marketed as the Rolls Royce of garden wagons, which is hand-built by a New England cabinetmaker, or Smith & Hawken's grass clippers, designed in 1730 for shearing sheep, that sing when you snip.<p>Perhaps the most alluring thing about forged-steel spades, moss-covered pots, rubber Wellies, and the like is that they make even amateurs feel--and look--like old hands to the task. A few calluses and you're all set. <p>

						By Marshall Sella<p>The global marketplace is shrinking. The odd part is that, no matter how small it gets, every corner still has its own language--a by-product of that pesky force known as human history. Before an important journey, it is sometimes wise to acquaint yourself with (or, God willing, actually learn) the language of the land. The best-known method is that of Berlitz International, which runs 350 schools around the globe. But what can you expect from one of these kwik-stop lingo shops? I decided to find out.<p>Day zero: During an initial consultation, I present my goal to a Berlitz representative: to become fluent in Russian in one week. His advice: "Re-incarnate." I opt instead to sign up for Berlitz's five-day crash course--four and a half hours per day of intensive, one-on-one training with a native Russian. Total cost: $1,380. <p>Day one: My first lesson is spent repeating questions and answers that all seem to involve notebooks and pencils. Given the alien sound of the language, I'm little more than a parrot with an American Express card. The second half starts 15 minutes late when a different teacher shambles in, irritated to learn that I don't already read Cyrillic. For the next two hours, he proceeds to scribble down words and pound them with his finger, as if the clamor will awaken the Russian poet that is doubtless hiding deep within me. It does not. At day's end, I pop by the main desk to ask that I never see this man again. The request is politely granted. <p>Progress: I've already surpassed most tourists by being able to pluck what and where out of the dim netherworld of spoken Russian. <p>Day two: Evgenije, a wry, rather Bohemian coach, replaces King Cyril; more Q&A drills. I learn much about a family called the Petrovs and stare at colorful pictures of them engaged in cheery daily activities. Accommodatingly, Evgenije spices up the conversation by endowing the family with unsavory traits. We decide, for instance, that Mr. Petrov is a philanderer, while little Tanya is unmasked (in simple Russian) as a half-wit. <p>Progress: I'm amazed at how much of Evgenije's commentary I can follow. If Muscovites confine themselves to questions such as "Is the pen red?" I shall be the most celebrated visitor to Russia since Armand Hammer.<p>Day three: Bad news. Russian verbs have different tenses. <p>Progress: I pick up a vague notion of the past and future. <p>Day four: Evgenije is fascinated by the late-night talk show wars and can steer any linguistic drill toward an analysis of David Letterman: "Please, what do you think of Letterman?" and "Is it true that Dave lives in Connecticut but works in Manhattan?" <p>Progress: By sunset I can manage a crude version of "Madam, do you want Paul Shaffer to purchase a new piano?" <p>Day five: Evgenije winds up the course with some useful travel expressions: "What does that sign mean?" "Got a smoke?" and "Fortunately, Grandmother will be asleep when the Letterman show begins." <p>Progress: I marvel that the guttural noises Evgenije is making are real sentences to me. I go home to polish my accent but fall asleep during Letterman.<p>
What you get:
--Five days (22.5 hours) of personalized coaching by Berlitz-trained native speakers<p>Extras:
--Set of 24 audiocassettes with 480-page Russian/English textbook called Ruski Jezik: $300 
--Paper cup of coffee: 25 cents<p>What you might buy instead:
--Three round-trip air tickets to Moscow
--Four weeks' intensive coaching by a non-Berlitz teacher
--Almost one Russian wolfhound
--89 bottles of Stolichnaya vodka 
--14 months' worth of the average Russian worker's wages<p>Bottom line:
Berlitz's method relies on conversation: Classes are conducted entirely in the foreign tongue. Most teachers are top-notch, and they tailor the class to your needs and abilities. You'll be astonished at how much you can absorb, especially if you do your homework. For information, call 800-257-9449.<p>

Steak houses are sizzling as Americans rediscover beef <p>By John Mariani<p>If there is any way to gauge how Americans feel about their guilty pleasures in the middle of the '90s, the proliferation of steak houses over the past three years would seem to indicate that a certain segment of society is feeling no pain. For despite health warnings about cholesterol and fat, the steady decline in overall consumption of beef--from a high of 94.5 pounds per person in 1976--has finally leveled off; Americans consumed 66.5 pounds of beef per person in both 1991 and 1992. <p>And not only have people stopped avoiding red meat, they're eating the best beef they can find. They seem willing to pay top dollar for the richest, fattest, tastiest beef available. Steak houses have been doing banner business across the country recently, with chains like Morton's of Chicago, Ruth's Chris Steak House, and Palm Restaurant pushing the number of their locations into double digits and many haute chefs getting back to basic beef. Richard Chamberlain, for example, after years of cooking up lighter fare at the Little Nell in Aspen, Colorado, recently opened up Chamberlain's Prime Chop House in Dallas.<p>True excellence is a relative thing, and beef graded prime (the highest USDA grading) can vary in quality at even the best steak houses and restaurants. While demand for prime has risen over the past decade, there is still only a finite amount of such top-grade beef available--currently about 2 percent of total beef production. "It's getting tougher all the time to find a consistently good product," says Alfred Thimm, COO for the New York-based Palm chain, which set the mold for the New York steak house genre when the first Palm opened back in 1926. And Marilyn Spiera, president of Brooklyn's Peter Luger Steak House, insists, "The beef the government now grades prime wouldn't even have made choice 35 years ago."<p>Prime beef is for the most part a genetic accident, dependent on how intramuscular fat, called marbling, is distributed throughout the best cuts of a steer carcass. There's just no way to get that rich beefy flavor from a steak if it isn't highly marbleized: The more fat throughout the beef, the more flavorful it will be, and the most marbleized of all is stamped usda prime. Ranchers can't simply overfeed a steer to produce such marbling, because it would be prohibitively expensive and might produce more external than internal fat.<p>The taste of a steak also has a good deal to do with how the beef is packed and shipped to meat markets. Prime beef comes principally from three meatpackers--IBP in Nebraska, Monfort in Colorado, and Excel in Kansas--and is shipped in airtight Cryovac bags to local markets, where it is then selected by the steak house operators. Most of the big steak houses swear that "dry aging," whereby the meat is removed from its Cryovac bag and aged for several weeks in cold, dry lockers, is better than "wet aging," in which the meat ages in the bag while sitting in its own juices.<p>It has long been true that New York gets the best prime beef, because the competition among steak houses like Palm, Gallagher's Steak House, Smith & Wollensky, and Peter Luger in that city demands extremely high quality, and operators pay top dollar for their meat. In fact, many people in other U.S. cities balk at paying upwards of $30 for a sirloin and often complain prime meat tastes too rich and beefy to their liking. Until recently, the best restaurants in this country served only top choice (the next grade down from prime) to their customers.<p>The prospects of getting a good steak, therefore, are very good at any of the national chains serving prime meat, but the odds of getting a great steak increase measurably if you eat in New York. As one operator says, "We guarantee our steaks will be the best you'll find in any city we're in. But to be perfectly honest, the ones we and our competitors serve in our New York restaurant are going to be even better."<p>Palm Restaurants runs its own purchasing company. Gallagher's (opened 1927) dry ages its meat in its own lockers for three weeks (you can see them in the window of the restaurant). Peter Luger, dating back to 1887 and best known for its porterhouse, refuses to buy any boxed or Cryovac-wrapped meat at all, and trims off half a pound of exterior fat to get half a pound of perfect beef. And at New York's Old Homestead (1868), a specialty is Japanese kobe (or wagyu) beef, which is fed on beer and grain and hand-massaged daily, resulting in an incredibly tender steak that sells for $100 a pound in the restaurant.<p>"We know it's a big challenge for us to try to crack the New York market," says Ruth Fertel, chairman of the board and founder of Ruth's Chris, "but customers who love our steaks in New Orleans or Washington or Orlando will love them just as much when they go to New York." <p><p>

A new catalog banks on a royal connection<p>By Jennifer Pierce<p>Since her engagement to prince Charles in 1981, Princess Diana has been on the cover of People magazine 56 times, more than any other celebrity--ever. There's no doubt about it: Royalty sells. This fact has not escaped the notice of a few shrewd marketers who have taken creative license using a regal-looking coat of arms to distinguish themselves among the already crowded list of more than 10,000 mail-order catalogs in existence.<p>This month, The House of Windsor Collection, the brainchild of the Eclectic American Catalogue Co., debuts with 160 specially commissioned and indubitably British products. Included among them are a $135 sterling silver Skinner & Co. key ring ("an elegant accessory for all who like to live their lives with style"), a $115 set of four lead-crystal Windsor tumblers with an etched silhouette of Windsor castle ("hold history in your hand"), and $110-a-pair Queen Victoria wineglasses (available with or without the House of Windsor Collection crest).<p>Cynics might point out that the only member of the royal family directly involved in the venture is the Queen's distant cousin Prince Michael of Kent, who is paid to sit on the Eclectic American board of directors. ("He's got to earn a living," says a Buckingham Palace spokesman.) Nonetheless, all manufacturers whose goods appear in the catalog have earned warrant status in Great Britain, a distinction bestowed exclusively by the Queen, the Queen Mother, the Duke of Edinburgh, and the Prince of Wales to honor royal patronage. The catalog's creators are counting on this royal connection to sell their private line of "quintessentially English" goods on the other side of the Atlantic. <p>The House of Windsor Collection is hoping that by selling hand-painted Weymss ceramic-cat collectibles and bottle goblets with inscriptions like "Wine gives courage and makes men apt for passion," it can cash in on the success of other companies like Laura Ashley, Victoria's Secret, and Crabtree & Evelyn that market an English lifestyle. One promising indicator: When the Queen opened Buckingham Palace last summer, in just two months visitors spent about $1.2 million in the souvenir shop. <p>

World-band radios keep media junkies connected<p>By Robert Sullivan<p>Almost invariably, when i mention to someone that I enjoy spending time with my shortwave radio, I have to talk them down from a mental picture of me in which I am wearing a headset down in a basement somewhere, surrounded by transistors, old wires, knobs, and maps--possibly coming to the aid of some Portuguese merchant-marine vessel in distress off the Maine coast. In fact, my shortwave radio is a sleek little number made by <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a>, about the size of a small hardback book; technically, it is known as the ICF-7601, and if I feel like hamming it up at all, it has a nifty little extension antenna that rolls out like a tape measure and makes the rest of the world sound that much clearer.<p>The other invariable that comes when I am spreading the word of shortwave is the recitation of my very first shortwave experience, which involved a BBC report from Wales about the closing of a mine. The person who is not meant to be a shortwave listener generally interrupts me to say that I could have had the same experience with less audio interference had I gotten a cable subscription that included CNN. But I say no. First of all, television makes the world seem smaller: No matter how many channels we will one day wind up with, all TV news will always seem to take place within the space of a land mass the size of Pennsylvania. Second, with shortwave, the static is the thing. That night, the miners just talked and talked and one wept, and in those faraway silences, in the wash of white noise out of which they told their story, I could hear all the Atlantic's waves.<p>My shortwave ended up serving me well during the Gulf War--I heard Radio Damascus, Radio Iraq International, and for a while Radio Kuwait--but the war hurt shortwave in general. Initially, it caused shortwave sales to boom by almost 80 percent overnight. But few radio-manufacturing companies were able to keep up, and the gap was filled mostly by fly-by-night operations. "The people who do Ginsu knives were doing these things," says Lawrence Magne, editor in chief of Passport to World Band Radio, a shortwave guide, "and the problem is these things just don't work. So we had a half-million people who bought these junkers and turned them on and thought, 'This is what shortwave radio is all about?' So we lost them." Sales soon flattened out, and although they are now on a more gradual rise, Magne estimates the industry lost a year's worth of growth because of the war. At the same time, shortwave's image suffered: The newspaper stories tended to pigeonhole the average shortwave listener into either the grandfatherly ham-operator category or the techno-nerd, when the actual average user, by Magne's own survey's account, has only a slight technological sophistication and is just looking for information with perspective.<p>I listen primarily to news on my shortwave. The BBC itself is worth the price of the thing; it has the best newscast in the world. Monitor Radio from Boston covers North America in particular better than the BBC, though it lacks the BBC's overall scope, and then there is Deutsche Welle's European Journal, a great news show broadcast in English from Germany. Once a week the news is even read in Latin on Radio Finland.<p>But there are all kinds of entertainment programs on shortwave, too. On Sundays on the BBC you can hear Letter From America, a short weekly report from Alistair Cooke, who was a British correspondent from the U.S. long before he stumped for Masterpiece Theater, and there are a lot of nifty quiz shows (David Letterman has said he is a BBC quiz-show fan). The selection is absolutely endless.<p>In my time, I have heard a report on National Hugging Week in Britain and lots of great jazz on Radio Havana Cuba. Once, on a Radio Nederland show called East of Edam, I heard long talks on the history of various cheeses and then the following exchange between the host and a listener on the telephone from the U.S.: "I've got a photograph of you here, Theresa," the host said. "Would you like to tell us what's different about you?" A cheery woman responded, "Well, I'm three foot five inches, and I used to have a perm. Basically, I'm just like everyone else except I'm a little shorter. And my hobby is listening to shortwave radio!" The host then hit her with a few questions about dwarf throwing and then moved on to a guy with a question for the Dutch Allergy Board, which I didn't catch. I was too busy thinking what a crazy world it is out there, and then I just kept moving along the shortwave bands. <p>
Tuning In<p>Before you even think about buying a shortwave radio, you should buy Passport to World Band Radio (International Broadcasting Services, $17.95), the best and biggest shortwave guidebook. Aside from listing all the shortwave radio shows in the world, it rates the performance of most of the different kinds of radios anyone would want to buy.<p>You will probably want to start with a radio that has a digital frequency readout, as tuning otherwise can be tedious. The Sony ICF-SW30 ($130) is a good bet, and the Realistic DX-375 ($100) is almost as good. The Grundig Yacht Boy ($249) was a favorite this year of the panelists who rate shortwaves for Passport. The radio they choose year after year is the Sony ICF-2010, a kind of classic, which, at about $430, is as good for the obsessive beginner as it is for the long-time low-rent fan waiting to move up: It has 32 preset buttons, an alarm, and a world time clock, which comes in handy if you don't naturally think in terms of the shortwave standard, Greenwich Mean Time. Whatever you buy, you'll soon find that part of the romance of shortwave is that the radio, thanks to the mercurial workings of the ionosphere, works better at night. <p><p>

						<p>By Gail Glickman Horwood<p>The organization man is a vanishing breed, and so is his briefcase. The hard slim case he once carried paperwork in has been replaced by a softer, more stylish silhouette. "It's been an evolution," says Jill Golden of Coach leather goods. "As women rose through the ranks, personal style became more of a professional issue."<p>The newest shapes play off retro looks but appeal to both men and women. Color has become more expressive: Louis Vuitton's Taiga line is available only in forest green. And browns are challenging black as the new neutral. The briefcases also offer the kind of flexibility today's executive needs. There are compartments that accommodate computers, cellular phones, and faxes, and detachable straps are a common option. Bree's sporty briefcases can even convert to a backpack. With her briefcase on her back, Organization Woman has her hands free to adapt to the evolving workplace.<p>

						<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Barbra streisand may be a person who needs people, but her 1927 Cartier clock she can apparently do without. It--along with the rest of Funny Girl's art nouveau and art deco collection--hits the block at Christie's this month. But without a basic grounding in the auction game, don't even think about picking up a bidder's paddle.<p>Take your time. Subscribe to Antiques and the Arts Weekly, the auction bible regularly devoured by those in the know. Then get your paddle wet in a low-price setting, such as a <a name="NYSE:BID"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12331"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sotheby</b></a>'s Arcade Auction, where a lot (an object or group of objects offered together) can go for less than $1000.<p>See it all. "Buy with a notebook, not your checkbook," counsels Kathleen Guzman of Christie's. Always attend the preview before an auction, and don't confuse it with a wander through the Met: You are not here to "ooh" and "aah" but to assess. If it's a painting you're thinking about buying, ask to see the back of it. If it's a bureau, open the drawers. <p>Control yourself. House appraisers publicly set estimates, low and high, between which a lot can be expected to sell--Barbra's clock, for instance, should fetch from $100,000 to $150,000. But in the frenzy of bidding, anything can happen. Set your limit and stick to it.<p>Know your values. Several factors determine the worth of an object: its rarity, condition, quality, desirability in the market of the moment. Perhaps most intriguing, though, is provenance. What will the highest bidder pay for the fact that a Tiffany lamp spent time in Streisand's sunroom? No telling--but in a society of people who read People, 'twont be peanuts.

						<p>Victoria conquered it. Kipling covered it. Richard Attenborough made it a star. India has been on our western minds for a long, long time. This spring, though, it will be in our faces. Or rather, on our movie screens, with In Custody, Merchant Ivory Productions' gripping drama about--yes--Urdu... in our bookstores, with Bombay-born Ismail Merchant's pungent cookbook, Passionate Meals: The New Indian Cuisine for Fearless Cooks and Adventurous Eaters (Hyperion, $27.50)... on our pulse points, with Casmir, the rare scent that can count mango and coconut among its top notes--and the Taj Mahal as the model for its bottle--out this month from Lancaster... and quite literally over our heads, at New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art's brand-new Irving Galleries for South and Southeast Asian Art, where, precious Buddhas and Bodhisattvas aside, the biggest eyeful may be had by looking up at the carved teakwood dome that has come all the way from 16th-century Gujarat.<p><p>

						<p>By Randall Fuller<p>How does a hotel room get to be $800 a night? To find out, we visited Twin Farms, the Vermont property that author Sinclair Lewis gave his wife as a wedding present in 1928. Back then, Lewis paid $10,000 for the 300-acre farm; today, you can have run of the entire spread for a mere $8,000--a day. Once the setting of bohemian literary parties, the upscale, rustic hotel is now more likely to have its guest book signed by Southampton, New York, socialites. And no wonder: With tax and the 15 percent service fee added, a night's stay in the least expensive room tallies up to $869.40, including meals.<p>At Twin Farms the dizzying price is reflected in the smallest details: Wedgwood bone china (in case you develop a sudden thirst for tea) and unbleached 310-count Egyptian cotton sheets in the room, Wegman photographs in the gym. We had a supper of lobster bisque, goat-cheese salad, caviar sorbet, roast quail, and tarte tartin--a menu built around a wine we had selected earlier in the day. <p>Our activities manager drew up a route for us to go mountain biking along a country road. As soon as we finished, the kitchen outfitted us with a rucksack lunch and we made the hour-long hike to Turtle Mountain, where we picnicked on smoked-salmon sandwiches and locally brewed hickory-smoked beer. When we weren't being expensively athletic, there was time to browse through Lewis first editions in the library.<p>Had the author lived to see the transformation of Twin Farms, he undoubtedly would have made the same discovery we did: The farm is simply too expensive to stay for as long as you'd like. After all, until the success of Main Street, Lewis's advances were only $2,000--barely enough to cover a weekend at the hotel.   <p><p>

						<p>By Tish Durkin<p>Gertrude stein isn't alone in thinking a "rose is a rose is a rose," but the best cupids know better. Here's how to make a lasting impression.<p>Surrender the red. Long-stemmed reds don't exactly scream originality. At least contemplate the growing bounty of colors and names at your disposal: the tall, creamy, slow-opening oceana, a fabulously fragrant orange morella, the feisty South American lambada. <p>Handle with care. "If the head of the rose is firm, then it's a sign that the rose is fresh," says Gary Buckwald of Surroundings in Manhattan. Good roses should last five days. <p>Send a setting. Unless your beloved is a closet florist or a ballerina taking a bow, forgo the long-stemmed bouquet for a vase-and-all arrangement ready to be plunked down.<p>Surprise your valentine, not your florist. The cost of roses routinely rises by at least 25 percent around Valentine's Day (from the usual $75 for a dozen high-quality blooms). Order at least a week in advance.<p>Invest in the best. The Rolls of roses is the pale apricot, long-stemmed, long-blooming Beaute. It'll cost you the moon, but that's a pittance to pay for love.      <p>

						<p>By Bill Marsano<p>What a blessing obsolescence can be. The Newton is an executive tool, but a pen is executive jewelry, a personal scepter: symbol of power. But not just any pen. Stock clerks use felt tips and messengers use ball points, so whether you're making a deal or making history, use a fountain pen.<p>You say it's totally impractical? Exactly. With their handmade gold nibs and bellies full of liquid ink, fountain pens have gone from utility (machine made by the millions, sold for pocket change) to indulgence (made by hand, priced like fine wines).<p>The symbolism is power and image. "Success used to be measured by the secretary-typed letter," says Wayne Kingsland of the pen maker Montblanc. "Today, it's receiving a letter that has been handwritten." Executives use fountain pens because they control their own time and because they don't sign million-dollar contracts with 50-cent ballpoints.<p>A fountain pen turns signing into ceremony: Slide the pen from your pocket, admire it, slowly unscrew the top. Scan the document a final time and adjust the pen in your hand. Then, you sign.<p>These days, men don't have much jewelry left except fountain pens and watches. Executive women are using fountain pens more, too. They treat them like another accessory. Men aren't as good at accessorizing with pens, "but some men become fascinated," says Steven Wiederlight, whose Fountain Pen Hospital in New York City has "some men collecting vintage pens, and others ordering every new model shipped sight unseen."<p>Fountain pens may draw the line between class and clunk, but not much else. Still, for what it's worth, consider this: Ollie North and Princess Diana own Sheaffers; Prince Charles and Colin Powell wield Parkers.   -<p><p>

						 <p>Here's how to prepare for a summer full of international soccer. That's right, soccer.<p>By Jim Harmon<p>How did a country of such renowned indifference to international soccer end up as host of the 15th World Cup? Simple: We asked for it. Back in 1987, the only other serious contender for the 1994 tournament was Morocco. So the Federation Internationale de Football Association (FIFA) swallowed hard and chose the United States.<p>Immediately there were howls in the European and South American press. The game is neither understood nor appreciated in America, they said. The cup will be bastardized and commercialized into something unrecognizable, they fretted.<p>Commercial it may be, but this World Cup won't be ignored. The first-round games in several of the nine host cities sold out within hours last spring, and World Cup USA94, the organizing body, now hopes that this will be the first Mondial ever to sell out all 52 tournament games. Take that, Eurosnobs. So what if we have a trademarked cartoon canine mascot named Striker?<p>The tournament starts on June 17, with defending champion Germany playing Bolivia in Chicago, and concludes with the final on July 17 in Los Angeles. Americans had what they thought was their last shot at seats by way of lotteries last fall, but there are still ways to find seats. Sponsors will be returning tickets; they'll be resold through TicketMaster. Or consider the numerous multigame ticket packages, which range in price from $425 (one seat for every game in Detroit) to $10,000 (one seat and VIP perks for any ten games, including the opener, one semifinal, and the final). Call 800-793-1994 for information.   <p> <p><p>

						 <p>Sometimes it pays to keep antiques in the family <p>By Carla Koehl<p>Things lead lives like people do," writes Thatcher Freund in Objects of Desire (Pantheon, $24), a biography of three pieces of fine antique American furniture. "And they prosper, like some people, on the strength of their character."<p>Whether they also prosper as investments depends on how long one can afford to hang on to them (see above). "People are not buying a liquid investment when they buy antiques," says preeminent American antiques dealer Harold Sack, who figures prominently in Freund's book. "It's like good real estate; it takes time to liquidate. You're not going to call a broker tomorrow and sell the highboy to put a kid through college." <p>So, if antiques are the ultimate long-term investment, could antique funds be the ultimate long-term portfolio-diversity move? Fred Giampietro, one of the dealers featured in Objects, thinks so. His $2 million private limited partnership, Artvest LT I, has owned 250 American antiques for four years and has just begun to liquidate--so far, at a profit. <p>Most of the fund's 35 investors, who paid $50,000 a unit to be part of Artvest, are friends and associates of Giampietro and his partner, Allan Katz, and based their investment on the two partners' successes, rather than on their own often-limited knowledge of or interest in antiques. It's a good thing, too, since most of Artvest's 18th- and 19th-century Americana is sitting in a bank vault in Hartford. <p>Shareholders, therefore, aren't in it for artistic fulfillment, and they won't start to see any cash until later this year. But the upside, says Giampietro, is considerable: He and Katz paid dealer prices to increase profit potential, and they're not accepting management fees, only commissions.<p>Freund, however, reminds his readers of the risks inherent in seeing antiques only as things that might become worth more money to someone else. As he writes about the 1759 Willing Chippendale card table: "It was valuable because someplace a market existed for it and because out in the world of American furniture--where dealers fought and lied and stole things from their friends--some people could tell a great card table from a good one."   <p> <p><p>

Museum stores are drawing crowds these days with some of the season's best gift ideas<p>By Glenn Helmers<p>With museums long known as scholarly arbiters of taste and enduring style, perhaps it was only a matter of time before their shops would be turned into full-blown specialty boutiques--filled with objects as tempting as the exhibitions that spawned them. Museums have been forced to cash in on this cultural cachet, "marketing the word museum and everything it stands for," as Beverly J. Barsook, executive director of the Museum Store Association, puts it. Government funding and support from the private sector have waned in the last 15 years, and income from endowments has dropped because of lower interest rates. "The dollars are simply drying up," says Susan R. Laudeman, shop manager for the Historic New Orleans Collection, a museum and research center dedicated to preserving the history and culture of Louisiana and the Gulf South. "The only tax-free income museums are able to generate is through related business activity, which is why museum shops have exploded."<p>The criteria for choosing merchandise vary from shop to shop, depending upon the museum's mission, but the driving force behind the offerings is to educate. As Robin Cramer, museum-shop director for the Jewish Museum in New York City, explains: "We try to reinforce the permanent collection and the special exhibits in our product line." At the Renwick Gallery in Washington, D.C., that means anything handcrafted in America. At the Museum of Modern Art Design Store in New York City, the relationship between the items for sale and the museum's vaunted design collection is more direct: All the furniture is reviewed by curators, objects of consumer interest in the collection that are currently in production are stocked, and there are reproductions of selected pieces from the collection.<p>Boosting the educational nature of museum-shop merchandise are information or provenance cards that accompany most items. These tell about the history and significance of the product, whether it's a miniature Model T from the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, Michigan, a rubber dinosaur from the Peabody Museum of Natural History's Dinostore for kids in New Haven, Connecticut, or sterling silver Jesuit sugar tongs from the Historic New Orleans Collection.<p>Some shops are doing more than selling museum reproductions and adaptations and the usual fare of related books, videos, and stationery. Like galleries, these innovative shops seek to foster relationships between contemporary artists and the community or consumer. In Los Angeles, the Museum of Contemporary Art asked sculptor Robert Graham to produce a limited-production bronze torso for sale in the gift shop. Some of his seven apprentices are former gang members, and the proceeds go to benefit the museum's community-outreach program. The Jewish Museum's store, which features one-of-a-kind and limited-edition pieces of contemporary Judaica, recently launched a monthly program that showcases the work of an artist or craftsperson. Shoppers have the opportunity to meet the artist on a particular day and to learn more about his or her work.<p>If the idea of supporting a cultural institution while taking care of your holiday shopping fills you with cheer, remember that almost all larger museums, including the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Delaware's Winterthur Museum, Gardens, and Library, have catalogs that let your fingers do the walking. Museum members generally get a 10 percent discount on all purchases, whether ordering by phone or in person, so joining may be worth the cost, even if you live far away.<p>Shoppers who aren't avid culture buffs may also rejoice that some museums, like the Art Institute of Chicago, New York's Museum of American Folk Art, and the Toledo Museum of Art, have off-site stores located in other parts of their cities. New York City's Metropolitan Museum of Art has the most far-reaching store network of any museum: 11 to date, including two on the West Coast for the bicoastal crowd, with plans on the drawing board for venues outside the United States. But don't confuse these satellite shops with commercial ventures like the Museum Company, which buys much of its merchandise wholesale from museums. The difference, of course, is that the store, not the museum, pockets the profits.<p>

Reaching for nirvana, CD-ROM software has a long way to go<p>By Will Dana<p>Pardon me if i'm hopelessly stuck in the 20th century, but I've spent the last few weeks taking the future for a spin, and I just don't have time for it.<p>This particular future, interactive multimedia CD-ROM, is the computer industry's latest attempt to convince consumers that they absolutely need a personal computer at home. It's long been axiomatic that just the right combination of hardware, software, and marketing will release America's inner nerd, making the home computer as essential to our daily lives as sliced bread. But Silicon Valley is more out of touch with mainstream American tastes than even the so-called cultural elite.<p>CD-ROM stands for compact disc-read only memory. A CD-ROM looks just like a music CD. But in addition to mere music it can hold text and "real time" video. The idea, essentially, is that hooking up a specialized CD player to a computer will turn that computer into everything that your television is not; that is, it will make it interactive. While the big companies like IBM, Apple, and Microsoft--as well as scores of smaller developers--labor to figure out exactly what they mean by "information superhighways" and "500-channel digital interactive cable systems," they are pushing CD-ROM as if their lives depended on it. With some 7 million CD-ROM drives sitting on America's desktops and 15 million expected by 1994, "CD-ROM is the next evolutionary step in computing," says Tim Boyle of the San Francisco Multimedia Development Group. <p>The great advantage of CD-ROM is that the discs are cheap and offer a quantum improvement in storage space over floppy discs. Manufacturers salivate over the fact that for about one dollar per unit, a CD has a 600-megabyte capacity; that's nearly ten times more than the average hard drive. But the disc is only a storage medium. Most personal computers don't have the speed and power to efficiently deliver sound, video, and text all at once. There is simply too much information. It's like trying to manage a ten-story warehouse with just one forklift. "It's a compromised form," says Homer Flynn, one of the owners of the Cryptic Corp., which represents the Residents, a San Francisco-based group of multimedia artists who are working on a new interactive disc. "The information flow is so slow that you can only get a small window on-screen with full motion."<p>That's not to say CD-ROMs are useless. CDs are great for storing data--government records, back issues of newspapers, stock information, and dictionaries, for instance, exactly the type of data you want to get away from when you're trying to get excited about the future. The discs I sampled, sci-fi games such as Iron Helix and a travel book, From Alice to Ocean, adapted to multimedia, were stunning in their graphics and easy to use but slow. So slow in fact that I interacted with them by turning off my computer. I had high hopes for ICOM Simulations' Sherlock Holmes, Consulting Detective game, but when I booted it up, I discovered it wasn't much more than a cross between the game of Clue and a cheesy period movie, complete with bad accents. And these are the cutting-edge products. There are hundreds of other discs derisively known as shovelware.<p>The promoters of the new technology, while not quite ready to admit that it's not all its cracked up to be, seem to be under no illusions that they have to do better. They don't tell you to stay away from CD-ROM; they just talk about the future, hoping, in effect, that someone else figures out how to get the home-computer consumer excited. "My imagination is too linear to be aware of what the breakthrough product might be," says Tim Boyle. Victor Harwood of American Expositions, a company that runs computer expos, is no less sure where the industry is going: "We are just entering the period where creators are figuring things out," he says. <p>Whether or not interactive CD-ROM finally becomes the system that puts computers in every home will probably stand or fall on whether the music industry can figure out a way to excite consumers with it. Young consumers who are hooked on MTV, that is. Ty Roberts, who runs Ion, a multimedia production company in San Francisco, has positioned himself to become something like the Phil Spector of interactive music-video discs. He has one disc under his belt--an interactive version of David Bowie's latest video--has signed a $5 million deal with Bertelsmann, the West German media conglomerate, and is looking for the band with which he can make an "interactive Sgt. Pepper." All he has to do is find the right band, a band big enough to send 18-to-25-year-olds out to spend as much as $1,500 on a multimedia system. But that's in the future, a future the computer industry is more comfortable talking about than actually delivering on. For now, my inner nerd will slumber on.<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By Tish Durkin<p>God may be in the details, but for photographer Macduff Everton, who was shooting the ruins of ancient Uxmal, the picture wasn't. "I could get wonderful detail shots with my regular 35 mm," he says, "but no sense of the overall site, of what it was like to be there." He's been carrying a panoramic camera ever since.<p>Panoramic cameras aren't new, and their appeal is not hard to grasp: They stand out because they are more than twice as wide as they are high. But panoramics have never been more popular--or profuse--than they are right now. <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kodak</b></a>, Fuji, Nikon, Pentax, Olympus, and Minolta have all weighed in with wide-eyed models; price tags range from $13 for a cute disposable to $15,000-plus for a tripod technofeat. The overview, so to speak, is dizzying. Several different features can achieve panoramic photos--a fixed wide-angle lens, a lens that rotates, or a camera that itself rotates. Everton's own first panoramic was a Widelux ($1,200). "It looks like a crummy old camera," he recalls fondly, still faintly amazed that he could hang the Widelux around his neck and, almost never putting eye to viewfinder, just hold the lens parallel to the horizon and shoot. But the Widelux was "temperamental," erratic in the quality of image it produced and requiring constant servicing. Everton is now happily married to a sharp and stable Noblex ($2,250). For those who snap pictures on the side, though, a few thousand dollars, no matter how well spent, is too much. <p>As the wide-photo craze kicks in, beware of models that sound more panoramic than they shoot. The Nikon 600 ($300) has a lens that switches obligingly between panoramic and regular formats--which has zero effect on the picture you take. "It just crops the top and bottom," says Everton. "You are not getting a wider angle of view." The same goes for Pentax, Olympus, and Minolta. His sole "Eureka!": The dirt-cheap disposable. Kodak and Fuji panoramics cover an area of 100 degrees, doubling the vision of a normal 50-mm lens and yielding 3.5-by-10-inch prints instead of the standard 3.5-by-5-inch. (Agfa's disposable, with a 17-mm lens that will provide an extremely wide shot, should be available next year). Though hardly in the Noblex league, "the optics are surprisingly good," Everton says. "For what you pay, they're great."<p>The final image, of course, comes not from the camera but from the person using it. "You must rethink how you normally shoot," says Everton. Unlike the family snapshot, a pleasing panorama requires more than keeping the dog or the happy couple centered in the viewfinder. Edges matter. "It is like life, where we often get caught up in the details and don't notice the overall patterns," says the lensman. "In order to convey the big picture, you need to see the big picture."<p> <p><p>

Surveying the world with a wide-angle view, photographers revive the panoramic format <p>By Vicki Goldberg<p>In 1845, just six years after the invention of photography, the first panoramic camera was devised; its field of vision was 150 degrees. Staring straight ahead, our eyes can do better than that--almost 180 degrees--but nothing is very sharp at the sides. Panoramic photographs always come up with more than mere human vision can imagine; every inch is miraculously detailed. The cameras have no peripheral vision: Everything they see is dead ahead.<p>Nineteenth-century panoramic cameras were hopelessly expensive and cumbersome. In 1890, an Englishman reported that a panoramic camera he had first seen in 1861 was still in perfect condition 28 years later, probably because it had only been used once. Its plates, cleaning board, dark slide, and printing frame were all curved. "Fancy the expense and trouble attending to this apparatus," he said. Nonetheless, photographers, enchanted by the ultrawide view, took some awesome pictures. The Bisson brothers in France surveyed the Alps, the English photographer Samuel Bourne looked over the sprawl of Calcutta, and George N. Barnard registered the terrain that General Sherman marched through in the South.<p>Landscape and cityscape were the subjects of choice, for the cameras could not record moving figures. There was a breadth of ambition as well as of proportion in these photographs--they meant to encompass in a single frame the expansive grandeur of nature and human accomplishment. To some extent this could be accomplished with a wide-angle lens or even with a standard camera that was rotated after each shot and the pictures then carefully aligned and pasted together. In 1878, Eadweard Muybridge depicted San Francisco in this fashion in a series of 13 plates.<p>Then, in 1900, <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kodak</b></a> marketed a handheld camera that used roll film, and amateurs got into the game. In some panoramic cameras the film sits still on a curved plane while the lens and a narrow-slit shutter sweep past it; the camera only focuses on one small area at a time. In others, like the well-known Cirkut camera, the lens stands still but the camera body rotates mechanically and the film goes with it, again making exposures successively through a narrow slit. When the rotation is a full 360 degrees, we have the science-fiction like ability to see, without moving, what we never could have seen without turning around.<p>The lasting popularity of panoramic photographs in America depended for a long time on commercial photographers who took pictures of the members of the Elks Club, factory workers, or entire graduating classes. A few art photographers kept up the extended photograph throughout the century. Josef Sudek, a Czech who could find poetry in simple circumstances, rehabilitated an old panoramic camera after World War II and took pictures of streets and garden walks that seemed to curve or even bulge out toward us in ways no self-respecting rules of perspective would permit.<p>This is one of the seductions of panorama, that it can subvert the eye's experience, presenting an unfamiliar world in brilliant detail. In the last two or three decades, more and more photographers have tried this. Kenneth Snelson's color photographs seem to propose a physics of curved space. The streets of Paris and Venice go off at unlikely angles, single buildings may repeat themselves at the edges of the frame, urban geometry runs a fever and goes slightly loopy.<p>Other recent work depends more on the lure of views that take time to traverse. Art Sinsabaugh's pictures suggest the infinite reach of the Midwestern farmlands by cutting a narrow slice through the landscape; Stuart D. Klipper records the harsh, bold emptiness of Antarctica. In Lois Conner's eloquent platinum prints of China and Turkey, the landscape calmly unfurls like a scroll opened out for viewing. Mark Klett has rephotographed San Francisco in 13 images as Muybridge once did; when the two sets of images are shown together, they deliver an instant lesson in American history. <p>The recent revival of panoramic pictures was sparked by cameras produced by Russian and Japanese manufacturers around 1959, as well as by such easy-to-operate versions as the Widelux 150, introduced in 1973. The '60s and '70s were a time of renewed interest in landscape photography and rampant experimentation in photography in general; the odd, elongated format posed a challenge photographers took on eagerly. Now the panorama has really arrived: In 1984, the International Association of Panoramic Photographers was founded in Hampton, Virginia, and is now based in Orlando, Florida. Most of its members come from the United States but some from as far as Bangladesh, Finland, and Australia--a veritable panorama of the world.<p> <p><p>

We go in search of the indestructible button <p>By Carla Koehl<p>Faster than you can say "cheap offshore labor," the buttons on most new men's dress shirts will have already started chipping, cracking, breaking, dangling, falling off--and generally rendering millions of otherwise resourceful men utterly helpless. So it should come as a relief to learn that Coors Ceramicon Designs, a division of Adolph Coors, has recently developed new, Chinese-laundry-resistant buttons: Diamond Zs, which, according to Coors Ceramicon, can withstand just about any daily abuse short of being left in the path of a falling anvil.<p>Wondering how they'd hold up to everyday use, we decided to test these newfangled fasteners--and the shirts to which they're sewn--to see just how strong both shirt and button really were. Four all-cotton broadcloths were sent to the laundry, including a Perry Ellis Portfolio with ordinary plastic buttons ($42.50), a Sulka with high-end mother-of-pearl buttons ($115), and two shirts--an Ike Behar ($72.50) and a Nordstrom's private label ($52.50)--that have exclusive rights to Diamond Zs through the end of this month. <p>The results: After 25 times through the wash, nine times in a machine presser, and 16 rounds of hand ironing at a rather hostile neighborhood laundry, the pricier new Diamond Zs (eight to ten cents each for a shirtmaker to buy) had darkened at the edges, looking a little tired next to their cheap plastic rivals (less than a penny each).<p>Though the strength of the ubiquitous plastic button wasn't news to anyone at the Chinese laundry, it was news to us. That's because Coors Ceramicon--which makes such life-saving impermeables as bullet-proof vests--has made a fairly big deal of the fact that its Diamond Z buttons are even stronger than plastic, being made, as they are, out of sand that has been transformed into zirconia (yes, as in simulated diamonds), then fired at 3,200 degrees.<p>Unfortunately, buttons this strong are of little use when they come out of the wash considerably darker than the white shirts to which they're attached. After the first nine washings and machine pressings, the Diamond Zs were still in one piece, but surprisingly, they'd turned charcoal colored around the white-coated edges. After another 16 washings and, this time, hand ironings, they looked even worse. Coors Ceramicon brand manager Kristin Michas says the Diamond Zs can discolor if they meet with an old washing machine or iron. Since the rock-hard zirconia won't give way to pressure the way plastic does, she says, the resulting friction can cause rust or dirt to rub off onto them.<p>Despite the darkening, the Diamond Zs came out in much better shape than Sulka's mother-of-pearl buttons, which were chipped, scratched, and discolored. The plastic buttons on the Perry Ellis shirt came out with hardly a scratch. <p>The unfortunate part about our findings is that the strongest buttons are available on the cheapest, weakest shirtings, and the weakest buttons are available on the most expensive shirts. Both the Perry Ellis and Nordstrom's shirts, for example, went yellow at the collar and cuffs after being washed and ironed 25 times. Ike Behar's stitching ceded a button and odd threads after just 11 washings. Sulka's shirt stayed perfectly intact. <p>Our recommendation? Buy plastic buttons on the finest shirts available within your budget. Or buy one of the shirts now made with Diamond Zs and be sure that whoever launders them has brand-new equipment.<p>And don't bother bribing Sulka to put plastic buttons on a $115 shirt. We've already tried.<p><p>

Platinum designs are popular again<p>By Lauren Goldstein<p>Platinum traders were bartering on the floor of the New York Mercantile Exchange, but they weren't establishing the cost of a troy ounce of metal. Instead, the mock trading session was held to fix the price of the newest collectible Swatch, the platinum Tresor Magique. The limited-edition piece sold for about $1,500.<p>Swatch is helping to usher in a platinum-watch renaissance. The metal was most popular in the late '40s, when use surged after a wartime ban. During World War II the government stockpiled platinum for military use, including the manufacture of explosives. The jewelry industry developed white gold as a replacement, and platinum subsequently fell out of favor. Until now.<p>Seven years ago only 1,000 platinum watches were produced worldwide. Last year about 11,000 were. Platinum's growing popularity seems to be a reaction against the gaudy, gold-swathed, Trumpesque 1980s, says Laurie Hudson, president of the Platinum Guild International U.S.A.: "People are tired of ostentation and want a metal with a more refined character." <p>Ebel began offering Americans platinum options in the early 1990s but keeps fewer than 50 on hand in its New York store at any given time. Gucci introduced its first-ever platinum watch, a version of the 700M Skel ($4,000), a few months ago. Most of the 50 made available were headed for Japan, which consumes 90 percent of all the platinum jewelry produced in the world.<p>Although the popularity of platinum has not yet reached postwar-era levels, manufacturers hoping to capitalize on the metal's return to vogue have looked to the past for inspiration. Cartier has introduced the Platinum Tonneau ($10,600), inspired by a model created in 1906. The best-selling Chanel platinum watch, the Mademoiselle ($5,300), pays homage to Coco Chanel and the style of the 1930s she helped define.

A new book series shows you how to streamline with style<p>By Sarah Schoen<p>The '80s were the decade of (among other things) style as concept. We bought our looks lock, stock, and barrel, dressing our homes in Santa Fe, Swedish, or French Country and ourselves head to toe in Armani or Ralph Lauren. Wardrobes were easily retooled when fashion moved on, but when in the blink of an eye Spanish tiles went out and Italian marble came in, the only choice was to redecorate. <p>Times have changed, and so has our sense of style. The Chic Simple series--published by Knopf and described by the publisher as "practical primers for living stylishly with less"--addresses style in the '90s. The books are part catalog, part manual, and part mantra. Their mission is to streamline style and deconstruct design.<p>The series launched last May with Clothes and Home. The newest titles are Scents, Scarves, Bath, and Shirt and Tie. These four-by-five mini manuals sell for $12.50 and are truer to the concept than the first two larger and more expensive books. While Clothes covers everything from creating five different outfits with one navy suitto recycling classics like your old motorcycle jacket, the new books concentrate on the essentials. In Shirt and Tie it's fabric, fit, and feel (Gatsby's shirts made Daisy cry). Bath devotes a chapter to each of the four basic elements of cleansing: water, soap, scrub, and towel.<p>There may still be some '80s types around who would take issue with the Chic Simple premise, but what the '90s are about style-wise can be summed up by the aboriginal saying that begins each book: "The more you know, the less you need."<p><p>

400 percent markups are out as restaurant wine prices become easier to swallow<p>By John Mariani<p>"Wine," wrote Ernest Hemingway, "is one of the most civilized things in the world." And the best thing about it is that it's getting more affordable all the time. Like everything else, wine must obey the laws of supply and demand, and everyone involved in selling the stuff--from French vignerons to restaurant sommeliers--is trying to make it easier to enjoy a good bottle with a meal, mostly by dropping prices to levels Americans haven't seen in years. The greedy upward spiral of prices for top Bordeaux in the 1980s has flattened out, the $50 cabernets out of California's Napa Valley have become anachronisms, and wine futures are no longer the sure-shot investments they once seemed. "For a while there, wines like Chassagne-Montrachet from the '85 and '88 vintages were up to $35 to $40 a bottle," says Jim Gordon, managing editor of the Wine Spectator, a magazine taken as gospel by many oenophiles. "But today you see the same wines from the '90 and '91 vintage going for $25 to $30." Even wine from the preeminent Burgundy estate of them all, Romanee-Conti, was found recently on the gray market at lower prices than the estate's contracted distributors were charging.<p>Restaurateurs who once routinely marked wines up 400 percent above retail are now sitting on large stocks of aging and unsold grand cru. These days wine stewards are becoming more user-friendly, and the intimidation factor once used by sommeliers who blatantly coerced a host to pop for a $200 bottle of Opus One has been replaced by a caring rapport that offers exciting wines at easy-to-swallow prices. Indeed, the last vestige of 1980s gourmandism is the conceit that a cheap wine must be a bad wine. Sirio Maccioni, owner of the haute deluxe Manhattan restaurant Le Cirque, whose international clientele would seem to be able to afford any wine it wants from the restaurant's 50,000-bottle cellar, says, "I have scores of wines on my list for under $30. If I didn't want my customers to order these wines, I wouldn't have bought them in the first place. I tell my staff to promote them because I want young people to come to Le Cirque and not be put off by the feeling they have to spend a lot of money to dine here. That's why Ihave a $29 lunch and offer wine specials each week at reasonable prices." Le Cirque also charges only $5.50 for a glass of excellent house wine--far less than many low-rent bistros charge for plonk.<p>"People drink more wine if the prices are low," says Jean-Georges Vongerichten of Vong, one of the toughest reservations to get in Manhattan right now. "A table for four is more likely to order two bottles instead of one. But you'd still be surprised at how many people avoid a wine under $15, because they can't believe it's any good. Sometimes we've raised the price on a wine that's not moving at all, then, bang! It begins to sell like crazy."<p>"You've got to take the customer by the hand--gently--and tell them, 'Listen, this is a great wine at a great price,'" says Jimmy Brennan, an owner of Brennan's in New Orleans, which offers, in addition to many inexpensive wines on a massive list, some extraordinary buys on great rarities like Lafite-Rothschild '61 at $415, Cheval Blanc '53 at $360, and Romanee-Conti '47 at $500--prices you could never get at a wine store.<p>Gone are the days when a naive or ignorant chef-owner simply bought whatever popular wines the local distributor told him to buy. Now more knowledgeable restaurateurs hold tastings, travel extensively, and seek out wines from many distributors and regions as disparate as Apulia in Italy, the Willamette Valley in Oregon, the Maipo Valley in Chile, and the PenedEs in Spain. Also, people are realizing that many of the lighter, inexpensive regional wines go well with modern cuisine. And they allow the host to flex his connoisseurship by saying things like "This wine is from the best producer in the Barossa Valley, where you don't usually get the best out of the Shiraz grape."<p>With the savory bistro foods at Atlanta's Resto des Amis, chef-co-owner Guenther Seeger looks for sturdy wines from the RhOne valley and southwest France for under $25. Instead of listing inappropriate massive, tannic Bordeaux and burgundies, Vongerichten features unusual regional wines between $20 and $30 to go with his spicy Thai-French cuisine at Vong. If you can snag a table at the hot new NOLA in New Orleans's French Quarter, you'll find a wide range of wines set in price categories, the highest being $42. When Glen and Michael Cordua debuted Americas in Houston as a restaurant featuring cuisines of North, South, and Central America, they decided to rotate their wine list every six weeks in order to find the best bargains in the market and to feature well-priced Spanish and South American wines that go well with their food. In addition, you can order every wine on the list by the glass. In San Francisco, the namesake chef-owner Alain Rondelli offers every wine on his list by the bottle, glass, and even half glass so that you can taste a wine to see if you like it.<p>Markups, which once might have been 200 percent, 300 percent, or more above retail, have dropped to saner levels (see "Best Cellars"). At the Century Cafe in New York City, the formula is wholesale plus one dollar on a choice of over 60 wines ordered after 8:00 p.m. And the wine list at Richmond, Virginia's best new restaurant, the Frog and the Redneck, offers 75 out of 100 wines for under $35. In New York one of the Broadway hits of the season has been a theater-district trattoria named Becco, whose lusty, low-priced Italian food is accompanied by wonderful wines, every one going for $15 a bottle--most from excellent small vineyards like Batasiolo and Rocco delle Macie, whose Dolcetto d'Alba and Chianti Classico, respectively, are much better, more distinctive wines than the same varieties made by better-known, high-volume producers.<p>Restaurateurs have initiated all sorts of convivial lures to attract customers. At Zoe in New York's Soho, the wine list reprints remarks and numerical ratings under individual bottlings from the Wine Spectator. Some worry, however, that a restaurant that gives only the numbers rating will tend to make people order only the highest-rated bottlings on the list and ignore some perfectly good, interesting, lesser-rated wines.<p>Wine dinners, at which diners pay a special price for a multicourse meal built around a particular producer's wines, have become extremely popular at places like New York's "21" Club, Charlie Trotter's in Chicago, the Highlands Inn in Carmel, California, and Fournou's Ovens in San Francisco. At such dinners one can dine splendiferously with wines at every course--many of them special bottlings never released to the general public and otherwise unaffordable. So drink up. Like interest rates and inflation, you may never see wine prices this low again or fine restaurateurs so willing to part with the treasures in their cellars. <p><p>

The Conran Shop is the Paris attraction drawing crowds<p>By Charla Carter<p>Banish any preconceptions you may have about the name. British design guru Sir Terence Conran is the same guy who was once behind the eponymous home-furnishings store chain that blankets America, but that's a thing of the past--Conran's is now owned by former Bloomingdale's executive Marvin Traub. Ever since 1987, when Conran inaugurated his design emporium, the Conran Shop in the grand Michelin Building on London's Fulham Road, Conran has been synonymous with upscale chic.<p>And now there's a Conran Shop in Paris (117 rue de Bac; 33-1-42-84-10-01). Sprawled over 16,000 square feet of an erstwhile entrepot (whose 19th-century iron structure is signed by Gustave Eiffel), the Conran Shop has become to connoisseurs of style what the Louvre is to art lovers. Here, Eames chaise longues, Noguchi tables, and Alessi kitchenware mingle with Cutler and Gross sunglasses and vials of Neal's Yard foaming bath. Whimsical wrought-iron birdcages from India jostle baskets of wood-handled gardening tools; children's toys both beautiful and educational share shelf space with packets of fresh-ground Faguais coffee and bottles of pungent Maussane olive oil. Sixty-one-year-old Conran likes to think of the store as an attraction, a place where "clients can wander around like tourists," he says.<p>Paris's Conran Shop not only showcases classics of contemporary design (including a few Terence Conran-signed pieces) and irresistibly British and French items like shortbread biscuits and woven baguette baskets, but also kilim rugs from Turkey and Morocco, jewel-toned glassware from Iran, carved wooden doors from Rajastahn, and Indonesian straw mats.<p>The Conran Shop's sources may be third world, but it remains unabashedly elitist. "It's out of the question to situate the Conran Shop on the mass market," Conran commented on his Paris shop's opening. "We will remain on the top of the pyramid, targeting a clientele who may have shopped at Habitat [the mass-market store chain also owned by Conran] before but whose tastes have evolved towards more striking design." The merchandise is so unusual, in fact, that when designer Peter Marino, known for his interiors for Giorgio Armani, Christopher Whittle, and Calvin Klein, decided on the furnishings for New York City's lavish new Barney's flagship store, the only stock piece he used was a wicker-and-chrome bistro chair from Conran's Paris store. <p>Conran's style doesn't come cheap. Though the Conran Shop likes to boast that its prices start at about $2.50 for a glass-and-chrome salt shaker, a circular oak-and-wrought-iron shelf unit designed by Conran himself carries a $1,650 price tag, and a streamlined canvas-covered couch weighs in at a hefty $5,700. So even if you leave your credit card at the hotel (sound advice for budget travelers), Paris's Conran Shop merits a visit if only for the pure visual gratification. It is rapidly becoming what Conran predicted: a cultural attraction.<p>

Whether you slalom or shred, there's a slope for you<p>By Lauren Goldstein<p>Like it or not, snowboarding is the downhill winter sport of the future. Boarders bought 16 percent more lift tickets last season than the season before, and 9.4 percent of all lift tickets sold. A whole generation is growing up boarding instead of skiing: 77 percent of all boarders are under the age of 25. And it doesn't stop there: "We're seeing a lot of dads willing to take up the sport to keep up with their sons," says Lee Rogers, snowboard director of Snow Summit resort in Big Bear Lake, California. Ski legend Jean-Claude Killy, whose son is an avid boarder, is among them; the 1968 Olympic triple gold medalist is now actively campaigning to make snowboarding an Olympic event.<p>The spirit of boarding owes more to surfing and skateboarding culture than to skiing, so it's not unusual for boarders to ride over trees, picnic tables, and other obstacles on the mountain to catch air. Skiing purists who find them an annoyance are having trouble escaping them, since nearly 90 percent of American ski areas allow boarding. Snowboard-only parks have begun to spring up and are expected to multiply. Try these areas for an isolationist's experience.<p>

In the minor leagues, you don't have to be a millionaire to afford a diamond<p>By Emanuel Howard<p>As minor-league baseball heads to the showers for 1993, club owners are suiting up for a different kind of action: October is prime time for selling a minor-league franchise.<p>Unlike big-league ball, this isn't a moguls-only game. In fact, franchise buyers often are regular folks who convince their friends and family to form an investor group.<p>A triple-A club costs at least $5 million; double-A clubs go for $3 million and up. But buying a minority stake takes little more than a love of baseball--and about $100,000 to invest not so wisely.<p>In return, well-heeled fans can live out fantasies that will never be fulfilled by a mutual fund.<p>"We can't promise you double-digit returns," admits Dave Hersh, general partner of the double-A Memphis Chicks. "But we can promise you the things you dreamed of: spring training, tickets to the World Series, a road trip with the team."<p>Hersh says a small stake in his club costs $150,000, putting investors in league with co-owners including TV host Maury Povich and moviemaker Ron Howard. The relatively low entry point is a lure for unfulfilled fans. In 1985, Lee Anne Pagliai worked for <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. Now she's a partner in the High Desert Mavericks, a single-A team out of Adelanto, California. "I figured if I was selling, I might as well sell baseball," she says.<p>Big-league clubs manage all their affiliated teams, so minor-league owners don't have those hassles. "You can hang around the batting cage and not have to think, 'I gave this guy a $50,000 pay cut,'" says Bobby Brett, who recently bought the triple-A Indians in Portland, Oregon. Brett's partners:His three brothers, including Royals slugger George, and his high school basketball coach. <p>An investor's main role is to ensure that the club runs smoothly--and to keep 25 million Americans returning to minor-league parks every year. This isn't easy:Players move so quickly through the leagues that fans rarely see a consistent lineup. Feisty mascots and fireworks are the real draw for many clubs.<p>"Our tickets cost the same as a movie," says bond trader Frank Bolton, an owner of the single-A Blue Rocks in Wilmington, Delaware. "We compete against Sleepless in Seattle."<p>Even in franchises that do well, earning about 10 percent profit, owners often end up reinvesting their income--or diluting their ownership by offering extra shares to fund improved facilities.<p>Says Bob Richmond of Baseball Opportunities, a broker for many club sales: "People get into baseball because they want to get into baseball--not because of the returns."<p> <p><p>

When it comes to bashing their rivals, tightwads are generous to a fault<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>The nation's top penny-pinchers may be tight with a buck, but they're certainly not tight with each other. In fact, cheap shots are now common currency among the self-appointed gurus who've made frugality a lucrative profession.<p>"I was retching" while reading a recent issue of the industry-leading Tightwad Gazette, snipes Mary Hunt, editor of the rival Cheapskate Monthly--one of two dozen such newsletters now being published. The reason for Hunt's nausea:Tightwad stories on reusing feminine pads and identifying edible food in dumpsters.<p>But bad taste is only the beginning. This homely little industry is abuzz with accusations about everything from inflated circulation figures to espionage.<p>The most bitter rivalry pits Ron and Melodie Moore, editors of the Skinflint News, against queen piker Amy Dacyczyn--she of the dumpster diving. Dacyczyn (pronounced "decision") is convinced the Moores are exaggerating their newsletter's popularity.<p>In part, she bases her argument on penny-pinching. If the Skinflint News really has 45,000 subscribers as claimed, she says, the Moores should be using zip-plus-four mailing codes:"They'd save hundreds of dollars a month. And they'd save $2,000 a month if they did what I did" and bought special postal machines.<p>To clinch it, Dacyczyn cites a recent price drop at the Skinflint News, which advocates draining fried food on grocery bags instead of wasting "expensive" paper towels. "Who gives away $100,000 in annual profits?" she wonders.<p>Melodie Moore replies, "We negotiated a better printing deal and passed that on." But the Moores won't document their circulation claims. "We don't have anything to prove," Melodie Moore snaps, hanging up.<p>Dacyczyn says she has records to verify her claimed circulation of 55,000. But that doesn't get her off the hook with the Moores.<p>In June, Ron Moore spent an hour bad-mouthing Dacyczyn to Worth. Among other things, he griped that Dacyczyn sent employees to Florida to spy on him --perhaps to steal ideas, perhaps to prove the Moores aren't as cheap as they claim.<p>Tightwad employee Ellie Ring admits she tried to see the Moores' setup while visiting a nearby home in Florida but says it was her own idea. Ron Moore refused to let Ring in, and now he won't even discuss the rivalry.<p>"I wish you wouldn't print something like that," Moore sighs, fresh from appearing on a magazine cover and the Home television show. "I don't want any negative publicity."<p>The stakes in this dogfight are hardly penny-ante. Besides newsletter sales, there's a bundle to be made by successful books:Dacyczyn's best-selling Tightwad Gazette has 300,000 copies in print. Hunt's The Best of the Cheapskate Monthly--replete with tips such as rinsing coffee filters for reuse--counts 100,000 copies, while the Moores' Smart Cents tallies more than 75,000.<p>And in an industry that trades heavily on its friendly, homespun image, the misers' backbiting may carry a price.<p>Says Dacyczyn, who advocates cutting wide rubber bands in half lengthwise, thereby doubling their number:"This kind of talk makes us all look petty."<p>

The Jays feathered their nests with their World Series cash<p>By James Buckley Jr.<p>In 1949, a thrilled Jerry Coleman of the Yankees took his World Series check for $5,400 and ran to buy his first-ever car. The traditional Series bonus has grown a lot, but it won't hold such primal joy for the well-paid players who become world champions this month--at least, not if last year's winners are any indicator.<p>For most of the Toronto Blue Jays, the 1992 Series bonus of $114,962.16 was just another paycheck. In fact, most of the Jays we asked couldn't say exactly where their share of the loot went. <p>Only a few Jays--mostly rookies and staff--did any more than hand their bonus to a business manager after knocking off the Atlanta Braves in six games. And even the big spenders spent conservatively. A Jay's idea of splurging, in two words:Real estate.<p>The players' award pool, which is split between 12 teams, is created with 60 percent of the gate receipts from the first four games of both the league championships and the World Series. The remaining 40 percent, and the entire gate from any extra best-of-seven games, is split between Major League Baseball and the owners of the two Series clubs. (That explains why Marge Schott groused when her underdog Cincinnati Reds swept the 1990 Series in four games.)<p>Once the winning team's share of the pool is determined, the 25-man Series roster decides how to split it. Partial-season players might get less, as might trainers and other club personnel. After last year's Series, 35 members of the Blue Jays organization were handed full-share checks. Nineteen got partial shares, and the club gave cash grants to 14 more people. For most recipients, security came before indulgence.<p>Mark Eichhorn, pitcher
"I paid off the mortgage on my new house in Santa Cruz, California. Two acres and lots of trees--and the ocean is only a 78-mile-an-hour fastball away."<p>Ed Sprague, third baseman
The rookie pinch-hit a homer that won Game Two. He used his check to finish building a dream home in Stockton, California. But no pool for wife Kristen Babb-Sprague, an Olympic gold-medal winner in synchronized swimming: "I'd have never gotten her out of it."<p>Pat Hentgen, pitcher
The Series bonus more than doubled his income. His reaction would warm any parent's heart: "I put a down payment on a house in Macomb County, Michigan, 15 minutes from where I grew up."<p>Tommy Craig, trainer
When the Jays won the AL Eastern Division title in 1985, he used his bonus to buy a new house in Tarpon Springs, Florida. After the Series last year, he refurbished it. "I've got a pool and an exercise room, and everything looks like new."<p>Duane Ward, pitcher
The stolid reliever has banked his bonus for now but may change his mind. "I'm always looking for things to add to my collection of baseball memorabilia, like uniforms, baseballs, and cards. I might use the money for that."<p>Devon White, outfielder
Then there's Devo. Found near the batting cage before a recent game, he would only smile mysteriously:"Oh, believe me, it went to a worthy cause."<p>Maybe, just maybe, there's one old-time player left in Toronto.<p> <p><p>

Father and son rescue a cheesy cartoon, retooling it for success in the MTV age<p>By Thomas E. Weber<p>When a father starts tinkering under the hood of a classic sports car, it's only natural for him to ask his son to lend a hand.<p>That's what John Rocknowski figured when he set about tuning up the old Speed Racer cartoon for a comeback. And by putting son Jim, 34, in charge of U.S. licensing for Speed Racer Enterprises, Rocknowski gained more than a helpmate--he got an unabashed fan of the cheesy Japanese serial.<p>"I used to come and whip on the TV" to watchSpeed Racer, says Jim Rocknowski. "Being in tune with fans helps me figure out what to do here." Speed Racer, about a brash teenager and his fantastic car, was a staple for millions of children in the '60s. Now that its comeback is accelerating, the Rocknowskis think a new generation is ready for Speed. John Rocknowski, 62, has sunk about $6 million into the property since he snapped up rights in 1991. Together with Jim, he's jump-started a show that had languished for years.<p>The break came when MTV --like most cable channels, hungry for programming--granted Speed a regular time slot. Jim Rocknowski scored the coup with a free trial, allowing MTVto air Speed reruns at no charge. When viewership of the slot jumped as much as 50 percent from the previous offering, MTVbit and the Rocknowskis rejoiced: Speed is now a six-times-a-week supplement to the station's music videos.<p>MTV's heavy rotation is a partial solution to the Rocknowskis' number-one dilemma:how to ease the cartoon away from nostalgic baby busters and toward the gold mine of 1990s kiddie markets. With that aim, the elder Rocknowski, a veteran marketer of other cartoons, has more deals in motion. Speed merchandise is now on store shelves, for example, and a video game is in the works. A cartoon movie has been cobbled together from several old episodes.<p>Most important, though, is The New Adventures of Speed Racer, an updated TVshow that hits syndication this month. New Speed got major body work to ensure it appeals to kids; even the sleek design of the Mach Vcar was altered.<p>"With all due respect to the nostalgic aspects, [baby busters] are not our target audience," says producer Fred Wolf. "We're sensitive to the legacy, but we have to compete with newer shows."<p>So far, the Rocknowskis have seen little returnfrom their investment. And with new Speed episodes costing about $250,000 each, it'll be a while before they cash in on Speed's new hipness. "I don't think we'll hit the peak until 1996 or 1997," says John.<p>Neither he nor Jim fully understands Speed's staying power. "It was a weird, cutting-edge show," says Jim. "It's old enough to be new again.

The only certainties for Alex Gabor are debt and taxes, and he won't pay either<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Maybe you saw the ad in Esquire. Or Premiere.<p>Maybe you were intrigued enough to consider ordering a book called Confessions of a Sex-Crazed Money Man.<p>Maybe you're lucky you didn't. You'd have taken your chances with the author--admitted sex addict, polygamy advocate, and master debtor Alex S. Gabor.<p>Gabor admits that some customers who bought his book were overcharged by more than $100. What's more, he admits stiffing about a dozen magazines for at least $150,000 worth of ad space for Confessions.<p>The Hungarian-born Gabor also has peeved more than 20 other businesses and individuals, mostly around Seattle, who claim he owes them a total of more than $100,000 for schemes ranging from real estate deals to rave parties gone awry.<p>Gabor, 37, acknowledges many of these debts. He says he owes about $300,000 and that he'll pay it all. Eventually. After the Internal Revenue Service is eliminated.<p>"When the IRS no longer exists," Gabor reads aloud from Confessions, "I will pay off all of my creditors 100 percent on the dollar."<p>Plus interest?<p>"Sure. Plus interest."<p>To Alex Gabor, a.k.a. Gabriel Acs, a.k.a. Gabriel Alexander, a.k.a. Gabriel O. Di Safeyette, a.k.a. Gabor Sandor Acs--"it's only 30 bucks to change your name"--the tax system is the root of all evil. Don't understand? Read the book, he says.<p>Confessions details Gabor's sexual and financial exploits in a rambling diary-cum-political critique. At the end of a chapter titled "The Tuna Highway," he grandly forgives himself "for all offenses I may have committed . . .  while a member of this planet's social order."<p>Others aren't as generous. Worth spoke to 50 people, including a few Gabor told us would vouch for his good character.<p>Only one did. A more typical response:"I think he's clinically insane," says David Meinert, a Seattle music agent who says Gabor owes him money. "I don't know anyone who hasn't been scammed by him."<p>And he was one of Gabor's handpicked references.<p>Two people who helped Gabor sell Confessions say buyers were relieved of considerable sums when zeros were added to their $11.95 credit card bills--and one worker says buyers were also billed $100 extra if they ordered another author's book. Gabor says the overcharges were the fault of an incompetent employee he declines to identify, and that he intends to refund the money.<p>For his blizzard of ads, Gabor is in the hole to magazines across the country:Esquire says it's out $50,000, Premiere $58,000. "I'm looking for him, too," says Ed Gonzaga, a Seattle licensing inspector. Gabor owes the city taxes for various events he produced during the last year.<p>Lots of people would love to sue Gabor. But finding him isn't easy:Worth made more than 70 phone calls to track him down, finally finding him in Seattle at the Center for Applied Metapsychology, where he says he's recovering from an addiction to pot.<p>"I'm not hiding out,"insists Gabor, who can be reached only by leaving a message on phone mail. "I'm busy writing a script." He claims he's sold another script to an unnamed actor for $300,000.<p>Also on his agenda are two more books. "My goal," he confides, "is to sell a million copies . . .  and use the proceeds to abolish the IRS. And make some money for myself."<p>But so far, he's sold just 2,000 copies of Confessions--grossing, well, at least $23,900.<p> <p><p>

Uncle Sam wants to sell Jerry Lee Lewis's childhood piano<p>By Tara McKelvey<p>At this rate, the Internal Revenue Service will be opening its own branch of the Hard Rock Cafe.<p>The latest addition to the agency's revolving collection of confiscated music memorabilia:Jerry Lee Lewis's childhood piano. The upright is due to be sold at public auction, following in the tradition of Sammy Davis Jr.'s tap shoes and Willie Nelson's grand piano.<p>First, however, the IRS must prove it's the true owner of the instrument, now moldering in the Delta auction house in Memphis. This month Kerrie Lewis, the Killer's sixth wife, will argue in court that she has a better claim on the piano:She bought it after Jerry Lee's 1988 bankruptcy, she says, so the IRS can't use it to pay her husband's back taxes.<p>The piano itself is no prize. Half the ivory is falling off the keys, the paint is chipped, and it has been "kind of pasted together to keep from falling to the floor," says a Delta employee. Still, the auctioneers think it'll fetch "in the thousands"--a start toward paying off Lewis's debt of about $3.7 million in taxes, penalties, and interest.<p>Despite its condition, the Starck piano has a priceless history. As a youngster in Ferriday, Louisiana, Lewis pounded out his first chords on it. He learned to play alongside cousins Jimmy Swaggart--later to gain fame as a defiled minister--and Mickey Gilley, who would become known for running the Texas honky-tonk featured in Urban Cowboy.<p>The piano was the most notable item seized by the IRS when it cleaned out Lewis's home in Nesbit, Mississippi, in May. Lewis had previously removed other valuable keepsakes, including gold records he received for such songs as "Whole Lotta Shakin' Goin' On" and "Great Balls of Fire."<p>Nonetheless, the IRS spent a day filling three 24-foot trucks with more than 350 items. Included in the haul:A plaque from a Jerry Lee Lewis fan club in Holland, an exercise video, and ten Duraflame logs.<p>"They even got the shower curtain,"says David Monypeny, an attorney in Memphis who represents Lewis.<p>While this was going on, Lewis was traveling  with Kerrie and their son, Lee; shortly afterward, the family decided to settle awhile in Ireland. A spokesman says Lewis isn't evading the IRS; it must simply be coincidence that Irish tax laws exempt income from artistic efforts. Either way, Lewis, now 58, traveled light. An IRS official in Jackson, Mississippi, says the agency took everything in Lewis's house except young Lee's toys.<p>Lewis, who popped up as a guest at a Bruce Springsteen concert soon after his arrival in Dublin, has traded wits with the feds since the 1970s. He still owes taxes for 11 years and ducked a criminal rap by proving he was too uneducated to understand the tax code.<p>Lewis even dedicated a song to the IRS in 1979. Called "Milk Cow Blues," it's a sweet, bluesy tune about a man whose woman has left him. The IRS won't see any money from it, though: His label never released the record.<p> <p><p>

Washington chefs are ushering in changes faster than the Clinton administration<p>By Randall Fuller<p>Forget health-care reform and middle-class tax breaks. The politics of change currently sweeping Washington is in the kitchen. Less than six months after Bill Clinton called on government to engage in "bold, persistent experimentation," nearly a dozen innovative restaurants have opened in the nation's capital. Chefs from around the country have migrated to the city and quickly transformed eating habits that until recently had seemed trapped between the Eisenhower and Nixon administrations. Says Washington Post food critic Phyllis C. Richman, "Suddenly, and somewhat unexpectedly, Washington's become an outlandishly hot place to eat." <p>Inquire about this sudden interest in food, and you may get a reply that sounds like reheated campaign rhetoric. "Three or four years ago, this town was too ensconced in formal French cooking to even consider opening a restaurant," says Mark Miller, who started the trend of new restaurants a year and a half ago with his wildly successful Red Sage, on 14th Street. "What happened? I think the status quo finally gave way." Indeed, in less time than it takes to push a budget bill through Congress, the new administration has permanently altered the dining culture of Washington. New and stylish cafes have replaced Republican power haunts as the places to lunch, and even old take-out joints no longer receive most-favored-trade status (while Bush and Reagan staffers were content to order from Domino's, young Democrats prefer Listrani's upscale "Mediterranean" pizzas--Horwood Gdid I do the Mdash correctly. chicken and broccoli with feta and fontina cheeses). One sip of a double decaf iced cappuccino at Georgetown's brand-new Dean & DeLuca market--which unlike its New York City counterpart offers Bill and Hillary gingerbread cookies and Arkansas peppered ham--and you quickly catch the flavor of the Clinton era. <p>Palladin, the latest eponymous restaurant from Jean-Louis Palladin, is a perfect example of the kind of dinner place that is flourishing under the new administration. Set below the Watergate Hotel, the restaurant is a sophisticated but less expensive version of the much-heralded Jean-Louis. The food--continental technique applied to local American ingredients--seems custom-made for a small-town Ozark boy educated at Oxford. So far, however, the commander in chief has yet to try the sublime milk-fed Virginia leg of lamb with ragout of flageolets or raviolis of Maine scallops.<p>Fiscal responsibility also plays a role at Gerard's Place, the 65-seat coral-colored bistro within jogging distance of the White House, on 15th Street NW. A two-star chef in Paris before leaving to work at the Ritz-Carlton in Pentagon City, Gerard Pangaud opened the restaurant a month and a half after Clinton took office. "I wanted to create something smart and sophisticated," he says, "but not too snobbish or expensive." The result--populism with a French accent--has already attracted at least one powerful FOB: National Economic Council chief Robert Rubin is regularly spotted there at lunch. <p>Of course, part of the capital's booming restaurant scene can be attributed to the second most powerful group in Washington: Hollywood. Citronelle, the chic Georgetown restaurant set inside the Latham Hotel and run by L.A. chef Michel Richard, has been mobbed nearly every night since Janet Reno and Barbra Streisand met for the culinary equivalent of Camp David. Billy Crystal and Sam Waterston have stopped in on their way from the White House, as has political heavyweight Henry "the Fonz" Winkler. According to some old Washington hands, the commotion around a recent visit by William Baldwin brought back memories of the days when JFK and the Rat Pack dined at the then-new Sans Souci. (As for Washington's real celebrities: Warren Christopher is a regular at Citronelle, as are media heavy hitters Art Buchwald and David Brinkley.)<p>Still, Washington has always molded itself to the image of its leader, which helps explain the recent influx of food from below the Mason-Dixon line. The trend began with Vidalia, Jeffrey Buben's slick Southern eatery on M Street. Buben started work on the new restaurant as soon as he left his job at the Republican-favored Occidental Grill--the day after the inauguration, as it turned out. Lawyers and lobbyists crowd Vidalia for lunch, but dinner, featuring wild mushroom ragout with Virginia ham, cream gravy over a rosemary biscuit, and plenty of fresh cornbread, is when Buben's talents really sparkle. Next came the down-home Dixie Grill, located across the street from Ford's Theater. A hangout for Bubba wanna-bes and agents from the nearby FBI building, the place debuted soon after Chris Zarpas, former president of Island Pictures and co-owner of the restaurant with his brother Stephen, returned from a road trip to Little Rock just before the election. People come for the pool table and jukebox as well as the corn-fried catfish, french-fried sweet potatoes, and gumbo pie. Finally, there's Georgia Brown's Fine Southern Cuisine, on 15th Street NW, which opened in July with a host of low-country dishes, including Cape Fear River clams and crab cakes with collard greens. <p>As if to remind us that no government can afford to focus entirely on domestic policy, three international restaurants opened within the administration's first 100 days. Cafe Milano is a trendy Italian trattoria in Georgetown, while Jaleo, a Spanish tapas bar brightened by a mural of a flamenco dancer, is located in the newly booming downtown area. Most interesting of all is Mimmetta, on Eye Street, which was opened in March by Sicilian cookbook author Mimmetta Lo Monte. Workers from the nearby World Bank and IMF offices stop by for the beef with chocolate sauce and snails with mint, garlic, and bread crumbs. "But," admits Lo Monte, "I'm still waiting for Clinton and Gore to try my gelati."<p>Indeed, in a town where power is not only an aphrodisiac but a surefire way to keep a place booked, restaurateurs are clamoring to attract influential Democrats. The John Hay Room at the Hay-Adams Hotel, a traditional spot for power breakfasts directly across from the White House, recently hired chef Patrick Clark for a three-year contract rumored at $250,000 a year in an effort to lure the Clinton administration. The president instead has ventured to Restaurant Nora, the 14-year-old restaurant whose reputation for political correctness was oddly enhanced when George Stephanopoulos reportedly broke up with his girlfriend there. About the menu, full of heartfelt assurances that "animals are raised in a stress-free environment, fed highly nutritional ingredients with no pesticides or antibiotics, and butchered at the peak of their strength," Clinton was moved to comment: "The food is good, but I couldn't understand the menu."<p>Still, the most popular restaurant with the administration continues to be Red Sage. A multimillion-dollar cowboy fantasy, it remains the wittiest restaurant in D.C.: A cloud over the chili bar flickers with simulated heat lightning, and margaritas are made with passion fruit and served with a plastic barbed wire stirrer. Bill took Hillary there for Valentine's Day (the first couple's first dinner out in Washington), and on a busy night you're liable to see Les Aspin, Warren Christopher, Janet Reno, and even Tipper Gore. All of which is why Miller, who also owns Santa Fe's Coyote Cafe, is developing another restaurant for the capital--this time using cuisines from the Pacific Rim. <p>True, not all has changed in the capital. Clinton and Bob Dole chose the clubbish Duke Zeibert's for a recent dinner date, and Sam Donaldson continues to pay for drinks at the Jefferson after taping Prime Time. But to paraphrase another young Democratic president, there hasn't been such an intense appreciation of food in one place since Thomas Jefferson dined alone in the White House.<p>
RECOMMENDED RESTAURANTS<p>Prices are average for a three-course dinner per couple; drinks, tax, and tip not included. The area code for Washington, D.C., is 202.<p>Cafe Milano, 3251 Prospect St. NW; 333-6183. $50.<p>Citronelle, 3000 M St. NW; 625-2150. $79.<p>Dean & DeLuca, 3276 M St. NW; 342-2500. Double cappuccino, $2.80.<p>Dixie Grill, 518 10th St. NW; 628-4800. $33.<p>Georgia Brown's, 950 15th St. NW; 393-4499. $50.<p>Girard's Place, 915 15th St. NW; 737-4445. $75.<p>John Hay Room, 1 Lafayette Square; 638-6600. $81.<p>Jaleo, 480 7th St. NW; 628-7949. $48.<p>Mimmetta, 1919 Eye St. NW; 659-4447. $54.<p>Palladin, 2650 Virginia Ave. NW; 298-4455. $56.<p>Red Sage, 605 14th St. NW; 638-4444. $75.<p>Restaurant Nora, 2132 Florida Ave. NW; 462-5143. $71.<p>Vidalia, 1990 M St. NW; 659-1990. $58.<p>
ARE YOU WHAT YOU EAT?<p>We polled several Washington restaurants with political followings and discovered that listening to a voice count on Bill Clinton's budget package isn't the only way to tell the left from the right. There is some common ground between the two parties. Nearly every restaurant said that liberals and conservatives alike have cut down on hard liquor. (A notable exception was Red Sage, which manager Don Senich wishfully characterizes as "an oasis of political bipartisanship": 2,000 margaritas are sold there each week.) Duke Zeibert's strawberry cheesecake cuts across party lines as do crab cakes from the Monocle. <p>Democrat Dinner<p>Chardonnay, Citronelle. Margarita, Red Sage. Crispy shrimp, Citronelle. Eggplant steak, Restaurant Nora. Mushroom risotto, Restaurant Nora. Crab cakes, the Monocle. Fresh blueberry pie, Restaurant Nora. Strawberry cheesecake, Duke Zeibert's. <p>Republican Dinner<p>Beer, Red, Hot & Blue. Margaritas, Red Sage. Onion-ring loaf, Red, Hot & Blue. Grilled Black Angus strip steak, Occidental Grill. Tennessee Triple (barbecued beef, pork, and chicken), Red, Hot & Blue. Crab cakes, the Monocle. Mocha mousse torte, Occidental Grill. Strawberry cheesecake, Duke Zeibert's. <p> <p><p>

There's much more than South Beach on humorist Dave Barry's personal tour<p>By Carla Koehl<p>In 1986, syndicated columnist Dave Barry moved to Florida from Glen Mills, Pennsylvania ("It's exactly like Miami without the machine-gun fire"). It was then that he realized insects, not humans, were the dominant species. "I've seen grasshoppers all my life, but these things block your path," he says. "The animal life is much closer here. It's in your bathroom."<p>When Out-of-Towners Arrive: "We offer them a toothbrush and tell them to go to the Grand Bay Hotel [2669 S. Bayshore Drive; 305-858-9600] in Coconut Grove. It's elegant, fun, and has a nice Florida feel."<p>Favorite Restaurant: "At Coco Walk in Coconut Grove, there's Cafe Tu Tu Tango [3015 Grand Avenue; 305-529-2222], which has a really elaborate, complicated menu--mostly Caribbean food--with tons of hors d'oeuvres. I always order about ten of them and imported beer, which is very important."<p>Favorite Dive Bar: "The Taurus Steakhouse [3540 Main Highway; 305-448-0633]. It's an old, eccentric little bar where the bartender always dresses up. In August he's come in as Santa Claus. The Taurus also has a ring-toss game. It's low-tech, but hey--it still works when the power's out in a hurricane."<p>Getting to a Miami Heat Game: "You go to the 1800 Club [1800 N. Bayshore Drive; 305-373-1093], which is right near the Miami Herald, and buy tickets from a scalper. Then get on the trolley that the bar hires, drink in hand, go see the game, and come back to the 1800 Club to eat."<p>Favorite Live-Music Spot: "Tobacco Road [626 S. Miami Avenue; 305-374-1198]. It's the oldest, first licensed bar in Miami. Sort of hidden away. They serve a yuppie crowd at lunch. But at night it's just a good, good bar, with mostly blues bands."<p>What Not to Do: "Go on an airboat ride in the Everglades. I had this vision of the Everglades being like the Brazilian rain forest. But it's swamp, endless grass, and muck. Theoretically, there are all kinds of rare and exotic creatures, but the airboat, which is designed to be louder than a hydrogen-bomb test, makes all the animals disappear."<p>How to Pass for a Local: "No native here uses traffic signals. In fact, anyone who obeys traffic laws at all is generally assumed to be from Iowa and is usually robbed for it."

Personal digital assistants put efficiency in your palm<p>By Thomas E. Weber<p>Pocket organizers have been around for years, logging appointments and remembering telephone numbers, but tiny rows of keys were a poor substitute for putting pen to paper inside a Filofax. Now manufacturers are getting the point--pens are easy to use, and computers aren't. New pen-based computers, known as personal digital assistants, are doing away with rigid software, which often requires the patience only Wizardheads--gadget freaks named after the Sharp organizer--can muster. A PDA will let you scribble and jot using a stylus on a touch-sensitive screen, and with the help of some fancy programming, it will try to read your mind a bit, too. "Intelligent assistant" software helps route your scrawl to the right location--calendar, address book, to-do list--without specific instructions from you. The introductory hype for PDAs has created high expectations: A television commercial for the <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> EO unit shows a relaxed executive sending a fax from the beach (ever try to clean sand out of a computer?). Here's a look at some of the major players:<p>Newton MessagePad
Manufacturer: <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>
Street price: $699
Size: 4.5 in. x 7.25 in. x 0.75 in.
Weight: 14 ounces
Battery life: Two weeks of normal use
Most useful feature: Intelligent-assistant software
Most useless feature: Acts as an autodialer when held up to the phone
Gee-whiz feature: A puff of animated smoke appears when you delete a note<p>Despite some bad buzz before its introduction, Newton delivers. While other pen-based units have evolved from laptops or organizers, Apple designed Newton from scratch (see "Newton's Core") to be an all-encompassing technology for information management, with the MessagePad serving as the doorway. A few examples: Apple is launching a Newton electronic mail service that users can access with a pocket-size modem. For those who tote the kind of pager that can receive brief text messages, a plug-in card for the MessagePad will replace it.<p>Apple advises users to think of it as "an endless roll of notepaper." Write whatever you want, and Newton's intelligent-assistant software will guess what to do with it, based on preprogrammed knowledge and observation of your habits. Newton would look at a note stating "lunch with Lisa tomorrow" and surmise that it should add the date to tomorrow's calendar. If you have more than one Lisa in your address book, Newton suggests the Lisa whose name appears most often.<p>It can store a sketch in its original form, or it can clean up doodles, replacing them with straight lines and perfect circles. When using the optional modem (a Newton-modem bundle costs $100 more than the MessagePad alone), tapping your location on a world map tells MessagePad where you are, letting it dial and fax shrewdly, omitting area codes.<p>These features make Newton simple and intuitive for technophobes. For those who have mastered their personal computer, Newton's friendly style may seem disorderly and perplexing at first. And the idea of giving up some control to Newton's smart software can be disquieting. But Apple has definitely done its homework by sketching a thoroughly new framework for computing and filling in the details. Newton won't just replace paper organizers; it will supersede them.<p>Zoomer<p>Manufacturer: Casio, <a name="NYSE:TAN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11441"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tandy</b></a>
Street price: $699
Size: 4.2 in. x 6.8 in. x 1 in.
Weight: 16 ounces
Battery life: 100 hours
Most useful feature: Built-in versions of  popular software
Most useless feature: Built-in solitaire game
Gee-whiz feature: 26-language translator<p>Zoomer is ideal for personal computer users who don't want to lug around a notebook or spend time recharging batteries on the road. Two of its best features have been transferred straight from PCs: Pocket Quicken and <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>. Pocket Quicken is a streamlined version of Intuit's personal-finance software. A special version of America Online lets Zoomer users plug in a modem and access online services--electronic mail, stock quotes, news, and airline reservations. You can even send a fax by routing it through America Online.<p>Handwriting recognition, turning your scrawled notes into neatly typed text, is a bit slow on Zoomer. It's fine for quick notes, but lengthy letters may be frustrating. Also, the screen is a bit dim and may require some experimentation to find the optimum viewing angle. For experienced PC users, though, Zoomer's Windows-like software makes it a good option.<p>AT&T EO 440<p>Manufacturer: EO Inc.
Street price: $1,999
Size: 7.1 in. x 10.8 in. x 0.9 in.
Weight: 35 ounces
Battery life: 4 hours
Most useful feature: Large, sharp screen
Most useless feature: Short battery life
Gee-whiz feature: Lets you record voice notes<p>EO is positioned as a "personal communicator." It's not a pocket-size assistant, and it's not a laptop computer either. In fact, the base model would be a poor substitute for either. But with the addition of an internal modem ($500) and a cellular-phone module ($799), EO is transformed into a hybrid of computer, phone, and fax machine at the size and price of a high-end laptop.<p>A powerful chip called Hobbit drives the EO and helps the machine do a speedy job of handwriting recognition. With its cellular-phone module, EO can then fax those notes. Want to phone instead? Tap the appropriate entry in EO's address book, and it will even dial for you.<p>EO, like Newton, also includes intelligent software. For instance, writing "call Bob" in EO's calendar causes the device to display a note alerting the user if Bob isn't listed in the address book.<p>Despite these impressive capabilities, EO is relatively large and heavy for a pen-based device. After all, one advantage to getting rid of traditional keyboards is making portable computers slimmer. EO is best for users, such as businessmen often on the road, who want to make full use of its modem and cellular-phone add-ons and don't mind carrying them around. Otherwise, consider a laptop for computing power or a pocket organizer for portability.<p>Wizard OZ-9600II<p>Manufacturer: Sharp Electronics 
Street price: $499
Size: 4.1 in. x 7.1 in. x 1 in.
Weight: 15 ounces
Battery life: 80 hours
Most useful feature: Beaming memos straight to a printer
Most useless feature: Beaming doodles to another Wizard
Gee-whiz feature: Has actual keyboard  buttons<p>Wizard bridges the gap between simple electronic organizers and pen-based devices. Unlike Zoomer, Newton, and EO, Wizard can't translate handwriting into computer text. Instead, it stores pictures of what's been written and drawn on its touch screen. For all but the most rudimentary uses, text must be entered using a miniature keyboard. For users who plan on writing memos on the move, that's not necessarily bad. Wizard's keys, while smaller and more difficult to type on than a standard keyboard, allow text entry at a much faster rate than units dependent on handwriting recognition. The touch screen is available for entering drawings.<p>Wizard provides the basics: an address book and a calendar. It also offers a nicely thought-out to-do list which tracks completed tasks in a "done entries" section. Wizard's common-sense interface doesn't offer intelligent assistance, but controls are clearly marked, and calendars, notepads, and to-do lists look like their paper analogues. Like the completely pen-based units, Wizard can be hooked up to a PC (with additional software) to transfer information.<p>If you enter a lot of text, Wizard may be the PDA for you. It may not have the glamour of the pen-based Newton or Zoomer, but sometimes glamour is no substitute for a keyboard.<p>
NEWTON'S CORE<p>How did apple computer fulfill a promise to introduce groundbreaking technology in five months? Simple. They locked a team of high-tech wizards in a square, windowless room and prayed for a miracle. "Basically, these guys were told to come up with the next cool thing," says photojournalist Doug Menuez, who was granted complete access by Apple to chronicle the Newton project for the new book Horwood Gthis might be a November book Defying Gravity: The Making of Newton (Beyond Words Publishing, $29.95). Regarding John Sculley's January 1992 announcement that Apple would unveil its PDA technology in May of that year, Menuez confirms that the ex-CEO fired a blank. "That was an absolute screamer because they were not ready at all."<p>To fine-tune Newton's software and hardware, 65 engineers hacked around the clock for more than a year, breaking only to play fiercely competitive games of basketball and Ping-Pong or to nap for three or four hours a day. Kids, visiting their parents at dinnertime, shot arrows at busy engineers and scribbled on scientific data marked do not erase. The project mantra was "The absurd has become routine." <p>As pressure mounted, absurdity met tragedy. One team member committed suicide, engineers cracked up, and personal lives dissolved. "The stresses and strains of this project definitely took their toll," says Menuez. With Newton completed and its evolution recorded in the book Menuez describes as "Soul of a New Machine meets Day in the Life," will Apple's finest relax? "There's a  says Menuez, "but a lot of them plan to go right back to work."      <p> <p><p>

Fishing Vests Are the New Urban Style Craze<p>By Paul Schneider<p>Andy Carlson is reasonably certain that the man who was caught shoplifting at the Manhattan store of the fly-fishing outfitter Orvis a few months ago was not looking for a fishing vest for sporting reasons. "He had five of our Super Tac-L-Pak vests stuffed into a bag," says Carlson, an Orvis manager. "If he were going fishing, he would only need one." The $74 vests, he explains, have become a very fashionable thing for urban males to own. "The guy was definitely planning to sell them on the street."<p>Fishing vests are turning up on the street, and not just on the shoulders of German tourists, Associated Press photographers, and urban teens. Businessmen are wearing them in layers under jackets and over sweaters. Ralph Lauren pioneered the look as the first major designer to realize the wider fashion potential of the multi-pocketed vests; he has been selling them since the early '80s. The style really took off when rappers--among them Heavy D and the Boyz, Das Efx, the Pharcyde, Grand Puba Maxwell, and Brand Nubian--adopted the vests as part of their street wear. Donna Karan, a designer who often looks to the streets for inspiration, introduced a stylized $115 fishing vest into her DKNY men's line last spring. It was so popular she reinterpreted it for fall in a down-filled version (above). A $105 linen fishing vest was one of the hottest-selling items in Joseph Abboud's J.O.E summer collection. This season Abboud completes the garment's divorce from its angling origins with a loose, patch-pocketed vest made out of nubuck (at around $300, it costs as much as any real fisherman would spend on a fly rod). <p>Abboud's vest has only four pockets, while any fishing-worthy vest has at least ten. The mid-priced Super Tac-L-Pak, the most popular vest at Orvis among nonfishing customers, has an astounding 33 pockets: one for the cellular phone, one for the personal digital assistant, one for taxi receipts, one for subway tokens, and 29 for looks. The top of the line vest, Carlson says, can be automatically inflated for use as a life preserver. "And that," he says, "is a bit more of a fashion statement than people want."

						By Nick Ravo<p>
"People call us the Switzerland of the U. S. because of our initiative," says Robert Miller, head of financial-services development for the state of Vermont. <p>
Vermont? Home to Socialist congressman Bernie Sanders and lefty dessert dons Ben & Jerry? A haven for money managers?<p>
Yes, Vermont. Last summer, the aptly named Green Mountain State adopted an ambitious plan to lure financial managers. The biggest incentive (besides the ski slopes) is a 75 percent tax credit on state income taxes for Vermont-based investment firms. Right now, Vermont has the fifth-highest marginal tax rate.<p>
About 178 firms have inquired about the Vermont plan, and 3 companies have already relocated to cow country. "The state has gone from being hostile to business to being receptive," says Arnold Barton, president of Blackford Securities of New York, which recently opened an office in Vermont. Anticipating a boom, the state has launched Vermont Securities Institute at Champlain College in Burlington to train residents for the 1,000 or so jobs that may develop over the next five years.<p>
Those who know their history won't be surprised by the state's new economic ambience. Vermont's most famous native son is Calvin Coolidge, the 30th president and Yankee cheapskate who urged Americans to invest in the stock market of the Roaring Twenties.<p>

"Collectors have every incentive to beat the crap out of you over the phone," says Benjamin Dover, author of the self-help book Life After Debt. "Probably 60 percent of their tactics are illegal." Take, for instance, the creep who threatened Marianne Driscol of Texas. Not only did he claim to have planted a bomb in Driscol's office, but he also said a hit man had been hired -- all this over a $2,000 Visa bill. Driscol later won an $11 million judgment against Household Credit Services, which has appealed the ruling. Meanwhile, pit-bull collection practices run rampant. Impersonating an insurance agent with a claim check to get a return call, tacking on additional fees, and falsely implying that an arrest or property seizure is impending are common and illegal tactics. And don't expect to get revenge easily. Dover says that few attorneys will take harassment cases, which take years to resolve.

Stagnant living standards? It's tough out there. Nothing I'm going to say is meant to minimize that. But the perceived stagnation in living standards may be more quantitative than qualitative -- and not just because the crime rate is down. (And the Los Angeles air and much of the nation's water are cleaner.) <p>
Here's a letter I recently purchased, written by Margaret Mitchell, author of Gone With the Wind. I collect stuff like this. I bought it because, ironically, Mitchell was killed by a drunk driver a few months after she wrote it: <p>
February 3, 1949 
Dear Mr. Jones: 
Here is our thought about the matter of a new car. The four-door car just will not do for us. It appears to have less leg room for John than the two-door and it would cramp his legs on a long trip. The steering gear on the four-door surprised me by being set at a different angle, so odd an angle that even with the heavy driving pillow behind me I could not reach the brakes. I can't tell you how much this surprised us and disappointed us too. Mr. Mullin was as surprised as we were. He very obligingly said he'd bring us out the next two-door you had to try again. But John and I have talked the matter over and have decided we do not want the two-door either. We nearly got killed in an accident once when a drunk drove into the back of our car and we were sitting in seats which swung on hinges such as the two-door Mercury has. That type of seat will sling the passengers into the windshield. John felt, too, that the wheel of the two-door Mercury was in my ribs and that any slight accident might cause me serious injury.... 
Margaret Mitchell Marsh 
Atlanta, Georgia <p>
She goes on at some length: They'll just put a new coat of paint on their old Mercury and hope it holds up a while longer -- if not, they'll take the train. If only Mercury would come out with a car that combined the virtues of the Mercury engine, the 1918 Pierce-Arrow limousine, and the 1920 Ford Model T, she laments.<p>
Today, I have an air bag in my car. I have adjustable seats and seat belts. You, too? There's a good chance you have air-conditioning. And -- now, this is truly incredible -- a radio and possibly a telephone in your car! Power steering! We have computers ten times as powerful as the ones we could have bought for the same price just a few years ago. That's stagnation? <p>
For $300, I have a scanner smaller than a hero sandwich that will stick the original of the Mitchell letter onto my screen in seconds, then optically transcribe it from a photo to an actual word-processing document I can edit and stick into the text above, saving all that mindless retyping. I can then shoot all this over the phone lines up to a satellite and down to a computer at a magazine office.<p>
Stagnation? We have Caller ID and Prozac and not-from-concentrate orange juice year-round with little bits of real home-style pulp floating around in it. We have electronic banking, laser surgery, and $12 AM/FM clock radios with snooze alarms that receive music digitally recorded on compact discs. We have the Internet and fat-free cheese! This is not stagnation. This is wondrous progress quickly taken for granted. <p>
So when a panel of experts tells you that the consumer price index -- which weights cigarettes 16 times as heavily as computers and doesn't even consider cellular phones -- may be overstating inflation by 1 percent a year, don't assume it's a dastardly trick. It's probably long overdue. <p>
Annuity Insanity? 
I've never been too cheery about annuities, for reasons I've detailed from time to time. They're heavily promoted (because the sales commissions are high), but that doesn't make them a good investment. Once you get sucked into an annuity it's not so easy to get out or even switch managers. And you have annual administration fees and a "life-insurance component" that cuts into your return. Yes, they grow tax-deferred, like a giant nondeductible IRA. But why not buy municipal bonds, which are not just tax-deferred but tax-free? Or why not buy growth stocks outside the shelter of a variable annuity? Tax on their appreciation will not only be deferred until you sell them but, very likely, subject to a favorable capital-gains tax rate. (Within an annuity, any capital-gains advantage is ultimately lost -- the gains are fully taxable as ordinary income when withdrawn.) So I've been pretty down on annuities forever -- not that this seems to have thwarted in any detectable degree the army of salesfolk who sell billions of dollars' worth every year. But what's really appalling is that a large percentage of annuities are sold to people for their retirement plans: their IRA rollovers and Keogh Plans and so on. This is nuts. Those funds are already tax-deferred. Why on earth would anyone accept the sales and administration costs of an annuity product -- the only real justification for which is the tax-deferral aspect -- when their funds are already sheltered from tax? <p>
If you are one of the thousands of investors making this mistake -- quit it. If a financial adviser put tax-deferred annuities into your tax-deferred retirement account, I'd consider not just switching advisers but even inquiring as to possible "remedies." You've been the victim of something that is, or appears to me to verge on, professional malpractice.<p>
Money Bags. 
A friend sent me a couple of pages ripped from the Brainstorms catalog (800-231-6000), which appears to be unique -- it is the only catalog in the world I don't already get. He thought I'd like these pages because all the stuff has to do with money. It's true. Ever since I was treasurer of my high-school class, six years running, I have had a fondness for the stuff. (Tuttman! You still owe six dollars!...Just kidding.)<p>
Anyway, my eye immediately went to Item No. 50727, which is a clear plastic bag about waist high filled with -- are those leaves from the lawn? No, $100,000 of genuine shredded U.S. currency -- for $99.95 plus shipping. There's also a little see-through pillow -- "regularly $1,000, shredded price $6.95" -- and a $1,000 money wreath for $19.95. I must say I prefer the waist-high bag o' money to these last two, but then I guess you get what you pay for. <p>

Like Bruce Springsteen, Nick Binkley bemoans the working life. But you will not hear about factory shifts and dirt pay in the songs of this musician. Binkley, a venture capitalist and former banker, croons of Wall Street drudgery and white-collar angst. <p>
"It's my antidote to the burnout," explains the 51-year-old Binkley, who, until a couple of years ago, had to sing on the sly. During the day, he worked as vice-chairman of the board at BankAmerica. But once the whistle blew, Binkley grabbed his guitar and headed out to local clubs. "I was gigging all over L.A.," he says. "It never filtered up to the top of the bank. I think they'd have been a little surprised."<p>
Anxious for an out, Binkley resigned from BankAmerica in 1993 and co-founded Forrest Binkley & Brown, a venture-capital firm in Newport Beach, California. He and his two partners currently manage $110 million in assets for such clients as Texas billionaires Sid and Lee Bass. Binkley, however, remains devoted to his parallel career as a musician.<p>
Months ago, he released his debut album, Pin Stripe Brain. He financed it himself, and though he hasn't broken even on his $50,000 investment, the CD has sold 4,000 copies. Nearly 50 radio stations around the country have played it.<p>
Pin Stripe Brain, a collection of 15 folk and rock songs, kicks off with a Willie Lomanesque lament. On the title track, Binkley muses, "Grazing 'cross the fields / Of high profitability yields / Is the man / With the pinstripe brain / Summertime seersucker / Wall Street prisoner / Is the man with the pinstripe brain... / Bottom-line hypnotized / On a jet commuter red-eye / Is the man with the pinstripe brain."<p>
Already, Binkley has a follow-up album in the works. And he is still brooding over the corporate grind. One of his new songs, "Wooden Indians," recalls his experiences at Chase Manhattan Bank, where he once worked as an assistant treasurer. Recalling the floor where hundreds of fellow Chase bankers crunched numbers, Binkley sings, "Broken minds, lost in time / Twist and turn like rusted signs in the wind."<p>
Decades ago, Binkley tried to escape such decay. At 29, he dropped out of Chase, spent two years writing songs and studying guitar, and tried to nail down a record deal. "I really was hoping it would develop into an alternative to banking," he explains. "But I got back so many rejections." A music-industry veteran, who played guitar on Paul Simon's albums, finally told him, "You can make more money as a singing banker." <p>
Binkley still believes he's got a shot at the big time, especially if he can persuade a major record label to back his upcoming album. But as a venture capitalist, he knows the odds are daunting. "It's not an inexpensive thing to take on a new act," he says. "And the statistics are not good: Eighty-six percent of the 7,300 albums that were released in 1995 from the major labels sold fewer than 10,000 copies." What's more, most record companies, according to Binkley, "look at someone who's 50 and say, 'This isn't going to work.'" <p>
Not surprisingly, bankers really dig Binkley. He counts among his fans the chief financial officer of Credit Suisse First Boston and the chairman of Bankers Trust. He even appeared as a surprise performer at a conference for senior executives from BankAmerica. At the start of the show, Binkley says, "there were a lot of stunned faces, jaws dropping six inches."<p>
Binkley will not look back in anger if musical success eludes him. "This is something I do for my heart," he says. "The reason I write music is that, if I didn't, I would probably kill myself."<p>

REAL-ESTATE PEAK. Rocky Mountain High ain't just a knee-slappin' John Denver tune. Houses in the Rocky Mountain states (ranging from Montana to New Mexico) have risen in value 44.2 percent over the past five years, according to the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight. That's nearly double the growth of any other area. Stanley Duobinis, economist at the National Association of Home Builders, credits the spurt to a thriving job market and an influx of Californians. But prices should plateau as more new homes are built in this region.<p>
DOLLY PARTON ON RYE. Who says the Hard Rock Cafe isn't inspirational? Since 1990, Ecklein Communications reports, 18 new theme-restaurant chains have come on the scene. Our favorite? Country Star restaurant.<p>
PSYCHIC-PETS NETWORK. The American Veterinary Medical Association recently approved new guidelines that include alternative medicine -- such as acupuncture and massage therapy -- for pets. <p>
GUILT-FREE FUNDS. The politically correct craze continues. According to Lipper Analytical Services, since 1991 the number of socially conscious mutual funds -- those investing in companies that benefit social and environmental causes -- has soared 243 percent to 48. <p>
ACCLIMATION INCENTIVE. Sure, moving can be traumatic. But if it's a corporate transfer, adjust or pay. According to research firm Runzheimer International, since 1990, 25.9 percent more companies demand that transferees repay moving expenses if they leave the company within six months to a year. <p>
WHAT A DOLL. Feminism seems to be lost in the toy department. According to the most recent figures from Mattel, the maker of Barbie dolls, worldwide sales of the blond bombshell have soared 40 percent since 1993. Not bad for a 37-year-old icon who's definitely getting better with age -- her 35th anniversary prompted a bevy of collector's editions. Wal-Mart reports that it sells a Barbie every two seconds. <p>
LIQUID ASSETS. Aerobics addicts and status junkies aren't the only folks chugging designer water. The International Bottled Water Association estimates that Americans drink 2.7 billion gallons of bottled water a year, up 151 percent from 1985. Experts say a fear of polluted resources is driving the trend, which has boosted annual bottled-water sales to over $3 billion. <p>
TIME-OUT. A recent study by Boston-based research firm Dalbar reveals that investors who use financial advisers spend four hours per month managing their money, while do-it-yourself types devote nine hours. <p>
MY BOSS, MY BROKER. Where to invest that bonus? Ask the person who signs the check. According to a study by benefits consultants William M. Mercer of New York, 75 percent of companies (up from 44 percent in 1993) now offer basic investing seminars to employees.  <p>
YOU CHARGE, THEY CHARGE. Don't sit on that credit-card bill; the coming trend among issuers is to punish the tardy. Citicorp and Capital One have already upped their cards' $15 penalty fees for late payments to $18 and $20, respectively. But there's more bad news. Expect grace periods to shorten to just 1 day from 5 to 15 days, says Bank Card Holders of America, a nonprofit consumer agency that tracks the credit industry.<p>

Twenty years after its much-ballyhooed bicentennial reissue, the two-dollar bill is back. The Federal Reserve, having let its stock dwindle to a two-month supply, has printed up and begun circulating another $153.6 million worth -- enough for five years. The Fed hopes the deuce can finally shake its reputation as the bill of choice at the two-dollar window. "The two-dollar bill has often been associated with gambling," explains Tom Bower, a numismatist at the Smithsonian. "Putting a two-dollar bill in the collection plate at church on Sunday indicated that you'd been gambling Saturday night." Fed spokesman Robert Moore has his own use for the tender, which could catch on. "A lot of times," he says, "I'll just go and get a bunch of two-dollar bills because they're good for tips." Especially the ones from your bookie.

"God, did I want to be a ballplayer," says Barry Halper. Instead, the 57-year-old New Jerseyan spent nearly five decades amassing the world's largest private baseball-memorabilia collection, now worth $42 million. "The collection is like a child to me," says Halper, who's anxious to sell the lot, which includes Lou Gehrig's first mitt, Babe Ruth's will, and 30,000 baseball cards, "I don't want it split up." To keep his treasure together, Halper has taken a novel approach to unloading it: He's hired investment bank Lazard Freres to broker a deal. "I know Lazard's a blue-chip company. They sold Viacom," he says. Lazard managing director Peter Ezersky admits the firm has never done this before. "It's an unusual inquiry," says Ezersky, who's courting companies capable of housing the collection in a hotel, casino, or theme park/restaurant. "Someone like Ted Turner could buy it, too," adds Halper. "But the people who really want it can't afford it."<p>

What do economic seers predict for the coming year? Perhaps a rash of free publicity, if they stray far enough from the crowd. And that, says Owen Lamont, an assistant professor of finance at the University of Chicago, appears to be the agenda of many economic forecasters this time of year. <p>
Lamont analyzed the year-end BusinessWeek forecasts going back more than two decades and drew some controversial conclusions. Accuracy grows significantly worse as forecasters become older and more established, he says. And these forecasters, along with those who have their own firms, make wilder calls. <p>
"I cannot prove why," Lamont says. "I think it's because they're making a name for themselves." Lamont points out that there's plenty of incentive to play Chicken Little. While forecasters who make correct predictions are often publicly lauded, those who err rarely suffer censure. <p>
A. Gary Shilling, former chief economist at Merrill Lynch, disputes Lamont's theories. "As forecasters grow their reputations, they are more willing to speak their minds," he says. Shilling, who is cited in Lamont's study as one of the attention grabbers, now heads his own money-management firm in New Jersey. "Those who never stray from the crowd never develop a reputation," adds Shilling, "so they're not in BusinessWeek."<p>

AMAZING MATH: WINE BY THE CASE. Saving money is often the best "investment" anyone can make. No alternative yields as much with so little risk. One of the examples I use to illustrate this point has evolved over the years. The first time I told it was in 1978, on The Tonight Show. It went like this: Say you bought a $10 bottle of wine for dinner every Saturday night, but could instead get a 10 percent discount if you bought by the case. You'd "make" 10 percent on the extra money you tied up. And you'd make it in just 12 weeks, which works out to better than a 40 percent annual return. Where else can you earn 40 percent tax-free? (Uncle Sam doesn't tax you for smart shopping.)<p>
As the years passed, I found that some people were having trouble understanding this example. Why is it 40 percent if I just got a 10 percent discount? So I tried explaining it in more detail -- only to discover that I had badly underestimated the payoff. What really happens is that instead of going to the store and spending $10 for one bottle you are spending $108 for 12 bottles -- $120 minus the 10 percent discount. Which means you are laying out $98 more than the $10 you otherwise would have spent that weekend. That extra $98 is your "investment." The $1 a week ($52 a year) that you save on wine is your "return." And "earning" $52 a year on an investment of $98 is equal to a 53 percent return, tax-free.<p>
This revised example confused people even more. That first $98 is gone, they would tell me, and now you have to come up with a new $98 to buy your next case of wine. My response: not really. If you were someone who planned to spend $10 every week on wine -- $520 a year -- and who would have loved to save 10 percent buying by the case but just couldn't scrape up the dough to do it, how much would you need to borrow? Would you have to go to a bank and ask for a $520 line of credit to be able to change your buying habits? No, you would need only a $98 credit line -- and even that you would fully draw down only the first week. In the ensuing 11 weeks, you would replenish it by $10 a week (the $10 you previously used to spend on wine by the bottle). Result? After 12 weeks -- when you'd finished that first case and needed to buy another -- you would not only have replenished the full $98; you'd actually have an extra $12 in your pocket (the money you saved buying by the case). So now you'd have to draw down only $86 of your $98 credit line.<p>
I know this example can glaze the eyeballs, especially if you've had a glass or two of the wine (it's a nice merlot, contemplative but not haughty). So now that you see where I'm headed, let me drive the point home.<p>
* To finance this change in habits, from by-the-bottle to buy-the-case, you'd need a loan, that first day, of $98. <p>
* Soon -- within 10 weeks -- you'd have paid the loan down to zero (because of the $10 a week you'd have spent otherwise, the old way).<p>
* Then, to buy the next case, you'd have to run your loan balance back up only to $86 in the 13th week, which would require even less time to pay down at $10 a week.<p>
* And so on.<p>
Over the course of the year, you're drawing on far less than the full $98 credit line, on average, to finance this change in buying habits. So the return on your decision to tie up that $98 at first, and then gradually less money, is actually much greater than 40 percent or 53 percent.<p>
If my friend who keyed all this into his Hewlett-Packard financial calculator is right -- and I've never known him to err -- it works out to an annualized 177 percent rate of return. It's still only $52 you're earning -- $1 a week by getting the 10 percent discount. But if you do all your shopping this way, it can mount up. (Now try explaining that in 40 seconds on The Tonight Show.)<p>
INVESTING IN AIRLINE TICKETS. Have you noticed that "nonrefundable" tickets are, in fact, refundable -- in that you can apply them toward other tickets? <p>
There's a $50 charge, yes, but that $50 can constitute an excellent investment. Take your best guess now on your next five round-trips. Suppose two of them come to pass. You're now left with three tickets you'll need to exchange. The cost: $150. The gain: fares that you can get only through advance planning, such as $300 transcontinental round-trips instead of the full-fare $1,400. Got your spring-break ticket yet? You should. And if you're not sure whether you'll be spending it in Denver or Daytona, buy your super-savers to both. Forfeit $50 for having the privilege of deciding what you want to do right up to the last minute.<p>
THE MARKET FOR CAVES. Have you seen what's happened to the prices of caves in southern Spain lately? A perfectly adequate two-bedroom cave that sold for about $150 ten years ago now fetches nearly $8,000, according to the newsletter International Living.<p>
Apparently, there are quite a few middle-class Andalusians living in caves that are complete with all the modern cave-veniences, including phone and fax. It kills me that I didn't think of this ten years ago, of course. For $200,000, I could have all but cornered the cave market. It's still intriguing, if only because these caves have a year-round temperature of around 60 degrees (perfect for storing your aforementioned case of wine). To see how you like it, the newsletter suggests blowing $500 to rent a nice two- to four-bedroom cave for a week. For more information, contact the Spanish Government Tourist Office at 666 Fifth Avenue, New York, NY 10022.<p>
GIVE UP ON RUSSIA? NYET YET.I continue to think that Russia, while speculative, represents a great opportunity. If the Templeton Russia Fund (TRF) should tank one of these days, I think I'd pick up a few more shares. It's risky, but not imprudent if it represents a small portion of the funds you earmark for long shots.<p>

Ambulance chasers, the joke goes, file suits before the blood dries. Medical Recovery Service waits until the ink sets. The Illinois-based company peruses hospital bills for overages, disputes the charges, and splits what's recovered with convalescing clients. There's no shortage of pain. According to a study by research firm Equifax, more than 90 percent of all hospital bills are flawed. The most common overcharges? Lab tests, X rays, and even surgical procedures that were never performed. The supply costs hurt, too -- such as the $11.50 box of tissues (billed as a mucus-removal system) and a $17 "mouthwash" kit made up of only a toothbrush, paste, and floss.

We all know about the ducking and jabbing that goes on in Wall Street's trading pits. But the three major stock exchanges -- Nasdaq, the New York, and the American -- don't pull any punches either. Not when it comes to courting companies as potential listings.<p>
The three-cornered ring is primed for sparring right now, due to the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent crackdown on Nasdaq's large trading spreads. A record number of companies have defected from that exchange, including <a name="NYSE:AOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15558"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>America Online</b></a> (which moved to the Big Board) and <a name="AMEX:FIZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13947"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Beverage</b></a> (which went to the American Stock Exchange). At the same time, Nasdaq has managed to steal 12 companies from the ASE.<p>
Brian Wilson, a Nasdaq vice president, downplays the inter-exchange rivalry. "We're not beating down the doors," insists Wilson. "Many companies approach us." The 204-year-old New York Stock Exchange, home to <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NASD:COKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13014"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, offers a similar line. "Eighty-five percent of the companies eligible to list here are already here," says NYSE spokesman Raymond Pellecchia, implying that the noble exchange needn't stoop to such measures.<p>
But those kid gloves may be padded with quarters; industry insiders claim that both the NYSE and Nasdaq employ "switch teams" of salespeople who woo companies listed with the enemy. "Sucking up to issuers is rampant," says a former Nasdaq employee, who refused to be named.<p>
American Stock Exchange chairman Richard F. Syron calls the NYSE "the toughest of street fighters" and talks freely about the scrapping among the exchanges. "Anyone who says they are not out there competing is living in a different world," says Syron, who admits to being an underdog in the war. With just 794 listings, the ASE struggles to compete with the NYSE (2,809 listings) and Nasdaq (5,430 listings). <p>
The American Stock Exchange also suffers an economic handicap. Golf outings and expensive meals often figure into the mating ritual. At the ASE, says a spokeswoman, sighing, "we don't even have Knicks tickets."<p>

						By Nick Ravo<p>
When Bob Pittman was a child, he thought as a child. In 1981, at 27 years old, he founded MTV. "I've always made a nice living off of understanding the baby boomers," says Pittman.<p>
In fact, he's never taken his finger off the yuppie jugular, though he's marketed products as diverse as amusement parks, movies, and real estate. And now, he says, America's largest generation wants to figure out this Internet thing. That's why he's flitted yet again: to <a name="NYSE:AOL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15558"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Online</b></a>, to head up the company's new division, AOL Networks.<p>
Many Net watchers scratched their heads over the hiring of a marketer for this job rather than someone more technologically adept. Pittman says this misses the point. "A lot of the people who cover AOL don't know who I am because they are technology people," he says. "But AOL is more like a media company than a tech company." What this service needs, in other words, is to be peddled to the right people in the right way.<p>
For someone who dropped out of college four times and never graduated, Pittman has an argot and rsum that would do a Harvard MBA proud. After selling MTV to <a name="AMEX:VIA"></a><b>Viacom</b> in 1987, Pittman founded Quantum Media. Two years later he became chief executive officer of <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner Enterprises</b></a>, where he resuscitated Six Flags Theme Parks. Before jumping to America Online, Pittman devoted just 19 months to Century 21 as CEO of the mammoth real-estate company. "I'm a junkie for a good turnaround," he says with a slight Mississippi drawl.<p>
Perhaps that was the problem at Century 21: The company was huge and healthy; there were no crises to solve. AOL, on the other hand, appears to need a savior. The day the company announced the hiring of Pittman, it also announced that it was taking a $385 million charge to write down outstanding expenses. AOL's stock closed that day at less than $26 a share -- a crushing $45 a share below its 1996 high. Increasingly, AOL is seen, especially by young people, as a starter kit for Internet users -- something to be used just until cyberspace becomes comfortable. Some 10 percent of AOL's seven million subscribers give up on the service every month.<p>
That's where Pittman comes in. His chief role at America Online is to increase and hold on to the service's subscriber base. "This gives me a real buzz, one that I haven't had since MTV," he says. He notes that TV viewing has plateaued for the first time in his lifetime and that on-line services appear to be the next big thing.<p>
Pittman is quick to dismiss the doomsayers, particularly those who scoff at AOL's reliance on its proprietary content. "AOL will do whatever makes AOL the best service," he says. He's clearly ready for a fight. "AOL's already got great growth potential," he says. "We just have to pour gasoline on the fire." He also lauds his new co-workers. "I've been on the AOL board for a while," he explains. "I like the people. They are creative." In short, according to Pittman, "AOL is number one."<p>
Pittman's Music Man enthusiasm may affect Main Street, but Wall Street thinks that there's trouble in River City. "AOL's a house of cards," says David Rocker of Rocker Partners, a New York money-management firm and short-seller of AOL's stock. "The paradigm has shifted. The name of the game is content, and the content is moving off AOL."<p>
Pittman, however, likens AOL to MTV, circa 1983. "There was a time when people said the same about MTV," he responds. "They claimed that there were only so many cable subscribers, so we wouldn't be able to make more money. What they didn't foresee was how advertising took off." Pittman expects to expand AOL's user base by marketing the service heavily. If he can get people his own age to subscribe, and stick around, it will be a lot less important if the newest MTV generation thinks AOL is uncool.<p>
As for his brief tenure at Century 21, Pittman insists he never planned to get too cozy in real estate -- he says he did what he intended to do and moved on. Fair enough. Who could expect the man who's responsible for corrupting attention spans worldwide to sit still?

IT'S ALL AN ACT. Who really gives a whoop if Whoopi Goldberg calls her friends and family via MCI? Not consumers, according to research company Video Storyboard Tests. A recent poll reveals that the public's approval of the use of celebrities as product spokespersons has fallen 39 percent since 1993. <p>
POLL VAULTING. What's on America's mind? The Gallup Organization reports that more folks are following public-opinion polls, up 34 percent from 1985. Unfortunately, Gallup is not sure what's behind this trend -- nobody asked.<p>
BUYING THE FARM. Who can afford to die these days? The National Funeral Directors Association estimates that the average cost of a funeral has soared 23.6 percent, to $4,624, since 1991. As a result, the sales of prepaid funeral packages are up 50 percent, and wholesale caskets are now appearing on the market. "Preplanning can save people 30 to 40 percent," says spokesman Michael Kubasak. "We plan for every other aspect of life. But we avoid the inevitable." <p>
HOME SAFE HOME. White picket fences may be quaint, but these days folks prefer a more secure barrier. Studies estimate that four million Americans now live in gated communities, and home-security-system sales are up 20 percent since 1991, according to the Electronic Industries Association.<p>
WILD CARDS. The number of debit-card users has soared 251 percent since 1992.<p>

						By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>
They say Texans make the worst enemies. If that's so, Senators Al D'Amato, Christopher Dodd, and Phil Gramm had better watch out for Karen Evans. "Investors are often victims without recourse," says the 48-year-old Dallas divorcee. "And lately, Congress has been absolutely no help." <p>
Evans believes she knows why. From her home office, she tracks political contributions made by the financial industry to members of Congress. A few pecks at her computer keyboard summon more than ten years' worth of data. For instance, from 1985 through 1995, D'Amato, Dodd, and Gramm received nearly $3.5 million(40 percent of their campaign funding) in financial-sector contributions. The deepest pockets include <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, and the American Council of Life Insurance. Evans believes that money appears to have had its say.<p>
In 1994 Gramm helped kill a bill that would have required giving investors more background information on their investment advisers and their advisers' compensation. D'Amato, as head of the Senate Banking Committee, endorsed a law that exempts companies from liability based upon their projections of future earnings. "Do I see a connection?" asks Evans. "Absolutely." <p>
**Evans aims to educate constituents of their politicians' stances on issues.**<p>
Evans wants the public to be aware of their politicians' stances on investor issues. She works toward this end by sending her research to watchdog agencies and news outlets. "Evans is uncovering a real problem," says Gerri Detweiler, spokeswoman for the National Council of Individual Investors. "The securities industry wields a lot of influence on Congress. The individual investor's voice is often drowned out."<p>
Evans became an activist after a close friend, M. K. Peterson, ultimately lost $5 million, in investments and legal fees, after his broker ignored his demands to sell stock in 1987. An NASD proceeding failed to hold the broker accountable. When Peterson died nearly broke, in 1993, his case drew Evans's anger out like wildfire. That ire keeps Evans, who works without pay and owns no investments, obsessed. "I've become somewhat of a recluse," she sighs.<p>
And not a very popular one. Gramm's press secretary calls Evans's theory linking contributions with votes a "gross distortion." Dodd's spokesman calls her charges "outrageous." But a recent confidential fund-raising letter from the Securities Litigation Reform Coalition, a group that represents financial companies, calls upon industry insiders to contribute to Dodd's re-election effort as thanks for his recent support of a bill that critics say undermines investor-oriented reform. "Senator Chris Dodd stood as the Senate's foremost supporter of the bill," the letter says. "Now he needs our help." When Dodd gets that help, Evans will know about it.<p>

						Your neighbors are boors, and deafening traffic rattles the bedroom windows. But, hey, what do you expect if you live in a condo overlooking the Charlotte Motor Speedway? When built in 1984, the 40 units were priced at $95,000 each. They hardly budged. David Letterman even roasted the flagging venture by sneering, "Are you going to let your kids walk across the street?" <p>
Today, however, stock-car racing appeals to the Southern polo set; those same two-bedroom abodes are valued at anywhere from $350,000 to $800,000 apiece. And the real-estate race is on. Georgia already boasts a trackside condominium development at its Atlanta Motor Speedway, replete with a swimming pool, ballroom, and complimentary race tickets. <p>
Early next year, the Texas International Raceway outside Fort Worth will unveil its own horsepower housing. According to spokesman Jack Lenhart, most of the two-bedroom condos are already taken. And for $450,000 a pop, you better love the smell of Valvoline in the morning.<p>

						Eat, drink, and be patriotic.<p>
By Melissa Jeffries<p>
All those political debates and empty campaign promises can be tough to digest. But thanks to New Amsterdam beer, we the people can wash that rhetoric down with Election '96 Campaign Ale. <p>
"We'd like this to be known as 'Ale to the Chief,'" says a spokesman from the beer company. Let it be noted, by the way, that New Amsterdam exhorts voters to sober up before they pull the lever: don't drink and vote, warn Campaign Ale posters and buttons. <p>
No need to worry about imbibing on an empty stomach either -- pick up a box of Kraft's presidential edition of macaroni and cheese, available in elephant- or donkey-shaped pasta. The patriotic grub debuted at the summer conventions. Now, how about some First Lady Alka-Seltzer?<p>

HOT WHEELS. Looks like Easy Riders are now easy targets. The National Insurance Crime Bureau reports that the number of motorcycles stolen annually has jumped 46 percent since 1992. <p>
SKY SPA. Flying first-class has reached new heights. Virgin Atlantic Airways now offers manicures and massages on domestic flights, while both British Airways and Air France feature private cabins in first-class sections.<p>
POLITICALLY INCORRECT. Don't expect a feminine touch in the upcoming presidential duel. A recent poll of about 1,000 political TV ads, by professor June Speakman at Roger Williams University, found that only 5 percent used a female voice. "As one consultant told me, the voice of God is a male voice," says Speakman. And the voice of reason?<p>
WORK RELIEF. Corporate mergers have become less risky for employees. A study by outplacement firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas reveals that mergers are up 23 percent since last year but that layoffs following these unions have dropped 31 percent.<p>
GOING FOR BROKE. The American Bankers Association reports that personal bankruptcies are up 21 percent since last year. <p>
TAKEN FOR A RIDE. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the number of odometer-fraud complaints by the purchasers of used cars has soared from 45 per month to 24 per week.	 <p>

Pack up that cooler, darlin', we're heading to Crater of Diamonds State Park to mine precious gems! Located in southwest Arkansas, Crater charges just four dollars for a day of jewel hunting in the United States' largest diamond deposit. And there really are carats in them hills. The Uncle Sam Diamond, the biggest sparkler ever found in North America at 40.23 carats uncut, was unearthed in Crater by a mining company in 1924. In 1975, W. W. Johnson of Amarillo, Texas, found in Crater what became known as the Amarillo Starlight, valued at $100,000. According to the park's superintendent, Michael Hall, an average of 16 diamonds weighing over a carat each are discovered in Crater each year. What do triumphant prospectors do with their quarry? Hall recalls one man who just took his stone home and traded it for a pickup truck. Yee-ha!

						Cash can come in handy when you break the law or your leg. At California's Huntington Beach jail, a pen that offers housing to pay-to-stay offenders, convicts pony up $100 (for the first night; it's $65 a night thereafter) for better food and bigger cells. City jails in nearby Fullerton and Seal Beach have similar programs. Meanwhile, the ailing affluent can go for broke. Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore has private suiteswith personal safes, fax machines, CD players, and catered mealsfor an additional $650 per night. New York's Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center serves high tea with live piano music and shrimp cocktail to those who pay an extra $250 per night to stay in its McKeen Pavilion.

"I've been cheated on change a few times when it comes to money," says Scott Marshall of the American Foundation for the Blind. That can happen because the U.S. is the only country with paper money that doesn't vary in size and color or have cropped edges to help those with imperfect vision determine its value. Dutch money (below), like the money of 22 other countries, even has braille-like bumps. Why the blind spot in Washington? The U.S. Treasury says that altering the size of bills would require a costly refitting of vending machines; perforations or cut corners would increase wear and tear. Congress is considering resolutions that call for a revamp that suits the sightless. But the $20 bill is scheduled for a face-lift in 1998, and it doesn't include nips and tucks as of now.

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> *401(k) UPDATE. Good news for the retirement-obsessed. According to Hewitt Associates, a management-consulting firm, 52 percent of American companies now offer daily valuations of 401(k) accounts over the phone, up from 18 percent five years ago. Just punch in your PIN. Investment choices are up, too--to six options from four.  <p> *WHO, ME RETIRE? Keyport Life Insurance, in a recent survey, found that 46 percent of those employed expect to work after retiring. That would constitute a real change in the economy: Only 13 percent of current retirees collect a pay check.  <p> *THE END OF AN ERA. Could this be the end of shopping as we know it? Procter & Gamble has begun phasing out cents-off coupons, because the number redeemed has been dropping--by 6 percent last year alone. In their absence, check your mailbox for more samples, which, according to the firm Target Marketing, 92 percent of us prefer over coupons.  <p> *TEEN GREEN. Off to the mall, son? Pick up a job while you're there. Since 1993, the number of high- school students whose main source of income is a job (their own, that is) has risen almost 10 percent, according to the National Endowment for Financial Education. The number of high schoolers dependent on an allowance, meanwhile, has fallen nearly 10 percent.  <p> *DOWNWARDLY MOBILE. The Dohring Company, an automotive research firm, reports that 49 percent of consumers--the highest percentage Dohring has recorded--would rather save money and buy a two-to three-year-old car than pay for a new one. <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> NO COOKIES  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> For Chris Gross, charity meant "giving to public television and buying Girl Scout cookies"--until the bombing in Oklahoma City last April.  <p> After the disaster, the 27-year-old California financial analyst donated a year's salary of $53,874 to seed a college-scholarship fund for kids who lost a parent in the blast. His employer, Applied Materials, and other firms also chipped in. About $700,000 has been raised, still short of Gross's goal of $1 million.  <p> During his year without pay, Gross says, he "ate a lot of cereal and pasta." Anticipating his first paycheck, Gross, a wind surfer, says, "I'm buying a new sail--and I won't feel a bit guilty." Send donations to:Children of Oklahoma City Scholarship Fund,c/o Oklahoma City Community Foundation, P.O. Box 1146, Oklahoma City, OK 73101 (405-235-5603).

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> THE BUFFETT WITH A BULLET  <p> By Ken Kurson  <p> What do you do when your father's fame practically marries your last name to his career? Well, you can run for president with the money your dad made. Or you can find something you love to do--and do it.  <p> Peter Buffett, 37, is Warren Buffett's third and youngest child, and a man refreshingly unoppressed by his genetic link to wealth and fame. For the past 18 years, he has quietly collected a string of credentials as a composer, arranger, and producer that impresse seven those who've never heard of value investing.  <p> "I went to public school in Omaha. Dad had a Volkswagen--not a lot of sitting around eating bonbons," says Buffett, who dropped out of college and, with an eight-track recorder in his San Francisco apartment, created his Independent Sound studio business.  <p> Then, perhaps showing something of his father's eye for opportunity, Buffett saw that "in the early 1980s electronic music was coming into its own. It was popular and cheaper and easier to do. I got into it."  <p> After recording and playing on some minor-league disco hits, in 1987 Buffett composed, produced, and played many of the instruments on his debut album, The Waiting. He followed that up in 1989 with One by One, which reflected his interest in the American West and Native Americans.   <p> Next, Buffett made his own break by calling in favors from friends of friends to get a copy of One by One to Kevin Costner, who had begun work on the movie Dances With Wolves. Buffett wound up scoring the music in the film's pre-dance scene and went onto score last year's eight-hour CBS documentary 500 Nations for Costner's production company. Buffett also scored several scenes for the 1995 version of The Scarlet Letter ("It was a lot of fun, but man, what a bomb").  <p> As for how the prudent billionaire viewed his son's decision to enter the hit-or-miss music profession, the younger Buffett says, "For as long as I can remember, he thought all three of us should do what made us happy. He was great that way." Buffett isn't surprised that his father has retained his down-to-earth reputation. "He is, essentially, the same guy he was 30 years ago. He'll ask me, What do you get paid for something like The Scarlet Letter?' Well, I got this or that,' and he'll be like, Wow, that's a lot of money!'"  <p> In 1989, Buffett moved back to the Midwest, to Milwaukee, where he built Independent Sound into a state-of-the-art studio, with clients including CNN, <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, and Cadillac.  <p> So what does this Buffett do with his money? "I don't have enough to sit back and figure that out," Peter says. "I plow what I've got back into what I'm doing."  <p> Buffett has a new album, Spirit Dance, arriving this spring. He's also touring on the strength of the 500 Nations sound track. "You should see it," he says, "20 people onstage and Douglas Spotted Eagle plays the flute."  <p> Incidentally, Buffett long ago sold all his shares in <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>, his dad's company, to fund his business. They "would be worth 20 million bucks" today, he says blithely. <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> BLUE-CHIP BOOKS -- A SELLER'S MARKET  <p> By John Kearney  <p> Books about money are supposed to impart financial wisdom, but some provide a financial windfall as well. In 1994, for instance, R. G. Klein of Wall Street Books in Los Angeles sold a 1934 first edition of the investment to me Security Analysis for $7,500. <p> Robert Rubin, an antiquarian bookseller in Brookline, Massachusetts, says that, increasingly, investors are "buying blue-chip books and want them to perform as blue-chip stocks." He notes that in 1954 first editions of Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations sold for $250 to $500, but today fetch $20,000 to $40,000. A firstedition of Thomas Robert Malthus's An Essay on the Principle of Population sold in 1980 for $12,815; in 1991, a comparable copy went for $52,500. And David Ricardo's On the Principles of Political Economy and Taxation, published in 1817, cost around $3,000 in the late 1970s, but is now worth $10,000. Even the first edition of Das Kapital ($300 in the 1970s) today runs up to $19,000.  <p> "The economic classics are an excellent investment," says Judith Lowry of Argosy Books in Manhattan. "There will never be a time when Adam Smith is a lesser author."<p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> BIZ-SCHOOL BRAWL  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> The nation's elite business schools reached their lofty status because their degrees are seen as tickets to a high-paying job. So what's a school to do if its recent grads aren't doing so hot?  <p> Massage the employment statistics, claims Alice McCarty Baxter, a former employee of Dartmouth College's Amos Tuck School of Business Administration. In a recently led lawsuit, Baxter says that in 1995 Tuck fired her for refusing to boost the number of graduates with job offers. <p>Roland Adams, a Dartmouth spokesman, calls Baxter's allegations"baseless" and motivated by greed. "Our gures are veriable,"he says.  <p> "She got fired for doing the right thing," counters Susanna Robinson, Baxter's attorney, who's seeking $500,000 in damages. "Those are damn important numbers."  <p> They are indeed. For example, in U.S. News & World Report's annual issue "America's Best Graduate Schools," published in March, job placement accounts for 35 percent of B-school rankings."There's a long history of schools' puffing data," says Robert Morse, research director for the issue. "None of the academic data is accredited."  <p> One way to inflate figures, says Andrew Adams, placement director at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, is to count only the students registered in the placement office. "C'mon, this is not brain surgery," says Adams, who bases his claims on Wharton's entire graduating class. "But everyone seems to have a complicated method for getting their figures."  <p> At MIT's Sloan School of Management, career-development director Ilse Evans says, "A business school falsifying data is like a company misstating its quarterly revenue numbers. That's bad news."

						By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Executive-compensation expert Graef Crystal calls her the woman who put corporate governance on the map. 
Warren Buffett says, "Sarah is hard to say no to." Sarah Teslik may not be a household name, but she's well known (if not well liked) where it counts -- in the boardroom. Teslik, 42, is the executive director of the Washington, D.C. based Council of Institutional Investors, a group formed by 20 pension funds back in 1985 to agitate for change at major corporations in which the funds owned stock. Today, the council represents 100 pension funds with $1-trillion-plus in combined assets, and Teslik still scrutinizes every company expenditure as if it came out of her own pocket. This Methodist minister's daughter, originally from Walla Walla, Washington, specializes in corporate exorcisms, too. When the stock of Westinghouse began a devastating tumble in the early 1990s -- the company's losses topped $5 billion by 1993 -- Teslik was instrumental in persuading <a name="NYSE:WX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11627"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Westinghouse</b></a>'s board to remove CEO Paul Lego. She also had a hand in the ousting of CEOs at <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>.<p>As if that weren't enough to earn her powerful enemies, she also speaks her mind -- with very little editing. Here is the shrewd and scrappy Teslik on what she's seen and learned in 11 years of fighting power with power.<p>On the new noblesse: "There is a star cult about CEOs that I find disappointing. They are a very sheltered group. They have lackeys who do their laundry, who arrange their corporate jets, who do their every little personal chore. Today's CEOs need lessons in courage and the nature of fiduciary obligations."<p>On those six-, seven-, and eight-figure salaries: "If you took the excesses of corporate perks, executive compensation, and personal rapaciousness out of their context and put them into another, you would find violations that border on the criminal."<p>On what goes on behind closed oak doors: "The only contact CEOs have with the outside world is when their boards meet with analysts and investment bankers. They'll ask the CEO questions to determine where the stock price will be tomorrow, but not where the company should be in 20 years."<p>On corporate DNA: "Genetic defects caused by inbreeding are nature's way of voting for big gene pools. The independent board is the corporate equivalent. Chairman clones on the board won't see problems the chairman doesn't."<p>On the most incestuous board: "<a name="NYSE:ADM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10124"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Archer Daniels Midland</b></a>. Of the 16 members, 3 are related to the chairman by blood, and most of the others have financial or business ties to him. It is outrageous, immoral, and bad management to put one's family members on any board or entangle a board member with a financial connection."<p>On why she took the job: "Back in the mid-'80s, shareholders were getting screwed. Hostile takeovers were common. Customers have contract rights, employers have contract rights, bondholders have contract rights, and taxpayers have voting rights. But shareholders had no rights. Back then, few public or union pension funds had ever filed shareholder proposals."<p>On why she hasn't sold out: "This is people's grocery money and jobs we're fighting for. Once, pension funds were asleep at the switch. Now we use the power of our purse to raise issues and embarrass corporations in the media. It is just plain wrong to take $100 million from a company in salary and lay off a hundred workers."<p>On watching her back: "We have terrifically large enemies with a lot of clout who are watching us to make a misstep. For example, I was told that <a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Time Warner</b></a>'s chairman, Gerald Levin, 'wants to get me.' What's he going to do, have me killed?" (A spokesman for Levin says, "Her comment is totally off the wall, absurd, and ridiculous.")<p>On why she has made such a powerful enemy: "They're too arrogant at Time Warner. They're not careful enough with their money. They reserve 17 percent of the whole company for employee stock-based compensation."<p>On whom she identifies with, as a survivor: "Yasser Arafat, because he is famous for taking on the state of Israel for 20 years and for being able to say no to people, as I do with big corporate executives. 
Yet he's still alive. That's extraordinary."<p><p>

						By Robert Bentley<p>In Hollywood, where you're only as good as your last deal, folks are always pawing through their Rolodexes. Especially those who are locked into a pyramid scheme that has spread faster than a Joe Eszterhas script.<p>The scheme, dubbed Friends Helping Friends, has spawned countless others and become the buzz in entertainment circles. The fact that soliciting money for so-called endless chains is illegal hasn't deterred interest. Chardonnay-and-canap parties, held in Hollywood Hills mansions, have become venues for anyone willing to join in. Entry fees range from $100 to $5,000. Either way, the same rules apply: Each player must recruit other participants to move up to the next slot. The process repeats until that player reaches the pinnacle and collects the big prize, which can be as much as $40,000.<p>Pyramid pushing on the job has become a heated issue. After an in-house investigation, one <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony Pictures Entertainment</b></a> employee was red recently and another resigned for pyramid networking on company time, and a memo warning all studio workers to steer clear of the scheme followed. A similar missive circulated at CBS's Television City.<p><a name="NYSE:TWX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11482"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warner Bros.</b></a> has had pyramid problems, too. Allegedly, jobs on the studio's hit TV series ER went to extras who joined the scheme. Warner execs denied the claims, and the Screen Actors Guild nosed around (it found "no evidence of widespread abuse," according to a SAG spokeswoman). Nevertheless, Warner Bros. quickly issued a memo threatening to terminate Friends Helping Friends players.<p>The Los Angeles City Attorney's Office has convicted eight people involved in Friends Helping Friends schemes; all eight have received 90-day jail sentences. "It's a nice title," says prosecutor Don Kass, "but somebody always gets screwed." Just like in a Joe Eszterhas script.<p><p><p>

						By Jim Melloan<p>Relocating employees can be a bear, especially when it comes to creature comforts. According to a nationwide survey by the research firm Runzheimer International, the corporate policy on pets knows no limits. And Michael Jackson isn't the only wacko, with his llama farm and pet chimp. Along with dogs of every size and description, companies have transferred a live gorilla, a pack of mink, a dolphin, a pair of alligators, 50 cats belonging to one family, and a 500-gallon aquarium. One executive even persuaded his company to relocate a huge rock -- it was his dog's favorite pit stop. "If it's not illegal and not unethical, we'll move it," says Betsy Roche of Connecticut-based PHH Relocation. Yeah, but what if it bites?<p><p><p>

						In 1926, a man could get a good suit for $50 and a seat on the New York Stock Exchange for $133,000. David Granger, then 22 years old, bought both.<p>"I'm the senior member," Granger simply says of his 
70-year tenure on Wall Street, where he's the longest-serving
current member of the NYSE. At 93, Granger still puts in at least six hours a day at the investment firm Ingalls & Snyder, where he manages nearly 100 accounts for clients, some of whom have been with him for 40 years or more.<p>Not a bad run for someone who claims he "was propelled" into making Wall Street a permanent address. After graduating from Yale in 1924, Granger did his postgraduate work at Cambridge University. There he studied under John Maynard Keynes, whom he refers to as his mentor. When Granger returned to New York, his father put up the stake money for him to join his two older brothers on Wall Street. Together, the siblings founded Granger & Co., and as the youngest, David was sent to trade on the floor. "It was a different world then," Granger says. "Today, far more of the traders are ex-clerks, and there's a mad scramble for profits. Back then, we'd sit around for days and do maybe a few hundred shares."<p>Granger recounts his first brush with a blue chip. "One day I was asked to lunch by an <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> board member," he says. "It had to be around 1930. He told me that IBM was not going to expand its plant in upstate New York. So I bought some, because of his wonderfully conservative stick-to-our-knitting story. Obviously, I bought it for all the wrong reasons." Nonetheless, he still made a tenfold gain when he sold his shares.<p>These days, Granger seldom visits the trading floor, and his seat is leased to a whippersnapper of the scrambling variety. But he remains passionately protective of his clients, whom he calls "friends," and takes pride in staying abreast of news that may affect their holdings. "I'm not an analyst," he says, "but I read a great deal about the companies I follow. A lot of investing is spontaneous, emotional."<p>Retirement has yet to cross his mind. Granger says he is determined to continue "investing for my friends and increasing their capital." His 70th anniversary with the stock exchange came and went last February with no acknowledgment from the NYSE. "They used to hand out 25-year and 50-year certificates," he says. "People now are too busy. They should think of it, but they don't." <p><p>

						By Melissa Jeffries<p>The price ain't right at most hair salons and dry cleaners -- at least not for women, who usually pay more than men do for like services. The vendors say this is justified: Female tresses take more time to cut; women's shirts don't fit on the presses and must be ironed by hand. But that argument doesn't fly in California, where a new law requires that comparable unisex services (including manicures, which often cost up to $10 more for men) be priced the same. A similar bill is being considered in New York, and its supporters hope to bring it before the legislatures of every state. Expect Adam and Eve to face off. "I only get 10 to 15 women's shirts a month. I'm not buying a $6,000 press just for that," snaps Ishves Naik of Atlanta's Esquire Cleaners, which charges women up to $2.10 more a shirt. Manicure, Ishves? <p>

						By Monica Corcoran<p>CHARGE DU JOUR. Booked a reservation at that fancy French bistro but didn't show? Prepare to say "Au revoir" to as much as $25 per head if you gave up your <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a> card number to hold the table. Amex and selected restaurants recently tested the new no-show penalty, and more eateries could soon adopt the policy.<p>DOUBLE OR NOTHING. That's the cry of consumers looking for a real sale these days. America's Research Group reports that shoppers now expect a 38.7 percent price cut, compared with 21.8 percent in 1990. Apparently, discount diamonds are a girl's best friend -- 63 percent of jewelry buyers demand about 50 percent off retail. <p>HOUR TRIPPER. Expect fewer drivers wreaking highway havoc 
to get the rented four-door back in time. Last year, Value Rent-a-Car wheeled out hourly rates, ranging from 99 cents to $2.49 in most areas, and now some independent companies are following suit. <p>WHO'S J.? Georgetown Publishing House reinvents the trend in personalized marketing with an overly friendly approach. Hawking a $297 book titled American Speaker, the firm mass mailed ads that 
were affixed with a handwritten endorsement (right) signed by "J." Deceptive and annoying, sure. But not illegal, says Lesley Fair of the Federal Trade Commission's Division of Advertising Practices, which recently stopped the same company from endorsing the pricey tome with an ad that looked like a book review. Maybe J. wrote that, too.<p>MTV FINANCE. Generation-Xers are more than twice as likely to play the lottery as to invest, says a recent poll.<p><p>

						By Louis Jacobson<p>Until we were out of the woods, it was surrealistic," recounts futures trader Thomas McMahon. "We didn't know what to expect. After the first bombs went off, the adrenaline came up at a fever pitch."<p>No, not a typical day of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Recently, McMahon and 21 fellow traders headed off to Quantico, Virginia, to find out what it means to be one of the few, the proud, a Marine. The weekend was an even swap for an event late last year, when Marines visited the exchange to sample the trader's brand of split-second decision making. After testing their reflexes in the pit, the soldiers invited the traders to the trenches. And Marines take payback time very seriously.<p>At 0500 hours, a leather-lunged drill instructor roused the underwear-clad traders from their bunks by barking orders. "That was fun," recalls silver trader Andrew Stanton. "But only because you knew it was going to end." Next, the camouflage contingency marched to a field-command center, where Marine communications specialists re-enacted a battlefield scenario on a computer. The traders relaxed and felt right at home amid the hand signals and squealing radios.<p>Hours later, however, the real battle began. Face-painted, M-16-toting Marines briefed the traders on their next mission: Backing up the jarheads while they knocked out an enemy post. Bullets whizzed by as Marine gunners strafed the practice range with authentic machine-gun fire. Grenades shook the trenches. Not surprisingly, the traders took a highly conservative approach to combat. Not a one strayed from his safe spot.<p>But the chance to fire machine guns at abandoned tanks brought out the GI Joe in all of them. "They did outstanding," says First Lieutenant Christopher Lewis. "But I don't think any of them would trade their jobs for Marine green."<p><p>

						By Peter Aronson<p>Come August 16, the start of "Death Week," Elvisphiles head off to 
Memphis, Tennessee, to commemorate the King's passing. Folks in Fort Smith, Arkansas, hope to get their share of tourists, too. Elementary-school students there are raising money for "Blue Suede Cut Economics," a campaign to preserve Fort Chaffee's Building 133, where Elvis lost his pompadour to the U.S. Army in 1958. "I cannot believe I lived in this town for five years before I knew Elvis got his hair cut here," says schoolteacher Jan Honeycutt, who's also rallying to have the original two barber chairs reinstalled in Building 133. A small fee would be charged at the door. But no ELVIS SAT HERE sign will grace either throne. Alas, nobody knows for sure which chair bore the King. <p><p><p>

						By Monica Corcoran<p>You won't see a toothy blond caressing a refrigerator. Or hear about those lovely prizes. This is Debt, a new TV game show airing on cable's Lifetime Television, where the contestants want to lose. "They play against their debt," says Michael Davies, who developed the show because everyone he knows is in hock. "So the winner takes home nothing." Three contestants are matched by their fiscal woes -- ranging from credit-card burdens and student loans to mortgages -- and battle one another to be the first to wipe out their debt by correctly answering pop-culture questions. Losers get an apt parting gift: a savings bond. And plenty of empathy. "I have a beautiful home that's mortgaged, and I lease two cars," says Debt host Wink Martindale, who has given away many a dinette set in his time. "I know debt, too." <p><p>

						By Monica Corcoran<p>A STAR IS BOUGHT. As the cost of making movies continues to rise, so does the price of Hollywood immortality. Recently, the cost of installing a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame rose 50 percent, from $5,000 to $7,500. <p>WRONG NUMBERS. Apparently, the long-distance heavies--<a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a>--are reaching out and picking our pockets. Consumer Action, a San Francisco not-for-profit watchdog agency, reports that basic rates among the three carriers have jumped 12 to 17 percent in the past five years; a sampling of four long-distance calls made with Sprint--which upped its rates the most--increased from $19.56 in 1991 to $22.96 this year. Somebody better call Candice Bergen.<p>"LIKE, UM, FORE?" Teenage girls are totally teeing off. The number of girls aged 18 and under on the green has increased 73 percent since 1988. She-teens now make up  the most rapidly growing group among the female fairway set, reports the Ladies Professional Golf Association. <p>FREEDOM OF CHOICE. Feeling fickle about your 401(k) plan? Perhaps you can switch right away. A recent survey reveals that 35 percent of companies, up from 4 percent in 1989, allow their employees to change their investment choices on a daily basis. <p>REWIND THIS. Maybe it's those pesky late charges. Research firm Alexander & Associates says that video sales climbed almost 18 percent last year, while video rentals dropped nearly 9 percent. Plus, the average video rental fee increased to $2.61 from $2.50.<p><p><p><p>

						By Pual Lukas<p>Last year, the Educational Coin Company of Kingston, New York, began selling toy packs of 25 to 30 real foreign coins or 15 bank notes, with information on the language and monetary system of the source countries.<p>ECC's main business is providing bulk currency for promotions--Ralston Purina once bought 14 million foreign bills to give away. This is mostly what's called demonetized dough, decommissioned by inflation-ravaged nations, which frequently change their virtually worthless coins and bills. ECC treasurer David Laties, who says his firm keeps about 100 million pieces of currency on hand, hopes electronic money will one day replace cash, leaving ECC with a corner on cash. The toy stuff already costs a lot: $5 to $10 a pack.<p><p><p><p>

						By William Green<p>As status symbols go, it's hard to beat a Learjet. But until now, your typical plutocrat's chariot had an Achilles' heel, or perhaps head: A trip to the john on the Learjet 35 meant arranging some plastic panels around a spartan facility at the front of the cabin. In 1995, however, Learjet Inc. of Wichita, Kansas, unveiled the $6.7 million, 512-mph Learjet 45, its first totally new plane in over 30 years. And the toilet is glorious.<p>Kip Harkness, who designed the jet's interior, waxes lyrical about the loo's "harmonious feel," "biomorphic flowing shapes," and calfskin-covered cabinet with "a hardwood trim that dances around the border." About $20,000 more buys 24-karat gold-plated sinks and fixtures. The rest room can even seat a passenger when the eight swivel chairs in the cabin are full. "Not somebody's first choice," says Jeff Miller, Learjet's PR director, "but it's probably not that unpleasant as long as no one else needs the lavatory." <p><p><p><p>

						By Ken Kurson<p>Americans bemoan the ubiquity of advertising, but we're mere babes in the woods. Great Britain, for example, sells ads on its postal cancellations, hawking everything from Nestle's Kit Kat bar to a radio station. New Zealand once put ads on the glue side of stamps. But you won't soon see the Pepsi logo on U.S. mail, says the New York Philatelic Foundation. Only not-for-profit companies, such as Easter Seals, have appeared on mail here. "In 1981, the U.S. considered it, with Barry Goldwater championing the idea," says the foundation's William Crowe. But Congress vetoed the proposal, dooming that attempt to lick the budget deficit. <p><p><p>

						By Elizabeth Macdonald<p>Ready money" is the most reliable friend in American politics, said Senator Phil Gramm at the start of his failed campaign for the Republican presidential nomination.<p>He's right. Whatever else a candidate needs these days, money--lots of money--is first on the list. How else to pay for months of TV attack ads?<p>In fact, the two major political parties are, among other things, permanent fund-raising operations, laboring to keep the coffers filled so that candidates around the country can be financed. <p>Getting hold of voters' cash is a crude business, as described in an article in Roll Call, a twice-weekly Capitol Hill newspaper. The article showed how the Republican National Committee squeezes contributions from senior citizens (average age 54). The GOP depends on this group for much of the $9 million it raises annually over the phone, says the RNC's press secretary, Mary Crawford.<p>"Don't let the donors ramble on and on about their bills, sick spouse, or problems with the government. Move carefully and purposefully, keeping the subject of the conversation on money." These and other helpful hints are part of the RNC's handbook for telemarketers, which adds, "You deserve their attention, not complaints about invasion of privacy."<p>RNC fund-raisers must make at least three demands for money during a call, and they are exhorted to "think big and ask for a lot." Indeed, they must pull in at least $250 per hour, or they get the boot. That's a tough benchmark: The RNC's average contribution is $43.<p>One former RNC telemarketer, Andrew Beadle, 27, told Worth that he quit last March because "the RNC was exerting way too much pressure on senior citizens. It made me feel kind of slimy."<p>The American Association of Retired Persons and the Gray Panthers are unaware of any complaints (political fund-raising outfits are not federally regulated). But Gray Panthers executive director Dixie Horning says, "If that was their mother, they would probably get angry and tell her to hang up."<p><p><p><p>

						By Monica Corcoran<p>"Twenty years of schoolin' and they put you on the day shift," Bob Dylan sang in the 1960s, but it's today's reality for many college students, whose diplomas may be worth a lot less than they cost. <p>This is making it tougher for many schools to fill their classes. "There are about 1,600 private four-year colleges," says Morton Schapiro, economics professor at the University of Southern California and co-author of Keeping College Affordable. "How many have lines of high-quality, affluent students waiting to get in? A generous answer is 50." <p>Some schools are using marketing to help bring in good applicants. St. John Fisher College in Rochester, New York, for example, is offering a kind of money-back guarantee on its four-year $40,000 tuition. If students sign up for the "Fisher Commitment" and can't find a job within six months of graduation, the college will pay them $400 per month--up to a maximum of $5,000. The fine print: Students must graduate with a 2.75 grade-point average or better, have developed a career plan with their counselors, and do a job-related internship. <p>"We decided to put our money where our mouth is," says William Pickett, president of the college. <p>Fisher isn't alone. At Clark University in Massachusetts, undergraduates with at least a 3.25 GPA are entitled to a year's free tuition toward a master's degree. "That could be a savings of up to $50,000 [on] the cost of an advanced degree," says provost Roger Kasperson. Pennsylvania's Lehigh University has a similar program. <p>"Private colleges have to be more creative about attracting students," says Russell Edgerton, president of the American Association for Higher Education. "We're going to see a lot of ingenious marketing, given the current competitive climate."<p>This fall, Ohio's Muskingum College is slashing its tuition 29 percent to $9,850, and North Carolina Wesleyan College's tuition will fall 23 percent to $11,650. Drake University of Iowa guarantees tuition increases won't exceed the consumer price index, or 3 percent.<p>Not everyone thinks these deals will work. "People get the sense that this is the school's last gasp," remarks David Breneman, author of Liberal Arts Colleges: Thriving, Surviving, or Endangered? and dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia. <p>By contrast, he says, "some folks would mortgage their grandmother if they could get their kid into Harvard." Even Harvard, though, at $28,896 a year, kept the 1996 tuition rise to 4.8 percent, the lowest since 1969. <p>So competition is coming to campus. Can frequent-flier miles and free cable TV be far behind? <p><p><p><p>

						And you thought the tickets to the Olympics were expensive<p>By Tom Nawrocki<p>Sure, you can buy a program or sweatshirt, but how can you really show your allegiance to the Summer Games in Atlanta? By plunking down 50 grand for a set of five commemorative pins.<p>Each pin is 18-karat gold and slathered in diamonds, emeralds, sapphires, and/or rubies. Each reflects a different aspect of this summer's centennial games. Balfour, the pins' manufacturer, made only ten sets, and nine are still available: Former Atlantan and 1984 Olympic boxing medalist Evander Holyfield was the first to snap one up. The remainder are for sale at <a name="NYSE:SKS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=40406"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Saks Fifth Avenue</b></a> in Atlanta.<p>If $50,000 seems a little much, the pins are available individually for $10,000. But if $50,000 seems like petty cash, there's also a very limited edition set (one made) of platinum pins. The price tag: a cool million.<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>USED CAR<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Don't bother asking for a test-drive. This used car, the Bugatti Type 41 Royale Binder Coupe de Ville, is one of only six of its kind in existence, three of which are in museums. "We wouldn't accept an offer of anything less than $15 million," says Don Williams, a partner in the Barrett-Jackson Classic Car Auction. <p>In January, the 7,000-pound, 20-foot sedan went on sale in a silent auction at Barrett-Jackson in Scottsdale, Arizona. No payment plans allowed. Williams says, "There are only ten people in the world I can think of with the desire and the wherewithal to buy this Mona Lisa of a car."<p>Legend has it that this model, which was built in the early 1930s by designer Ettore Bugatti, earned its noble title by default. The cars were presented to royalty, including, it is said, King Carol II of Romania, because even the profligate refused to pay $42,000 for a car originally built with no headlights. "Call it an early Edsel," says Andy Rheault, secretary and registrar of the American Bugatti Club. "It's not very practical." <p>And though a Sunday drive with the family might be snug in a cab that seats just two, those bulletproof rear and side windows are a nice touch, and the Royale's eight-cylinder, 300-horsepower engine will take you up to 125 miles per hour in top (third) gear. As for mileage, don't ask.<p>Of course, a fender bender would cost you a second mortgage. "C'mon, you wouldn't dare drive that car anywhere but in your own driveway," says William H. Smith, executive director of the Antique Automobile Club of America.<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>HOW LIZZIE GOT HER CARRIAGE<p>By Carol A. Schatz<p>In 1892, Lizzie Borden, as every child knows, gave her mother 40 whacks (and her father 41) in Fall River, Massachusetts. Following a trial at which the defense argued that Lizzie was the innocent and upper-class victim of overeager Irish cops, Borden was acquitted of the ax murders in less than an hour. However, history, like the popular nursery rhyme, has rendered a different verdict: that she was, in fact, a parricide.<p>Why, then, did she do it? A compelling new documentary by filmmaker Immy Humes, who was nominated for an Academy Award for A Little Vicious, her 1991 film about a dog on death row, suggests one straightforward motive: money. "This is a story about her getting hers," says Humes.<p>To make Lizzie Borden Hash & Rehash, Humes interviewed dozens of crime experts and Borden buffs. Among other things, she discovered that Lizzie had a stingy father, Andrew, and believed that her stepmother was out to steal her inheritance. <p>Andrew was a poor relation in a rich family but eventually made himself into one of Fall River's wealthiest men, first as an undertaker and later as a real-estate investor. It seems, however, that he never overcame his experience of poverty; for though Lizzie was given a genteel education and socialized with her wealthy cousins, she lived in a house without plumbing in a shabby part of town__and she had no carriage. Thirty-two years old at the time of the murders, "she was living below her means," says Humes, "and got sick of it."<p>Of course, there are other theories to explain why Lizzie chopped her way into history, says Humes. Andrew could be violent (he once decapitated his daughter's pigeons after neighborhood kids tried to steal them), and the doors of the Borden house were often locked and bolted, leading some to suggest the possibility of abuse or incest. <p>Happily for murder connoisseurs, no theory is ever likely to provide conclusive proof. As for Humes, she reserves her greatest distaste for the many people who believe that Borden was guilty and yet are still understanding. "What I think is suspect," says Humes, "is how sympathetic most people are to [her], as if there's something criminal in her father being a miser."<p>In the end, free of her father's parsimony and also in control of his fortune, Borden bought a mansion in the nice part of town__complete with four bathrooms, two servants, and a car and chauffeur. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>GREEN MAGIC<p>By Melissa Jeffries<p>Barrie Dolnick, a former ad executive turned mystic (and a Gemini), has written Simple Spells for Success (Crown), which will "bring positive results to any endeavor." <p>Dolnick's New York firm, Executive Mystic, sells this otherwordly advantage to businesspeople, for whom she has concocted spells and "Power Bundles" to attract investors and deals. She also provides tarot-card business projections. <p>Dolnick offers Worth readers this spell to attract money:<p>On a Friday during a waxing moon and in the second hour after sunset, light a green candle. Place yellow roses in a vase with water. Dab one of the following scents on the candle: poppy, honeysuckle, or almond. Place a bunch of grapes next to the candle.<p>Say aloud: I draw in the eternal flow of prosperity to connect with me on this Venus evening. I call in fire, earth, air, and water to manifest abundance around me. I affirm I am open to all forms of prosperity, and that it comes to me easily and readily. I ask that I be guided to use this gift within the greater good. <p>So be it. And so it is.<p>Blow out the candle. Eat at least one grape. Repeat as desired during any waxing moon. <p><p><p>

						By Ken Kurson <p>As he surveyed the sea of black faces at last fall's Million Man March, the only color Kelvin Boston saw was green. "It's time," he says, "for blacks to take a good look at ourselves and the whole enterprise system."<p>The 41-year-old Boston, author of the recently published Smart Money Moves for African Americans (G. P. Putnam) and host of the cable-television show The Color of Money, is a star in the booming business of providing financial advice to America's 32.5 million blacks. The work is also something of a crusade__a 1990s-style civil-rights movement for a man who exemplifies its potential.<p>Boston was born in the projects of Wilmington, Delaware. He remembers that "others had more things__beautiful cars and lovely homes. Most blacks were told in church that money is the root of all evil, but I didn't believe that God intended for all blacks to be poor."<p>After graduating from predominantly black Lincoln University outside Philadelphia, with a B.A. in English literature, Boston landed a job as the liaison between the Wilmington mayor's office and the city's community groups. Working with the black poor, he saw that "the civil-rights leaders were talking about economic priorities [as] a class issue. But I realized it's an individual issue. We needed to reach heads of families, not heads of rallies."<p>Eight months later, in 1980, Boston headed for Toledo, Ohio, and enrolled in IDS/<a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>'s financial-planning program. Though "intimidated by finance and my classmates," he completed the course and by 1985 rose to become the company's Midwest manager for financial planning.<p>Boston counseled hundreds of families (most of them black) in Toledo, and discovered that, along with his race, his facility with numbers and knack for punctuating financial advice with biblical quotations helped him reach people mistrustful of the largely white financial-services industry. In 1988, Boston moved to Detroit, a city that was bleeding services and expertise as whites fled to the suburbs. There he created Financial Insight, a cable-access program for black investors that combined Boston's relaxed manner with tough talk about the importance of investing. Rechristened The Color of Money, it won the backing of the Detroit PBS station and the Black Entertainment Television cable network. Today, it airs on more than a hundred PBS affiliates and reaches more than 53 million people. <p>Boston's eponymous Boston Media Inc. produces and syndicates The Color of Money, and he owns 50 percent of Corporate Detroit, publisher of Corporate Detroit magazine. He will launch The Color of Money Journal, a "wealth-building magazine for people of color," early in 1996, and has signed with Bloomberg Business News to produce the Bloomberg Color of Money Business Index, which will track black-owned firms.<p>On television and in his book, Boston offers a general primer on personal finance and takes on some sensitive issues. For example, he writes of the inferiority felt by many black entrepreneurs in the presence of whites. He calls it the "white man's ice is always colder" syndrome and says African-Americans must free themselves of this "utter nonsense" or fail.<p>Young blacks, he says, are increasingly aware of the importance of finance. "You go into the black sororities, clubs__black wealth is what's on their minds. They want their chunk of the American dream. The economic-rights movement is what people are talking about in the 'hood."<p>Still, while median income for black families is about half that of white families, their net worth is just 10 percent that of white families. To erase this disparity, Boston preaches "the Power of Ten. Take 10 percent of your income and invest it in instruments likely to produce 10 percent returns and make a commitment to do so for ten years."<p>Boston adds that there is a growing number of black-owned or -affiliated companies. "A lot of Americans have made money with black companies and black-owned mutual funds," he says. "Unfortunately, most of those Americans aren't black."<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>THE (REALLY) BIG BOARD GAME<p>By Nick Ravo<p>In real estate, everything is location, location, location. No surprise, then, that Monopoly can now be found on both CD-ROM and the Internet, the hottest piece of real (albeit virtual) estate on the planet.The Monopoly Web site is open to all, but to play on-line you need the Monopoly CD-ROM__distributed by Virgin Interactive
Entertainment ($39.95)__which was introduced last fall in a match among players at cyber cafs in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, and London. Players log on at http://www.monopoly.com to schedule games in the Monopoly Boardroom. Off-line, the CD-ROM lets groups play via a local area network (LAN), at a  single PC terminal, or against a computer opponent. There are more than 800 animations and a score with tunes from the 1930s, when the game was invented.<p>On-line Monopoly is available in English, French, and German; the Web site converts currencies and translates property names. For example, when a player in Manhattan sells Boardwalk and Park Place to an opponent in London, they become Mayfair and Park Lane. You need Windows 3.1 or higher and a 486/33 MHz computer with eight megabytes of memory; a quad-speed CD-ROM drive is recommended. Direct Internet and World Wide Web access through SLIP and TCP/IP connections is required.<p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> MUSIC TO GET LUCKY BY  <p> By Gretchen Reynolds  <p> Of all the new music acts coming to Las Vegas, Dave Zabriskie's is probably the one that people will want to hear most. As a composer for WMS Gaming, a slot-machine manufacturer in Chicago, Zabriskie creates the melodies of jackpots.  <p> "In the old days, slot machines just kerplunked and pinged," Zabriskie explains. "It was dull, dull."  <p> Now the one-armed bandits toot, blare, and even talk. Take WMS Gaming's Western-themed slot, Jackpot Stampede. Players hear pounding hooves, braying horses, and cowboys yelling "Yee-haw." It's all set to a rollicking musical background that evokes, to the untrained ear, "Oklahoma." (Zabriskie says it's evocative of Aaron Copland.) The serenade sounds with every quarter a player drops into the machine, reaching its crescendo when someone hits the jackpot. Then lights flash and extra horns toot.  "It's sensational," Zabriskie explains, "but tasteful. You don't want to scare away the little old ladies."  <p> Of course, when it comes to a casino, "tasteful" covers a lot of territory. One of the company's other slot machines is Lucky Ladies, which is decorated with drawings of voluptuous 1940s sweater girls. The musical score is Glenn Miller's familiar "In the Mood." When three "Miss Firecrackers" or "Peek a Boo Sues" line up, the big-band sound bursts forth. For that, Zabriskie says, WMS did its own arrangement. "It's a really big big-band sound," he adds proudly.  <p> Zabriskie's serenading slots have proved popular in Atlantic City and also in the Midwest, but until late last year, WMS did not have a license to operate its machines in Las Vegas. James Jackson, senior vice president of gaming operations at WMS, is confident that the company's slots can make it in the big leagues."We give people fun," Jackson says. "If they don't hit the jackpot, well, then they get to hear some good-quality music. That's a fair trade, we think."  <p> Zabriskie has been with WMS for ten years now, ever since completing his doctorate in music composition at Northwestern University. In his spare time, he also composes classical symphonies for the Evanston Symphony in suburban Chicago.   <p>  <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> MICROSOFT ALUMNI:  A WEALTH OF OPTIONS <p>You know the two billionaires:  here's what's become of the other nine  <p> By Jane Birnbaum  <p> Long before  Bill Gates began hobnobbing with Warren Buffett and guest-starring on David Letterman, the now mighty  <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft Corp. </b></a>consisted of a ragtag group working away in Albuquerque, New Mexico. In 1978, just before the company moved to the Seattle suburbs, the staff gathered for the company photo that appears on the following page. Of the 11 faces in the photograph, 2 are familiar: Gates, who is famously wealthy, and Paul Allen, the company co-founder, who is nearly as rich and famous as Gates. As for the rest? Almost all of them cashed in on those celebrated Microsoft stock options. But listening to them, you discover that money didn't drive these folks then, and  it doesn't now. <p> Marla Wood says, "I kind of kick myself for having left Microsoft before it went public, but staying wouldn't have been worth it. There was so much tension." Wood, 40, was originally enlisted to do part-time filing; later she became office manager. Today she lives outside Seattle with her husband, Stephen. She's a "professional volunteer," a full-time mom of two, and leader of Girl Scout troop No. 163. She uses a computer constantly, finding it especially helpful for keeping track of her troop's badge requirements.  <p> Stephen Wood, 43, left Microsoft in 1980, long before workers received a stock option plan, but he did start buying and selling shares in 1985. Originally a programmer, Wood moved on to jobs at Asymetrix and Starwave, two of Paul Allen's companies. In1994, he founded his own company, Notable Technologies, which will soon produce a pager-like device to notify stock traders of portfolio changes and price and volume alerts. Wood says he's followed Microsoft's example by hiring high-energy people and giving them stock options. "A start-up is very high risk," he says, "and the way you motivate people who are very bright and capable is to give them a piece of it."  <p> Programmer Marc McDonald, 39, was Microsoft's first permanent employee, in 1976. He left in 1984 because of a "corporate attitude that sucks people dry and throws away the husk," he says. As for the stock options, "you take a look at how much people were offered for the work they'd done. It was a joke," says McDonald, who works as a programmer for another Seattle start-up. Still, the options made him financially comfortable he has courtside seats for the Seattle Supersonics ("my biggest splurge," he says). They have also enabled him to speak his mind. "That's one thing I got out of Microsoft. I can say what I mean."  <p> Former Microsoft technical writer Andrea Lewis, 47, says, "Working with Bill and Paul was great because you always knew where you stood with them. You had to move fast, but you always knew where you stood." She left Microsoft in 1983 and exercised about two years' worth of stock options. Now living with her hydrologist husband in Seattle, she's at work on short stories and a novel."I have enough money so that I can go on calling myself a novelist for a couple more years."  <p> Programmer Bob Wallace, 46, left Microsoft in 1983 and exercised exactly one stock option, worth 450 shares. "I managed not to sell it, even when I was desperately in debt," says Wallace. Now that stock is worth $1.5 million. Wallace's latest venture is Mind Books, a direct-mail company in Sebastopol, California, that offers scholarly titles about psychedelic drug use.  "I knew in the 1960s that personal computers would become extremely important," he says. "And now these psychedelic compounds are the beginning of something that will be very useful."  <p> Robert O'Rear is a bona fide Microsoft millionaire. "I was fortunate to get the options and keep the options and exercise them overtime," he says, "and too busy to ever bother selling stock until it had accumulated a fair amount." Unlike most of the original team, O'Rear, 55, rode out the changes at Microsoft and retired two years ago. He now plans to spend more time with his brother on the cattle ranch they operate in their native Texas. "I'd hate to ever call ranching a business," he says. "It has its own category, I think."  <p> Freelance contract software engineer James Lane lives on secluded Seattle acreage, soon to include a dance hall, where he'll indulge his passion for the tango. When the 42-year-old programmer works, it's as a hired gun for start-ups. "There's an enthusiasm in the best of small companies that you rarely see in large companies,"he observes. "We had that at Microsoft at the beginning, and they beat it out of me." When he left in 1985 ("I wasn't happy with Microsoft, and they weren't happy with me") Lane exercised three years' worth of stock options. He says he's held on to his stock, and can quote the daily closing price down to an eighth.  <p> Bill Gates, 40, remains chairman and CEO of Microsoft.  <p> James Gordon Letwin, 44, rose at Microsoft to become an "architect," one of its high priests of programming. Three years ago he took an indefinite leave of absence to kick back with his wife in Seattle. "There's a dessert place here that sells a T-shirt that reads: life is uncertain; eat dessert first," he says. "We decided it was time to eat some dessert." Still friendly with Gates, he is advising on the construction of electronic systems for Gates's new house. Says Letwin: "Bill offered me money. But I thought taking it would be churlish, considering what we've been through."  <p> The day Robert Greenberg, 41, left his programming job at Microsoft in 1981, he received seven job offers. Some companies wanted to hire him "only to compete against Microsoft, but I didn't want to live my life for revenge." Greenberg, whose grandfather founded Coleco, later developed Intelligent Tee-Time Manager, software for golf courses. Years ago he taught computers to fellow students at Harvard, where he met Bill Gates.  <p> Paul Allen, 43, retired from Microsoft in 1983. Among his businesses: Asymetrix and Starwave.  <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> A LITTLE VALENTINE TO HARTZ  <p> Jim O'Gorman sent one of his valentines a little early this year. In this case, the valentine was a $10,000 ad in The Wall Street Journal in which he thanked his former employer, Leonard Stern, for 22 great years at the Hartz Mountain Corp.  <p> O'Gorman, who retired in late September from his job as a regional sales manager at Hartz, thought the ad would be a nice way of showing his appreciation to the company's owner. "I know Leonard is a billionaire," O'Gorman explains. "And what can you do for a billionaire?"  <p> Stern says the ad came as a complete surprise. His first reaction when he opened the Journal and saw An Open Letter to Leonard Stern' was negative. "I figured it was going to be an ugly complaint," he admits.  <p> Hardly. In the ad, which appeared late last year, O'Gorman praised Stern for "caring acts of kindness" and "concern for people." The boss was especially attentive when O'Gorman was diagnosed with kidney problems in March 1991. "Leonard called and said,Don't do anything until you get a second opinion,'" O'Gorman remembers. Stern flew O'Gorman from Atlanta to New York to see a specialist. A few months later, O'Gorman underwent heart surgery, and Stern telephoned several times to check on him.  <p> Upon his retirement, O'Gorman and his wife took a vacation, visiting Montana, Wyoming, and the Dakotas. "Now I've seen all 50 states," he says. He hasn't yet figured out everything he wants to do with his free time. "But I'm not going to sit around and watch Matlock," he says. "You know he's always going to win in the end, so that's a waste." <p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> BY ORDER OF KERNEL LUGAR  <p> By Louis Jacobson  <p> Like many Republicans, Senator Richard G. Lugar of Indiana says he favors shrinking the federal government except when it comes to popcorn. Lugar, currently running for president, is the force behind the Popcorn Promotion, Research, and Consumer Information Act, a Senate bill introduced in late 1995. Under the bill, the government would levy an assessment on popcorn processors to fund a  Popcorn Board, which would  be overseen by the Agriculture Department and charged with managing an "effective, continuous, and coordinated program of promotion, research, [and] consumer information" on popcorn (much like programs for beef and eggs). <p> Should the government be sticking an invisible hand into the nation's snack foods? Sure, if you believe the bill's claim that "the production and processing of popcorn plays a significant role in the economy of the United States." (Oh, it's not just a snack food anymore, either. In the stately legislative prose of the bill, "popcorn is an important food that is a valuable part of the human diet.")  <p> Lugar declined to comment on the bill for this story. But Andy Fisher, press secretary for the Senate's Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry Committee, cautions against underestimating the power of popcorn. "It adds value in rural areas, so it benefits rural development in popcorn-growing regions," Fisher says. They include Indiana, Lugar's home state, and Iowa. Hmmm, isn't there a caucus or something in Iowa soon?  <p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> A RUBENS?  HOT DOG!  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> As disputes in the art world go, this one's quite meaty. George Hormel II, the 67-year-old heir to the Spam fortune, claims he was tricked into buying some fake paintings. And the man he's accusing, Robert Peters, is no stranger to processed-meat products; he made his millions peddling Peters Wieners in the Midwest. <p> The feud, expected to go to trial later this year, dates back to July 1993. That's when Hormel and Peters, both living in Arizona, first met to talk about art. Hormel wanted to expand his collection. Peters had more than 200 paintings and sculptures to sell includingtwo paintings purportedly by Peter Paul Rubens and two by Maurice Utrillo. But there was a hitch, according to the complaint Hormel filed with the Superior Court of the State of Arizona: Hormel says he wasn't permitted to remove the four paintings from Peters's plush home to have them authenticated. In fact, he says he wasn't allowed any access to the art without buying Peters's house as well. Even so, after several viewings, Hormel and his wife agreed to buy the house and the art for $2.2 million.  <p> Now Hormel says he didn't get the Grade-A prime artwork he paid for. When he was finally able to have Sotheby's and Christie's evaluate the Rubenses and Utrillos, according to court filings, they turned out to be fakes. The Peters camp, however, says the works were sold as is. "Hormel's case is groundless," says Michael Gallagher, the attorney representing Peters. "The paperwork specifically had a disclaimer that said there was no guarantee of the art's authenticity."  <p> Neither Hormel nor his attorney will discuss the case, but Hormel's personal financial adviser, Allan Winter, says his client hopes to settle out of court. For now, the beef continues.  <p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> WALL STREET LOVES A PARTY  <p> By Christina Ohly  <p> It's time to deck the halls of Wall Street again. Whatever the state  of the markets, and despite a Scrooge here and a Grinch there, most folks in the financial world will have at least one thing to celebrate this holiday season: a party. Here's a survey of the ghosts of Christmas parties past and present:  <p> <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BEAR STEARNS</b></a> Chairman Alan C. ("Ace") Greenberg hosts a magic show for employees and their children at the company's Park Avenue offices. Greenberg performs tricks with eggs, peanut butter, and jelly. "A three-year-old once told me it was the best magic act he'd ever seen," says Greenberg.  <p> Over five December nights in its Wall Street atrium, J.P. MORGAN holds fancy cocktail parties--food from around the world, including French wines, sushi, and Russian caviar--for different groups of employees.  <p> When the DREYFUS CORP. was acquired by Mellon Bank last year, the holiday dinner-dance at the Waldorf-Astoria's Grand Ballroom was one of the first things to go. "The days of wine and roses are clearly over at Dreyfus," says one staffer.  <p> Neither LAZARD FRERES nor <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LEHMAN BROTHERS</b></a> throws a party--whether employees are naughty or nice.  <p> Chicago-based brokerage firm WILLIAM BLAIR & CO. celebrates with cocktails at the Mid-Day Club. Music is provided by William Blair's in-house band.  <p> Last year some CITICORP employees partied at the Cowgirl Hall of Fame in New York City. An awards ceremony featured the Orange County Award (for the biggest municipal-bond deal) and the Longest Deal (the winner received a sterling silver ruler from Tiffany). <p> At T. ROWE PRICE in Baltimore, pot luck departmental celebrations take place in one of the firm's conference rooms.  <p> PIPER JAFFRAY, in Minneapolis, offers its 2,800 or so employees a choice: 21-pound tom turkeys or 11-pound hen turkeys.  <p> FIDELITY INVESTMENTS throws a party for thousands at Boston's World Trade Center. The company provides food and entertainment; employees provide the laughs by performing skits in the "Fidelity Follies." At the various regional office bashes, attractions in past years have included karaoke and arcade games.  <p> FIRST INTERSTATE BANK in Los Angeles allocates $10 to $15 per employee; employees arrange themselves into groups, and then each group spends its holiday money as it wishes.  <p> SALOMON BROTHERS employees traditionally gather at Bridgewaters, a Manhattan restaurant. The Chicago office, after last year's soiree at Michael Jordan's restaurant, plans a sports-themed party again this year.  <p> Denver-based JANUS FUNDS hosts a dressy dinner that includes casino games. No money is wagered, but participants can win $50 gift certificates to such local establishments as Blockbuster Video, Chili's restaurants, and King Soopers grocery stores.<p>

						By William Green  <p> In the 1960s, the Joyce Chen Restaurant in Cambridge, Massachusetts, grew into a spectacular success. Local luminaries such as Julia Child and John Kenneth Galbraith were regulars, and Chen herself became a celebrity. As the host of her own Chinese cooking show on PBS, Chen introduced the American public to Peking duck, moo-shi pork, and other exotic delights.  <p> Her son, Stephen, was her dutiful assistant. At 13, he began packing take-out orders. At 16, he started driving the restaurant's employees home in the family's van each night. When his mother traveled to Hong Kong and Taiwan in search of new recipes, he left school and accompanied her for months on end. In those days, Joyce Chen's business flourished.  <p> Now 43, Stephen Chen is struggling to save his mother's business from a mess that he created. The trouble began in the mid-1980s, when Joyce Chen developed Alzheimer's disease. "One by one, things wouldn't get done," remembers Stephen Chen. "My mother would get lost driving home." When she acted irrationally, he would try to humor her: "She'd wake up at 5 a.m. and say, 'We've gotto go the restaurant.' I'd say, 'Okay,' and we'd go."  <p> When his mother's condition worsened, Stephen Chen assumed control of the business. He decided to set up a second Joyce Chen Restaurant, selected a site in Boston, and secured $1.85 million in loans by pledging his home and the restaurant in Cambridge as collateral. <p> If his mother had known what he was doing, says Chen, "she would have said I was crazy to spend so much money." But the Boston economy was booming and Chen thought he could profit from the area's revitalization. The project also appealed to him on a personal level: For the first time, he says, there was a "sense that maybe I could do something, too.... It felt good."   <p> His venture quickly hit the skids. Construction delays proved expensive; the Wang Center exhibition hall next door closed for repairs, depriving the fledgling restaurant of patrons; and Boston sank into the throes of recession. By 1991, the restaurant was $116,000 behind on rent and other payments. In 1994, Chen received an eviction notice. The restaurant was closed, and the property was converted into a microbrewery cum restaurant called Brew Moon. A few months later, Joyce Chen died at the age of 76, unaware that her business was near bankruptcy.  <p> Stephen Chen took the failure hard. "It was really a blow," he says. "When something like that happens, you realize how vulnerable you are." Worst of all, he adds, is a sense that he has let down his family. "I feel a little shameful," he says.  <p> The Cambridge restaurant is still serving customers, but Chen says the business is $1.5 million in debt. Part of him just wants to forget the debacle and move on. "To me, spiritually, I think I've paid enough," he says. Yet he still feels obligated to keep the restaurant open. "The idea," he says, "is not to let people forget Joyce Chen."  <p> Chen says he has come to believe that he devoted too much of his life to his mother's business. Now he's pursuing some of his own interests. He recently learned to ski and ride a motorcycle. And he's starting a family of his own. Two years ago, he married a woman he met through a dating agency, and they are about to adopt a baby girl from China. The baby's name is Mingxue, which means "bright snow." <p>

						 By Ralph Gardner Jr.  <p>
 I was eager to meet David Salz, president and CEO of western-hemisphere operations for Alfred Dunhill of London, the venerable English tobacconist and tailor. Dunhill makes the hearty, masculine aftershave that I use and my father used before me. (Dad's still around. But when Dunhill upped its prices a few years back, my father started diluting the fragrance with rubbing alcohol--even when he received it from me as a Christmas gift. He finally abandoned it completely.)  <p>
 I envisioned Salz as a Prince Philip type with impeccably tailored double-breasted suits, bushy eyebrows, and a wry, British sense of humor. I was frankly disappointed when I found him in shirtsleeves in his modest office above the company's Park Avenue store. He was on the phone, trying to sell a private locker in Dunhill's humidor to some guy from Goldman, Sachs. "Sign up before we run out," he was saying.  <p>
 When he got off the phone, Salz reluctantly admitted he doesn't use aftershave. "I have very, very sensitive skin," he said. <p>
 However, he did assure me that he shared my respect for the product--at least from the perspective of the company's balance sheet. "I find it fascinating that we can do $1.5 million in fragrance sales [at $37 for a 100-milliliter bottle] in ten stores when we don't promote this at all," he says. "It tells you there is huge brand loyalty."  <p>
 Dunhill sells two lines of its aftershave and cologne. There's the Classic, devotees of which include myself and Jerry Lewis. The comedian apparently applies the stuff liberally and is known to plug it on TV talk shows when interviewers question him about his aroma. Personally, I usually splash it on and then shower, a procedure that helps to mute its appealing but assertive scent. <p>
 There's also the newer, zippier Edition aftershave, which comes in a frosted bottle and has a fruity smell. Women are said to use it as well, and it accounts for a majority of Dunhill's fragrance sales.  <p>
 At the moment, the aftershaves are sold only at Dunhill stores and at a smattering of duty-free airport shops. But Salz thinks sales could expand dramatically with proper marketing. Among other things, that will require wholesaling the aftershave to retailers--for instance, Saks Fifth Avenue. "I would hope," Salz told me, "that a year from now when you and I meet, our fragrance business would be very much different than it is today, in terms of the seriousness with which we approach it."  <p>
 I kept my mouth shut. But I doubted that going wholesale was the right approach. I thought of the horror of walking through a department store and being ambushed with my own aftershave by one of those spritzing sales associates.  <p>
 Brand loyalty be damned. That'll be the day I switch to rubbing alcohol too.

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> SOME RANDOM THOUGHTS  <p> By Jack Egan  <p> In the new, sixth edition of his investment classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street, Princeton University economist Burton Malkiel argues once again that it's nearly impossible to beat the market. But for those who want to try anyway, we asked Malkiel--who has consistently outperformed the market over the past few years with his own private portfolio--for his thoughts on what's hot and what's not. Among his observations: There's a Warren Buffett bubble puffing up <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b>'s stock. Malkiel also thinks <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity's Magellan Fund</b></a> is "highly risky," having binged on tech stocks. So what does he like? Malkiel, a contrarian, favors down trodden real estate investment trusts, recuperating Japanese shares, and AAA-rated tax-free municipal bonds. "There's an assumption built into the municipal market that we'll have a flat tax, which is not necessarily true," he says. For devoted Random Walk fans who want to stick with index funds, Malkiel warns that the popularity of Standard & Poor's 500 funds may have inflated their value. He likes funds based on the broader Wilshire 5000.  <p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> SHOULD THIS MAN BE FIRED?  <p> By Jane Birnbaum  <p> Okay, so the perks aren't too shabby. Members of the Council of Economic Advisers get to dine in the White House mess, hang out with the Commander in Chief, and take an occasional jaunton Air Force One. So who can blame Joseph Stiglitz for shuttering his office at Stanford University in 1993 and accepting Bill Clinton's invitation to join the council?  <p> Indeed, reports Stiglitz, the food at the White House mess puts the Stanford faculty club to shame. And there's nothing quite like a flight on the president's plane, where there are no nagging flight attendants to interrupt high-level chats about the latest gross domestic product numbers. "The first trip, we were working as the plane was taking off," says Stiglitz, the council's chairman. "People were standing at a 45-degree angle and holding their meeting."  <p> Alas, those fabulous fringe benefits would all come to an end if House Republicans have their way. Keeping the three-member council in business costs $3.4 million annually. The House Appropriations Committee deleted those funds from the proposed budget, arguing that the White House could make do with economic advice from other agencies. That move has put the council's future in limbo, though it appears likely that an effort by Republicans in the Senate to help the White House save the council will succeed. <p> If the council is sacrificed in the name of austerity, Stiglitz will get by. No matter how good the White House chefs are, produce in Washington, D.C., just doesn't compare to northern California. And frankly, the pay of a presidential advisor doesn't measure up. Stiglitz's CEA salary is around $130,000--about half his Stanford salary and forgone consulting fees. There's no cushy expense account making up the difference, either. "When we have guests from abroad or bring somebody into the mess to discuss an issue, we pay for them ourselves," Stiglitz says.  <p> The council just can't seem to get respect. Part of the White House since the Truman administration, the CEA consists of economists on leave from the nation's top universities. They stand ready to give the president analysis on all things economic, ranging from the meaning of economic indicators to the potential impact of a proposed tariff. And since they aren't entrenched Washington insiders, it is hoped they can offer the president unbiased opinions. <p> But most people don't find that very exciting. Herbert Stein, who chaired the council during the Nixon administration, remembers people asking him whether it was even a full-time job. (It is.) "Many members of Congress are not aware of how the CEA works, and there's a negative attitude now about intellectuals of any kind," says Stein. "They say, 'Who needs them,' like the CEA is the National Endowment for the Arts engaging in pornographic activity."  <p> And how does the average American feel about the council? Brian Cox, a beekeeper from Ojai, California, favors killing it off because, he says, Clinton "has it in for bee keepers" by opposing subsidies that help them cope with cheap Chinese honey flooding the country.<p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> MISS AMERICA TALKS ABOUT INVESTING  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> Shawntel Smith, a 24-year-old Oklahoman, was recently crowned Miss America, a title she'll hold for a year. After that, she'll return to Oklahoma City University, where she's pursuing a master's of business administration degree. We decided to test her poise yet again by asking her about money, investing, and nondurable goods.  <p> Do you have any investments?  <p>No, I sure don't. But that will be something to consider in the future.   <p> Will you make more money now that you're Miss America?  <p>Yes, I will. I could make $250,000 over the next year. I will want to invest that money and put it in places where it could grow.  <p> If you did invest, where would you put your money?  <p>Well, we have some wonderful sponsors of the Miss America Organization: <a name="NYSE:FTL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11960"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fruit of the Loom</b></a>, Konica, <a name="NASD:WATFZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42015"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Waterford Wedgwood</b></a>, and Clairol. As far as learning anything from the Miss America Organization on investing, those are companies that I would strongly consider investing in. Also, I've grown up with <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> stores in my area, and they stand behind their products. I might invest in Wal-Mart.   <p> What else have you won?  <p>I also won $12,000 by winning the Miss Oklahoma title. I've competed in Miss America for six years and it's paid for my entire education. I foresee my scholarships paying for my M.B.A. and, after that, my Ph.D.  <p> Have you spent a lot of money on pageants?  <p>I've bought a dress here and there, but I never spent a whole lot of money. But I competed in the pageants to get the scholarship money, so I wouldn't shoot myself in the foot by buying an expensive gown. And of course, my family wouldn't allow it because that would mean I wasn't competing for the right reasons.  <p> What did your family teach you about money?  <p>My dad owned a small furniture business, so we always had to work hard for money. We never made money a big priority in our lives.  <p> What have your pageant experiences taught you about money? <p>Don't abuse it, don't spend too much, and save it. I've also learned that I should invest for a secure future and my retirement. Now that I'll be making more money, I'll definitely learn more about investing.  <p> Do you think the current state of the economy is good or bad? <p>I know that in my community in Oklahoma, we're doing pretty good. There's people purchasing durable and nondurable goods in Oklahoma. And as far as the nation, we're doing okay.  <p> Is there anything you want to buy with the money you'll receive? <p>Later on, I will buy my dream sports car: a red <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> Mustang with a tan interior.

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> SON OF SPAM  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> Axel Boldt likes Spam  if it's a cold dish in a Monty Python sketch. But when it's a force-fed diet of advertisements blasted over the Internet--a process nicknamed "spamming" by denizens of the Net--Boldt gags. So to fight back against overeager entrepreneurs in cyberspace, Boldt created his own World Wide Web page, which he calls the Blacklist of Internet Advertisers.  <p> Boldt says he was inspired by Larry Canter and Martha Siegel, two Arizona lawyers who earned notoriety last year for spamming the Internet's discussion groups with ads for their services. "I was in a bookstore, and I saw their book, How to Make a Fortune on the Information Superhighway," Boldt says. "I thought, I've got to do something about these guys."  <p> For Boldt, a 29-year-old student from Germany working on a Ph.D. in math at the University of California's Santa Barbara campus, that something turned out to be the Blacklist, a roster of the worst offenders of Internet etiquette. Attorneys Canter and Siegel were the first named to this hall of shame, and more than 50 others have since joined them.  <p> Simply advertising on the Internet isn't enough to draw Boldt's wrath; he isn't a purist trying to keep cyberspace commerce-free. Instead he's railing against advertising that is intrusive and indiscriminate. Sending unsolicited ads through electronic mailis one of his pet peeves. Another is burdening Internet bulletin-board discussion areas, called newsgroups, with ads for products or services that have nothing to do with the discussion's topic. For instance, take the person who sent an ad for credit card information to an animal-rights discussion. Or the folks at the Sound Healing Center: They spammed 61 newsgroups in order to sell "what Jesus Christ, Buddha, Shiva, and Pythagoras knew."(Price: $3.00.)  <p> Boldt says he doesn't advocate retaliatory spamming or other sorts of digital mayhem. "I'm not so much into punishing these guys," he says. Instead, Boldt encourages simply boycotting the businesses. That said, though, the Blacklist (located on theWeb at http://math-www.uni-paderborn.de/~axel/BL/blacklist.html) pointedly provides the names, telephone numbers, and computer addresses of offenders.  <p> Boldt plans to return to Germany after completing his dissertation,"The Position of Uniserial Modules in the Auslander-Reiten Quiver of Finite Dimensional Algebras," but he doesn't expect to escape the spammers, even though most of those on the Blacklist are based in the U.S. "It's much easier for a business or for a private person to get Internet access in the States," says Boldt. "But this will change, and we will start to see more non-American asses."  <p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> THE RIGHT WAY TO STIFF  <p> By Carol A. Schatz  <p> All hell broke loose just as the diners were about to tuck into their wild striped bass. The problem, it seems, was the bottle of 1994 Rioja. "This wine is undrinkable, and we can't have it with our dinner!" shouted one guest, shattering the genteel atmosphere of Solera, a stylish Spanish restaurant in midtown Manhattan. Another, examining the label with disdain, exclaimed, "What kind of grape is this?"  <p> Fortunately, this was only a test, not an actual food emergency. The indignant patrons were practicing how not to return spoiled wine as part of a workshop on obtaining better restaurant service. Twenty-five passionate diners--from a Wall Street futures salesman who called eating out his hobby to a physician who described herself as a "professional foodie"--paid $85 each for a three-course dinner with wine and well-seasoned advice from New York City service consultant Eric Weiss.  <p> Weiss, 45, has been in the restaurant business in one way or another since the age of 16. He normally runs service classes for the trade but recently decided to offer his expertise to the general public. The enthusiastic response didn't surprisehim. "I think I've hit a nerve," he says.  <p> And indeed, the assembled guests at Solera seemed in need of therapy for traumatic experiences had while dining out. Their litany of woes from various restaurants included dead flies on the sorbet, horse meat substituted for steak, and waiting-for-Godotstyle service. After Weiss invited the group to share memorable experiences, a young man recalled the time a runaway dessert cart plowed down his table as he dived for cover. The group sighed with sympathy."I'm afraid I've had more bad experiences than good, and that's why I'm here tonight," said one member.  <p> Unfazed, Weiss worked the group like a food-obsessed Phil Donahue, describing problematic restaurant scenarios and asking for possible solutions. "I used to get good service by using doctor' when I reserved," offered a wine consultant. "It worked. But then it backfired when somebody had a heart attack and they called me over." A real doctor dismissed that as no problem, saying that all one needs to do when that happens is to recommend calling an ambulance. "That's all I do," he said, "and then you usually get a free meal or a bottle of wine."  <p> That incited more recollections from the increasingly chatty crowd, forcing Weiss to quiet them all in order to get back to addressing their biggest complaints, such as enduring a surly waiter while trying to send a dish back to the kitchen. Weiss advised being honest, specific, immediate, firm, and gracious while returning food.  <p> Some of Weiss's other suggestions for dining bliss: get the name of the person who takes your reservation; total up the items on your check--waiters make both honest and not-so-honest mistakes; and send a thank-you note to a chef or manager if you've had a great meal. Practices to avoid, Weiss said, are forgetting to cancel a reservation; offering a gratuity to the maitre d' beforehand (most aren't comfortable being bribed); and antagonizing servers by snapping your fingers, calling their names, or tugging at their sleeves. And if you must return wine, do so graciously, and keep in mind that when it comes to very expensive bottles--or what one diner called "show-off" wines--it's caveat emptor. <p> The key to better service, Weiss concluded, is to act as if you were a guest in someone's home--a tipping guest, of course."If someone has been rude, I have no problem stiffing," he said."But you must tell the person in charge--the owner or the maitre d'--why."  <p> That posed no obstacle for a seemingly demure woman from Virginia. "Food matters so tremendously to me that after breakfast I start thinking about lunch," she said. "After lunch, then dinner. So if I go to a restaurant and things aren't good, I'm not quiet at all."

						By Diane Goldner  <p>
 A lot can happen in just under 400 years. Which is why Alicia Williams has some perspective on immigration to these United States.  <p>
 "It's fine with us," says Williams, a Katharine Gibbs graduate and genealogist who traces her own lineage back to those legendary immigrants, the Mayflower pilgrims. "The old idea about the melting pot of America, that you have to become homogeneous, it's changed now to the idea of a goulash: The gravy is the Americanization that keeps us together. But diversity is great. We aren't throwing ourselves across the portal.S If you travel across this country, you will realize there's plenty of room left."  <p>
 Williams, 48, was born on the army base at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. Today she makes her home in Hingham, Massachusetts, living with her parents in their ranch-style house. Hingham is about 30 miles from Duxbury, where Williams's forebear John Alden settled after arriving in Plymouth on the Mayflower. Alden was awarded 600 acres in the colony's land grant. But the land is long since gone--divided up and sold off piece by piece. "If we had 600 acres, we'd all be very rich," says Williams. "I only wish. It's a distinguished lineage, not distinguished money. There's a big difference."

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> BASKING IN THE HALL OF FAME  <p> By Ralph Gardner, Jr.  <p> Miss Hall's, a prestigious private school for girls in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, will deploy a not-so-secret weapon in its $10 million fund-raising campaign this fall: Trudy E. Hall, the school's head. Hall, 40, has a loquacious personality, a solid educational track record, and a jar of M&Ms that she forces on visitors. But when it comes to persuading alumnae to open their wallets, her most convincing quality may be the last name she shares with Mira Hinsdale Hall, who founded the academy back in 1898.  <p> The two women aren't related as far as Trudy Hall can tell, but many of the school's graduates don't know that. Alumnae--some of them old enough to remember the original Miss Hall, who worked at the school until her death in 1937--tend to approach her at school functions with enchanted expressions, Hall reports. Then they'll gush about how wonderful it is to have "Miss Hall" back at the old school again. "The assumption is that I must have the same standards she had for the school," Hall says.  <p> There were actually two Miss Halls prior to Trudy: Miss Mira, as she was known, and her niece, Miss Margaret, who took over the school when her aunt died. The latest Miss Hall assures us that she never tries to pass herself off as a blood relative:"My disclaimer is usually, Oh, but I wish I were!' "  <p> But Hall is leaving the genealogical door open just a crack. Trudy is of Scottish descent, as were her predecessors at the school, and Trudy's dad recently discovered some old family portraits that bear a striking resemblance to Mira and Margaret. Does Trudy share an ancestor with Mira somewhere back in history? The issue could be settled shortly; the Berkshire Historical Society, which Miss Margaret founded after her retirement from the school, isusing a recent grant to dust off and catalog the old Hall family arcana in its files.  <p> Useful as it may be drumming up endowment dollars, the Hall name does have some drawbacks. Particularly when Trudy Hall is checking into a hotel late at night and a smart-alecky front-desk clerk, looking at the address that she's written on the register, can't help pointing out that she resides at a school that bears her name. "At 11 o'clock at night when that happens to you, you're about ready to throttle the person," Hall says.

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> DEFENDING SWEET CHEEKS  <p> By Sharon Churcher  <p> Wags in Texas have suggested that when the inevitable TV movie is made about Anna Nicole Smith's fight for a chunk of her late husband's fortune, it might well be titled The Bimbo and the Brain.  <p> The brain in this case is Diana Marshall, Smith's Houston lawyer. A tough-talking redhead, Marshall, 47, was once named among the nation's top women litigators in a Time magazine poll. Until now she was best known for corporate work on behalf of such button-downclients as Tenneco and Texas Commerce Bank--hardly the obvious candidate to represent a former Playboy centerfold. But Marshall says she leapt at the chance to take Smith's case.  <p> "Anna has been treated without any regard at all for her rights, and I consider that to be an affront to wives, women, and spouses anywhere," Marshall declares. "I find her an attractive person to represent because she only wants what is fair."  <p> What's fair depends on what you think about Smith's marriage last year to oil mogul J. Howard Marshall II (no relation to Diana). When the wedding took place, he was wheelchair-boundand 89; she was 26. "I don't believe that Anna Nicole married Howard for his money," says Diana Marshall. "But even if she did, I can't think of any way that it would be relevant to her legal rights. Whether or not you love your spouse is not relevant to what you get when he dies."  <p> The question of Smith's legal rights is complicated. At stake is a potential share in the estate's big prize--a family trust valued between $480 million and $3.2 billion. Smith was essentially excluded from the trust by documents Howard Marshall signed two weeks after the marriage. Smith has alleged in court filings that Howard's son, E. Pierce Marshall, used "fraud" or "undue influence" to get his father to sign those papers. In an alleged attempt to keep his father away from Smith, Pierce eventually went to court and had his father declared mentally incapacitated. <p> Diana Marshall has no doubts as to Howard's capacity. "We will prove that Howard Marshall was a man who truly demonstrated never a moment of senility," she says. "He was a man who had a legendary love for beautiful women."  <p> And that's why he fell for a woman who might be cast as the bimbo? "I do not consider her to be that at all," snaps the lawyer."Anna is very strong in some ways, and in others she's quite vulnerable and unsophisticated. In some ways, she is, shall we say naive.<p> There's no question that Diana Marshall feels sympathy for Smith--may be even a certain kinship. Like Smith, Diana grew up in Texas. She was raised in the oil camps near Odessa, where her father was a $100-a-week pumper. After working her way through school, she became one of the first women to make partner at Baker & Botts, family firm of former secretary of state James Baker. Unlike Smith, Marshall has never appeared at a strip club or assumeda stage name like "Sweet Cheeks." But she does perform in public, playing the banjo and harmonica in a country and western band called the Texas Barflies.  <p> Even if Marshall does share some traits with Smith, it would be a mistake to view her as naive or vulnerable. Once, when a judge condescendingly referred to her as "lady" while addressing her male adversary as "counselor," Marshall sweetly informed the judge, "You can call him lady, too."  <p> Courtroom viewers can expect to see this no-nonsense attitude when Smith's case goes to trial. Pierce Marshall's lawyers are likely to portray Smith as a callous predator; in court papers they've accused her of carrying on "adulterous" affairs behind her elderly husband's back. Diana Marshall maintains that her client's character has nothing to do with her rights as J. Howard Marshall's widow. "I can't think of anything they could say about Anna that would be relevant in court," she says smoothly.   <p><p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> CPA: CERTIFIED PARTY ANIMAL?  <p> By Lauren Goldstein  <p> Surely, at some point, you've thought, My accountant is a nerd. And that's exactly the kind of attitude that causes CPAs to want to throw off their green eyeshades and break a No. 2 pencil in half. Now the American Institute of CPAs is fighting back witha $3 million ad campaign it feels will pump up the image of CPAs and get clients to think of them as financial planners, not number-crunchers. But will it? Here's a sample: "The CPA. Never underestimate the value." In other words, don't expect to see ads with your favorite accountant wearing a milk mustache or imploring you to "just do it." When Accounting Today polled readers, most favored the plan, but a hint of the CPA's true nature crept into one response: "Don't make it look like those Calvin Klein ads."

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> A GRAVE ISSUE FOR INVESTORS  <p> By Jack Egan  <p> When Republican Congressman Jack Fields was growing up in the tiny oil town of Humble, Texas--now subsumed by the sprawling suburbs north of Houston that make up his district--he was paid 25 cents an hour to dig cemetery graves for his father's funeral business.  <p> Today he stands accused by foes of trying to bury investors' rights. Fields, the chairman of the House Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee, recently introduced the Capital Markets Deregulation and Liberalization Act of 1995. If passed, the measure would constitute the most dramatic revision of America's securities laws since they were put on the books following the crash of1929.  <p> "Everything is on the table," Fields says--from easing corporate takeover rules to giving brokers the benefit of the doubt when dealing with big-buck investors. Under Fields's bill the federal government would even gut the role of state securities regulators, who typically deal with penny-stock frauds that are too small to draw the notice of the Securities and Exchange Commission. <p> Hearings were set to begin in October. Needless to say, state regulators strenuously oppose the bill. "This measure would take the cops off the beat across America and leave small investors on their own," says the North American Securities Administrators Association, a group representing state regulators. Also crying foul is Representative Edward Markey, Fields's predecessor as chairman of the subcommittee. Markey, a Massachusetts Democrat, calls the bill an "ideologically driven assault" and "a solution in search of a problem."  <p> Texas-tall and boyish looking at 43, Fields scoffs at such accusations."Any time you review something that hasn't been looked at for 60 years, it's going to shake some people up," says Fields at the desk of his spacious House office. None of the changes, he says, "would compromise investor protection in any way."  <p> Beyond that, though, Fields offers few specific assurances as to why little-guy investors shouldn't be worried. The bill is more likely to please the brokerage community, which for years has been a significant source of campaign contributions for the eight-term congressman. (From 1985 to 1994, Fields received $660,000 in contributions from political action committees representing securities and finance interests.) But Fields--a long-time champion of free-market views--says he's convinced that both individuals and publicly owned companies can benefit from the lifting of some existing regulations.  <p> One example, Fields says, is the rules governing dissemination of information to investors. He fixes on those bulky prospectuses, which investors are supposed to review before they buy shares in a new offering but which few are able to comprehend.   <p> "As Jack Citizen, if I want to buy shares in <a name="NYSE:XON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Exxon</b></a>, why shouldn't I just be able to go online with them and ask them to answer a few pertinent questions?" he asks.  <p> Among other reforms, Fields would also like to see the number of SEC commissioners cut to three from five. He'd also like to see the SEC's budget trimmed. And he's for privatizing the SEC's electronic records system, known as EDGAR. Especially in the area of technology, he says, the market and not the government can do things "better, faster, and at a lower cost."  <p> Will the bill make it? Legislation making it much tougher to sue publicly owned companies for misleading individual investors sailed through the House and Senate this summer, and only small differences remain to be hammered out. With pro-business sentiment strong in Congress, Fields's deregulation proposal could very well pass.  <p> When he's not plotting the future of finance, Fields focuses on the other half of his subcommittee's beat, the telecommunications industry. Earlier this year he won high marks inside the Beltway for steering an overhaul of communications regulations through all-but-final passage. Under that bill, cable television companies would be permitted to offer telephone service, while phone companies would be allowed to deliver movies to homes--potentially revolutionizing the entertainment industry.  <p> For Fields, entertainment mainly amounts to catching old movies on late-night cable. "My favorite actors," he says, "are Errol Flynn, John Wayne, and Gary Cooper."  <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth Magazine/Outfront  <p> SISTER ACTIVISTS  <p> By Laura Goldstein  <p> Fictional nuns go off to Africa to visit leper colonies or hangout with Bing Crosby in failing Catholic schools. Real nuns keepan eye on their investments. Sister Marie Lucey, who monitors the retirement fund for the Sisters of St. Francis of Philadelphia, is in charge of making sure her convent keeps its conscienceclean while it pursues a decent dividend. That means scrutinizing portfolios managed by Mellon Bank and Smith Barney and generally making a nuisance of herself to corporate chieftains such as John Smale, chairman of <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, and Jack Welch, chairman of <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a>.  <p> It may be awkward to argue with a nun, but the chairmen try. When Sister Marie Lucey chastised Smale at this year's annual stockholders meeting over the company's involvement in foreign military sales, he didn't hesitate to invoke GM's new time limits designed to silence perennial rabble-rousers. In fact, Smalecut the nun off twice. "The rules were not clear," she says."I thought it was rather foolish. I was not ranting and raving. I fully expected to have my say."  <p> GE's Welch, an Irish Catholic, is less sanguine about messing with the church. Sister Marie Lucey fondly remembers the time in 1992 he helicoptered in to the order's mother house in Aston, Pennsylvania, 20 miles south of Philadelphia, for a chat. The nun wanted GE to phase out weapons production for more Christian pursuits. "It was very exciting," she says. "That he agreed to the meeting acknowledged the influence we have." That fall, GE announced that it would sell its defense business. Says a spokesman:"We sold the division because of market conditions ... not because of any protest group."  <p> Whatever.  <p> The 60-year-old nun has been applying the ruler to corporate knuckles for 17 years now. Standing about five feet tall, with smartly cropped gray hair and wearing a conservatively long white skirt topped by a blue blouse (accessorized only by a cross), she works from a cramped office at a small convent in Philadelphia, tracking the stocks selected for the portfolios by the pros at Mellon and Smith Barney and sniffing out such problematic activities as discrimination or environmental transgressions. Then she writes to the companies, follows up with phone calls, arranges meetings with executives, and attends shareholder gatherings. Occasionally, Sister Marie Lucey will instruct the investment managers to divest a stock on ethical grounds, though she might opt to keep a small number of shares in the portfolio just so she can continue to give the company a hard time. (<a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> was the latest to receive this treatment.)  <p> This fall, Sister Marie Lucey will retire from her job with the Sisters of St. Francis fund and take up work as an employment coordinator for Project H.O.M.E., a Philadelphia organization that works with homeless people who are addicted or mentally ill. In her new role, Sister Marie Lucey won't need to attend shareholder meetings. That development seems likely to please the regular contingent of agitators who can be a bit competitive about the spotlight. Evelyn Davis, a notorious annual-meeting gadfly, said she wouldn't miss the nun at all because she didn't know who she was. Then, reminded that Sister Marie Lucey had been squelched at this year's GM gathering, Davis said, "I was the main story there. I was cut off too."   <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> PROOF THAT MONEY GROWS ON TREES  <p> By Laura Goldstein  <p> It may be inadvisable to accept a wooden nickel, but Mats Lijemark hopes folks won't be similarly spooked by a wooden credit card. The 29-year-old Swede and his father, Bengt, have developed a thin birch wafer they think is well suited for charging purchases of blond modular furniture, aquavit, and the like.  <p> The pair created the EcoCard as a test for Telia, the Swedish national phone company. Telia under pressure from environmentalists in Sweden wanted an alternative to its plastic phone cards. The Lijemarks hope to branch out from wooden phone cards to key cards for hotels and eventually to full-fledged credit cards.  <p> The younger Lijemark believes wooden cards won't present any knotty problems for consumers. Asked whether card carriers need worry about splinters, he replies, "No, not at all." Is the EcoCard suitable for whittling? No. But it can be imprinted with raised letters and numbers, just like a plastic credit card. Will the EcoCard burn? Well, yes.  <p> To Lijemark, wood is ideal for credit cards, and Sweden is an ideal place to make them. "Trees," he points out, "are not a problem in Scandinavia." <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> IS THIS THE NEXT WARREN BUFFETT?  <p> By Jane Birnbaum  <p> As hawk on American Gladiators, self-described "in-shape big guy" Lee Reherman was in New York City last year to help drum up investors for a live version of the televised athletic clash. At dinner one night, he sat beside a stockbroker in his early 20s. "Suddenly he starts pitching himself as a great retail broker and wants to open an account for me," Reherman recalls. "When you're on TV, everyone thinks you're a billionaire and wants to sell you something. He thought I was a meathead Gladiator." <p> Carrying 245 pounds on a six-foot-four-inch frame, Reherman is muscular, but not steroidally so. And with his beefy brown-red skin and a blond buzz cut, he does look a bit like your average meathead. So he let the broker natter on before delivering the death blow. "I asked whether he preferred the capital-asset pricing model or the arbitrage pricing theory. The kid had no idea what I was talking about. He was just shocked. I felt bad for him and bought him a few beers."  <p> Clearly, this is one gladiator who knows his puts from his calls. Reherman, a 29-year-old native of Louisville, Kentucky, has already earned an M.B.A. from the Anderson Graduate School of Management at UCLA. Now he's working on a Ph.D. in economics at Anderson while putting in time as a business think-tank researcher.  <p> His jock credentials are in order, too. During his undergraduate days at Cornell, Reherman was an offensive lineman on the Big Red football squad. After college he took his shot at pro football but was cut from the Miami Dolphins' roster during preseason training. He then spent three years in sports marketing before turning to graduate school. And it was there, while working out one day at the weight room, that he was discovered by a talent agent. Soon Reherman was firing tennis balls at Spandex-suited contestants in the Gladiators arena.  <p> It has proved to be a steady gig. Reherman was recently renewed for his third Gladiators season. "He's not only a great athlete, but a big personality," says Adam Jordan, coordinating producer for the program. "Sometimes he gets a little too wild and we say, Calm Hawk down.' " (The producers dubbed him Hawk because of his expansiveness and because his hair fringe flies out like wings when ungelled.)  <p> Reherman's verbal skills are highly prized on the show. "Whenever we need a good one-liner, he always has something witty to say," Jordan says. His financial savvy is also valued. Fellow gladiators often ask for Hawk's counsel. He won't recommend specific stocks, but he is willing to listen to people talk out their problems and to discuss the risks and benefits of various courses of action. "If they ask what investments I'm in, I'll tell them," Reherman says. "But I always give a disclaimer."  <p> Now Reherman is looking to the big screen. He recently completed his first starring role as an Austrian ski instructor in a family movie called Downhill Willy. Later, he figures a financial-services career awaits. Will his days as Hawk be an asset in the investment world? "It might be tough for people who watched the show as teenagers when ten years from now I'm dealing with them in a business relationship,"he says. "Say I'm a portfolio manager. Would you let Hawk manage your money?"  <p> But Reherman wouldn't be Hawk without his confidence in himself and the future: "Somebody may also look at the fact I accomplished a lot athletically and respect my diversity," he says. "I have no idea how it will play out, nor do I worry."  <p><p>

						By Jim Melloan  <p> Pizza joints in Cambridge, Massachusetts, take note: If late-night business falls off this year, blame Andrew W. Lo. The boyish finance professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has created a trading-room simulator destined to become the new hip hangout among budding M.B.A.s.  <p> Indeed, Lo sees his simulator becoming a regular campus hot spot, with students loitering into the wee hours to catch the latest prices from stock exchanges on the other side of the world. "Students should be getting good sleep," Lo says. "But I suspect we're going to have some people staying here."  <p> The simulator (officially, the Laboratory for Financial Engineering) opens for business this fall, and it promises to be the first of its kind a true simulation of a brokerage trading room. Students can choose to work with live data from the financial markets or try their hand at coping with such mocked-up disasters as a sudden plunge in the dollar.   <p> Not that Lo will be training the brainy students at MIT's Sloan School of Management to be mere traders. "We're in the business of producing sophisticated financial engineers," he says. In other words, high-paid Wall Street wizards who cook up new derivatives and decide how to price them.  <p> Lo, 35, seems a fittingly wired choice to direct the lab. Boasting a bachelor's degree in economics from Yale and a Ph.D. from Harvard, he believes that most kinds of trading done by people today can be automated. "What you need humans for is to understand the motivation for trading, to come up with the ideas, to take the ideas from the blackboard to the trader," he says. "The technology we're now developing will automate the easy trades and allow the traders to really focus, using human judgment and intuition on the more difficult ones."  <p> Would anyone dispute him on this? "Yes," he says. "The current installed base of traders would argue with me."  <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> YOU ALWAYS REMEMBER YOUR FIRST TIME  <p> By Christina Ohly  <p> Michael Minikes <p>Treasurer, <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear Stearns & Co.</b></a> <p>" I bought my very first stock for all the wrong reasons. My girlfriend at the time Cheryl, now my wife of 30 years, worked at a small brokerage firm and gave me a hot tip. The stock was in a company called Commonwealth Oil Refining, and I can't quite remember how it performed. My first important stock buy, however,was in a company called Felmont Oil, which is no longer in existence. It was recommended by a broker friend at Bear Stearns. That buy made me enough money for my wife to redo the kitchen in our apartmentin grand style. And she was going to redo it anyway, so that stock was a very good thing. "  <p> Evelyn Lauder <p>Senior corporate vice president, <a name="NYSE:EL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=40148"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Estee Lauder Companies</b></a> <p>" My first shares were in Pacific Southwest Airlines. My husband, Leonard, and I flew the airline on our honeymoon in July of 1959. We  traveled out west, and it was so enjoyable that I decided to buy stock in the company. "  <p> Floyd Abrams <p>First Amendment lawyer <p>" My first stock purchase was 200 shares of Penn Central railroadback in the '60s. It soared and soared and rose from $20 a share to $200. Unfortunately, I held on to that stock until Penn Central's bankruptcy at $1 a share.... I bought it on the recommendation of a very intelligent person. Unfortunately, he didn't tell me exactly when to sell. I've learned since that it's much easier to lose money than to make it in the stock market.  "  <p> Ken SEIff <p>Founder and CEO, Pivot Rules Co. <p>" I picked my first stock in 1986 after I received a phone bill from a call I made on spring break in Mexico. The call lasted ten minutes and cost something like $75. I was so floored by the size of that bill that I decided to look further into Telefonos de Mexico. I borrowed $10,000 and bought a number of shares at nine cents each. I held on for a year and a half and bought more. I cashed out in the fall of '87, three weeks before the market crashed. When I sold the stock, I made about $50,000 which I used to start my company.  "  <p> Ben Cohen <p>Cofounder, <a name="NASD:BJICA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12763"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ben & Jerry's Homemade</b></a>  <p>" My first stock investment was my 50 percent stake in Ben & Jerry's, which started out at zero value. When the company went public several years later, though, it was worth real money. Later, I invested in a Vermont company marketing a vegetarian chili called Chili 2000. They were committed to eliminating hunger by the year 2000. I lost all of my money there. "  <p> Ellin Saltzman <p>Vice president and fashion director, <a name="NYSE:LTD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11471"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>The Limited</b></a>  <p>" I bought my first grown up stock as a 22-year-old newlywed. It was an oil stock Asamera Oil and it was about $1 or $2 a share. I bought under $1,000 worth on a hot tip from a friend. My husband went crazy at me for gambling with so much money. I ended up doubling my money on that investment, however. "<p><p>

						By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> Lee Sheppard is one cranky lady. In her weekly column for TaxNotes, an insider D.C. newsletter read by 4,000 lawyers, accountants, journalists, and other tax junkies nationwide, Sheppard routinely vents her spleen over apparent abuses of the tax system.  <p> And she gets personal: Among those who have crossed her sights are Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, ex-White House chief of staff John Sununu, and former Virginia governor Douglas Wilder. A recent target was Bob Dole, whom she savaged for setting up a think tank with tax-free status. Sheppard saw it instead as a campaign organization in disguise or, as she put it, "a haven for former Bushies." The day after her story appeared, Dole announced he was disbanding the organization.  <p> At Tax Notes, Sheppard, 38, has earned a reputation as a thorough reporter. But one suspects that her readers savor her column for its biting prose as much as for its Beltway insights. On the doomed Clinton health care reform bill, she wrote: "It is difficult to believe that 500 educated people labored six months over this ill-conceived package. It is more likely that the scheme sat in White House Senior Policy Advisor Ira Magaziner's head until he found time to commit it to paper."  <p> The sharp words just come naturally, it seems. "I hate phony images and hypocrisy," she says. "I like to break down the tax-law-abiding faade that anybody puts on. I shouldn't take this stuff so personally.I'm going to blow a gasket one of these days."  <p> Perhaps. It's certain that her subjects explode from time to time. When Sheppard recently seared corporate tax lawyers, lobbyist Tim McCormally fired off a letter accusing her of a "calumnious" smear campaign. The only things missing from her piece, McCormally wrote, were comparisons between tax lawyers and "white males, members of the Michigan Militia, or disciples of the Religious Right."  <p> But Sheppard gets her share of fan letters, too. Senator Bill Bradley is an avid reader. Other admirers include tax-minded staffers at the Treasury, Congress, and Washington think tanks. Says Henry Aaron, a tax expert at the Brookings Institute: "She's fun to read."  <p> "Fun" isn't how Sheppard characterizes her early exposure to the world of taxes. After graduating from Northwestern University's School of Law in 1981, she took a job at a Chicago law firm and soon found herself helping rich guys find loopholes. So she sent her rsum to the editors of Tax Notes, and a tax muckracker was born. After putting in seven years in Washington, she moved to New York in 1991. "I like the vibe, speed, and impatience of New York because it matches my personality," she says. "It's the only place where aggressive, tough women are completely welcome." <p> Inside Sheppard's Manhattan apartment, the floor is cluttered with stacks of paper two feet high. There she pores over tax-related documents eight hours a day, perching on a smoker's chair while tunes by Black Sabbath and Led Zeppelin play in the background. <p> These days, with Washington mired in tax-reform debate, there's plenty for her to read and to write about. And believe it or not, beneath that cranky exterior, Sheppard favors sticking with the income tax. She says alternative approaches, such as a value-added tax, aren't practical. "My dream is for [House Ways and Means chairman Bill] Archer to move up here to New York and ask the pizza sellers how much cheese they bought to figure out how much of a value-added tax to collect," Sheppard says. "Forcing taxpayers to comply under a VAT ain't no day at the beach."   <p><p><p>

						October 1995  <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> A BASKET OF CASH, E-I-E-I-O  <p> By Raplh Gardner Jr.  <p> Among the tourist attractions in the Berkshire hills of Massachusetts are the Tanglewood Music Festival, the Norman Rockwell Museum, and the wicker cash basket at the Rawson Brook goat farm. "People do come just to look at the money box," says Susan Sellew, who, along with her husband, Wayne Dunlop, operates the idyllic little farm in Monterey and produces some of the most delicious and delicate goat cheese around.  <p> The renowned money box sits inside Sellew and Dunlop's unattended farm stand, where customers help themselves to plastic containers of cheese from the milking room's sparkling refrigerator. For payment, they leave money in the basket, making change out of the cash already there if necessary. Many of the visitors are weekenders from less placid locales, and the sight of unguarded cash frankly weirds them out.  <p> "Customers come and tell me, I'm nervous would you please empty the box,' " Sellew says. It fills up fast, especially on weekends, when tourists stock up on Rawson Brook's flavorful Monterey Chvre with chives and garlic and the ever-popular peppered log. The cheeses sell for $8.75 a pound.  <p> When edgy customers can't find anybody to witness their purchases if, say, Sellew and Dunlop are off making replacement shingles for their barn or home-schooling their eight-year-old daughter, Tarsi some will nonetheless announce that they're depositing money in the basket. Occasionally, Dunlop will overhear these shouted bulletins while working behind the barn. "They'll say, I got a pound of chives and two of wild thyme,' " Dunlop says. "They walk youth rough it in case someone's listening."  <p> Sellew attributes the couple's willingness to employ the honor system to their fundamental belief in the goodness of human nature, to the fact that the farm happens to be down a little-traveled dirt road, and to what she describes as "the specific vibe" of the farm. "Somebody would have to be pretty hard off to rip off poor farmers," she says.  <p> Unfortunately, somebody apparently was last year. "We did have our first dip in the basket," says Sellew. The damage was about $25, plus a pound of cheese. She suspects a local teenager rather than a larcenous weekender. The couple contemplated beefing up security, albeit not very seriously. "A fake camera was the first thing my husband thought of," Sellew says.  <p> In any case, the money in the cash box represents only a small portion of Rawson Brook Farm's revenues. The farm produces about 350 pounds of cheese each week, selling it throughout the Berkshires and at stores such as Zabar's in New York City and Bread & Circus in Boston.  <p> The problem, Dunlop says, is keeping up with demand. The farm is profitable enough, but expanding would mean a new barn and new equipment. It would also mean adding some full-time employees including, presumably, replacing the old money box with a cash register manned by some local teen with a problem complexion. Dunlop flatly rejects that idea. "We'd just be like all the rest," he says.  <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>TIPS FOR RICH BOORS<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Gracious! money, it seems, is finally a topic fit for discussion in The Amy Vanderbilt Complete Book of Etiquette. There's no way of knowing what Amy herself might say about this, since she passed away in 1974. Instead, credit for this modern attitude must go to Nancy Dunnan, author (with Nancy Tuckerman) of the new, completely rewritten etiquette guide.<p>And who better to advise the courtesy-conscious? Dunnan is a 50-year-old veteran personal-finance writer and the author of 27 books, including The Dun & Bradstreet Guide to Your Investments. <p>Dunnan sees the decision to include money matters in this latest edition as logical. "Money was never discussed in prior editions because it was taboo to talk about it," she says. "But these days, a lot of people are inheriting more money. And a lot of people are declaring personal bankruptcy."<p>Her approach is thoroughly modern. "I am not prim and proper," she says. "But I am polite and pragmatic."<p>One example: In dealing with your poorer friends, "You can either change your style of entertainment...or you can treat.... Probably you will end up doing a little of both."<p>Even in this more enlightened age, money is still a topic best skirted if possible. "Difficult as it may be, try to avoid talking about money more than absolutely necessary," the guide advises. "It becomes boring and can be offensive."<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>STOCK TIPS, NEXT EXIT<p>By Laurie DeLater Weeks <p>When the latest edition of JAG Notes reels out of a subscriber's fax machine in the morning, the look is amateurish: plain type, plenty of underlining, and lots of capital letters. At the top, computer-generated calligraphy proclaims the daily newsletter's name; below that is its motto: "Don't Settle for Rumors, Get the Fax!"<p>In short, JAG Notes looks like a bunch of guys in New Jersey are slapping it together every day. Guess what: They are. JAG stands for Jeff, Anthony, and Gary--that is, Jeff Goss, Anthony Salandra, and Gary Valinoti, three stockbrokers in their 30s. Every morning, from a small office in Linden, New Jersey, they, along with partner Barry Belzer and Valinoti's wife, Cathy, pirate the hottest stock market tips from Wall Street's top brokerages, compile them into three pages, and fax them out to subscribers.<p>These subscribers are hoping for a window into a Wall Street ritual known as the morning call. Every day, members of a brokerage firm's sales force arrive at their desks at sunrise to listen to a conference call in which analysts from the firm's research staff share their newest investment ideas--which stocks are ripe for purchase and, less frequently, which should be sold. The brokers then share the information with their top clients before the opening bell.<p>JAG Notes' three pages may be short on details, but they do offer a gloss on what a lot of the firms are saying, not just one. More important, they get the news out early; in the stock market, whoever gets the information first wins. Around 7:30 a.m., the 15-line phones at JAG Notes' headquarters start ringing as sources at brokerages phone in tips fresh from their morning calls. Cathy Valinoti types up the remarks, then, at 8:30, starts faxing them to clients. "We do have typos at times," Goss says. "But if there's a mistake, someone will call and we'll put out a retraction."<p>Goss, Salandra, and Valinoti launched JAG Notes five years ago. Back then, all three were brokers at Jesup Josephthal (now known as Josephthal, Lyon & Ross) in Morristown, New Jersey. One of their clients was Daiwa Securities, a Japanese firm. Every morning, Goss says, some traders at Daiwa would call to request a summary of the day's research comments from firms like <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> and PaineWebber. Goss and his friends at Josephthal would call around to their buddies and get the comments to oblige the Japanese firm. But one day it dawned on them that if Daiwa was willing to pay thousands of dollars a month for the information, others might, too. "We bought a book with money managers' names and phone numbers in it," Goss says. "We started cold-calling people from the book and offering a free trial." They recruited informants with offers of free subscriptions. The first issues were really low-rent: handwritten and faxed to one subscriber at a time.<p>Today, claiming more than 500 subscribers, the partners run JAG Notes as a separate business, though they continue to work during the day as brokers at tiny Westfalia Investments. Subscribers range from big brokerage houses to small investors. For many individual investors, the appeal of JAG Notes is limited, because it isn't detailed enough to assess a stock's long-term prospects. But for those willing to play the risky game of day trading, it can be a helpful tool.<p>"It's the best thing that I've found for what I do," says Robin Karian, a mother of two who trades stocks from her home in rural Massachusetts. Karian checks JAG Notes each morning to see if her favorite brokerages have recommended any blue-chip stocks. Her goal: Buy shares from the list at the opening and sell them later the same day at a higher price.<p>For some, a subscription to JAG Notes is simply insurance (at $1,850 for a year's subscription) against being caught off guard by the competition. Says Chris McLellan, a managing director at Robertson, Stephens & Co., a San Francisco brokerage: "We take it just to be sure that we don't get blindsided."<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>IL TESTAMENTO
("Ill Will")<p>By Judith Harris<p>CAST
Giacomo Puccini: the once rich but now deceased composer
Antonio Puccini: the deceased son of the composer
Baron Livio Dell'Anna: the deceased brother-in-law of Antonio
Pasquale Belladonna: the butler who inherited Puccini's wealth
Simonetta Puccini: the illegitimate granddaughter of Puccini
Aldo Giarrizzo: court-appointed curator of the composer's estate<p>ACT I
The drama opens in 1986 with Pasquale Belladonna, an aged butler, inheriting an estimated $13 million estate from his newly deceased lover and employer, the self-styled baron Livio Dell'Anna. The money and the properties once belonged to Italian composer Giacomo Puccini, of Madama Butterfly and La Bohme fame. When Puccini died in 1924, his son Antonio inherited the estate. Antonio's widow passed the wealth to her brother, Livio.<p>ACT II, SCENE I
Enter Aldo Giarrizzo, the Puccini estate curator with an appetite for justice. Giarrizzo sues Belladonna in 1990, alleging that the butler seized Puccini's riches without right. "He's short, fat, uneducated, and lacking in any cultural sense," Giarrizzo sings of Belladonna in the opera's most celebrated aria, "O, Uomo Grasso." The Italian court dismisses Giarrizzo's suit, deciding that the butler and the "baron" had a "para-matrimonial relationship." The butler, however, is not the only player in Giarrizzo's court duel.<p>ACT II, SCENE II
In the distance, we hear a lone soprano: Simonetta Puccini, the illegitimate daughter of Antonio. In February 1995, the 68-year-old Simonetta is recognized as a Puccini and awarded one third of the estate. "For 20 years, I've fought to have my rights respected and to look after the moral and cultural heritage of Puccini," she sings in the aria "Un Bel Anno." Living in a modest apartment in Milan, Simonetta seeks to wrest control of the maestro's legacy. <p>ACT III
With Simonetta's approval, Giarrizzo attempts to create a foundation that will protect Puccini's residences. Torre del Lago, the lakeside retreat in Tuscany where the composer is buried, would become a proper museum. "Everyone agreed, from the Milan mayor to Simonetta," sings Giarrizzo. Suddenly, Simonetta demands to be named president of the foundation. But Giarrizzo refuses; he doesn't think she's up to the task. Alas, as future court skirmishes loom, the properties continue to decay. In the background, thieves loot Torre del Lago.<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>ALL IN A GOONDA'S WORK<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>On a bright evening last winter, social activist Madhu Mehta was enjoying the sunset from his home on Napean Sea Road in Bombay, India, when a visitor was ushered in.<p>"He was a young man in his early 30s," Mehta recalls. "He was scared."<p>The visitor, a midlevel employee of a multinational company, told an astonishing tale. He was a Citibank credit card holder who, due to financial difficulties, had defaulted on payments toward his credit card balance of 36,000 rupees (about $1,140). He said his card had been impounded by the bank, and an independent collection agent had been sent to settle the account.<p>When the young man, Deepak Gandhi, requested an extension of the time limit to repay his debts, he said the collection agent, one A. Qadir Shukri of Bombay Credit & Company, told him he must either settle within 48 hours or have one of his organs removed to repay the amount to the bank. The cardholder claimed he had been first offered the choice of giving up an eye, his liver, a lung, or a kidney. But the collector then decided he wanted a kidney and asked for his blood type. The young man fled.<p>Mehta lent a sympathetic ear. He is the head of the Hindustani Andolan, a 21-year-old group that he describes as a "nonpower-seeking renaissance political, social, and cultural movement." The 65-year-old Mehta says the need for the group is easily explained:"India is run by thugs and charlatans. So we have to take action."<p>Mehta quickly took up the young man's cause, charging that he had been subjected to "Chicago mafia-type tactics." He demanded an investigation into the matter and Shukri's suspension as a collection agent.<p>In a country that thrives on drama (India produces more films each year than Hollywood), the story was irresistible. The press had a field day: CITIBANK AGENT THREATENS TO PLUCK KIDNEYS OUT FOR RECOVERING CREDIT DUES read a headline in the Indian Express, one of the nation's leading dailies.<p>It wasn't long before bizarre legends about defaulters and credit cards began circulating. An old lady who was behind in her loan payments was said to have had her car repossessed on the streets of Delhi--while she was driving her granddaughter to school. Then there was the story of a collection agent who threatened to take possession of a defaulter's wife. Given the already shady reputations of the collection agencies, the stories spread like wildfire.<p>"The collection agencies are mostly mom-and-pop shops," says Rajiv Luthra, a consumer-finance consultant in New Delhi. "It's a 'goonda-gardi' business." That is to say, a thug's work.<p>Mehta says that description certainly fits the persistent Shukri. "A very uncouth person," sniffs Mehta, who met the man on Gandhi's behalf. "He certainly doesn't look well-educated."<p>For his part, Shukri denies the strong-arm tactics. "It was a small amount, so why should I do this?" he says. And Citibank--the No. 1 player in India's fledgling consumer-finance market--dismisses Gandhi's tale as pure fabrication, perhaps inspired by stories in the local press detailing the organ trade in India. Indeed, police closed their investigation after a month, citing a lack of evidence. Now Gandhi is working with Citibank on a repayment schedule for his outstanding debts.<p>Still, Shukri--goonda, or victim of rumor?--is no longer in the bank's employ. He strikes a philosophical note about the ups and downs of the collection business. "Things like this happen," he says. <p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>PHILIP DIEHL: CREME DE LA MINT<p>By Louis Jacobson<p>Since taking office as director of the U.S. Mint last year, Philip Diehl has found himself arguing for fewer coins instead of more__not necessarily the most obvious position for the nation's czar of spare change. But Diehl is trying to keep pace with a Congress that's seemingly coin-crazed. <p>First, the House Republican budget plan contains a proposal to scrap the dollar bill in favor of a new dollar coin. That pushed Diehl to side with advocates of folding money.<p>Sure, replacing the dollar bill with a longer-lasting coin might produce budget savings (anywhere from $20 million to $800 million a year, depending on which estimate you believe). But Diehl argued that a new coin, no matter how well designed, might not be able to overcome the public's distrust of dollar coins__the legacy of the Susan B. Anthony debacle. "There's real resistance to the government telling people what's good for them," Diehl says.<p>Call it a customer-service approach to currency. Diehl, 44, is accustomed to worrying about customers__or constituents, as the case may be. He started out in the service sector, logging nights as manager of a La Quinta motel while earning a master's degree in government at the University of Texas in Austin. Later he joined the staff of Lloyd Bentsen__first as a top aide in his Senate office, then as his chief of staff at the Treasury. It was then a short jump over to the Mint.<p>Once there, the former senate aide soon found himself lobbying Congress to stem a glut of commemorative coins. Legislators regularly push for special-issue coins to honor pet causes; recent suggestions have included the Navy's Blue Angels precision-flying squad and Congress's Botanic Gardens.<p>Again, it comes down to the customer__in this case, collectors reeling from a flood of commemoratives. At the same time, surcharges that benefit the organizations featured on the coins are jacking up prices. The latest example: a set of 16 Olympic coins Congress foisted on the Mint as a way to raise $100 million for the Atlanta games. Right now, sales are expected to snare only half that amount. Diehl fears the coin deluge will turn off even die-hard numismatists; it's better to cut back. "The less you sell," he says, "the more appeal it has."<p>If and when Diehl reins in the commemoratives, there are other policy questions for the Mint to tackle__whether to get rid of the penny, for example. But Diehl's long-term vision sounds positively Gingrichian: replacing coins with "digital" cash. "Coins are at best a second-wave technology," he says. "Barter was first, then coins. The third-wave technology, it's absolutely clear, is debit cards and smart cards."<p>For now, though, Diehl gets rid of his coins the way a lot of us do: He tosses them into a jar and leaves them for his kids. Then the next time they hit him up for money, he'll hand them the jar and say, "If you roll them, they're yours."

						By Gary Hector<p>Paul Volcker had to ask for an invitation. Jim Wolfensohn, president of the World Bank, swung by on his way back from Africa. Roger Altman, friend of Bill Clinton and former deputy Treasury secretary, stopped in for a few minutes to schmooze. And Doug Fraser, retired president of the United Auto Workers, stayed until well after midnight. <p>Fifteen years ago these men played pivotal roles in one of the biggest--and most successful--political gambles in U.S. history. In a swirl of headlines, drop-dead dates, and arm-twisting, they persuaded the U.S. government to guarantee up to $1.5 billion in debt for Chrysler. The agreement saved the automaker from bankruptcy. But this night they were all together atop the former Pan Am building in New York City to party--knock back a few drinks, munch on a gargantuan wheel of cheese, and talk shop.<p>A big topic, of course, was Kirk Kerkorian's offer to acquire Chrysler. Steve Miller, the former Chrysler executive who organized the reunion, found the bid astounding. "Who could have imagined that we'd see a smart Wall Street type offering $22 billion for something that was worth $200 million when we were working on it?" he said.<p>Miller is now chairman of Morrison Knudsen. And glancing around the reunion, it was easy to spot other alumni who have risen to prominent positions. David Schulte, who was then at Salomon Brothers, has since started Chilmark Partners. Brian Freeman, a key staff member at Treasury, became an investment advisor to labor unions. Freeman ended up advising UAL workers in their buyout effort and introduced them to Gerald Greenwald, former Chrysler vice chairman. Greenwald is now CEO of UAL.<p>The only conspicuous no-show was Chrysler's leader during the bailout: Lee Iacocca didn't make it. Neither did the giant cheese wheel; by the end of the evening, the bailout alumni had gnawed it to crumbs.

						September 1995
Worth magazine/Outfront<p>BURPING THEIR WAY TO THE TOP<p>By Jane Birnbaum<p>They came for tips on selling RemarkaBowls and dinnerware separates from the Tabletop Collection, but for 500 of the nation's top Tupperware salespeople, the spring seminar in Dallas was also a great chance to scope out the competition.<p>Considering some of the prizes awarded to Tupperware's best hawkers, scouting one's opponents might seem like a smart idea. Top-ranked salespeople (actually, they're called "managers" in Tupperspeak) vie for such incentives as minivans and Caribbean cruises.<p>But veterans insist that they're rooting each other on, not looking over their shoulders. Nickie Malouf of Burbank, California, a Tupperware manager for 17 years and No. 2 nationally last year, admits that wanting to be first would be "a natural, normal thought," but says, "it doesn't go through my head." <p>With all those warm feelings, you can almost believe that the salespeople in shooting range of No. 1 wish nothing but the best for Judi Daugherty of Morgantown, West Virginia, the top manager nationwide last year after just 18 months in the Tupperware game. Needless to say, other managers were curious to meet her. "She had set a new standard of excellence, and I was dying to know what she was doing that was different," says San Diego's Alana Klepper.<p>Daugherty didn't keep attendees of the Dallas conference in suspense. In her talk on how she had earned $20,000 in one month and personally sold an astounding $40,000 worth of Tupperware in that time, she disclosed one of her key strategies: Demonstrate the Modular Mates system, a basic part of the Tupperware line intended to instantly organize a cupboard. "If I can sell women a set, when they get home they can start to see the bigger picture more quickly," Daugherty says. Yes, sets do indeed cost more than single pieces.<p>Even though Daugherty won a Dodge Intrepid, $10,000 cash, and some jewelry last year for winning the national sales competition, she didn't mind sharing her secrets. "Teaching 499 people to earn $20,000 a month can't hurt me," she says. "I might not be No. 1 again for 1995, but that's not my goal. I'm No. 1 because I work hard."<p>For many of the top contenders, the Dallas seminar was their first chance to get acquainted. "When I met [No. 2 ranked] Nickie Malouf, I felt like I was meeting a queen," Daugherty says. "Tears came to my eyes. She's been in the top year after year, and here's me, the new kid on the block, meeting the best of the best." In fact, Daugherty's status was in flux in Dallas because manager Patty Wilson of Mason, Ohio, was $5,000 ahead at the end of the first quarter of 1995. "I sat right next to Patty on stage, and I said, 'Let's try to get together for a phone call,' " Daugherty says. "She was excited, too."<p>Wilson, who has been selling Tupperware for six and a half years, doesn't begrudge Daugherty her rapid ascent to the top. She doesn't plan to change her strategy, either: She'll simply continue "dating" as many parties as she can--that is, persuading friends and acquaintances to host sales demonstrations. Like her grocer father before her, Wilson makes monthly sales charts. And, for inspiration, she listens to the Tupperware awards-ceremony theme song--Whitney Houston's "One Moment in Time"--at least twice every day.

						By Lauren Goldstein  <p> As economists ponder the price of gold these days, some Americansare heading their cars toward Fort Knox, Kentucky, with a hearty "There's gold in them hills!" Hoping for a chance to spend their rapidly plunging dollars on gold souvenirs and to catch a glimpse of the 147 million ounces of gold brick stored there, about 3,600 visitors a year show up on the doorstep of the U.S. Bullion Depository. <p> Disappointment awaits them. "There are no tours," says Bill Daddio, the man in charge of Fort Knox's security. In truth, Fort Knox remains harder to get into than ... Fort Knox. When U.S. Treasurer Mary Ellen Withrow visited last January, she was allowed in, but her staff had to wait outside. Even the regularshipments of <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> are left at the gate to be searched. Tourists will probably get a better idea of what Fort Knox looks like if they stay home and rent the James Bond movie Goldfinger. The movie wasn't actually filmed at the depository, but Daddio says the sets were good replicas.  <p> Secrecy is a key element in Fort Knox's security. When pressed for details, the response is "enough." How many people work there? Enough to do the job, Daddio says. How much money is spent on security? "We're given what we need to do the job," he says. <p> Don Nichols, public affairs officer for the U.S. Mint, sums it up: "Fort Knox is a facility we're very neurotic about."  <p>  <hr> <p>

						By Jack Egan  <p> Not so long ago India was dismissed out of hand in financial circles as the "sick man of Asia" and the last place to think of investing. Today, despite jitters about emerging economies after Mexico's meltdown, India is considered one of the more promising places in the world to put money.  <p> Behind that stunning shift in perception stands Manmohan Singh, India's owlish finance minister, known for his stylish sky-blue turbans and wily pragmatism. He has been the chief architect of an ambitious program to thoroughly overhaul India's red-taperiddled economy. "Finance Minister Singh and the current government's reform agenda are not only inextricably intertwined," says Douglas Johnson, senior international investment strategist for <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, "he's been the key for maintaining the confidence of foreign investors."  <p> Oxford-educated and a former economics professor, the self-effacing Singh, now 62, seemed a bit of an odd choice when Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao picked him in 1991 to bring India's stagnant economy back from the brink of collapse. Yet in the past four years he has succeeded in restoring India's international credit rating to investment grade while supervising the sweeping change from a Soviet-style command economy toward a more competitive, market-oriented system. The country's official foreign reserves, negligible when he took office, now stand at more than $20 billion. <p> These days, however, Singh is getting singed from all sides, putting his notable poise to the test. Within India, where the ruling Congress party appears weak going into next year's elections, naysayers worry that Singh is handing over the country to foreign investors while neglecting India's multitudes.

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> IN DOGGED PURSUIT OF A BETTER IRA  <p> By Louis Jacobson  <p> America's savers may get a pleasant surprise this year. Congress is mulling three proposals intended to make Individual Retirement Accounts more attractive, and it appears likely that one of them will pass.  <p> If that happens, credit Senator William V. Roth Jr., the perennial champion of the IRA, for refusing to give up on the idea that we should all save more. The Delaware Republican has been advocating incentives for savings for more than two decades, with a tenacity that hasn't gone unnoticed by his Senate colleagues. "He's a bulldog, I tell you," says Rhode Island's John Chafee. "He gets that bone in his teeth and hangs right on to it."  <p> The dog metaphor suits Roth well. When he first ran for a seat in the House of Representatives, he won by crisscrossing the state with his trusty pet Saint Bernard. The dog was a magnet for kids, and while the tykes were occupied, Roth slipped their parents his campaign literature.  <p> Roth, now 73 and in his fifth term as senator, still loves big dogs. Photographs of several generations of Saint Bernard pets dot his Senate office. He also still can't understand why his efforts to expand IRAs have met with so much resistance. The mention of past failed attempts to pass IRA legislation throws the ordinarily low-key senator into a fit of frustration.  <p> "I'm still shocked in disbelief that individuals don't see the worthiness of the idea," Roth says. And why is it that not everyone likes IRAs? "Stupidity. People don't like to think about fiscal matters. But it's rare when you can promote a concept that helps both the government and the people at the same time."  <p> The concept of the IRA dates back to the mid-1950s, when Senator Carl T. Curtis, a Republican from Nebraska, began crusading for them. The idea, then as now, was to encourage Americans of average means to increase their savings by granting them some combination of up-front tax deductions and a deferral of tax on accumulated interest income until the savings were withdrawn. Supporters saw it as a way to increase the rates of both personal savings and national savings, giving businesses access to more capital and thus promoting economic growth.  <p> But it was a tough sell. Congressional leaders sensed no urgent desire from the public, and they were fearful of forgoing tax revenue by offering deductions and deferments for savings. It wasn't until 1974 that the aging Senator Curtis succeeded in getting the first true IRA passed into law. When IRAs were expanded again in 1976, Curtis passed the torch to Roth.  <p> It was an appropriate move. As a young man serving in military intelligence, Roth had come to admire the high rates of saving in postwar Germany and Japan. Roth's big break came early in Ronald Reagan's first term, when he and then-Representative Jack Kemp successfully sold Congress on what have become known as the Kemp-Roth tax cuts (and what alumni of Roth's office refer to, a bit defensively, as the Roth-Kemp tax cuts). Among other things, the legislation eased limits on who could qualify for an IRA and how much could be deducted.  <p> That bill's passage kicked off the golden age of IRAs, a time when rising numbers of Americans opened accounts and kept adding to them. But that era ended in 1986, when Democrats and Republican deficit hawks worked to tighten many tax loopholes, including permissive eligibility standards for IRA tax credits. Roth began trying, once again, to convert his Senate colleagues to the IRA gospel, but it hasn't been easy. Critics remained wary of giving up tax dollars, particularly when some economists suggested that many savers were simply shifting existing holdings into tax-favored IRAs. <p>The battle for IRAs hasn't made Roth a household name. Though the Almanac of American Politics acknowledges that Roth has made" some significant accomplishments" on Capitol Hill, it also says he is "not treated as a major player."   <p> Still, he persists in trying to sell fellow legislators on his current proposal. Called a back-loaded IRA, this new species of savings account would encourage depositors to switch to it after first paying the deferred taxes on their old IRA, which would actually boost the Treasury in the near term. After that initial tax hit on the transferred funds, earnings on the funds would be tax free. In addition, these IRAs would allow penalty-free early withdrawals for college tuition, first-time home purchases, and the like.  <p> Critics say the U.S. can't afford to offer such expensive tax incentives, but Roth believes IRAs create a habit of saving, helping people take care of themselves. "They're very shortsighted," says Roth, "the people who don't agree."  <p><p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> HE HAS A FINE WAY WITH A STEINWAY  <p> By Carol Schatz  <p> Franz Mohr doesn't really play the piano, but he knows how to improvise. During a lifetime spent around concert grands, his not-so-classical movements have included applying hair spray to Artur Rubinstein's keyboard to make it "grippy" (the way Rubinstein liked it), removing broken strings mid concert for Vladimir Horowitz, and telling conductor Eugene Ormandy, "Maestro, if this piano is flat to you, then you've got no ears!"  <p> So when the 68-year-old retired chief concert technician for Steinway & Sons hosted a free public seminar on how to buy a used piano, a standing-room-only crowd of more than 120 filled New York City's Steinway Hall. They came to hear him speak about his passion and perhaps to reassure themselves that it was business as usual at Steinway, which was bought by Selmer in April for $100 million.  <p> As a Steinway (playerless and retrofitted with the digital equivalent of piano rolls) played Bach in the balcony, enthusiasts ogled the hall's massive marble columns and ornate domed ceiling while sharing musical anecdotes. "I had a kitty who played the keyboard," giggled one well-dressed woman. "Unfortunately she wasn't very good." A bookish-looking telecommunications professor sitting near her confessed that he couldn't quite afford a $30,500 Steinway medium grand. "I don't own one yet," he said. "But I will." <p> When Mohr, a small peppy man with a white mustache and an engaging grin, began to speak, the audience leaned forward and listened with the same rapt intensity they might give to, say, Chopin's E Flat Nocturne.   <p> "I am a Steinway nut, and I can't help it," said Mohr. An experton the 12,000 parts in a Steinway, Mohr joined the company in1962 after emigrating from Germany and was Horowitz's personal piano technician for almost 30 years. "Today the world is being flooded with mass-manufactured pianos that deteriorate when they leave the factory," he said. "It takes a year to build and assemble a Steinway, there are no two alike, and they get better as they are broken in."  <p> Used pianos in good condition cost a quarter to half as much as new ones, but Mohr warned bargain-seekers that an instrument in bad condition can become a money pit. Reconditioning an old Steinway, for example, can cost from $10,000 to $17,000.<p>

						<p>As backyard barbecuers bore friends this summer with their sauce recipes, Karen Putman will be whipping up another batch of her Flower of the Flames Raspberry Bar-B-Q Sauce, a rich, slightly sweet elixir that, as she boasts, "just makes your tongue slap your head silly, it's so good!"<p>The difference is, Putman sells her sauce--shipping 400 cases a month at $22.80 a case. With that business, and some notoriety in barbecue circles under her belt (she did, after all, win a Piggy award from the Kansas City Barbecue Society), she has started consulting to would-be sauce wizards, providing advice on recipes for a fee of $45 to $50 an hour.<p>Putman finds plenty of demand for her services; Kansas City has spawned more than its share of BBQ entrepreneurs. "There's a big epidemic of sauce," Putman says. "Everybody wants to get sauced."<p>For those who want to give the sauce business a try, Putman rents out (at $115 a day) her 1,200-square-foot commercial kitchen in Lenexa, Kansas. But she offers a word of caution. "These people all have that expectation that they're going to go straight to the top," she says. "It's hard to tell them that success is just not going to happen overnight." But for Putman, creating a sauce comes more easily. "It's like going and sittin' on a fish bank, I guess," she says. "It's work, but relaxing work." <p>Some recipes even seem to write themselves, such as the one for her new mustard-based sauce. The recipe came to her in a dream, and she perfected it just 45 minutes after waking up. <p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> ELAINE TO WALL STREET:  "THINK PINK"  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> Why is Elaine Garzarelli thinking pink? In the pink-covered debut edition of Sector Analysis Monthly Monitor, her first stab at dissecting the market since <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lehman Brothers</b></a> let her go last October, she concludes 44 pages of notes, equations, and charts with a newspaper clip asserting, "Pink is fashion's new power." To wit: "Why pink now? We've rediscovered the female figure, and pink is a color that represents good health.' "  <p> Sitting in a casual restaurant off the main drag in East Hampton, Long Island, one of Wall Street's most famous analysts certainly looks in good health. Tanned and rested, Garzarelli says that at 43 she's never been better. "I finally feel free," she says, knocking back a glass of tomato juice.   <p> This spring, she flung open the doors to her new firm, Garzarelli Capital, Inc., in Boca Raton, Florida. She says she has lined up 400 clients who will pay a minimum of $8,400 a year to receive monthly reports and quarterly conference calls. She'll also be working with stock picker Mario Gabelli and her old friend Leonard Zacks, who runs an investment research firm in Chicago. She'll do all this while dividing time between Florida and East Hampton."I want to reconnect to people," she says. "I'm interested in human relationships now."  <p> But some of those who know her wonder if this veteran of 12-hour work days can learn to relax. After graduating from Drexel University, she headed to Wall Street in 1971 and began a remarkable career. She predicted the October 1987 market crash, then later became a complete optimist. Soon her predictions became self-fulfilling, when she talked, the market moved. Institutional Investor named Garzarelli as Wall Street's top quantitative research analyst for 11 years straight.   <p> In her short skirts and peek-a-boo blouses, Garzarelli stood out among the investment world's starched white collars. Few Wall Street economists can list the accomplishment of appearing in a No-Nonsense pantyhose commercial. But her flamboyance didn't necessarily work to her advantage at Lehman. She became expensive her annual compensation was reportedly more than $1.5 million and she began working more at home. "Working in the office was like being at a party all of the time," she says. "People throwing darts, talking. I couldn't get anything done." In October 1994, Lehman forced her out. Lehman officially declined to discussthe reasons for her departure.<p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront <p> THE UNSINKABLE VELMA MORRISON  <p> By Jesse Kornbluth  <p> When the news came, Velma Morrison was at her winter home in Palm Desert, California, hundreds of miles and a warm sun away from the beleaguered headquarters of Morrison Knudsen in Boise, Idaho. For years, the widow of MK's founder had been praying for the ouster of William J. Agee, the sixth chief executive officer in the firm's 83-year history and the one with the most disastrous record. Now her wish had come true, but she was still unhappy.  <p> If Velma Morrison had owned a vast chunk of stock, it would have been easy to understand her outrage: MK shares that traded at close to 30 last year had dropped below 9 by the time Agee was axed. But she sold almost all her shares in 1990, the same year she turned 70 and was forced to resign as MK's first female director.  <p> What enraged Velma? Namely, from her point of view, that Bill Agee, who once described himself as "born, bred, and buttered" in Boise, seemed not to have grasped MK's vibrant sense of family. She felt he did not understand that MK was, at bottom, an engineering and construction firm. Nor, finally, did Agee abide by the memory and traditions of founder Harry Morrison.  <p> Morrison died in 1971, and Velma is remarried now. But she has kept her legendary surname. "They do that these days, don't they?" she coyly asks.  <p> Along with potato king Jack Simplot and grocer Joe Albertson, the master builder Harry Morrison established both a fortune and a way of doings things in Boise. Albertson walked his grocery stores, greeting acquaintances by name. Simplot moved to a bighouse on the hill, but his home phone number has always been listed, and he drops off his own dry cleaning. And Morrison? Affectionately called that "damn dam builder" by his widow, he built the Hoover Dam and was once described in a Time magazine cover story as the man who had most changed the face of the earth. Morrison liked nothing better than to grab a guitar at gatherings of MK employees and croon the songs of the day. Although he was rarely photographed without his vest, Morrison had no airs. <p> Velma had no trouble fitting in when she moved to Boise as Harry's second wife in the late 1950s. The two had met at her restaurant, the Broiler, in Bakersfield, California. He was 73, suffering from diabetes, his wife recently deceased. She was a perky blond 38-year-old divorcee with three children. A few months after they met, Velma recalls, he told her, "You've trained as a nurse. Come and work for me. You can give me my insulin shots as I travel." Velma sold her restaurant and took the job. They married in 1959. <p> Velma says he told her they could live anywhere the company had an office. She chose Harry's old house in Boise, where the people are, she says, "really friendly." There, she embraced community causes with gusto, which is no small thing in a city where good citizenship is like a second religion.  <p> After Harry's death, Velma could have settled into a comfortable, undemanding life, like some widows of wealthy men. Instead, she took over the Harry W. Morrison Foundation which her late husband had started in 1952 to support local institutions and created the Harry W. Morrison Performing Arts Center. In 1984, the $18 million, 2,066-seat theater was inaugurated with a production of My Fair Lady, Harry's favorite musical. In 1988, Velma married rancher and fruit grower John Hockberger and started building her dream house. She also continued serving on MK's board of directors as one of the company's largest shareholders. According to James McClary, chairman of the board from 1972 to 1978, Velma grasped the essential nature of the business of construction; she had traveled with Harry and understood that every job has to stand on its own feet.  <p>  <p>in the summer of 1988, William Agee had been an MK director for seven years. But that wasn't what some Boiseans thought of when his name came up. They remembered his unsatisfactory stint at Boise Cascade. They recalled how he had become, at 38, the CEO of Bendix only to be at the center of a personal controversy at that Fortune 500 company when he made young Mary Cunningham his chief strategist. And they remembered Bendix being gobbled up in a takeover battle Agee himself had launched, with Agee riding a golden parachute to safety. But Agee had gone on towed Cunningham, father two children, and settle into a quiet series of consultancies from Cape Cod.  <p> The summer of 1988 wasn't the best of times for MK. The company was unwinding its ill-timed excursion into the real estate business, and the charges to the bottom line were enormous. At a board meeting, sources say, Agee expressed deep concern; before the session ended, the directors had asked him to become both CEO and chairman.  <p> Velma now swears she was never completely sold on Agee. Others say she was an Agee enthusiast. After all, he had grown up on the same street where Harry and his first wife, Ann, lived. Velma is said to have been charmed by Agee's charisma and his contacts. And, because he was as native as potatoes, she thought he was likely to continue Harry's mission.  <p> Velma gave the Agees a reception that fall. But during the remainder of their relationship, friendship never developed. "They were just too high falutin for us," Velma says. (The Agees did not respond to requests for an interview.)  <p> More troublesome to Velma, however, was that Agee began changing the company in ways she didn't like. First, Agee drove out many of MK's most experienced "construction stiffs," people who were her friends. He turned the company away from its core business to new enterprises, mostly railroad and subway-car manufacturing, that were risky and unprofitable, which hurt her stock. But for Velma Morrison, the "meanest, cruelest" act was symbolic: Harry's portrait was moved from the boardroom to the storage room.  <p> Velma herself was soon moved out. In 1990, when she turned 70, she says Agee reminded her that she'd have to leave the board. The official acknowledgment of her three decades of service to MK? "You won't believe this," she says, "but Mr. Agee gave me a little farewell dinner after a meeting of directors at a restaurantat O'Hare Airport.... He did present me with a gift: a very nice piece of Steuben crystal made from the design of my new house. Frankly, I thought I deserved a little more."  <p> Had she been allowed to continue on the board, she says, "Agee would have had me to fight all the way." That year she sold all but 100 of her shares.  <p> Though Velma was off the board and no longer one of the company's largest shareholders, the tension between her and Agee continued. In 1991, rumor had it that Agee was headed out. Velma was then in London, visiting with two former MK executives who were working on the Chunnel project. Agee apparently believed that Velma went to London to ask these men to come home and run the company. He threatened to sue her.   <p> "These lawyers came all the way over, first class, to talk to me," Velma says. "I had to hire lawyers myself." Eventually, she says, "It went away."   <p> As Agee's compensation rose, the fortunes of many of his employees fell. He changed the retirement benefits, which encouraged some senior managers to take early retirement. Agee who liked to say that MK was "a place where tradition lives" also canceled the retirees' picnic. By this point, Velma saw no reason to be discreet; she decided to become one of the event's sponsors. "Last year, almost 350 people came," she boasts, "and I think I knew just about everyone's name."  <p>  <p>Agee's rule at MK began to unravel in November of 1994, when he completed the transfer of his office to his home in Pebble Beach, California. In a rare corporate revolt, an anonymous band of upper-echelon employees who called themselves the Committee for Excellence bombarded the board with documents showing MK's precarious finances.  <p> Because the directors (including Worth senior contributing editor Peter Lynch) have kept a low profile since dispensing with Agee, Velma's voice has been heard loud and often in recent months. Some Agee partisans have, therefore, marked her as a meddler who lobbied former California Supreme Court Justice William Clark the board member who would later serve as an interim chairman to dump Agee. Her motive, according to some sources in a Time magazine story: Agee had cut off her perks.  <p> Velma finds such charges laughable. "What perks?" she hoots. "I had none. This is Boise; the only people who cared about perks here were Bill and Mary Agee. As for Mr. Clark, I didn't know him from Adam. He called me when he took over. But I never met him until after he resigned." Clark confirms this.  <p> In recent weeks, Velma Morrison has found reason to celebrate. That process began when Harry Morrison's portrait was rehungin the conference room. But she didn't achieve full-bore elation until MK tapped Robert S. Miller Jr., who had been instrumental in <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler's</b></a> 1980 turnaround, to be its new chairman, a choice that she finally likes. In the days after Miller's appointment, trading of MK shares was very heavy, and the stock price rose.  <p> And how did Velma Morrison, with her piddling token amount of MK stock, feel about the run-up?  <p> "Very good," she said that week. "I had called my broker over the weekend. And as soon as the market opened on Monday, he bought me 5,000 shares." <p><p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> HOW TO SNAG A FREE HONEYMOON  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> Dianne Martinez and Bill Hale weren't sure how to handle gifts when planning their upcoming wedding. Martinez, 47, a second-time bride, had no interest in china or flatware. "We already have all that household stuff," she says. "But we would never ask for money." Not explicitly, anyway. Instead, they registered with a travel agency for a six-day bicycle trip through France's Burgundy Valley. Estimated cost: $4,000.  <p> That concept the honeymoon registry is fast becoming the talk of the bridal industry. "In nearly 50 percent of weddings these days, it's a remarriage for the bride or groom," says Alan Fields, coauthor of Bridal Bargains. "They don't need that fifth toaster."Worldtek Travel agrees; the agency recently launched an official honeymoon registry package.  <p> But not everyone is in favor of bucking tradition. "I talked a bride out of it because I think it's tacky," says Roberta Fleming, owner of Lace and Promises, a bridal consultancy in Baltimore."It's like saying, Hey folks, help us pay for our wedding.'"  <p> Hey, why not? Etiquette didn't deter Shalley Parmenter and Tom Joyner of Flagstaff, Arizona, from registering their honeymoon. Last October, the newlyweds spent three weeks backpacking through Chile; wedding guests chipped in some $3,000 toward the excursion."Some people thought it was rude," says Joyner. "But they could buy us crystal instead."   <p> <p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> POINTS OFF FOR EXTRA CREDIT  <p> By Jane Birnbaum  <p> This month, many of Chuck Malouf's 12th-grade students will trade in their school days for low-wage jobs. Many will find themselves on their own financially for the first time.   <p> But if Malouf has fulfilled his mission, these 17- and 18-year-olds now have some tools to cope with what lies ahead. As part of his senior economics class at John Muir High School in Pasadena, California, Malouf labors to explain to these young adults the difficult decisions they will face concerning money.  <p> He delivers his lectures with the timing of a stand-up comic."Most Americans have a tough choice," he told the class on a recent rainy morning. "You either buy a fancy new car or you feed your children." He pauses a beat before delivering the punchline: "It's obvious you buy the car, right? Because when your children suffer from malnutrition and you cruise to the hospital, you've got to look good." Once the laughter subsides, Malouf offers up the moral: "The question is, Do you want to look good or be good?"  <p> The son of Lebanese immigrants, Malouf, 53, grew up in nearby Glendale and started working at the age of eight, selling doughnuts door to door. A graduate of local schools and holder of an M.B.A., he's taught personal finance to Pasadena high school and community-college students for 28 years. He's also written a textbook, Consumer Education and Economics, which is currently scheduled for a fourth edition.  <p> Security at Muir is heavy, and the buildings look run-down. No matter. Malouf makes his classroom stimulating and fun. (A sign on the wall poses the question "Can I pay my MasterCard with my Visa card?")  <p> This afternoon, Malouf delves into the realities of personal budgets. But before handing out worksheets and asking his students to prepare a household budget based on a monthly income of $1,200 (and then redo it based on $1,000 a month), Malouf talks casually with the class, trying to squeeze a lifetime's worth of insights into a few hours. He explains how to keep track of spending, warns of the temptations of credit cards, and even briefly discourses on the meaning of money.  <p> "What can you do with money?" Malouf asks. You spend it, of course, the class replies. "What else?" Save it. "What else can you do with it?"  <p> "Can you lay in bed with it?" wonders one girl. Laughter all around.   <p>

And for the past five years, IBM's response has been perfectly consistent: Not no, not yes. Just "We'll think about it."  <p> Those five years of rebuffs haven't discouraged McCanless. And who knows? In a strange way, perhaps he has come up with the only approach capable of moving so large a force as IBM. Be nice. Be patient. After all, it took years for the Big Blue suits to try out a casual dress code, a benefit that doesn't even cost the company money.  <p> In any case, the strategy seems to come naturally to McCanless, an optimistic employee who is convinced that IBM will, as he puts it, "do the right thing." And in his cardigan sweater, khaki pants, and penny loafers, McCanless looks like he's comfortable enough to wait it out. The 38-year-old engineer at IBM's manufacturing and development facility in San Jose, California, has networked tirelessly, however, to put together a list of gay and lesbian IBMers in the U.S. a critical resource for organizing.<p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> ONE DIGITAL SAWBUCK  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> The artisans of the Prince Edward Island Crafts Council maybe more comfortable with looms and spinners than computers and modems, but they're always happy to make some cash cold, digital, or otherwise. So Peter Rukavina, information manager for the group of weavers and glass blowers on the Canadian isle, decided to try out the cutting-edge technology of electronic money that is, a purely digital currency that can be ordered and then spent via electronic mail on the Internet. "We're forced by location and circumstance to be innovative," Rukavina says.  <p> Too bad, then, that the council's experience with NetCash, adigital currency created by Software Agents in Germantown, Maryland, has been a bust. "It hasn't been successful in any way," says Rukavina. In fact, the group has received less than $10 in digital bucks since joining the NetCash system last July.  <p> The council had hoped to collect money from those accessing its database of North American suppliers over the Internet. (Feesare used to keep the system up-to-date.) Conventional systems were unworkable "We can't have our staff answering telephones to process Visa and MasterCard transactions," Rukavina says, "and we don't want to send an invoice to someone in Colorado for 60 cents." <p>NetCash seemed to be the solution; users of the database could pay for the service when they used it, directly from their computers. Alas, Canadian customers cannot get NetCash easily; it takes time and effort to purchase digital cash north of the border.<p>

						By Elizabeth Royte<p>While Hollywood gets ready to release a film version of Robert James Waller's sentimental Bridges of Madison County in June, the real inhabitants of Winterset, Iowa, here are engaged in a drama of a more mercenary sort: a low-stakes game called three coins, played downtown at the Montross Pharmacy since 1987.<p>Here's how it works: As many as 15 players ante up a nickel each. After each player takes zero to three coins into his hand, the contestants each predict the total number of coins hidden in the group. The players then open their hands, count the coins, send whoever guessed correctly out of the game, and start a new round. The last one out buys everyone coffee; the ante goes into a fund.<p>Last year, the nickels added up to $150.15, enough to buy beer and pizza at the annual awards ceremony. But players don't need to wait that long for recognition. Each week, the most skilled player gets to wear a badge signifying the feat. The loser gets a badge as well, emblazoned DAL, for "Dead Ass Last." <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>SHOW BOAT TO CHINA?<p>By Paul Alexander<p>For a man perhaps best known for a remarkable failure--his departure in disgrace from the Cineplex Odeon movie-theater chain--Garth Drabinsky is relentlessly optimistic about his latest venture. To hear him talk, his theater-production company, Live Entertainment of Canada, or Livent, is poised to democratize the nature of investing in live theater.<p>Sometime this summer, Drabinsky plans to list shares of his company on Nasdaq, meaning that rather than leaving patronage in the hands of the well-heeled--the traditional method of financing theatrical productions--he will offer stock to anyone who can afford to buy in. Maybe this will just give the American middle classes a glamorous new way to lose money--theater is notoriously fickle as an investment--or maybe Drabinsky really has vision. <p>One thing the Canadian doesn't lack is a healthy ego. His new autobiography, Garth Drabinsky: Closer to the Sun, could be read by future investors as a kind of prospectus, giving in 520 pages all the ups and downs of this 45-year-old's life. <p>A definite low point was his exit from Cineplex Odeon, which he cofounded in 1979 and built into one of the largest cinema chains in North America. When he was kicked out as chairman in 1989, the company was $590 million in debt.<p>So far, Livent's experiences on Broadway have been mixed. Its first venture, Kiss of the Spider Woman, didn't earn back its start-up costs, prompting Livent to write off $6 million on the show in January. But Drabinsky believes Show Boat, Livent's second Broadway effort, will recoup its start-up costs this year.<p>Livent investors will be buying into Drabinsky's overall concept: Take a show that started in a big city like New York, Toronto, or London, then spin off as many versions of the show as possible in smaller markets where there's less competition for the entertainment dollar. For other producers, that non-Broadway income is usually ancillary, but for Drabinsky it's a critical part of the business model. For instance, a Chicago production of Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat grossed a staggering $50 million over 16 months--enough to cover $1.8 million in start-up costs and weekly operations with plenty left over.<p>The returns haven't materialized lately for investors in Livent, which trades on the Toronto Stock Exchange. (Livent isn't related to U.S.based Live Entertainment, a film and video production concern.) Livent's shares had dipped to around $10 (Canadian) in mid-March from highs around $16 to $17 a little over a year ago. (The stock went public at $8.75 in May 1993.) But the company received a vote of confidence in February when Thomas H. Lee, a Boston-based takeover specialist who focuses on turning small companies into big successful ones (like Snapple), bought 13 percent of Livent.<p>Drabinsky's latest production hints at things to come. He has opened Phantom of the Opera in Singapore and intends to tour it in the Far East. If he has his way, the latest hit Broadway musical will be playing soon in a theater near you.<p><p>

						By Christopher Byron<p>On a warm and cloudless night in Paris in the summer of 1993, an elegantly dressed banker named Jamal Radwan emerged from a restaurant on the Avenue Duquesne with a female companion. Radwan was a key player in the high-stakes world of Arab finance, but on this particular night his thoughts were focused on the romantic stroll he planned to take. He didn't notice the tall man lurking a few steps away.<p>As Radwan stepped forward, the stalker emerged from the darkness and closed in from behind. Evil was in the moment. Drawing forth a knife big enough to skin a bear, he attempted, in a single, violent stroke, to sever Radwan's head. Then the attacker began to dissect Radwan's face, working relentlessly, methodically. Blood gushed to the pavement and Radwan collapsed. The attacker crouched and crudely sliced Radwan's mouth and tongue. Vous allez' pas dire, he said in a measured tone. Vous allez pas ecrire. You will not speak. You will not write.<p>With that, the assailant raised the knife, plunged it twice into Radwan's chest, stood up, and disappeared into the dark of Paris's side streets. French police never identified any suspects in the brutal knifing. <p>Jamal Radwan survived the attack. After seven hours on an operating table, he began a slow but steady recovery--one that has included more than a dozen operations to reconstruct his face. <p>Radwan's tongue also healed. And despite his attacker's gruesome warning--or perhaps because of it--the banker is using it to talk about the lawsuit he filed in federal court in New York only weeks before the attack.<p>In the suit, Radwan, the former head of the once-powerful Saudi European Bank, accuses some fellow Arab financiers of a vast web of schemes that bears an eerie resemblance to the scandal that brought down the Bank of Credit & Commerce International. One startling aspect of Radwan's suit: Among the individuals he names are major shareholders and even directors of a Bahrainian firm called Investcorp--a company that has purchased stakes in such marquee properties as <a name="NYSE:SKS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=40406"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Saks Fifth Avenue</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:GUC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46896"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gucci</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:TIF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11481"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tiffany</b></a>.<p>Syrian by birth, Radwan became a U.S. citizen after graduating from Southern Methodist University in Dallas in 1964. He then joined <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan Bank</b></a>, which eventually assigned him to Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia. There, Radwan helped establish Chase's presence in the Arab kingdom.<p>This feat was enough to bring him to the attention of Ahmed Zaki Yamani, Saudi Arabia's powerful petroleum minister. In 1979, when Yamani was setting up Saudi European, he hired Radwan to run the bank. With Yamani's clout behind it, Saudi European was soon reaping profits from lucrative oil-financing contracts--at least for a time. <p>In the mid-1980s, oil prices collapsed and Yamani was fired as petroleum minister. In a bid to raise capital, Radwan says in his lawsuit he made a big mistake: He sold Saudi European stock to a bunch of what he says were renegade financiers--many with ties to Investcorp. Also among the new investors was Charles Keating, later a villain in the U.S. savings-and-loan debacle.<p>The new shareholders, Radwan alleges began demanding sweetheart loans as if the bank were their personal cash drawer. Radwan claims he spent the last half of the 1980s trying to thwart nefarious schemes. One especially tantalizing charge is that several Saudi European shareholders tried to drag the bank into a greenmail attack on Houston-based Gulf Broadcasting Co.--that is, they sought to force Gulf to buy back its own shares at inflated prices.<p>Though Keating was eventually implicated in a greenmail plot against Gulf, no evidence has ever come to light that Radwan's bank or any of its other shareholders were involved. As Radwan's lawyer, Mark Cymrot says, "It's really Radwan's word against theirs. A lot of this case is like that." Radwan's enemies have fired back with lawsuits of their own, claiming that Radwan himself is a looter and that he has stashed as much as $30 million to $40 million in Swiss bank accounts. <p>Little attention has been paid so far to this legal battle. But the links and similarities between Radwan's claims and the BCCI scandal--including common characters like moneyman Ghaith Pharaon and the Gokal shipping family of Pakistan--suggest revelations to come. To date, Radwan says he has spent more than $10 million on legal fees. He has prevailed in every case so far, and his most recent victory--the first to produce an important ruling on substantive issues--came just before Christmas, when a French criminal tribunal declared him innocent of any wrongdoing in the bank's management.<p>At the time he was attacked on the streets of Paris, Radwan himself was acting as an informant for Manhattan District Attorney Robert Morgenthau, passing along information on BCCI--and Saudi European. Radwan believes that may be the reason for the assault. "They wanted to silence me from blowing the whistle," he says. That, of course, is speculation, and so far no evidence has surfaced pointing to any suspect in the attack, let alone one of Radwan's business adversaries. <p>Radwan's claims about schemes to loot Saudi European are being treated seriously--if cautiously--by U.S. authorities. Says a top official in Morgenthau's office: "You'd want to take some of his assertions with a grain of salt. After all, he was part of the very world he insists is so corrupt. But I'd say he knew what he was talking about."<p>Attempted murder would be an extreme way of doing business, to be sure. But in the Middle East it's often hard to tell where business ends--and where the Arabian nights begin.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>MAKING ALLOWANCES FOR KIDS<p>By Ralph Gardner<p>Finding common-sense solutions to the everyday problems between parents and children is how Cary Normile Sellers and Dr. Mary Foote spend their days. Normile is director of guidance at the Spence School, a private girls' school in New York City; Foote is a psychologist who lectures at Spence and other schools. <p>Unsurprisingly, a lot of the answers center on money. "The parents have more money than the children, so the parents have more power than the children," Foote says. The way parents share that power with their children is through an allowance. It teaches them responsibility, offers them a taste of independence, and, not insignificantly, gives parents an answer to the question "Can I have that?"--"Buy it with your own money."<p>Foote believes many parents are forking over too much allowance, sometimes up to $10 a week for young children and $80 for older kids living on New York's Upper East Side. "Guilt is often a motivating factor," she says. "Parents work all the time and think, 'If I'm not going to be with you, money makes up the difference.' "<p>So, then: How much to give? Foote suggests that first graders receive a dollar or two a week. A recently released national survey by Nickelodeon/Yankelovich Partners shows six- to eight-year-olds get an average of $2.77 each week. Older elementary schoolers should get around five dollars, says Foote, also about in line with the survey.<p>A few dollars may not sound like much to some kids or their parents, but it is enough to encourage children to save and teach them the value of money. Some families even earmark portions of children's allowances for saving, charity, and spending. Foote agrees that's a noble idea but knows from personal experience that its success hinges not just on the resolve of the parents but the disposition of the child.<p>"Parents are asking for trouble if they try to make their child save," she says. "I tried that with my kids. It didn't work with any of them. I got into a power struggle with each child. They said, 'It's my money--I can do whatever I want with it.' I had to eat my words."<p>An allowance becomes especially important to a child beginning in the third, fourth, or fifth grade, when he or she wants to buy things that are "private" and, perhaps, objectionable--makeup or compact discs with graphic lyrics, Normile says. She recalls a middle-school student who recently came to her for consolation after her mother balked at letting her buy an off-color T-shirt. <p>Foote's solution to this dilemma is to split up the problem: Tell the child that how she spends her money is her business but that T-shirts with expletives printed on them aren't allowed in the home or the school. "You need to sit down and see if you can't develop some dialogue," Foote says, "instead of getting into a power struggle over money."<p>The experts disagree over one of the most frequently asked questions: whether kids should be paid to do chores. Normile points out that once you start paying somebody to do something, whether a first grader or a member of a corporate board, you'll have a tough time getting work for free in the future. Here's the scenario: "If you link it to doing work, a child can say, 'Fine. I won't make my bed, and I don't care about that dollar.'" To Normile, an allowance's most important role is to teach children to set their eyes on a distant prize and work to win it. "You have to plan for what you want," she says.<p>But Foote likes aligning an allowance with a task so the child is introduced early on to the idea that money doesn't come easy. "It trains us that we're going to have to earn our keep in the world," she says. "There is no free lunch." <p><p>

Worth Magazine/Outfront<p>LESSONS FROM A BIG LOSER<p>By Gretchen Reynolds<p>While Nicholas Leeson languished in a Frankfurt jail in March, the next wave of young financial wizards gathered in a University of Chicago business-school classroom for the year's final lecture in A Guide to Business Ethics, taught by Nobel laureate Robert W. Fogel. After class, students debated whether Leeson--the 28-year-old trader who destroyed Barings PLC--was or wasn't an unprincipled fink.<p>"He was not," said a 29-year-old M.B.A. student who's starting an investment banking job next year. "He was just doing his job. There was a serious management failure by Barings, but that's not his fault--it's the bank's."<p>Another student immediately disagreed, faulting Leeson instead. "He shouldn't have assumed risks to that level. If he loses, he brings the entire bank down with him."<p>"First thing I did was check where he got his M.B.A.," a 27-year-old student chipped in. "I figured if it was Chicago, we were in trouble." (Leeson didn't get an M.B.A. at Chicago, or anywhere else for that matter.)<p>The Leeson-basher kept pressing the issue. "I still say he should've let his bosses know what level of risk they were assuming," he said. "I can't believe any sane CEO would willingly risk the entire future of his company on one trader's calls."<p>"Come on," another future M.B.A. replied. "You've been interviewing for jobs for a month and you can still say that?"<p>"What I don't understand is why people were so surprised at the amount he lost," a 27-year-old student said. His theory: "If you lose a certain amount, you lose your job. Say it's $100 million--or $400 million. Once you've lost that much, the floodgates open. You have to keep trading. If you don't, you've lost your job. If you lose another $400 million, you've already lost your job, so who cares? But if you win back that first $400 million, you're a hero."

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>EVERYONE NEEDS A NAG LIKE THIS<p>By William Green<p>Grumbling about taxes over supper one night, Martha Bagby challenged her daughter Meredith to write a book explaining what the government was doing with the money.<p>That motherly advice paid off to the tune of a $110,000 book contract for 21-year-old Meredith Bagby. Her First Annual Report of the United States of America is hitting stores. And, the Harvard senior acknowledges, Mom's help was invaluable. "I don't think it ever would have gotten completed had she not nagged me so much about it," she says. <p>Bagby, who spent a year gathering data, didn't even tell friends about the not-for-credit project "because they would think I was strange." Using a desktop-publishing program and $2,500 of her own money, she ran off 250 copies of the book. While her parents sold mail-order copies out of their garage in West Palm Beach, Florida, Meredith drove around Boston distributing copies to newspapers and television stations.<p>Nobody showed much interest until Ross Perot got a copy and touted it to Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich, and others. When word got around, HarperCollins bought the book. Bagby plans to revise it annually.<p><p>

 THE OOP-TIMA CARD  
<p>
 Call it a graceless gaffe for American Express and its Optima
True Grace card. To pitch this newest piece of plastic, Amex
aggressively touted the card's namesake attraction: a grace period
that allows customers with an outstanding balance to avoid paying
interest on new purchases. Then some Optima cardholders discovered
a glitch on their statements. Thanks to a computer mix-up, they
had been robbed of the grace period and charged for the interest.
Amex says the problem is small change--"The average incorrect
charge was only 21 cents," says a spokeswoman. Besides, the error
affected only about one account in ten and has since been corrected.
But that response may not placate every Optima customer. "They
advertise this true grace period,' but I didn't get any," grouses
Andrew Shaw, 29, a New Yorker who fell victim to the snafu. Still,
Shaw decided not to cancel his card once Amex removed the charge.<p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> PLAYS AT THE PLATE <p>When it's time to pump up church donations, ministers flock to consultant Herb Miller  <p> By Ellen Simon  <p> Upon graduating from Drake University's seminary in Des Moines, Iowa, in 1966, Herb Miller had a goal: "I planned to never mention money at any church I preached at." Nearly three decades later, Miller, 58, stands before 20 ministers and church leaders at a Louisiana hotel, ready to preach a gospel of "stewardship"--in church circles, the polite term for fund-raising. Simply put, this group of ministers is looking for advice on how to increase the take in the collection plate.  <p> Miller's own career as a pastor is behind him now. As executive director of Net Results Resource Center, a Lubbock, Texas, consulting group, he takes to the pulpit these days to teach ways of pumping up church donations. His personal conversion came after ten years of leading congregations in Arkansas, Iowa, and New Mexico. "I noticed I was baptizing people by total immersion, but their wallets were coming out powder dry," he recalls.  <p> At a time when members of mainline Protestant denominations are giving less of their income to churches than at any time in the past 25 years, Miller has found his calling. He spends 250 days a year on the road, traveling around to offer workshops. He has written a number of books, including Money Is Everything:What Jesus Said About the Spiritual Power of Money. Miller, in a sense, is God's management consultant.  <p> Today's crowd at the Radisson Hotel in Kenner, Louisiana, is typical--Catholics and Southern Baptists, New Yorkers and Texans. One attendee listens to Rush Limbaugh on headphones during a break. Each has paid $95.  <p> And as usual, not everyone in the room is comfortable with the subject. As Rev. Robert Hess, who made the trip to Louisiana from his Delmar Reformed Church parish in Delmar, New York, says,"Too many congregants already say, All you ever do is ask for money.' "  <p> Flipping transparencies on an overhead projector, a few pens sticking out of his shirt pocket, Miller offers his audience some basic tips. For fund-raising letters: "Do a good job of printing or photocopying. Let the quality of the letters speak of the importance of God's work!" He also recommends holding a special event he calls "Consecration Sunday." By calling in a guest speaker and offering a free lunch, the event serves as a "synthetic Easter"--that is, a one-time event with an Easter-size turnout.  <p> By the end of the six-hour workshop, some of the pastors have overcome their discomfort. Rev. Ron McKay of Taylorville United Methodist in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, says he is no longer afraid to ask parishioners for money. "It was what I was looking for," he says.  <p> And for those who are still averse to Miller's tactics, one of his not-so-spiritual insights may provide inspiration: "There's nothing more basic in human life than the phrase 'Put me down for the same amount as last year.' "  <p>

						Did the author's daughter get beat out of her rightful inheritance? <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> Jan Kerouac recalls the second and last time she saw her father, Jack, the author of On the Road. "He was drinking whiskey and watching The Beverly Hillbillies, but I knew he was happy to see me."   <p> Jan, then 15 years old, told her father she was going to Mexico to write a book. Kerouac, who had left his second wife before Jan was born and rarely acknowledged his daughter, offered her this parting gift: "You can use my name."  <p> That was all the man who coined the term "Beat Generation" ever gave his only child. Two years later, in 1969, Jack Kerouac died of alcoholism in Florida and left his estate to his mother, Gabrielle. A local court valued his belongings and property at the time at $35,559. When Gabrielle died in 1973, her will named Kerouac's third wife, Stella Sampas, as the sole heir.  <p> Or did it? "I've always been suspicious of the way the Sampas family got everything," says Jan Kerouac. At 43, having penned two semiautobiographical books of her own, she lives in New Mexico, coping with kidney problems that require her to undergo daily dialysis. Last year, after showing a copy of Gabrielle's will to a handwriting expert, Jan quickly filed a motion to have the will reexamined, claiming it had been forged. That triggered a court battle pitting her against Stella Sampas's relatives, who inherited the Kerouac estate when Sampas died five years ago. (Jan Kerouac does receive some copyright royalties from her father's written works.) Jan Kerouac's lawyer, Thomas Brill, expects the case to go to trial by the end of this year.  <p> The Sampas family dismisses Jan Kerouac's charges. "There's no question that the will is authentic," says Skip Dalton, attorney for the Sampas family. "We're just going to slay this dragon and move on."  <p> Now valued at up to $10 million, the estate includes Jack Kerouac's journals, manuscripts, some paintings by the author, and letters. The original manuscript of On the Road, typed out on one longscroll of paper, is worth more than $1 million, according to literary collector and dealer Richard Marcel. "My lifelong goal is to get back my father's things so I can put them in a museum or a library," says Jan Kerouac.  <p> In the meantime, the Sampases have been selling off Kerouac's belongings piecemeal. A trench coat, for example, fetched $15,000 from actor Johnny Depp. "I've heard from dealers that the Sampases are selling pieces hand over fist," says Gerald Nicosia, author of the 1983 Kerouac biography Memory Babe. "They're destroying a national treasure."  <p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> JAKE AND THE TAXMAN <p>For 46 years, Jacob Freidus has thumbed his nose at the IRS. His tab stands at $20 million.  <p> By Thomas Maier  <p> In American history, Jacob Freidus holds a special place, but it's not a distinction that pleases his government. What this frail 79-year-old man from Cold Spring Harbor, New York, has managed to achieve is the secret envy of many Americans, especially as April 15 rolls around: Freidus may be the greatest tax dodger in history.  <p> His tax bill--estimated at close to $20 million--dates to 1949. Still going strong in its fifth decade, the battle of U.S. vs. Jacob Freidus is the longest-running case known to the IRS. As a spokesman for the U.S. attorney in New York says, "He's been fighting the government for a very long time."  <p> A half century ago, the press heralded Freidus as the boy wonder of Manhattan's real estate market--a man who had amassed a $15 million fortune. Then, in 1949, he was charged with evading more than $200,000 in income taxes and eventually sentenced to four years in prison.  <p> He was hardly repentant. While in prison, according to the government, Freidus concocted a new tax dodge--allegedly funneling millions from his real estate empire to another dummy company he controlled.When the government discovered the plan, it ordered Freidus to pay $9 million in back taxes.  <p> The moment of reckoning never came. Freidus appealed the decision and, for the next two decades, used virtually every imaginable excuse to drag out the case. The government won the trial in1973, though legal complications kept it in U.S. Tax Court until1982.  <p> A U.S. appeals court eventually ordered Freidus to pay up, but he managed to stall once again. After the government launched a legal effort to sort through Freidus's business files and figure out what could be used to pay the back taxes, Freidus delivered his master stroke. In 1991, with authorities closing in, he filed for bankruptcy. Among his debts: a $17 million tax bill (the original debt, plus three decades of penalties and interest) and $458,000 in outstanding New York State taxes.  <p> Last year, a federal bankruptcy judge ruled that Freidus can't use the law to avoid the debt. He contested that ruling in front of another federal judge; once more, his appeal was dismissed. <p> The government is again ready to start sorting through Freidus's finances--looking for a way to collect his debt of nearly $20million. No one expects a quick resolution.  <p>  <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> FAST-TRACK TAXES  <p> When it comes to taxes, time is money. During the yearly flood of last-minute tax returns, it can take the IRS anywhere from two to five weeks to cash your tax-payment check--giving you extra time to earn interest on the funds. Of course, Uncle Sam would prefer getting his hands on your money right away. To that end, the IRS has created 1040-V, a new tax form being sent this year to nearly 10 million taxpayers who owed money on last year's returns. Under this system, taxpayers are asked to send their normal 1040 return to one location and then mail their payment, along with the 1040-V, to a special IRS lockbox address where checks will be cashed promptly. Why help out the tax man? The1040-V "will help us process your payment more accurately and efficiently," says the IRS. On the other hand, that additional envelope will also cost you an extra stamp. The good news: 1040-V is voluntary--for now.  <p><p>

The company set aside $475 million to replace all those brain-damaged microprocessors, closing (it hoped) the books on the subject. <p> There may be a lingering cost for the rest of us, though: a missed opportunity to delete some technological navet from the hard drive of our psyches. For a moment, the media was talking about the fallibility of technology--though it quickly passed. "Once Intel did the right thing, the public went back to thinking about O.J. Simpson," says Paul Saffo, a director at the Institute for the Future, a think tank in Menlo Park, California.  <p> If you're thinking all this doesn't matter because you never used a Pentium yourself, think again. Got an account at <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan Bank</b></a>? Make your investments through Prudential Securities? Both companies were among those that used Pentiums before the flaw was publicized and corrected. Hundreds more key institutions may have depended on the chip. Math-deficient machines even found their way into the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.  <p> Intel's gurus tell us the chances of a Pentium error were one in 9 billion calculations; others say it was riskier. Either way, the potential for harm was limited--this time. But with so much of our lives dependent on computers, this should have been a wake-up call about the danger of believing that technology can be flawless. Too bad no one was listening. "There's a touching faith in the accuracy of computers," says Saffo.  <p> Technology folks, at least, harbor no illusions. In a public message on the Internet, Thomas Nicely, the Lynchburg College math professor who first publicized the Pentium bug, argued that today's complex computer chips have outpaced human ken: "It is no longer possible to completely debug them, or even to determine every bug that exists," he wrote. Surely this is a sobering idea--if anyone stops to think about it.  <p> Problem is, there's not much we can do about our chip habit; it's too late to reboot. "You can't go backward," says Eugene Glazer, a Wall Street analyst who covers the industry. If that means more flaws and, as a result, more problems--well, so be it. "There's a certain price society pays for progress," says Glazer. "The increase in productivity is dramatically greater than the additional problems."  <p> Of course, no one's claiming that a Pentium problem could have caused society to crash. The chip's one known flaw kicks in only for arcane division problems. Still, it would have been nice to admit that, even with Intel's move to replace the chips, our brave new microprocessed world won't be bug-free. "People put too much trust in computers," says Saffo. "I worry that someday, when something goes wrong, they'll overreact the other way." <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> ADVENTURES IN BABY-SITTING  <p> Late last fall, Wall Street trading behemoth Salomon Brothers gave vice president Robert M. Stavis the biggest one-year pay package in the firm's history: $35 million in salary, bonus, and compensation. The news catapulted Stavis, now a managing director, into the spotlight as the Street's newest and biggest bonus baby.  <p> It turns out that Stavis was more like a bonus baby-sitter. The trade that earned him most of his pay--a monster arbitrage involving government securities and mortgages--was actually orchestrated by Lawrence Hilibrand, a famed Salomon trader who defected in late 1993 for a hedge fund. Insiders say Stavis and six colleagues in the bond arbitrage group inherited the position and sat with it after Hilibrand left. The trade eventually earned $500 million for Salomon. Neither Stavis nor Salomon will comment.  <p> There was a method behind this bonus madness. People familiar with the payouts say Hilibrand's defection had Salomon brass so worried that the firm made a sweetheart deal with Stavis and his colleagues: Stick around and we'll pay you 20 percent of the group's profits. It worked; they stuck.  <p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>TIP AND RUN<p>If you think you're not getting your money's worth out of tips, maybe you're not sending the right message. Members of a group called Tippers Anonymous have solved that problem: When they leave a gratuity, the statement comes through loud and clear. The group's trademark is its calling card--a waiter's report card that members leave with (or without) their tip. Diners fill out the report card to rate their service from excellent to poor and then tip accordingly. That doesn't mean cheaply, though. TA founder Robert Farrington isn't opposed to generous tipping; in fact, he recalls recently leaving a 20 percent gratuity. Instead, the report cards are dedicated to restoring the idea that a tip is a reward, not a right. Best of all, diners need not worry about violent retaliation by an undertipped waiter. "The beauty of the report cards," Farrington says with a chuckle, "is that they let you make your point and get out of there." <p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>SPECIAL DISPENSATION
For banks, deciding how to push customers' buttons at ATMs is anything but automatic<p>By Dean Robinson<p>When you stop off for cash at the corner ATM, the machine may not talk back, but it is watching--and learning.<p>Every transaction you make becomes fodder for banks and ATM networks that are constantly studying questions such as: How much money do you want? And how do you want it? The answers can be used to tailor ATM offerings for different markets and customers.<p>One example: Big bills for big spenders. At some Las Vegas casinos and at select Citibank sites in New York City, ATMs now dispense $100 bills. <p>"All those tens and twenties are too bulky, too much to handle," says Citibank spokeswoman Maria Mendler. Too much, that is, for customers in the habit of withdrawing stacks of cash: Citibank is spitting out the C-notes only at a dozen test spots chosen for their high withdrawals. "It wouldn't be useful if we put them in locations where people take out an average of $50," says Mendler.<p>Banks are also working to speed customers on their way by fine-tuning the "quick cash" setting, the ATM shortcut to a designated cash amount. Most machines around the country--when they offer such an option--are set to deliver $40 or $50. But economists (or sociologists) should take note: In New York two of the city's largest ATM networks now dispense a quick $100. <p>On the laid-back West Coast, even a one-touch setting must seem too constricting. Most <a name="NYSE:WFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wells Fargo</b></a> ATMs provide at least two fast-cash choices: $40 and $100. Bank of America's system is even more accommodating--cardholders can customize the feature to their own most frequently selected amount.<p>For thoughtfulness, who can knock the Portland, Oregon based <a name="NASD:USBC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14968"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>U.S. Bancorp</b></a>? Its ATMs may provide an unvarying $50 in fast cash, but that last $10 makes all the difference: It comes as two fives. "It's cheaper to use just one denomination, as most banks do," says John Kresge, head of ATM and debit-card marketing at U.S. Bancorp. "But this way, if you want to get a cup of coffee at <a name="NASD:SBUX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15745"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Starbucks</b></a>, you don't have to use a twenty." Not for a small, anyway.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfronts<p>PRESUMED SOLVENT<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Tired of long lines at the bank? Weary of endless service fees? Don't get mad. Get a law degree.<p>When it comes to banking, the scales of justice definitely tip in favor of attorneys. Though it's not widely known outside law offices, banks frequently offer the legal set special treatment unheard of by folks who don't bill by the hour.<p>"We're here to help the 'time is money' crowd," says David Skinner, vice president of personal banking at <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a>. Perks can include a personal banking account executive, unsecured lines of credit, and jumbo mortgages. Standing in a bank line is out of the question, since the account executive handles all transactions.<p>Such niceties are usually extended to a bank's wealthiest depositors as a matter of course. But if your business card reads "attorney at law," many banks will roll out the red carpet regardless of your current income or assets--even to associates fresh out of law school.<p>"I pay no checking or ATM fees," chirps Anupam Chander, a 27-year-old associate at Cleary, Gottlieb, Steen & Hamilton, of his perk-ridden account with Citibank. "When I call my personal banker, she gets back to me the same day. It's a great setup." Indeed. But what do they do with all those free toasters? <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>LEE'S BIG AD VENTURE<p>By Stacie Stukin<p>Susan Powter beware: Lee Iacocca is about to join the insanity with his own infomercial. The retired <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> chairman will take to the airwaves this spring to pitch a videotape series, Iacocca on Success: It Can Happen to You. Granted, the quintessential "rags to riches" son of immigrants has earned the right to opine on success. But must Iacocca rub shoulders with Jay the Juiceman, Cher, and Vanna White to spread his motivational message? "He really wants to give something back to society," says his agent, Rick Bradley. Give and you shall receive is more like it: Iacocca plans to peddle his tapes at around $25 each. That should help augment the $500,000 annual stipend he gets as a consultant to Chrysler and the $60,000 he commands for individual speaking engagements. In addition, Iacocca sits on the board of Ronald Perelman's <a name="NASD:NWCG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17177"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New World Communications</b></a>, which owns more than one third of the outfit producing his power pitch. Rest assured, though, the production will be tasteful. Rather than gesticulate madly and roam a studio audience, Iacocca plans to segue from chats with guests to inspirational soliloquies--perhaps next to a cozy blazing fireplace. But even if the spectacle helps channel-surfing insomniacs tally the price of success, they may still wonder: What price dignity?<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>IS THAT SEAT TAKEN?
Forget season tickets: "Permanent" seating plans let you stake out your turf for good<p>By Bob Woods<p>Think that season ticket proves your loyalty to the hometown sports team? Maybe you should consider buying a seat for life.<p>That's the idea behind permanent seat licenses, a new scheme that lets die-hard fans purchase lifetime rights to designated seats. It's also the latest tactic for financing the construction of new sports facilities.<p>The idea has been pioneered by the Carolina Panthers, a new National Football League franchise in Charlotte, North Carolina, that will begin league play this fall. More than 52,000 Panther fans have signed up for permanent seat licenses costing from $600 to $6,400 each.<p>That's not as great a deal as it sounds. The seat licenses aren't actually season tickets. Instead, fans own the rights to their seats but must still purchase a season ticket each year.<p>The idea came about when Jerry Richardson, the owner of the Panthers, hired sports marketing whiz Max Muhleman to devise a plan to raise $100 million for construction of a Charlotte stadium. Without a facility, the NFL wouldn't grant the city a franchise.<p>Betting on the appetite of the hungry fan, the Panthers offered seat ownership in Carolinas Stadium, now under construction. Charlotte banks got into the act, too, offering special four-year fixed-rate loans at 8 percent. Some companies even extended financing to employees.<p>Not surprisingly, some other cities--including Tampa and Seattle--have begun eyeing permanent seating plans. And Muhleman is working on a similar program in St. Louis to help lure the Los Angeles Rams to town.<p>Speculators in stadium real estate are already talking about resale value, but for now, it's too early in the game. Owners are barred from selling the seats until 1997. <p><p><p>

						There's not likely to be much heavy breathing on New York City's latest 900 number. But moans may be heard, as folks discuss their tax dilemmas on this new CPA chat line. At $3.99 a minute, the service promises to "make taxes less taxing" by demystifying everything from estate issues to corporate refunds. But prepare before you call, because the meter will be running, advises Alan Reed, the CPA behind it all. "You have to know how to ask the right questions," he says. At Reed's suggestion, we anonymously hit him with a few tricky tax queries about home offices and real estate. "His advice was right on," says a fellow CPA whom we asked to vet the answers. But H&R Block needn't close up shop. This hotline could be costly for a filer with, say, overseas mutual funds. "It's in the same class as Dial-a-Doc," says Rick Telberg, editor at Accounting Today. "But what will kill you in taxes is what you don't know."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>HE SAID, SHE SUED, HE LOST
A court appeal may soon set the price of a broken engagement<p>By Gretchen Reynolds<p>The blissful engagement of Richard Austin Springs III and his love Sharon Wildey endured for exactly seven weeks in 1992. Then Springs, a wealthy 50-year-old Oregon cattle rancher, got cold feet, wrote his affianced--a 49-year-old Chicago lawyer--a Dear Sharon letter, and attempted, rather gracelessly, to fade from her life.<p>He was about to discover what real courting means.<p>In October 1992, Sharon Wildey sued Springs for breach of promise, an offense so antiquated that 18 states have stricken it from the books. To the astonishment of most legal scholars, Wildey won, and won big: In November 1993, a jury awarded her $178,000 for the financial costs--and pain and suffering--of having been jilted.<p>The case immediately became a minor cause celebre, with everyone from the Chicago Tribune to Dateline NBC focusing on its seeming absurdity. When the frenzy subsided, the idea of suing over a broken engagement seemed like yet another legal oddity.<p>But the real legacy of Wildey v. Springs is just now being shaped. Today the case sits before Chicago's Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals. A decision on whether to overturn is expected this month, just in time for Valentine's Day. And if the award to Wildey is upheld, the case may well be transformed from an oddity to a precedent.<p>Even now, the circumstances sound absurd. Wildey and Springs had known each other barely four months. And when Springs bolted, he left behind a $19,000 engagement ring and $10,000 in his Chicago checking account. Wildey kept both. Then she sued.<p>But there's more to the case than money (or even romantic reprisal). "Our legal system is slowly moving toward the notion that it has a significant role to play in regulating intimate relationships," says Jane Larson, a law professor at Northwestern University. "The Sharon Wildey case is a major milestone in that respect."<p>If it is a milestone, we may be on the wrong road, argues Katha Pollitt, a feminist scholar and writer. "People should be able to change their minds in questions of romance without penalty," she says. "Pain and suffering are part of life."<p>Many lawyers expect to see a rash of similar lawsuits if the award is upheld--possibly even the development of a new subset of family-practice law. "You once had to have a lawyer handle your divorce," says Barry Schatz, a prominent divorce attorney in Chicago. "Then you started to need one to draw up your prenuptial agreement. Will you need one now to handle the terms of your engagement?<p>"Call your friends when you are brokenhearted," Schatz advises. "But leave your lawyer out of it."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>DON'T BLAME SOCIETY. BLAME THE ACCOUNTANTS.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>This time, the IRS isn't just mad. It's very disappointed.<p>"It's bad," says Leslie Shapiro, the director of the office of practice at the IRS. "They have failed to meet their commitments as role models in society."<p>Violent criminals? Professional athletes? No, just more than 400 professional tax preparers, most of them certified public accountants, who've recently been nailed as nonfilers. And to no one's surprise, the IRS doesn't show a sense of humor when it comes to the pros.<p>Since March of 1993, Shapiro's department, which governs CPAs, attorneys, and enrolled agents who prepare taxes, has been sniffing through tax preparers' returns. Or lack thereof.<p>Shapiro concedes that "it's strange" that those who prepare taxes for a living would neglect to file their own. So what's their excuse? <p>They're only human, says Gerald Padwe, vice president of taxation at the American Institute of CPAs. "Sometimes a life-cycle event occurs that prevents a taxpayer from filing," Padwe says. For instance? "The death of a spouse would be one." Or maybe they've just been too busy with their clients' returns.<p>One excuse that definitely won't fly: I didn't have the right forms.<p><p><p>

Want to breed a better investment strategy? Try a computer model of evolution theory.<p>By Jim Melloan<p>In a quest to find the perfect investment strategy, some money-management firms have turned to a method with a track record of four billion years: evolution.<p>Using a science called artificial life, these firms subject potential investment approaches to stringent computer simulations. Different investment strategies are used to make simulated investment decisions based on historical market data. A financial struggle for survival ensues, with the winning strategies being those that make the most simulated money.<p>So far that sounds like standard Wall Street number-crunching. But rather than just sticking with those winners, the artificial-life approach takes the best strategies, "mutates" them slightly to produce a new generation, and runs them through the simulation again and again. Sophisticated genetic algorithms guide the strategies' evolution through countless repetitions.<p>"The number of possible strategies you can explore with this stuff is absolutely mind-boggling," says Richard J. Bauer, author of Genetic Algorithms and Investment Strategies, the first book on this fledgling field. "The other night I was at my PC exploring foreign-exchange trading rules, and I was sifting through about 35 billion possible rules."<p>For Redfire Capital Management Group, a tiny start-up investment firm in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the articifical-life approach has paid off. The company boasts of an 88 percent return for the first 11 months of 1994 using artificial-life strategies to trade stock-index options.<p>Redfire, with less than $100,000 under management, is small, but the approach has also captured the attention of First Quadrant Corp. in Pasadena, California, with about $16 billion in assets. First Quadrant now uses genetic algorithms to manage about $5 billion of that total.<p>For now, few others have tumbled to the method, and even fewer are willing to go public about it. Devotees are hoping artificial life remains their secret. As Redfire partner Michael de la Maza says, "We're very happy to keep it quiet."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>SO MUCH FOR THE BEAR MARKET
When traders slug it out in the pits, things can get ugly.<p>By Ted C. Fishman<p>Bulls and bears have always slugged it out at the Chicago Board of Trade. So when the Brookfield Zoo's polar bear mascot came prancing around the pits, naturally a trader belted him -- it was practically a conditioned response. <p>Under the fur, however, was an actor playing bear to promote an Endangered Species Fund picnic. The mascot was rushed to a first-aid station, where he was treated briefly. <p>The ursiphobic trader, J. Allen Jorjorian, popped the bear on a $25 bet and now may face sanctions from the CBOT's conduct committee. Jorjorian, who didn't return our calls, was working in the CBOT's financial-futures room -- home of the infamous U.S. Treasury bond pit. Members often complain that the overcrowded pit makes them ornery, and there have been previous cases of violence. <p>Zoo workers can be a tad ornery, too: They've suggested promoting next year's picnic by sending Arki, their real polar bear, into the T bond pit -- dressed like a trader. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>ROUGH SAILING
A young American says he's buying Aristotle Onassis's former yacht. The owner disagrees.<p>By James Gorant<p>In February, Alexander Blastos's ship seemed to have come in. The little-known Greek-American businessman had agreed to pay $2.2 million for the mothballed yacht once owned by billionaire Aristotle Onassis -- and promised to spend a further $40 million fixing it up for charter cruising.<p>But now Blastos's deal appears to have been scuttled and the 29-year-old has headed for Europe, leaving anger and questions in his wake. Several people involved in the transaction believe Blastos grossly exaggerated his wealth, duping everyone along the way -- including the Greek government, which has owned the boat since receiving it as a gift from Onassis's daughter Christina.<p>Blastos is hard to find. His relatives in Keene, New Hampshire, say they don't know where he is. But in a telephone interview peppered with grandiose boasts, the putative millionaire insists his deal hasn't fallen through: It's just awaiting some "paperwork." He gamely pledges to boost his budget for restoring the Argo, which Onassis called the Christina, to a stunning $80 million.<p>Blastos won't be cruising on the Argo anytime soon, however. "The sale is off," confirms a spokesman at the Greek embassy in Washington, D.C. "There were questions that Blastos didn't have the finances." As a result, German shipyard Blohm & Voss presumably won't get to refit the yacht for Blastos, a lucrative job that would have included fixing the hydraulics that transform the mosaic-tiled dance floor into a swimming pool. And famed yacht designer Luigi Sturchio won't oversee the restoration project as planned. Neither the shipyard nor Sturchio would comment.<p>It's the latest humiliation for a boat with a glorious past. The Argo is one of the world's largest and most famous yachts. Originally a Canadian navy frigate, the vessel was bought by Onassis and remade in opulent style with gold faucets and original art works by El Greco and Gauguin. The Greek tycoon used the Christina to entertain guests such as Greta Garbo, Frank Sinatra, and Winston Churchill; in 1968, he honeymooned aboard the yacht with Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis.<p>After the billionaire's death in 1975, Onassis's daughter donated the Christina to his home country, which dubbed it the Argo and used it for official purposes. But high operating costs made such outings infrequent. The boat hasn't been used since 1987 and is now in serious disrepair.<p>Blastos's interest, therefore, came as a welcome development. Styling himself a money manager who had thrived on hot stocks and other investments, the Greek-American talked a good game. But trouble surfaced in June, when Greek news reports quoted a lawyer in the deal claiming that Blastos's deposit check had bounced. Blastos says there was never such a check. The Greek government won't comment on any of this or give details about how the deal unraveled.<p>Blastos's true financial status is hard to assess. He says he built his wealth starting as a preteen, got "phenomenally lucky" in the stock market, and branched into other areas. But according to the editor of his hometown newspaper, the Keene Sentinel, many of these stories simply don't hang together. "There's always some truth to what he says," says James Rousmaniere Jr. "But as to what percentage, you're left hanging."<p>Rousmaniere says he tracked down a number of the projects on which Blastos claims to have gotten rich, including auto sales to Japan and a fruit-processing plant in Mexico. "By his account he was very high up in these projects," says the editor. "But when you talk to others who were involved, you discover that sometimes he's not even clearly remembered."<p>Untroubled by such comments -- or by Greece's insistence that the Argo deal is dead -- Blastos says he's now moving on to the next stage of his career: shipping. "I'm on my way to Greece tomorrow to finalize the purchase of two ships." <p><p><p>

In the wake of O.J.'s freeway ride, buyers aren't bucking Broncos.<p>By Abby Ellin<p>Entrepreneurs hawking O.J. t-shirts aren't the only ones making money off the sordid Simpson saga. Count in Ford dealers on the West Coast, who report a rush on "O.J. Simpson Broncos." <p>Nationwide, Bronco sales surged 24 percent from June to August, but a Ford spokesman says it's because the company began offering rebates two weeks before Simpson fled police in a Bronco on June 17. "It has nothing to do with O.J. Simpson," he says testily. <p>In Southern California, however, the link is unmistakable. Bronco sales are up almost 65 percent from last year, and dealers say it has plenty to do with the accused murderer. "That car looked good going down the freeway," says Scott Strotz, sales manager at Kemp Ford in Thousand Oaks. <p>While all types of Bronco are flying off dealers' lots, the biggest prize is the white XLT with tan interior. That's about $29,000 to emulate the Juice -- not counting mobile phone. It seems some dealers even have offered "O.J. specials." Predictably, that trend started on the West Coast too. "People in the East have better taste," says a California dealer who's almost out of Broncos.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>FEELING THE HEAT
Fire walker and self-help guru Tony Robbins finds himself dragged across the legal coals.<p>By Christopher Byron<p>In the world of infomercials, no one delivers a message with more punch than Anthony Robbins. The personal-improvement pitchman is perhaps the most successful television guru ever, generating about $30 million a year from products sold on his Personal Power shows -- and at least as much again from seminars.<p>Robbins's schtick is familiar enough, a warmed-over but powerful mix of techniques from Dale Carnegie to Werner Erhard. In a California twist, he earned his superstar rep in part by herding hundreds of pumped-up, barefoot disciples across beds of burning coals.<p>Beyond all the motivational talk, Robbins mostly sells his own image to fans. A handsome, six-foot-seven-inch man who lives in a castle overlooking the Pacific and oversees a Fantasy Island-type resort in Fiji, Robbins portrays himself as the embodiment of all that follows when people use his "technology" -- a series of lectures offered via audiocassette, on videotape, or in person.<p>But in fact, Tony Robbins has had some trouble winning friends and influencing people lately. He continues to settle lawsuits from franchisees who accuse him of deception. An effort to build a financial-planning business has ended. And most recently, Robbins was accused of fraud in legal action by Guthy-Renker, the company that helped craft the Robbins image.<p>That fight centered on Robbins's infomercials. Guthy-Renker, which produces the shows, claimed Robbins tried to extort money by blocking its latest release. It sought $3.3 million in actual damages, plus $5 million as punishment for Robbins. Brad Hunsaker, Robbins's top lawyer, says the holdup came after a disgruntled Guthy-Renker employee told Robbins he was being mistreated by the production company. The resulting spat could have made for juicy revelations about both parties' finances, but at press time it seemed headed for a hush-hush settlement.<p>Meanwhile, Hunsaker himself plays a key role in another of Robbins's financial headaches: a continuing flow of damaging lawsuits from peeved franchisees. In a scheme devised around 1989, the guru's organization charged entrepreneurs for the right to show taped Robbins seminars to large crowds. That largely proved a bust. But instead of shutting down the operation, Robbins merely changed its concept slightly and flogged franchises all over again. The new system wasn't a roaring success either.<p>In lawsuits, licensees have charged that Robbins deceived them about their ventures' prospects and exclusivity. Ironically, among their best weapons is a blistering internal memo written by Hunsaker. In that 1990 document, known to some lawyers but disclosed widely for the first time here, Hunsaker mentions "obvious misrepresentations that were made during the early part of our history."<p>The smoking-gun memo became evidence in a franchisee suit filed against Robbins in Georgia, where a judge ordered sanctions against the Robbins organization for lying in court papers. The case was settled out of court -- and other settlements have followed as Robbins's network has dwindled to 20 licensees from more than 50. The most recent payoff came late this summer after a Texas franchisee named Cindy Chambers sued, saying she was duped and that Robbins himself unfairly poached on her territory.<p>Meanwhile, Robbins continues to suffer setbacks in other areas. Destiny Financial Services, an effort to manage his disciples' money, quietly fell apart last year after a three-year joint effort with San Diego stockbroker David D'Arcangelo. This summer Destiny's remnants were swallowed by Rodman & Renshaw, a Chicago brokerage firm. D'Arcangelo now pitches his new employer's services from Robbins's office building in San Diego.<p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>CARBON COPIES
Synthetic-diamond merchant Tom Chatham tries to add a new facet to the gem trade.<p>Thomas Chatham may soon be a girl's best friend, but he's the diamond industry's worst nightmare. Head of the largest synthetic-gem company in the U.S., he plans to unveil a line of affordable man-made diamonds next year -- a move that could turn the $11.5 billion diamond business on its ear.<p>Synthetic gems aren't fakes; they're real stones, grown in a laboratory instead of being formed under the earth's surface. The technology was pioneered by <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Electric</b></a> for industrial use in the 1950s but has never been applied to the consumer diamond market. Chatham's new synthetics would be produced in Siberia, where Russian scientists have been working on man-made diamonds for some time.<p>According to Chatham, his plan has already roiled some big players -- notably <a name="NASD:DBRSY"></a><b>De Beers Consolidated Mines</b>, which keeps a tight grip on the world's diamond supply. "He's treading on some major toes," says industry analyst Joel Arem.<p>De Beers says it's not worried about Chatham, the 48-year-old president of Chatham Creative Gems. Gem-quality synthetic diamonds will never take off, says a De Beers spokesman: They're uneconomical to make and too yellow in color. Some industry figures disagree -- although many synthetics are yellow, white diamonds are easy enough to grow, says Robert Hazen, a scientist at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C.<p>What's more, some Siberian synthetics have already been found mixed into parcels of natural Russian stones: The Gemological Institute of America says it recently detected several examples. GIA research manager Emmanuel Fritsch says the numbers so far are "minuscule," and the synthetic stones can be detected with proper equipment.<p>But Chatham's stones are effectively identical to natural diamonds -- unlike faux gems, they're equal in hardness and refractivity to their natural siblings. And at $700 a carat wholesale, Chatham figures prospective newlyweds won't care that a rock is man-made. "Seven thousand dollars is a lot to spend on a symbol," he says.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>100 GRAND<p>The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000 -- imaginary, we're afraid -- on five items. Usually we hate to accept second place, but this month we celebrate it by focusing on TV sidekicks. Andy Richter keeps the love seat warm for "Late Night" host Conan O'Brien. Ed McMahon, king of second bananas and current host of "Star Search," spent 30 years announcing "Heeeere's Johnny." And comedian Howard Feller has snared a regular gig on the newly syndicated "Jon Stewart Show" after years in stand-up.<p>ANDY RICHTER<p>-> $30,000 for two years of graduate school at New York University for wife Sarah Thyre, who's studying Old English.<p>-> $15,000 for his next vacation. "I'd go to Japan just basically to eat. Then I would go to Greece just basically to swim."<p>-> $20,000 toward a "modest" vacation home by the ocean.<p>-> $25,000 to clear up his credit rating. "No bank would give me a loan on the vacation home until I do that."<p>-> $10,000 for his family and his wife's family. "If I didn't give them a chunk of it, they'd never let that go."<p><p>ED McMAHON<p>-> $15,000 for a one-day spending spree in New York City with his six children -- including nine-year-old Katherine Mary -- and three grandchildren.<p>-> $35,000 for a blowout week in Paris with wife Pam.<p>-> $15,000 for a cruise in the Mediterranean.<p>-> $15,000 for a visit to the Canyon Ranch in Arizona "so my wife and I can get back on track with exercise and fat-free diets after all that vacation."<p>-> $20,000 for the Muscular Dystrophy Association and for St. Jude's Ranch for Children in Boulder City, Nevada.<p><p>HOWARD FELLER<p>-> $23,000 to hire a hit man to kill his Uncle Fred. "I like him well enough, but he didn't buy me a sled when I was eight years old."<p>-> $24,000 to hire a hit man to find and kill Billy Pearson. "That was the guy who used to beat me up when I was in fifth grade."<p>-> $50,000 for a red BMW to cruise the streets for well-endowed women.<p>-> $2,900 for a television, VCR, lots of videos, and cable hookup. "But before all that, I guess, I really should get my apartment wired for electricity."<p>-> $100 for socks.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>SHARON'S STONES
Tales from Harry Winston, where the stars go to borrow jewels.<p>In truth, we're tired of actress Sharon Stone and her jewels. After getting grief for wanting to keep a $400,000 "loaner" necklace from Beverly Hills jeweler Harry Winston, Stone now is suing the store for $12 million, claiming breach of contract. Tacky.<p>Still, we're weirdly fascinated by Winston's jewelry-lending practice. Turns out the store has handed over (and gotten back) diamonds worth as much as $3 million at a time. That was for Elizabeth Taylor, but lesser stars such as Patti LaBelle have paraded in $2 million sapphire-diamond combos lent by Winston.<p>Like many tony stores, Winston likes loaners because its name gets dropped in those gushing descriptions (hair! dress! shoes!) of guests at gala events. A Winston shopping list from the 1994 Academy Awards -- all safely returned:<p>-> Dolly Parton: Diamond necklace and earrings ($750,000)<p>-> Rosie O'Donnell: Sapphire-and-diamond necklace, diamond cluster earrings ($550,000)<p>-> Marisa Tomei: Diamond earring-and-bracelet set ($400,000)<p>-> Laura Dern: Diamond drop earrings, bracelet, and ring ($250,000)<p>-> Winona Ryder: Diamond necklace and cluster earrings ($100,000)<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>PLASTIC SOLDIER
One man's credit-card crusade.<p>Forget those frequent-buyer deals on credit cards. George Brennan has found a better way to get money back: He hauls stores into small-claims court after using his credit card. <p>The Californian retiree has made more than $7,000 since early 1993 by suing stores that ask for personal info -- such as his address -- when he pays with plastic. Gathering such data is illegal in 12 states, since it might be used by fraudsters. <p>Brennan was once ripped off this way; now he styles himself an avenger, prevailing over retailers including <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:SME"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11342"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Service Merchandise</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:CC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10343"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Circuit City</b></a>. He's not alone in his crusade: Several stores have settled class-action suits. <p>Still, Brennan's litigious shtick may be wearing thin. "He just goes around making purchases, suing the stores, then returning the items," says an exasperated James Brooks, an Orange County judge who recently tossed out such a case. Brennan remains unbowed.

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>LIVE FAST, DIE YOUNG - PAU UP
Two insurers challenge River Phoenix's estate -- and a Hollywood tradition:  Actors who try to hide their drug and health problems.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>When River Phoenix died of a drug overdose last year, the young actor was mourned as a lost talent -- the James Dean of his generation. But Phoenix's true legacy in Hollywood may have more to do with movie economics than with tragic romanticism. In part because of two little-noticed lawsuits against Phoenix's estate, actors with drug and health problems may soon find it harder to get work.<p>As usual in Tinseltown, it all comes down to money. When Phoenix died, two insurance companies paid nearly $5.7 million to the producers of two movies he was acting in at the time, "Dark Blood" and "Interview With the Vampire." Phoenix was replaced in his "Interview" role by Christian Slater, but "Dark Blood" had to be scrapped entirely.<p>Now the insurance companies are suing Phoenix's estate to get their money back. CNA International and American Casualty claim Phoenix violated his contracts for the movies by lying when he said he didn't do drugs. That's an unusually tough stand, but it has won support from other insurers. And it's souring the clubby atmosphere on movie sets, where many stars routinely file false medical reports.<p>Post-Phoenix, insurers are insisting that movie producers prove that actors are truly drug-free and healthy -- or face sky-high premiums. One industry official estimates that cast-insurance costs have swollen tenfold since Phoenix's death and won't settle down until insurers' demands are met.<p>In addition to a physical examination, many insurers now want major stars to submit to blood and urine tests, an electrocardiogram, and a chest exam. The old procedure merely called for a bill of health from each actor's personal physician. "Demi Moore, Bruce Willis, and Sylvester Stallone just went through all that [testing] for a picture," says Marty Fink, president of Complete Film, a unit of Carolco Pictures. "They didn't like it one bit."<p>But a look at the Phoenix case shows why such measures might be wise. Phoenix's medical certificate for both films, signed by the star and his doctor, Michael Klaper, states that Phoenix never used "LSD, heroin, cocaine, alcohol in excess, or any other narcotic, depressant, stimulant, or psychedelic." That was in August 1993, when Phoenix was deeply into the drug scene, according to many reports. Only two months later, the 23-year-old Phoenix collapsed and died with a cocktail of drugs including cocaine in his blood.<p>It isn't known whether Phoenix's estate could afford to reimburse the insurers -- his will has been sealed -- but the companies' claims are "groundless" in any case, says a lawyer for Arlyn Phoenix, the actor's mother and executor of his estate.<p>Phoenix's death isn't the only force behind insurers' newly tough attitude. Another huge claim, about $14.5 million, was paid by Fireman's Fund after actor John Candy died of heart failure while filming Wagons East in March. Candy apparently wasn't formally examined before he was insured for the role. If a doctor had seen him, say several experts, he likely would have received only limited coverage -- saving Fireman's a bundle.<p>Besides being famously obese, Candy smoked and had gained about 40 pounds just before filming began. Heart disease ran in his family. Actors with such obvious problems may soon be just as hard to employ as stars with heroin habits.<p>The insurance crackdown will likely cause some confrontations in an industry where unhealthy living and inflated egos are the norm. "Some big stars won't even see a physician," says Carolyn Norton, of insurance broker Hogg Robinson. Compliance could become a union issue: "We'd be concerned if insurance companies started making outrageous demands," says a spokesman for the Screen Actors Guild.<p>But most observers think the insurers will get their way -- and that actors who don't comply will find themselves banished to infomercialville. Says Scott Taylor, a showbiz-insurance broker: "This sends a message to stars who think they're untouchable."<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>LAST CALL?
One man fights to get beer commercials canned -- as deceptive advertising.<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Television beer commercials have never been big on realism -- their dumb bikini fantasies are the last bastion of unreconstructed manhood. But if a former policeman has his way, those ads full of babes and stunts will soon be ruled illegal.<p>Richard Overton is suing beer giant <a name="NYSE:BUD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Anheuser-Busch</b></a> for deceptive advertising. At first glance his argument seems simple-minded: Beer drinking isn't just babes and stunts, says Overton, so it's illegal to portray it as such.<p>But Overton, a college recruiter, is no frustrated party animal. He's just worried about the lopsided effect all these glamorous ads have on kids -- including his own. His case is now before Michigan's Supreme Court.<p>Overton saw his share of drunken fights and car wrecks as a state trooper. He thinks beer ads would be better if they carried a disclaimer -- "The people depicted are not under the influence of alcohol," for instance. But mostly he wants them ruled deceptive as a matter of law. "I have yet to find a good legal mind that disagrees with me," he says.<p>Well, actually, a few judges have disagreed with him: Overton has lost every round in court so far. Still, he vows to press on. "This is a bombshell waiting to explode" under the beer industry, he says. Unsurprisingly, Anheuser-Busch says the case has no merit.<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>This Deal's a Turkey
Or maybe not -- if you believe we'll be eating McOstrich burgers anytime soon, that is.<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Ostrich farming is taking off: Some 75,000 of the flightless birds are now being raised on 4,000 ranches nationwide, roughly a threefold increase since 1991. Ostriches are being touted all over as the next hot investment opportunity.<p>But if a big marketer of ostrich partnerships is any example, this business is strictly for the birds. Beecroft Young Interest Ltd., a Dallas-based firm, cold-calls many investors at home. Its story is alluring: "On a $10,000 investment, you'll easily get $100,000 back."<p>Small wonder BYI has sold out its first three ostrich ventures. But while BYI and its rancher make money, others are likely to be disappointed. Ostrich investing looks like a pyramid that's due for collapse. Already this year the Securities and Exchange Commission has shut down one Florida ostrich partnership; in California, state officials halted another venture.<p>The idea behind the current boom is that Americans will eat all these birds -- ostrich is touted as a low-fat, low-cholesterol red meat. But experts say a change in U.S. eating habits is doubtful at best. "It's more likely the Messiah will come," says Steven Kaplan, editor of Food and Food Ways magazine. Last year, 6,000 pounds of ostrich meat were sold in the U.S. At 80 pounds of meat per ostrich, that's a measly 75 birds.<p>What's more, ostrich meat is five times as expensive as beef. And U.S. investors buy birds for far more than they cost in South Africa, where ostrich meat is accepted as food. "Ostriches are being bred here mostly so they can be sold to other breeders," says Mitchell Hurwitz, a Dallas financial consultant who studied one BYI deal for Worth. "The whole thing appears based on the greater-fool theory -- like tulip mania," a Dutch investment fad that blossomed and withered in the 17th century.<p>Even without such caveats, though, many partnerships are unlikely to pan out. BYI's North Bend Ostrich Venture II deal is fairly typical. NBOV II raised $500,000 to buy 11 pairs of ostriches. Investors paid $10,000 for a 1.5 percent share of any income the birds produced. <p>Among the deal's problems:<p>-> In its brochure, BYI fails to mention that 25 percent of all new chicks are given free to the rancher, reducing returns. This fact is buried in a deal memo that BYI provided only grudgingly, after repeated requests.<p>-> BYI projects that its breeders will produce 28 or so chicks a year. A quarter go to the ranch; half of the remainder will be sold, the rest kept to raise the number of breeders. But an expert at North Carolina State University says ostriches have only 10 to 15 healthy chicks a year.<p>-> In its telephone sales pitch, BYI says it deals in "insured investments." But investors' stakes in NBOV II aren't insured -- just the ostriches are.<p>Mike Young, a principal in BYI, defends the deal and doesn't back off BYI's "conservative" projections. He concedes the ostrich market is "similar to a pyramid." But by the time prices fall, he says, his investors will likely have made a bundle. <p>Hurwitz, by contrast, says BYI investors may break even in two or three years -- if greater fools keep buying overpriced ostriches. That seems quite a gamble, but for now ostrich mania continues unabated. At press time, BYI was pushing a fourth partnership.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>CHIPPED TEETH
Yet another reason to hate going to the dentist.<p>By David A. Andelman<p>It may be inevitable, but it's still creepy: the move to implant microchips in people's bodies as identification devices. Dentists like the idea; near-indestructible teeth are the perfect location for a high-tech dog tag. Now the Food and Drug Administration may take up the issue -- there's a study to see if chips might be included in breast implants, for example. <p>The technology was pioneered to identify animals. Vets charge about $30 to inject a rice-grain-size microchip between an animal's shoulders. When a special reader is held close, the chip emits a code that matches an entry in a database. <p>Almost 1 million pets now can be identified this way if they're lost or stolen. The first Chiclet-size chip was implanted in a horse 15 years ago; shrinking electronics have created a healthy market for ID companies such as Avid and InfoPet. <p>InfoPet's chip has already been tested in human bridgework, according to vice president Jay Culberth. Culberth says implants could alert doctors to vital medical conditions, as well as identify dead bodies. One snag: Unlike dog tags, removing a chip requires surgery. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>CHEAP THRILLS
A literary novelist shouts down his muse and listens instead to the siren song of lucre.<p>By D.T. Max<p>What's an acclaimed literary novelist doing writing a brutal, trashy thriller called "Father's Day"?<p>Selling out, of course. And he's not ashamed to admit it.<p>At age 34, John Calvin Batchelor saw his second book reviewed on the front page of the New York Times Book Review. But after four more well-received novels, he was still barely making a living. So Batchelor, now 46, began planning a huge payday.<p>His strategy was as closely plotted as the bravura opening of Father's Day, in which the U.S. Army launches an assault on Air Force One. First Batchelor studied the plots of classic political thrillers: "Fail-safe," "Advise and Consent," "Six Days of the Condor." For a model, he finally settled on "Seven Days in May" -- the 1963 movie version, in which a paranoid Burt Lancaster plots against the president. With a slight spin, Batchelor devised a "high concept" any Hollywood player would love: " 'Seven Days in May,' only this time the president dies."<p>Then he set out to dumb down his style to thrive in Tom Clancy territory. His tactics:<p>-> Use short paragraphs, short scenes with cutaway endings, and lots of acronyms.<p>-> Include many ambiguous, testosterone-laced conversations.<p>-> Call sympathetic characters by their first names, unsympathetic ones by their last names.<p>-> Always have characters think in italics.<p>Is Batchelor abashed at such crass calculation? Not even slightly. "This book made me rich," he says, reached in Maine as he surveys some oceanfront property he may buy with the $1.25 million he says he got from Cinergi for film rights.<p>Besides, Batchelor is rather pleased with the craft in "Father's Day," which will be released this month. "You have to be a highly trained professional to even attempt such a novel," he says. Take the battle for Air Force One. "In Hollywood, they call that the 'money scene,' " he says. "I dare you to find a better one."<p><p><p>

100 GRAND<p>
The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000 -- imaginary, we're afraid -- on five items. This month we tapped three writers who find their romance in nightmares. Clive Barker's latest horror novel, "Everville," is out this month; he's also directing a movie, "The Lord of Illusions." Up-and-comer Poppy Z. Brite writes erotic horror from her home in New Orleans; her "Drawing Blood" was just released in paperback. Peter Straub, the best-selling author of "Koko," is at work on a psychosexual thriller called "American Nights."
---------------<p>
CLIVE BARKER<p>
-> $25,000 to anybody who can locate the Marquis de Sade's bones.<p>
-> $20,000 to the Samhain Society, which wants to make Halloween -- not Christmas -- the most important festival of the year. "A worthy cause."<p>
-> $20,000 to anybody who can provide diagrams for a genuinely new sexual perversion.<p>
-> $10,000 to erect a monument at his old school in Liverpool. "It'd say: To all the teachers who said I'd never get by without a working knowledge of mathematics."<p>
-> $25,000 to anyone who can raise the devil.<p>
POPPY Z. BRITE<p>
-> $50,000 to travel abroad with a couple of friends, eating weird things, buying a new wardrobe, and shipping lots of books home.<p>
-> $2,000 to work out post-travel kinks with a black-leather massage chair from the Sharper Image.<p>
-> $7,500 for three caviar blowouts -- chilled vodka and tip included, of course.<p>
-> $5,000 for a complete CD-ROM computer system. "Just so I can never get any work done."<p>
-> $35,500 to install a padded dungeon in her home, fully equipped "for those important muscle-toning exercises."<p>
PETER STRAUB<p>
-> $30,000 for a first edition of Ernest Hemingway's first book, "Three Stories and Ten Poems." "That's for myself."<p>
-> $30,000 for an Elizabeth Murray painting -- a gift for his wife, Susan.<p>
-> $19,000 for "inspirational fuel" that'll help him work better, a category that includes compact discs and fresh-cut flowers.<p>
-> $600 for lunch with his wife and three good friends at Lespinasse, a classy restaurant in New York City.<p>
-> $20,400 as a donation to the Gay Men's Health Crisis, to help fight AIDS.<p>

						By Monica Corcoran<p>Next up: The human billboard? <p>Basketball bruiser Anthony Mason set minds ticking at the NBA finals when his coif drew almost as much interest as the action. For different games, Mason had his team's name--Knicks--and "In God's hands" neatly shaved into his locks. Ad folks' natural response: Why not the distinctive logo of his sponsor, Adidas? One wag even suggested that Mason just ditch a few letters from Knicks and sell the space to Nickelodeon, the cable channel known as "Nick." Would Mason sculpt his scalp for profit? "We haven't rented out Anthony's head yet," says his agent. "But we'd consider it." Unfortunately, the NBA says that would violate the rules. Still, the idea of body ads has huge potential. Tennis has no restrictions on anatomical adornment: Can we expect Andre Agassi to lease his stubble to <a name="NASD:CANNY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41862"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Canon</b></a>--or Pete Sampras to flex his marketing muscle by tattooing a <a name="NYSE:NKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14254"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nike</b></a> swoosh on his bicep? "It wouldn't be favorably received," sniffs a tour supervisor for the Association of Tennis Professionals. Still, says Brian Murphy, editor of The Sports Marketing Letter, such ads may be the wave of the future. "Think about beach volleyball," he says. "Those broad vistas of unadorned flesh." <p><p><p>

						It's tough being a Supreme: decisions, decisions. Still, who knew that one of the choices would be whether to take freebies that'll later show up on financial disclosure forms? Luckily, our justices weren't intimidated. And we were intrigued by some  of the gifts and donations they accepted: items of clothing, for example. (No pelican briefs, alas.) Yes, we asked David Souter to tell us more about Patricia Andrews. He declined to comment.
---------------<p>THE JUSTICE: Anthony Kennedy
THE GIFT: $400 worth of shirts.<p>
THE JUSTICE: Sandra Day O'Connor
THE GIFT: Bust of General Omar Bradley.<p>
THE JUSTICE: Clarence Thomas
THE GIFT: Bust of Churchill; $150 worth of cigars; $125 worth of suspenders.<p>
THE JUSTICE: David Souter
THE GIFT: Two paintings from Patricia Andrews.<p>
THE JUSTICE: John Paul Stevens
THE GIFT: Lots of honorary memberships. This is one popular guy.<p><p><p>

An economist draws on financial arcana for clues on making money in art.<p>Bu Jim Melloan<p>After the great art crash of 1990, many people would prefer never to see the words art and investment in the same sentence again. But a few hardy souls still see potential profit in Picassos.<p>The latest pitch comes from Roger Stiles, a London art-market economist who takes his cue from the world of derivatives and other financial instruments. Stiles, 33, has designed several products that allow high rollers to invest in art without ever  having to store a canvas.<p>Already an American brokerage house has participated in Stiles's idea for a complex "art swap." In essence, the brokerage took ownership of a big art collection but agreed to pay a fee based on the art's current value to the previous owner, a  strapped English celebrity. (Stiles won't name names.) In return, the celebrity agreed to maintain the works -- which include a Rembrandt, a Matisse, and a Picasso -- and gradually sell them to third parties, with the U.S. brokerage getting any  profit if the art's value appreciates. Stiles's firm, Fine Art Investments, gets a cut from the celebrity.<p>By taking the swap, the U.S. company is betting that the collection will benefit as the art market improves. Also, the art may fetch more than its assessed value if the works are sold one by one, rather than in a single auction. Some experts  ridicule the idea. "An outrageous concept," says Chicago dealer Paul Gray. Huffs William Grampp, author of Pricing the Priceless: "Anyone who tries to buy and sell art for profit should have his head examined."<p>But Stiles, who boasts a degree in econometrics and forecasting, is undaunted. Indeed, the former official for Christie's in London continues to develop a related investment idea -- his Art Securities Index, a sort of Dow Jones Industrial Average  for the art world.<p>The ASI, based on the share values of publicly traded art dealers and auction houses, is supposed to be a proxy for the health of the top 10 percent of the fine-art market. There have been other art-market indexes; Sotheby's published one from 1975  to 1992, for instance. But Stiles apparently is the first to encourage investors to bet on the direction of his index. Privately offered ASI options would help investors hedge big purchases, he says, or play the art market without getting paint on  their fingers.<p><p><p>

Threats of a baseball strike affect another national pastime -- rotisserie leagues.<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>Ball teams and broadcasters aren't the only ones who spent summer scrambling to deal with the threat of a strike by Major League Baseball players. Well-known names from billionaire Bill Gates to rock star Meat Loaf were also maneuvering to avoid getting caught in the squeeze play.<p>That's because a strike, which at press time seemed likely to hit in late August or early September, could rock the $150 million industry that has grown up around "fantasy baseball." Over the past decade, the addictive pastime has spawned statistical services, magazines, a weekly newspaper -- even a pay-per-view television show.<p>In fantasy baseball, also called rotisserie-league baseball, participants match talent-scouting abilities by assembling imaginary teams made up of real major-league players. The concept was dreamed up in 1980 by a group of journalists hanging out at  New York's now-defunct Le Rotisserie Francaise.<p>Now that there's big money to be had, major companies such as <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> are getting into the game. Gates's huge software concern began offering its Complete Baseball service with much fanfare in June. A mixture of history, stats, and daily updates  from an on-line service, Complete Baseball is nifty enough. But it came to market late -- halfway through the current season, when most rotisserie leagues were already well under way. Sales may be damped by the prospect of a truncated season, and  "if there were an extended strike, losses [on Complete Baseball] could be heavy," says product manager David Malcolm. <p>That would be an unusual defeat for Gates, hardly known for striking out.<p>Another big name with plenty on the line is Meat Loaf. Meat, as he's known, is a rotisserie-league junkie: He has participated in 30 leagues in the past three years, winning 20 of them. He's also been negotiating to buy a fantasy-baseball service to  which he has subscribed for four years -- Baseball Manager, offered on the Prodigy on-line service.<p>"I don't have a clue about what I'll do" if the players go out on strike, says Meat. "Fantasy leagues are my escape."<p>Also affected would be New York governor Mario Cuomo, a talented rotisserie player who would face an unaccustomed loss if the strike proceeds. By July, Cuomo's team was well out of contention in his fantasy league, says team co-owner Marty Steadman.  Cuomo and Steadman probably need a complete season if they're to catch up. But Cuomo has been "so busy with legislation and his reelection effort that he may not be too upset" by a poor showing, Steadman says.<p>Meanwhile, many small businesses -- particularly those that supply the statistics that fuel fantasy baseball -- may go belly-up in a strike. "Millons and millions of dollars could be lost in this industry," says Lew Fidler, president of the  Rotisserie League Baseball Association.<p>Fantasy-league customers are expected to ask for refunds in droves, fouling up stat companies' finances. John Kavanagh, a San Francisco lawyer who has written extensively on rotisserie baseball, says he'd advise small stats services to file for  bankruptcy so they don't get wiped out by litigation.<p>To be sure, some companies have emergency plans. The service Meat Loaf wants to buy, for example, will reuse stats from earlier in the season if there's a strike. STATS Inc., a big statistics provider that's part-owned by billionaire Paul Allen,  Gates's fellow Microsoft founder, plans to conduct make-believe games using stats from previous years. "The games will have everything from injuries to home runs," says director of marketing Ross Schaufelberger. TV's ESPN may even run highlights  that have been spliced together from old footage.<p>Other coping strategies range from the sensible -- asking rotisserie leaguers to "draft" players from the minor leagues -- to the unusual. One league, for instance, will ask participants to draft TV shows and follow the Nielsen ratings in lieu of  batting averages. "I bet Seinfeld goes in the first round," says John Hunt, who writes a Baseball Weekly column for rotisserie-league junkies.<p><p>

Why the Bond Market is Breaking the Rules<p>By Gregory Millman<p>When the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates, as it began doing in February, long-term rates should come down. Why? Because such a move indicates the Fed is on the job fighting inflation -- a signal to investors that they can stop worrying about the value of their long-term investments.<p>Recently, however, investors haven't been following this script,. In the spring, when the Fed nudged up short-term interest rates, long-term rates surged and prices plunged.<p>An analysis at the Fed suggests a troubling explanation: Widespread use of derivatives may have made the bond market less likely to follow the rules of the past. If true, this is bad news for investors trying to gauge the direction of rates.<p>The Fed acknowledges that fears of inflation weren't entirely extinguished by its efforts to boost short-term rates earlier this year. But it also implicates investors who bought mortgage-backed securities -- often through mutual funds.<p>On the surface, mortgage-backed securities seem fairly innocuous. They are derivatives created by Wall Street firms by repackaging household mortgages. An investor buys the flow of interest and principal payments on a group of mortgages.<p>So how did these securities end up distorting bond prices? The Fed study notes that when interest rates began rising, homeowners stopped refinancing. This, in turn, meant that investors in mortgage-backed securities could count on a longer flow of interest and principal payments, which, in effect, turned these securities into longer-term instruments.<p>Money managers try to insure their investments against the risk created by rising interest rates. They do this by shorting bonds of a similar maturity. In this case, that meant that fund managers had to short longer-term Treasurys to balance the government-backed securities. That drove down the price of ten-year bonds and drove up long rates.<p>Patricia Mosser, the Fed economist who led the study, was surprised by the findings. If this one kind of derivative could have unexpectedly changed the shape of interest rates, what other surprises might lurk in the market? <p><p><p><p>

For a corps of professional strikebreakers, it's not just a job -- it's an adventure.<p>By Vincent Coppola<p>Corporate cutbacks and activist unions have helped fuel a rise in labor disputes -- and a healthy business for Zipper Allen. That's too bad, because when Allen works, he's often a target for curses, rocks, and worse.<p>Allen is a sign of the times: a professional strikebreaker. The retired Green Beret sergeant major -- once known to labor leaders as Colonel Klink, real first name Howard -- is founder of Falcon Global, a Pennsylvania security firm that companies  use when things get rough. Falcon bases its business on Allen's talent for raising small armies from the 150 former Special Forces soldiers he says he keeps on call, not to mention numerous weight lifters, bouncers, and sundry other muscleheads -- including a 450-pound Samoan. "We're the outsiders everybody hates," Allen says. "You know what? We're willing to take it."<p>Allen and two other Vietnam vets founded Falcon in 1991; credit cards funded its first year. After handling a brutal coal-miners' strike in 1993, however, its business boomed. Since then, clients have included major corporations such as <a name="NYSE:TXT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11466"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Textron</b></a>,  Koppers Industries, and <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a>.<p>Military discipline is crucial: Falcon employees are told not to break heads -- even if mightily provoked -- as they ensure scabs' safe passage through picket lines. Not that it'd be wrong, mind you; it'd just be bad publicity. "If you can't stand  to have some Teamster call your mama everything imaginable," says Allen, "don't get on that line."<p><p>

						The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000 -- imaginary, we're afraid -- on five items. This month's players are three top chefs. Jacques Pepin writes a column for the New York Times and this fall will host a third season of Today's Gourmet on public TV. Pastry chef Nancy Silverton is a co-owner of La Brea Bakery and Campanile, a trendy Los Angeles dining spot. Stephan Pyles recently opened the superhot Star Canyon restaurant in Dallas, home of "New Texas cuisine."<p>
JACQUES PEPIN<p>-> $30,000 to help pay the mortgage for the James Beard Foundation, a showcase for good food.<p>-> $15,000 to sharpen all the knives in all the kitchens he'll visit during the next year.<p>-> $15,000 to give lessons to young chefs so they'll serve food warm, properly seasoned, "and not arranged like a Japanese garden."<p>-> $20,000 to fund an apartment in Brussels for his daughter Claudine, a political science student.<p>-> $20,000 to throw a champagne-and-caviar party for himself and his friends.<p><p>NANCY SILVERTON<p>-> $20,000 to landscape her backyard a la Martha Stewart, with a wood-burning oven and barbecue -- "a little bit of Connecticut in L.A."<p>-> $20,000 for giving to close friends and saying, "Buy whatever you want."<p>-> $20,000 to squirrel away for her three kids, to help them go to college or travel in Europe.<p>-> $20,000 to donate to the Pediatric AIDS Foundation.<p>-> $20,000 to indulge a longtime fantasy: Handing out $100 bills at Florence and Normandie, the corner in South Central L.A. where the riots began.<p><p>STEPHAN PYLES<p>-> $20,000 to take his kitchen staff to Oaxaca, Mexico, to experience firsthand the inspiration for his restaurant's food.<p>-> $20,000 to cover the restaurant's losses from such a trip -- "otherwise my partners wouldn't let me do it."<p>-> $10,000 to install gas lines and a commercial stove in his home.<p>-> $40,000 to throw a party on a ranch in his native West Texas. "There'd be spit-roasted goat, barbecued everything, and the Gipsy Kings would play."<p>-> $10,000 to help Share Our Strength feed undernourished children.<p><p>

Used merchandise moves upmarket as stores promote a new take on old stuff.<p>By David Hochman<p>In stores all over the country, what's old is new again. Recycling has merged with retailing, and suddenly the used-goods market is growing like -- well, like there's no yesterday.<p>The new trend isn't about thrift shops or the established trade in things like old computers or compact discs. Instead, big-ticket items including office furniture, posh exercise equipment, children's toys and clothes, and wedding gowns are appearing in stores that look more like the <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a> than Goodwill.<p>Atop the wave is <a name="NASD:GBIZ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16366"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Grow Biz International</b></a>, which operates 540 used-merchandise stores under names including Play It Again Sports and Once Upon a Child. Grow Biz started in 1983 after founder Martha Morris couldn't find a place to sell her good-as-new backpack. "People love (this type of store) because you get great value without feeling you've stepped into a garage sale or a pawnshop," says Douglas Raymond, president of the Retail Advertising & Marketing Association.<p>"Recycling's no longer underground," agrees Mark Werts, a pioneer in the recent movement toward vintage clothing as high fashion. Werts's superchic American Rag now has seven locations around California and is planning to move east.<p>One word of warning with used goods, however. Some older models of cribs, exercise equipment, toys, and other products don't live up to the latest safety standards. If in doubt, call the Consumer Product Safety Commission at 800-638-2772. Old news isn't always good news.<p>

Trying to build a floating utopia isn't exactly a profitable venture.<p>By Jim Melloan<p>WHO HE IS: Eric Klien, 28-year-old computer programmer and founder of the Atlantis Project.<p>WHAT HE WANTS TO DO: Build utopia.<p>WHERE HE WANTS TO PUT IT: On a network of hexagonal floating platforms off the coast of Panama.<p>HOW HE'S DOING: Not well. The Atlantis Project just shut down; Klien will spend "the foreseeable future" paying off its debts.<p>SO HE'S GIVEN UP? No, another try may be in the offing.<p>HOW KLIEN ENVISIONS UTOPIA: As a libertarian paradise with minimal government. It would be called Oceania.<p>WHY "THE ATLANTIS PROJECT," THEN? Atlantis is the lost continent buy also alludes to Atlas Shrugged by Klien hero Ayn Rand.<p>WHAT WOULD BE PERMITTED IN OCEANIA: Drugs, prostitution.<p>WHAT WOULD BE ILLEGAL: Taxes.<p>ESTIMATED COST TO BUILD THE FIRST NINETY 1.6-ACRE HEXAGONS: At least $1 billion.<p>HOW MUCH KLIEN HAD RAISED FROM INVESTORS: About $50,000, plus $100,000 in donations.<p>THE BRAIN BEHIND OCEANIA'S DESIGN: Architect Sten Sjostrand, who also designed a floating hotel for divers exploring Australia's Great Barrier Reef.<p>WHY THAT IDEA WAS A FLOP: Wherever the hotel was put, it killed the reef.<p>WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HOTEL: Japanese investors had it towed to Vietnam, where it has done better.<p>HOW KLIEN MET SJOSTRAND: Through Mike Oliver, a concentration-camp survivor who tried -- and failed -- to build utopia on an uninhabited Pacific island.<p>WHAT KLIEN IS DOING NOW: Looking for computer-programming work. He's also "glad to take donations."<p>SO, NO MAN-MADE ISLANDS FOR A WHILE? Actually, Universal Studios is building one off Hawaii for the filming of Waterworld, a special-effects blockbuster that will star Kevin Costner.<p>PROGRESS OF THAT PROJECT: Construction is underway. The movie will be released next summer.<p>THE MORAL: Write a script, not a constitution.

The Debts of Zsa Zsa Gabor<p>"Sorry, dahling, I'm broke." That was the essence of Zsa Zsa Gabor's retort to Elke Sommer, the aging German bombshell to whom Gabor was ordered to pay a $1.25 million slander judgment. The feuding celebrities couldn't even agree on that much, however: Sommer recently filed a motion to dismiss Gabor's March petition for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. "Gabor could pay up if she sold some of her property," says David Reeder, Sommer's lawyer. "Chapter 11 is for people with true financial difficulty -- and she's not one of them."<p>Far be it from us to judge the merits of either side in this catfight. But the documents filed in the case by Gabor, 76, provide an interesting look into the financial life of someone who's known mostly for being rich and famous.<p>A sampling of her debts:<p>-> To Melvin Belli, the well-known attorney: $150,000<p>-> To Courtesy Stables, for purchase of horses: $26,812.50<p>-> To American Fence: $6,088.82<p>-> To Citibank Visa: $9,662.58<p>-> To Dynamic Private Duty Nursing: $507.15<p>-> To Beverly Hills Small Animal Hospital: $785.25<p>-> To Hollywood Fantasy: $140,000 (a television production company)<p>-> To Bloomingdale's: $2,800<p><p>

						Mario Gabelli's Couch Potato Fund adds some zip to mutual funds' staid image<p>By Dean Robinson<p>What's in a name? If it's the name of a mutual fund, usually not much: Most fund companies stick with boring combos of words such as growth and equity when naming their products. Let's praise Mario Gabelli, then, for livening things up with his <a name="FUND:CICPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CICPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gabelli Global Interactive Couch Potato Fund</b></a>, a fund name that's both accurate and attention-getting.<p>The veteran money manager has a history of being daring with fund names. Last year the Securities and Exchange Commission forced Gabelli to change the name of his Six Plus Fund because it seemed to guarantee a rate of return. That's a mutual fund no-no. Undaunted, Gabelli tried to call his offering the Little Guy Fund. But the SEC nixed that too. "We're not very good on humor," says SEC spokesman John Heine. The former Six Plus is now called <a name="FUND:GABCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GABCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gabelli ABC Fund</b></a>.<p>The SEC doesn't have many firm rules on fund names; regulations mostly concern things like mentioning United States or U.S. government in conjunction with words like insured and guaranteed. But the agency is uptight about false advertising. "Our concern is whether people are misled," says Heine. "If a name indicates something other than what's in a prospectus, it's a pretty serious problem."<p>Perhaps wary of such issues, Gabelli soft-pedals his new fund's humorous name. "We're not marketing people, we're investment people," he harrumphs defensively. The stand is a bit disingenuous: There's more than a little marketing to Gabelli's Couch Potato Fund, which invests in "information superhighway" companies. And Gabelli himself grabs plenty of customers just by dint of his name, so he knows the power of image.<p>Still, most financial types aren't convinced that outre names are good for business. "There's a maxim in marketing," says Jack Trout of Trout & Ries, a marketing-strategy firm. "Don't get cute with money and drugs. People don't want to play around when it comes to money or their health." Gabelli has a stronger fan in Hrach Alexanian, research director at Morningstar, the mutual fund-watching company. "It's nice to see something funny," says Alexanian. Nonetheless, he frets that Gabelli customers might not see the humor: "People are very conservative when it comes to money. What's the probability that someone's going to invest in the I'm Going to Jump Off a Cliff Fund?"<p>Well, that depends: Is everyone else doing it?<p><p><p>

The IRS is targeted by lawmakers who want it to be -- gasp! -- nicer to taxpayers.<p>By David A. Andelman<p>The Internal Revenue Service may soon be getting friendlier to taxpayers -- whether it wants to or not.<p>Momentum is building for a proposed law officially known as Taxpayer Bill of Rights 2 but commonly called T2, in reference to the popular Arnold Schwarzenegger movie Terminator 2. Like that movie, T2 is a sequel: Six years ago, T1 gave taxpayers some fundamental rights that had never been recognized by the IRS -- paid ombudsmen to stand up for them, for example, and the right to sue the agency.<p>The IRS opposes T2, which would establish yet more basic rights the agency doesn't want written into law. The measure, sponsored by T1 author Senator David Pryor (D-Arkansas), would clear up some glitches in its predecessor. It would make T1's ombudsmen more powerful, for example, and have them report to a Taxpayer Advocate in Washington, D.C., instead of to the local IRS offices they police.<p>T2 also would require the IRS to reduce interest charges if it takes too long to find tax mistakes, and to pay taxpayers' legal fees whenever it loses a dispute in court. Pryor says he sees the changes as a kind of payback "at a time when we are asking the American taxpayer for contributions to reduce the deficit."<p>In the House, Representative James Traficant (D-Ohio) is pushing an even tougher bill that would force the IRS to consider taxpayers innocent until proven guilty. That's hardly a radical notion in criminal prosecutions, but the opposite is basically true in the IRS's civil prosecutions: Right now, the agency can seize property on its sole authority from taxpayers it judges have acted illegally. Then it's up to taxpayers to get their stuff back in court if they feel they've been wronged.<p>"Jeffrey Dahmer and the Son of Sam have more rights under the law than those accused of fraud under the IRS," says Traficant. Still, even supporters of the Traficant bill say the innocent-until-proven-guilty standard probably won't make it into law. "The tax courts are already pretty clogged up," says David Keating, executive vice president of the 250,000-member National Taxpayers Union. "Imagine if every audit case were made criminal." More likely, say most observers, a watered-down version of Traficant's bill may be melded with T2.<p>T2 is set to start moving forward this summer. It was vetoed two years ago by President Bush, but President Clinton is believed to be more sympathetic to the cause.<p>The IRS, meanwhile, doesn't think it needs any more legislation to do its job right. "We do believe in rights -- we're taxpayers, too," says a spokeswoman for the agency. "But quality customer service doesn't always mean getting what you want."<p><p>

A telemarketing scammer shows why states want new powers.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Roger Byers should be a popular guy: He loves to give people Hawaiian vacations and $5,000 credit lines. Instead, his activities in at least seven states are a prime example of why law officials are anxious for new legislation to combat telemarketing abuse.<p>Short, slim, fifty-something Byers is a felon and a serial scammer. He has been fined millions of dollars for deceptive schemes and has run afoul of the law since at least 1974, when he was convicted in Nevada for transporting stolen stock certificates. But Byers may still be telemarketing in dozens of states: Despite his record of rip-offs, authorities can't seem to shut him down.<p>The problem is simple. Individual states can bar Byers from doing business in their territory if he acts improperly there, but only a federal action would stop him nationwide. The FBI and other federal authorities, however, don't deal much with telemarketing scams. Such cases are usually small-scale and tough to prosecute. When toted up, however, these small cases cost consumers up to $40 billion a year -- and cause huge headaches for local law enforcers.<p>Dealing with telemarketers state by state isn't very efficient. Some schemes operate all over the country, but there's no system to tell local officials if a telemarketer has been banned in other places. Even if there were such a system, states couldn't use the information to bar known scammers unless local complaints started coming in.<p>In Roger Byers's case, the dilemma is plain. Companies controlled by Byers have been banned from certain activities in states from California to Nebraska to New Jersey. State officials say his standard telemarketing scheme involves offering a preapproved $5,000 credit line, even for folks with bad credit or no credit history. To learn more or to claim an award, consumers are told to call a phone number within 48 hours. According to judgments filed in numerous states, consumers end up paying for what they believe to be a widely accepted credit card, such as MasterCard or Visa. But the credit Byers provides can be used only to buy overpriced goods from a special catalog.<p>Through a Phoenix-based company dubbed North American Credit Card, Byers raked in nearly $1.4 million this way in 1991. His come-ons featured a Hawaiian vacation that turned out to be no luau. "You had to buy an incredibly expensive airline ticket to get it," says Hugh Hegyi, an assistant attorney general in Arizona. "Plus, you had to shell out money just to find that out. Byers is just a real jerk." Earlier this year, Arizona barred Byers and his son Donald from telemarketing there.<p>In Oklahoma, Byers recently was told to stop illegally soliciting business as North American Credit Card, USA Promotions, Continental Credit Card, and Dialing for Dollars. All four operations offered awards and preapproved credit lines. Says Jane Wheeler, chief of consumer protection in the state attorney general's office: "We hope he never comes back." So do California, Nebraska, and New Jersey, not to mention Maryland and Idaho -- all places Byers's companies have been barred from making misleading offers.<p>Byers's phone has been disconnected, and he couldn't be located for comment. His attorney in Arizona, where Byers owes more than $3 million for his most recent con, says he has no idea where his client went. Byers didn't pay fully for his defense, the lawyer adds. Byers's son Donald, who was also named in the Arizona scam but denies any wrongdoing, is even terser: "I don't know where my father is. Don't ever call here again."<p>If the past is any guide, Byers may now be setting up yet another telemarketing business in a state where he hasn't been banned. Such a move would be perfectly legal -- until President Clinton signs some legislation that state officials think could stop people like Roger Byers.<p>Versions of the proposed law have been passed by both houses of Congress; a final draft is being hashed out and stands a good chance of reaching the president's desk before the end of the year, says Emmitt Carlton, a spokesman for the National Association of Attorneys General. The measure would allow states to ban offending telemarketers nationwide, instead of just in their own territory. Meanwhile, a major crime bill would provide more federal funds to combat telemarketing scams.<p>"We definitely need tougher remedies," says James Jeffries, director of Wisconsin's Consumer Protection Agency. "You can't keep up with telemarketers like Byers if they can always just move on."<p><p>

						July/August 1994
Worth magazine/Outfront<p>100 GRAND <p>The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000 -- imaginary, we're afraid -- on five items. Our players this time hope to become America's latest heroes by helping the U.S. soccer team do well in the World Cup in July. The key to success may lie with goalie and team captain Tony Meola, whose skill will be tested by Swiss and Colombian attackers. Sweeper Marcelo Balboa is a seasoned veteran who played in the last World Cup. At 23, defender Alexi Lalas is a new star who's great in the air: He scored six goals with his head last year.<p>
TONY MEOLA<p>-> $30,000 to swap acting tips over an Italian dinner with Al Pacino, Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci, Andy Garcia, Danny Aiello, and Danny De Vito.<p>-> $10,000 to buy tickets for underprivileged kids to see the U.S. team's games.<p>-> $20,000 to rescue as many stray and unwanted dogs as possible.<p>-> $10,000 for a trip to Hawaii after the World Cup is over, "including a $1,000 tip to the operator to keep my phone from ringing."<p>-> $30,000 to invest in a one-year-old thoroughbred racehorse for him and wife Colleen.<p><p>MARCELO BALBOA <p>-> $15,000 for a new <a name="NYSE:HDI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harley Davidson</b></a>. "Any kind, as long as Rebecca De Mornay can fit on the back."<p>-> $15,000 to take Helen Hunt to Monaco for the weekend on a private plane.<p>-> $20,000 to start a catalog called 'Celo's Secret. "I'm not the model, though -- I'll leave that to Rebecca and Helen."<p>-> $40,000 for a black BMW 325i convertible, fully loaded.<p>-> $10,000 as a gift to the Magic Johnson Foundation, which supports AIDS research. "That's my goody-goody item."<p><p>ALEXI LALAS<p>-> $5,000 for a Slurpee machine. Both nozzles would serve cherry, his favorite flavor.<p>-> $20,000 for music gear, including a couple of vintage Gibson guitars and an old Stratocaster.<p>-> $50,000 to buy some real estate on the Upper Peninsula in his native Michigan.<p>-> $5,000 for four season tickets to the Detroit Red Wings.<p>-> $20,000 for a huge party after the World Cup. "Everyone would be invited -- even our opponents. It'd be a down-and-dirty, kegs and T-shirts affair."<p>

As the blues become red hot, Joliet Joe's custom harmonicas are instrumental<p>By David Hochman<p>WHO HE IS: "Joliet Joe" Filisko, 27, whose brass- and gold-plated harmonicas are used by savvy harmonicists from the South Side of Chicago to the West Wing of the White House.<p>WHO HE'S UP AGAINST: Hohner USA, which pumps out more than 650 harmonicas an hour.<p>HOW JOE COMPARES: He turns out just one "harp" a day, charging from $125 to $165 apiece.<p>HOW MANY HE'S SOLD: About 800 in the past four years. He's so busy now that he takes orders only from professional musicians.<p>HOW JOE MAKES A HARP: He combines standard parts with custom-made parts to produce his souped-up product. "I think of it as transforming a Pontiac into a hot rod," he says.<p>ARE THERE MORE EXPENSIVE HARMONICAS? Yup -- Hohner sells a two-foot-long orchestral model for $1,295.<p>OWNERS OF JOE'S HARPS: President Clinton has a gold-plated model, complete with presidential seal. Then there's Kenny Loggins, Dan Aykroyd, and Chicago blues greats Charlie Musselwhite and Junior Wells. David Flack, a self-described "harmonopath" from Portland, Oregon, has bought 30.<p>WHY SUCH DEVOTION? Pucker-friendly round air holes, as opposed to Hohner's square ones. Handmade cover plates prevent air leakage. And Joe will custom-tune for anything from delicate jazz to raw blues to full-bodied country.<p>ANY DOWNSIDE? Filisko harps are three times as heavy as their competitors. But the pros actually like this heft: "It gives me a much bigger, warmer, fatter, fuller sound," says jazz harmonicist Howard Levy.<p>WHY THAT'S AN UNUSUAL COMPLIMENT: Levy has an endorsement deal with Hohner.<p>WHAT'S BEHIND THE BOOM IN HARMONICA PLAYING: "The more music is overrun by synthesized sounds, the more people hunger for authentic roots music," says Kim Field, author of Harmonicas, Harps, and Heavy Breathers. "Nothing's more authentic than harmonica playing."<p>A WORD OF WARNING: Playing too long can lead to harmonica player's hemoptysis, first cited in the case of an Australian harmonicist who coughed up blood after playing six hours straight.<p>HOW LONG JOLIET JOE PLAYS: "Eight hours straight many times, sometimes longer."<p>WHAT HE'S GOTTEN AS A RESULT: So far, just the blues.<p><p><p>

When it comes to inheritances, being treated like a dog may not be so bad.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Be nice to rich old Aunt Edna's Pekingese: That pooch may soon have his paws on the family fortune.<p>The New York Bar Association is making it easier for every dog to have his day, offering guidelines for including animals in a will. Such authoritative advice hasn't been published before, says William Thomashower, who led the bar's effort. "A lawyer who never had a pet might not understand -- or might even laugh," he warns.<p>But the issue is serious. More than half the U.S. population owns a pet, and many people simply don't think ahead. The ASPCA in New York, for example, gets about 500 animals a year that have outlived their owners. "You don't have to leave your pet everything," says Kim Thornton, editor of Dog Fancy magazine, "but owners should make some provision."<p>In fact, nearly 27 percent of dog owners and 21 percent of cat owners already name their pet in a will, according to one survey. Bequests usually range from $20 a week to $10,000 a year -- although a few pets make out much better. Back in 1968, for example, oil heiress Eleanor Ritchey left $4.3 million to Auburn University for the care of her 150 dogs.<p>Pet bequests aren't simple matters. "You can't just leave a chunk of money to your dog," warns Thomashower. The number-one issue: Naming a caretaker. Then comes guesswork about appropriate amounts for feeding, grooming, medical care, and so on. Too confusing? Pet owners can also leave animals to Texas A&M University. For a $25,000 donation, the university will take care of any pet in a new building built just for the purpose. Only one cat and two dogs live there now, but director Sally Knight says 57 animals with still-living owners have been signed up.<p>Some other examples of well-provided-for pets:<p>-> Tinker, a Turkish Angora cat from Seattle, inherited about $500,000 from owner Anna Morgan last year. A trust pays for her $385-a-month apartment and a $10-a-day caretaker.<p>-> Mr. Pig and Calamity Jane, a hog and a German shepherd, were in the clover when their owner, Margo Lamp of Davenport, Iowa, left a 320-acre farm to support them in 1990. "Cammy" died soon after, but Mr. Pig thrived until last July. The property will eventually be sold to help fund a local humane society.<p>-> Lady, Lucky, and Princess needn't beg for bones. The mutts inherited about $300,000 from their owner, Floridian Raymond Falkenstein. All three have been adopted by different caretakers, but a thorny legal issue has yet to be resolved: Should the estate pay for care of Lucky's daughter, Beauty?<p>-> Damon and Pythias, long-haired Burmese cats, had reason to purr when New York millionaire Terry Krumholz left them her $750,000 Fifth Avenue apartment in 1991. But the siblings were evicted when the building enforced a no-pets policy. The cats resettled elsewhere, but fur is still flying as family members contest Krumholz's will. "We're not looking to cut the cats out," insists an attorney for the challengers.<p><p>

Heirs of the Three Stooges slap each other with lawsuits but find little to nyuk about.<p>By Dean Robinson<p>The Three Stooges poked, punched, slapped, and nyukked their way into the pop-culture pantheon. Now, in the group's 60th anniversary year, the actors' descendants are putting on their own show: a nasty courtroom fight over who controls the Stooges' comic inheritance.<p>Even after death, Moe Howard is the Stooge with the upper hand. His grandson now controls all Stooge merchandising rights. But the heirs of Larry Fine and Joe DeRita -- who played Curly-Joe, successor to both Curly and Shemp Howard as "third Stooge" -- are trying to elbow into the picture, and Curly's heirs may also get involved. The stakes are high: If Columbia Pictures goes ahead with a planned Three Stooges movie, the disputed rights could mean millions for whoever is declared the winner.<p>This isn't the first time Stooge heirs have tangled, but it'll likely be the first case to go to trial. Earlier challenges pitted the estates of Curly and Shemp against their brother Moe but were settled out of court. The latest fracas involves claims by the heirs of Larry and Curly-Joe against Moe's daughter and grandson. In essence, Curly-Joe's widow and four of Larry's grandchildren say they've been shafted and want damages of "at least" $10 million from Moe's kin.<p>Jeffrey Scott, Moe's grandson and the linchpin of current Stooge licensing efforts, agrees the other Stooge heirs deserve some of the proceeds. But he says he's made the right payments to them all along, and angrily rejects the idea that he still owes big money to anyone. "It was a dead property" until recently, he says of Stooge licensing. "It wasn't generating a lot of money each year -- maybe $200,000."<p>That's possible. But the real payout will likely come from future licensing deals, not small-scale efforts such as the air fresheners and pillow cases now sold by Frank Reighter's mail-order Stoogestore or the limited-edition plate recently offered by the Franklin Mint. The true plums in Stoogedom are tie-ins with a new movie, which Scott has been helping develop since 1988.<p>"A Columbia movie would greatly increase the visibility of the Stooges," says Harry Ross, who operates Soitenly Stooges, another mail-order business. If the movie is a hit, Ross envisions Stoogemania sweeping stores and fast-food chains nationwide. "The best thing that could happen," he says, "is if McDonald's introduced Curly fries tomorrow." Scott agrees: "The movie is the Saturn V rocket that blasts the payload into space."<p>Scott, a prolific television writer who has won several Emmy awards, feels he's entitled to a healthy share of any rewards from a resurgence of Stooge popularity -- and for more than legal reasons. "I've been working my tail off for six years to turn the Stooges into something that could generate millions and millions of dollars," he says. "It hasn't happened yet, but I've made a movie deal. I've put together most of an animated-series deal. I sold a live stage show and a merchandising deal to the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas. I put together a deal to do new commercials." He believes the Larry/Curly-Joe camp is trying to cut him out of an industry he helped build.<p>But opposing attorney Bela Lugosi -- son of the horror-movie star and a celebrity licensing expert himself -- counters with a portrait of Moe Howard's legal maneuvers that's as full of slapstick as a Stooges routine. A prime example: Old letters and contracts that Scott says give him control of all Stooge rights. The documents actually grant Moe those rights; later contracts hand them to Scott's company.<p>In fact, Lugosi says, Moe wrote the earliest contracts himself -- and signed Curly's name himself, too. A later contract also has a questionable Curly signature, he adds; yet another isn't signed at all. In any case, Lugosi argues, the papers were supposed to make it easy for Moe, the lead Stooge on-screen and off, to negotiate for everyone -- not to sign away the other Stooges' rights forever.<p>Stooge watchers say the spat may have no real winners. For one thing, the Stooges movie isn't yet a sure thing -- especially since Scott sued Columbia last year over some development money that apparently is missing. News reports have talked of a possible link to the Heidi Fleiss affair, and Stooge infighting has further complicated matters for the star-crossed movie.<p>Scott says he's talking to Columbia about settling the missing-money suit but won't give details. Columbia also has no comment. Still, Scott insists that a Stooges movie will soitenly get made, "probably within the next year."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>INVESTING: MY FIRST TIME
Robert Lutz, 62, president of <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a><p>"In the early 1950s, with some money I got from my grandmother at the time of her death, I bought some shares of North American Aviation, which was later taken over by <a name="NYSE:ROK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11283"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rockwell International</b></a>. I bought it because the Korean War was on and I was an airplane fanatic. NAA was selling F-86 Sabres -- jets that competed against the MiG-15. After I bought, the stock went up considerably. But as the war progressed, my father advised me to get out of NAA. I never knew why for sure, but I assumed he was right because he read every business and news publication. I sold, and I remember the price fell very shortly thereafter. My father isn't infallible, however. In 1968, when I was at <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, I bought a 1952 Citroen for $150 in France. My dad told me I should grow up -- that I should be buying GM shares instead. He said GM was the world's best corporation and that one share, which went for around $90, would soon be worth $200. Well, you know where GM stock has gone since then. My Citroen, on the other hand, is worth around $20,000."<p><p>

For fighting Pan Am 103 lawsuits, an insurer now faces a worse kind of claim <p>By Christopher Byron<p>After five and a half years, the terrorist bombing of Pan Am 103 may still have casualties to claim. Latest to feel pain from the disaster that killed 270 people: Insurance giant General Re, charged by a grand-jury witness with tolerating as much as $500 million in possible bombing-related fraud.<p>A lawyer for General Re says the company has no comment on the federal probe, about which few details are publicly known. So what's the inside scoop? A former employee has claimed that a General Re unit used false detective work to avoid paying the relatives of those who died on Flight 103 when it exploded over Lockerbie, Scotland.<p>In fact, in what may turn into a big headache for General Re, the whistleblower has implicated chairman Ronald Ferguson in the affair. This is bad news for a company that, for now at least, is one of the few bright spots in an industry battered by natural disasters such as the Midwestern floods and the Los Angeles earthquake.<p>Often referred to as the Tiffany of reinsurance, General Re underwrites the risks of other insurance companies. Despite a bleak 1994 for most insurers, with stock prices off by 10 percent so far, General Re has been rated a buy by analysts including Michael Frinquelli of Salomon Brothers. The company's profit is expected to rise healthily this year, Frinquelli says. But that's assuming management can stick to its knitting, which could be difficult if Ferguson and other General Re executives are distracted by a scandal.<p>The whistleblower story begins on a January day three years ago, at an extraordinary meeting in a General Re conference room. Among the attendees were Ferguson and the company's top in-house lawyer, Edmond Rondepierre, according to someone familiar with the events. The men came to hear from a former official at one of the firm's subsidiaries -- Robert Alpert, who had earlier resigned as head of claims for United States Aviation Underwriters. U.S. Aviation manages a pool of top insurance companies that provide coverage to the airline industry.<p>Alpert had asked for the meeting to inform top brass that he had quit because of what he thought was illegal behavior by U.S. Aviation in defending itself against more than 200 lawsuits related to Pan Am 103. As "lead" of more than 100 insurance companies at risk in the crash, U.S. Aviation could decide for everyone whether to pay the claims of the victims' relatives.<p>U.S. Aviation had been fighting these lawsuits in part because a private investigator had shown the Central Intelligence Agency to be involved in the bombing, something that might not be covered by its policies. But Alpert himself had hired the investigator in question -- and he believed the resulting report was worthless and false. (That conclusion has since been substantiated in the media and verified by the U.S government.) The claims chief became convinced that his higher-ups were using the false report as a convenient way to escape a liability that some news reports had said could go as high as $7 billion. Taking the advice of his lawyer, Alpert resigned in disgust.<p>The January showdown that resulted was no ordinary meeting. To ensure there would be no misunderstanding, Alpert prepared an astonishing method of presentation. As the meeting began, says someone familiar with what followed, Alpert sat stone silent in the boardroom and pressed the play button on a tape recorder. Amazed, Ferguson and Rondepierre listened as a prerecorded speech unspooled. Later, Alpert handed over transcripts of the tape.<p>But days turned into months, and U.S. Aviation continued to defend itself on what Alpert saw as highly questionable grounds -- even after a federal civil trial found that the company should pay what's now estimated will be $500 million in settlements. Eventually, Alpert was contacted by federal prosecutors. A grand jury was impaneled in New York and has been hearing evidence in the case for roughly a year. U.S. Aviation tried desperately to stop Alpert from testifying.<p>It failed. Earlier this year, a judge overseeing the grand jury rejected U.S. Aviation's argument that its communications with Alpert, a lawyer by training, were protected by attorney-client privilege. Now Alpert is a key witness in a probe that's the talk of the aviation-insurance industry.<p>Alpert and federal officials refuse to comment on his testimony, which isn't public. The grand jury already has indicted someone who helped U.S. Aviation develop its "the CIA did it" defense. A source familiar with the investigation says further indictments are likely in the autumn.<p><p>

						June 1994
Worth magazine/Outfront<p>100 GRAND<p>The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000 -- imaginary, we're afraid -- on five items. This month we tapped three people famous for their love of being quoted. As we had hoped, all three returned our calls promptly. Larry Sabato is the author of Feeding Frenzy, a critique of journalism. Norman Ornstein is a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute and has been a commentator on Comedy Central. Besides getting Claus von Bulow off the hook, lawyer Alan Dershowitz has appeared on every talk show in existence.
---------------<p>LARRY SABATO<p>-> $15,000 to hire a part-time cook "to make me one really good, healthy meal a day. All I eat now is junk food."<p>-> $40,000 as seed money for a foundation that would fight cynicism about politics.<p>-> $25,000 to establish a scholarship fund, named for his parents, at the University of Virginia, where he teaches.<p>-> $19,000 to publish a third edition of his book, Feeding Frenzy. "It makes a great holiday gift."<p>-> $1,000 to put in cattle futures so he'll have another $100,000 to blow.<p><p>NORMAN ORNSTEIN<p>-> $20,000 to buy Prozac for Rush Limbaugh, Ralph Nader, and other excitable types in the media.<p>-> $30,000 to provide civics texts to every reporter and editor involved in covering Washington, D.C.<p>-> $30,000 to help create a visitors' education center in Congress.<p>-> $10,000 to buy great season tickets at Baltimore's Camden Yards so he and his sons can watch the O's win the pennant.<p>-> $10,000 to Brian Lamb, president of C-SPAN, "just for being Brian Lamb."<p><p>ALAN DERSHOWITZ<p>-> $25,000 as a reward for anybody with evidence that would save the life of an inmate on death row.<p>-> $20,000 to start a censorship watch on college campuses that would "expose the absurd excesses of the politically correct."<p>-> $10,000 to attend a fantasy camp for basketball players under six feet tall.<p>-> $20,000 to a program that would buy back guns from young kids.<p>-> $25,000 to help finance his son Elon's next movie.

After losing a bundle, Frances Lear tries again--as a financial advisor, naturally on video<p>By Dana Dickey<p>Frances lear has hardly proved herself an astute investor: Lear's, the women's magazine she founded with her $100 million divorce settlement from sitcom magnate Norman Lear, closed in March after anemic ad sales, a staff exodus, and losses estimated at up to $50 million.<p>So what's the Chanel-suited 70-year-old doing hawking her financial tips in a new videotape aimed at women? Well, she describes the effort as a "magical collaboration" with Peter Foley, 35, her former chauffeur and current lover--a sandy-haired would-be filmmaker who has kept a picture of actor Mickey Rourke on the wall of his office. ("I just admire his talents," he says.)<p>Although Lear is spending $500,000 on the videotape, called Take Control of Your Money, the venture is largely a family affair. Foley, the tape's producer, spent a summer studying film but has scant experience as a senior producer. Foley's line producer is his sister Elizabeth Foley, a Columbia University film student, and his aunt, Mary Scanlan, is a project publicist.<p>On the financial-advice side, Lear is depending on Harry Browne, an iconoclastic newsletter publisher she's admired for 20 years. But according to Hulbert Financial Digest, Browne's recommendations have underperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 index by more than 50 percent over the last eight years--albeit at a relatively low level of risk. At least Lear has kept her sense of humor: She also hired Anne Elder, a comedy writer from Los Angeles, to add a witty edge to the video.<p>In the 90-minute tape, expect to see Lear leading a discussion group of seven women, aged from their mid-20s to late 50s. Talk about finances will be intercut with segments that follow these women in their workaday lives. "I talked to lots of women--professionals and women entering the work force--and no one had any idea what to do with their money," Lear says. "Everybody said, 'Please help.' "
Thus guru Browne will pop up throughout the tape, outlining his cautious philosophy. Without using a stockbroker, women are counseled to shoot for a 10 percent annual return from a "permanent portfolio" of equal parts gold, mutual funds, money market funds, and long-term bonds. "They will always carry you through," says producer Foley, who admits ignorance in money matters and says he hasn't had savings until recently.<p>Browne's own version of the strategy, meanwhile, has yielded an 8.2 percent annualized return over the past five years. Some experts criticize his advice--particularly the idea of keeping a quarter of your portfolio tied up in gold, no matter what the market's doing or how old an investor is. "Certainly not a position that Wall Street would traditionally embrace," says James Stack, president of InvesTech Research, a financial-research firm.<p>Until it failed, Lear had said she intended to turn Lear's, where this reporter worked until 1991, into a women's financial journal. But her interest in the magazine was waning, many staffers say, and its demise was expected. She'll be touting her new project in TV infomercials and ads in women's magazines. But not, alas, in the magazine that carried her name.<p><p><p>

A new measure would mean phone callers don't have to put everything on the line <p>By David A. Andelman<p>How would you feel if your telephone company were to sell your name and address to a travel agency because you make lots of international calls?<p>What if it gave your name to an X-rated video marketer as part of a list of phone-sex addicts?<p>Though they haven't been hashed out in court, such actions are likely legal right now. Phone companies aren't barred from hawking lists of names, organized by calling habits, to all comers. Meanwhile, police departments and other authorities need a subpoena to see such records.<p>Most phone companies insist they'd never divulge your habits to a marketer--although they may use them for their own marketing purposes. But many other companies sell phone-call records: Mail-order companies, for instance, often use caller-identification technology that tells them who's calling, then sell that data to other merchants. And some numbers exist just to gather mailing lists.
"A great deal of information about us is collected, analyzed, and sold when we are conducting everyday activities," says Congressman Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, who's pushing a measure to limit info harvesting.<p>Markey's proposal, included as an amendment to a broader telecommunications bill, seems like a no-brainer: It would mainly require phone companies to get a consumer's express consent before disclosing any calling patterns or other data. The bill also would set nationwide privacy standards for caller-identification technology and require new privacy rules for all telecommunications media.
But powerful local phone companies oppose the measure, which will likely be debated in the late spring. "The telephone business has been around for more than 100 years, and sacrosanct privacy has always been its hallmark," says  a spokesman for <a name="NYSE:BLS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10200"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BellSouth</b></a>. "It seems strange that anyone thinks legislation like this is necessary."<p><p><p>

An oenophile sours on the grape and gives his life over to Jesus instead.<p>By John Anderson<p>Who he is:  Marvin C. Overton III, part-time neurosurgeon, full-time gospel evangelist--and, until recently, star of the fine-wine circuit.<p>What he's like:  A classic Texas cowboy, tall and garrulous, raised on ranches and oil rigs. His outsize character comes through even in his wine jottings: "This wine is a suave devil!"<p>What he's famous for:  His collection, especially his Bordeaux wines. "One of the largest, most eclectic, and best-assembled private collections anywhere," says Clive Coates, a noted wine writer.
and of course: The celebrated Overton Tastings, at which fellow oenophiles would quaff hundreds of his precious vintages.<p>What's in his cellar now:  Nothing. He sold the lot in recent auctions at Christie's and Butterfield & Butterfield.<p>Why he abandoned wine:  "I didn't need it anymore."<p>What prompted all this:  In 1992, Overton was told he had cancer and might have only months to live.<p>His response:  He demanded new tests, telling doctors: "Those tests are lying. The Lord is not ready for me to go--I'm a fighter for Jesus."<p>The new results:  No cancer. "I told 'em so."<p>How he reacted:  "I needed to weed out all the inessential things in my life, and wine was one of them."<p>His farewell tour:  A five-city series of blowout tastings. "A masterpiece," raves wine consultant Dennis Foley.<p>His take on wine now: "Oh, I'll have a glass now and then. I still love wine, but I love Jesus more."<p>What he does with the extra time: "Preach the healing, cleansing message of Jesus' love. Say, have you pardnered up with Jesus?"<p>

Among the Mexican Americans of Los Angeles, Vidal Herrera is known simply as El Muerto. But even Angelenos who don't know his grisly reputation may be familiar with Herrera--he tools around in a van emblazoned with his memorable in-state toll-free number: 1-800-AUTOPSY. Does the world really need a coroner who makes house calls? Herrera says it's a growing business: He hopes to open 20 franchises of his Autopsy
ost Services nationwide. His own staff performs about 600 autopsies a year--including about 100 for private citizens, at an average cost of $2,000 for five-day turnaround. Now A
S is branching into specialties such as "posttraumatic and decomposition cleanup." That's mopping up mass-murder scenes, to a layman. "It's recession-proof," he says cheerfully.<p><p>

						<p>By Devon Jackson<p>Who he is:  Carl Person, 57, the attorney behind a wave of theft-of-idea suits against Hollywood studios.<p>His background:  High school dropout and 1962 Harvard Law grad. Holds patent on a gizmo designed to catch flies alive.<p>Claims to fame:  First lawyer to sue for right to advertise. Helped develop the paralegal profession by founding the Paralegal Institute. Created a private court system that never took off. Won the right to sell shares in lawsuits, another fizzled idea.<p>Other notable facts:  Is suing the pope for $120 million on behalf of an ex-priest seeking restitution for his years of service.<p>His self-image:  An economist who acts on convictions.<p>His latest conviction:  That theft-of-idea litigation can catch on if it's marketed well. "That's what we're selling."<p>Why he's targeting Hollywood:  He hates monopolies. In fact, he's even sued the maker of the Monopoly board game.<p>How theft-of-idea works:  Client claims a studio developed a movie from an idea the client submitted but was never paid for.<p>Movies he's suing over:  New Jack City, Regarding Henry, Coming to America, Sister Act, and Philadelphia.<p>What he's suing for:  From $48 million (New Jack City) to $420 million (Coming to America). He gets 50 percent if he wins.<p>What Hollywood thinks of all this:  "Meritless," says Paramount (Coming to America, Regarding Henry). "No substance," says Disney (Sister Act).<p>How he's getting into movies:  He produced an unreleased film, Ramblin' Gal, directed by his wife, Lu Ann.<p>How you should get into movies:  "Submit your idea to a thief, hope they steal it, then call me." <p><p><p>

As World Cup tickets soar in value, here's an insider's guide to the resale market<p>By James Buckley Jr.<p>If you own any of the 3.6 million tickets for this summer's soccer World Cup, count yourself lucky: You're on the right side of a big seller's market. Already, some single tickets are going for twice the price of the four- or five-game packages offered for $105 to $400 last year.<p>Prescient buyers snapped up those packages without knowing what teams they'd see. Once teams were announced in December, most tickets got more valuable--and some became the equivalent of gold dust. By now, the chance of paying face value for a ticket is as slim as the U.S. team's prospect of making the World Cup final.<p>As a result, the resale market is taking off, despite extra-tough conditions imposed by the tournament's organizers. The worst snag--apart from the possible illegality of some resales--is that no actual tickets have been issued yet: To stymie counterfeiting, ticket buyers have only gotten a confirmation letter so far. The real tickets won't be distributed until this month. That has made reselling a matter of faith and contracts, rather than a simple hand-it-over transaction.<p>For most World Cup ticket holders, the easiest and best thing to do is to attend the game and be thankful. But if that ticket really was an investment, and resale is legal in your area, here's how to cash in. Ticket buyers, of course, can turn these tips around.<p>-> sell or hold? If you've got tickets to a less-popular game--Saudi Arabia vs. Morocco, say, or Cameroon vs.Sweden--get what you can right now. For the top first-round matchups, as well as later games, hang tight: Foreign fans will be waving huge wads of bills near game day.<p>-> The ethnic card. U.S. demand will be highest in immigrant enclaves, so advertising in the right ethnic newspapers can pay off. Another trick is to call popular ethnic restaurants and bars. Don't laugh; they may be the busiest ticket-trading centers of all.<p>-> Get on-line. The sports areas on computer-chat networks such as America Online and CompuServe are active trading forums.<p>-> Go global. More foreigners than Americans will be looking for tickets. Try using a friend in a relevant city--Berlin for Germany games, for example--as a go-between. Some sellers are even placing ads in foreign papers.<p>-> See your agent. Dozens of official World Cup travel agencies around the globe are selling tournament packages. Some may not have enough tickets to offer as many tours as they'd like. Call and make a deal.<p>-> Good as gold. Finally, if you're in the enviable position of owning a ticket for the July 17 final at the Rose Bowl--go. Reselling may get you a 1,000 percent return, but you shouldn't miss one of the greatest spectacles in sport.<p>Even better, you could just give it to me.<p><p><p>

John Jordan stole to keep his dream alive. When it died anyway, he got drastic.<p>By Vincent Coppola<p>If you've ever bought merchandise via those glossy inserts stuffed into credit-card statements, you've helped fund a $300 million industry that's got more in common with blackjack than with catalog shopping.<p>Industry leader John Jordan, however, turned "merchandise syndication" into another, deadlier gambler's game: Russian roulette.<p>A silky-smooth Atlanta entrepreneur, Jordan sent out more than 100 million solicitations a year, building his import operation into a $50 million house of cards called Jordan Concepts. Slender and engagingly polite, he made his money flogging electronics, jewelry, and other gewgaws in credit-card mailings from Montgomery Ward and other issuers.<p>Even in good times, statement stuffing is a loser's game. A hefty 15 to 20 percent of revenue goes to the card issuer, while the stuffer must carry huge upfront costs for printing and shipping. Cash may not start flowing until three months after orders are placed. And all the while another warehouse full of steak knives sits waiting to be moved.<p>But these are not good times for stuffers. Since the late 1980s, sales have slumped while costs and competition have risen. And response rates keep tumbling--from a heady 6 percent back in the 1960s to just a fraction of 1 percent today. Says E. James Kearney of Chicago-based Eire Partners, one of the players that now control the industry:"The heyday is over. The business is dying."<p>Jordan Concepts, meanwhile, is already dead, quietly liquidated by Chase Manhattan, its main financier, after the embarrassed bankers realized Jordan had defrauded them out of nearly $24 million. But the tale behind that fraud, so convoluted it took investigators three years to unravel, lingers as a reminder of the high-pressure world behind every cheesy opal-ring solicitation.<p>Curiously, the evidence suggests Jordan possessed a perverse integrity. He didn't take any money for himself; everything he stole seems to have gone into Jordan Concepts and, eventually, down the drain. "He was brilliant,"says Miami accountant Stanley Foodman, who lost $140,000 he put into a separate Jordan venture. "Too bad he didn't use his brains for a better purpose."<p>Because of their lousy cash flow, merchandise syndicators live on credit lines that are secured by their receivables--the money they've already earned but haven't yet gotten. As Jordan's sales tumbled along with the industry in 1987, he was caught in a massive credit crunch.<p>His solution was that of an addicted gambler:Invent $12 million in receivables to keep the credit flowing from <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a>, then plow the borrowed money into more mailings. "Sales cures all" became Jordan's mantra, then his prayer. "This was a man who could not separate himself from his business," says Bryan Farrell, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted Jordan.<p>Jordan's high rolling unnerved both colleagues and competitors. "I was cutting back, and this guy is placing business all over the place," recalls Kearney. It also rang alarm bells. In March 1990, Chase Manhattan finally became suspicious and sent a team of auditors to Atlanta.<p>Jordan was ready:With a household intercom he bought at Radio Shack, he bugged the conference room the auditors used so he could learn what documents would be examined. Then he set about creating a false paper trail, preparing fake cancelled checks, banks statements, and dozens of other business forms. Jordan even made call-forwarding arrangements in other cities, just in case the auditors phoned his partners and vendors--the calls would have bounced back to Atlanta, where his assistant Donna Crabtree waited with a prepared script. (Crabtree pleaded guilty to one count of bank fraud for her role in the scheme.)<p>"For 16 days the auditors grill him," says Donald Samuel, Jordan's attorney. "He fools everyone." Satisfied, Chase advanced another $1 million. But Jordan's dreams kept withering in mailboxes around America. After another few months and no miraculous sales boom, two of his senior financial officials cut a deal with the government, agreeing to testify against their boss in return for immunity.<p>The game drew to a close three years later. After investigators laid bare his scheme in federal court, Jordan was convicted this February on nine counts of fraud and conspiracy. When he failed to show for the verdict, his lawyers figured he'd fled the country.<p>Instead, facing eight to ten years in prison, Jordan had chosen a far harsher penalty. On a red clay field behind a local Holiday Inn, he put a pistol in his mouth and a .38-caliber bullet in his head. A maintenance man found a written apology next to his body. Even the prosecution was shocked.<p>"This was a guy who thought he could overcome anything," says Farrell. "We take no pleasure in this. We're here to achieve some kind of justice. Nothing more."<p><p><p>

Coming soon to a virtual-reality theater near you: The original vast wasteland<p>By Jim Melloan<p>Like to pilot a lunar rover around the site where Neil Armstrong first set foot on the moon? In 1997 you could get a chance, if the first commercial moon landing goes as planned.<p>Indeed, such just-for-fun gimmicks may fuel the next great space mission, which will likely show up on pay-per-view television. A new company, International Space Enterprises, has hooked up for the task with Russia's Lavochkin Association, which built most of the former Soviet Union's spacecraft. The team's implausible goal: To make seven unmanned lunar landings by 2000, helped by agreements with film studios and a major theme park.<p>ISE envisions mapping and filming the lunar surface to enable virtual-reality simulations of the moon for games and theater attractions. The company won't name most of its partners, which makes its chances hard to assess. But experts agree with John Pike, a space-policy analyst with the Federation of American Scientists who was initially dubious but now says there's no "giggle factor."<p>Adding credibility is the involvement of robot guru Red Whittaker, who's designing a lunar rover for a company called LunaCorp that plans to hitch a ride on ISE's first outing to the moon. (First stop: The Apollo 11 site.) A mission into an Alaskan volcano this summer will showcase Whittaker's progress, and LunaCorp will be trying to tempt sponsors with the notion of a contest offering the chance to drive the rover around the moon for an hour--by remote control, natch.<p><p>

Real estate markets in other western cities are cashing in on the Los Angeles earthquake, as Angelenos flee riots and recession in search of cheap homes and firmer ground. "The first weekend after the quake we had 60 visitors from Southern California--and 15 sales," says Anne Mariucci, president of a housing community near Phoenix. "Before that we had no sales to Californians." The pattern was repeated in Denver, Las Vegas, Salt Lake City, and Portland, Oregon.  "I've joked that whenever there's a disaster in California, business goes through the roof," says Steve Slabaugh, a real estate executive in Lake Oswego, near Portland. "But the day after the quake, our phone rang off the hook."<p>

Looking for a hot franchise idea? Try selling lube jobs door-to-door. (Really.)<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Franchising is bigger than ever: Entrepreneur magazine's annual Franchise 500 issue actually lists 873 franchisors. Investors and potential franchisees can be forgiven, then, for failing to spot the recent rotisserie-chicken craze in a crowded field. So you won't miss another <a name="NASD:BOST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16244"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boston Chicken</b></a>, we asked some experts to predict the next big franchise opportunity.   <p>expert:  Edward Kushell, president of Franchise Consulting Group, based in Los Angeles.
next big franchise: Fresh bagels--but better-tasting ones than current offerings.
why: Healthy food, good return on investment, chance to save the world from supermarket bagels.
current players: No national player meets Kushell's standard. But top chains include Manhattan Bagel, Chesapeake Bagel Bakery, Skolniks Bagel Bakery.<p>expert:  Regina Gardner, board member of the International Franchise Association and owner of a travel franchise in Houston.
next big franchise: Business services, such as postal centers, temp-worker providers, and travel agencies.
why: "The 1990s are the era of service," as she keeps hearing.
current players: Voice-Tel Enterprises, Interim Services, Mail Boxes Etc.<p>expert:  Gladys Glickman, author of Franchising.
next big franchise: Fast food in Eastern Europe.
why: In developing countries, it's a cheap, popular, and easy-to-start business.
current players: <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, Little Caesars Pizza, Arby's, Burger King.<p>expert:  Pete Harman, first and largest independent franchisee of KFC--in 1952 he agreed to pay Colonel Sanders a nickel for every chicken he sold.
next big franchise: Buffet-style dining.
why: People want healthier food and greater variety at a good price.
current players: Sizzler International, Golden Corral. Stacy Buffet may start franchising.<p>expert:  Susan Kezios, president and founder of Women in Franchising and the American Franchisee Association.
next big franchise: Home-based service franchises, such as mobile dry cleaning and mobile auto detailing.
why: For those with $20,000 or less to invest, this is a promising franchise area--and customers like vendors who come to their homes.
current players: Pressed4Time, International Flying Colors, Oil Butler International.<p>expert:  Robert Purvin, chairman of the American Association of Franchisees and Dealers.
next big franchise: The information superhighway.
why: "It has a lot of sex appeal."
Current players: None, but he envisions local, brand-name on-line communities: "Someone will figure out how to sell a franchise." <p><p>

						<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>Now that members of the 1969 Miracle Mets baseball team have licensed a line of diapers, among other gewgaws, the marketing of bygone teams is poised to become big business. Already, members of other legendary lineups have asked the '69 Mets for advice. Among them: Pitcher Vida Blue of baseball's 1972--1974 Oakland A's and linebacker Harry Carson of football's 1986 New York Giants. With so many old-timers touting memorabilia, team-level promotion was inevitable, says Stephen Hisler, president of the marketing firm National Pastime. His pick for the dream team of yore: The 1980 U.S. Olympic hockey squad. Mike Eruzione, who was the captain of the fateful team, says the Olympians "would love to" market themselves. Brian Murphy, publisher of Sports Marketing Letter, says many old teams could do well, including the 1985 Chicago Bears football team and the Cincinnati Reds of the 1970s, baseball's Big Red Machine. Cal Levy, an agent for several old Cincinnati players, including Johnny Bench, Pete Rose, and Joe Morgan, agrees. But he notes a major snag: "We can't do anything until Pete Rose [who's banned from all baseball-related activity] is reinstated."<p><p>

A proposed law on privacy is riling big business, which wants the right to watch<p>By David A. Andelman<p>Big business grabbed headlines recently by opposing the government's plan to mandate "trap doors" in many electronic devices so the feds could eavesdrop on communications. But what of business's own penchant for electronic spying?<p>Ironically, corporate lobbyists are fighting fiercely to protect companies' right to monitor their own employees and, in some cases, their customers. Battle lines are forming over a bill sponsored by Senator Paul Simon of Illinois that attempts to set limits on electronic snooping in the workplace. The main concern: Technology that allows employers to watch over every move made by a worker--from listening in on phone calls to counting the number of keystrokes by typists.<p>"In some industries, employees are tied to their desks via their computer and phone system," says Kristina Zahorik, a Simon aide. "Everything they do is recorded. They can't even get up from their computers to go to the bathroom --if they do, they can get docked pay or lose their jobs."<p>But opponents see the Simon bill as another ill-advised attempt by Congress to micromanage business. "If I'm paying people to get a job done, I should have the right to know what they're doing," says Larry Fineran, a top lobbyist for the National Association of Manufacturers.<p>The proposed legislation wouldn't ban electronic monitoring completely. But it would require employers to warn workers when snooping will take place--or to be able to prove "reasonable suspicion" for unannounced spying. Big companies say that's overkill: Monitoring is simply a high-tech version of the old-fashioned supervisor, they argue.<p>The securities industry gets special treatment in Simon's measure, since most of its electronic and voice interactions are policed by Securities and Exchange Commission rules--allowing for a record of trades, for example. Still, the Securities Industry Association opposes key provisions of the bill.<p>"It's too sweeping," says Kristin Hofeditz, manager of securities legislation for the SIA. "If electronic monitoring is a tool of harassment, that's a problem. But in our industry, it's used to protect our customers, our investors." Hofeditz says the measure would stop the SEC from using electronic records to investigate market irregularities unless it got a warrant--"a step backward," she claims.<p>But the bill's advocates, including the American Civil Liberties Union, say the proposed protection for workers, as well as for consumers whose conversations may be monitored without their knowledge, is invaluable.<p>The measure's sponsor in the House of Representatives is Montana congressman Pat Williams, who previously shepherded into law an anti-polygraph bill that limits the use of lie detectors at work.<p><p><p>

						<p>Lee Iacocca brings Broadway to Branson, a town that's country music to his ears <p>By Jonathan Burton<p>Lee Iacocca has finally found the stage he's sought since stepping down as chairman of <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> in December 1992. And it's right in the heartland that embraced his trademark folksy pitches and no-nonsense prose.<p>After fielding dozens of business proposals, the 69-year-old Iacocca is betting that the next great American industry will be country music and that Branson, Missouri, will be its Detroit. Once again, Iacocca will have the spotlight he loves--but this time, he'll pay for it to shine on a Branson production of The Will Rogers Follies, the hit Broadway musical.<p>Iacocca is a major partner in the new staging of the Rogers show, which is slated to open this month. And he's investing in a Branson real estate project that will include a convention center and shopping mall. The town also has attracted Iacocca's new investment company, Iacocca Capital Partners. The firm has consulted with Iacocca about Branson--and is scoping out opportunities for itself there. Iacocca predicts his interest in the town won't be "a flash in the pan."<p>That goes double for Branson itself. The small Ozarks town, full of country-music theaters, has tapped a potent mix of glitz and family values to become the nation's number-two destination for driving vacations. Iacocca was originally just one of five million tourists who pour into Branson each year. He was awed by a five-mile traffic jam and originally agreed to head Branson Airlines, a proposed solution to the area's traffic woes.<p>But then the business icon took in a Wayne Newton show and realized that if Vegas could be reborn in the Ozarks, so could Broadway. He rounded up partners and soon was back in business with a homespun spectacle that echoes the values he sold in Chrysler ads and in his bestselling books. Will Rogers himself, another showman-cum-capitalist, would approve.<p><p><p>

						<p>After losing control of Paramount, Davis also fails to snag a writer for his book<p>By Robert S. Boynton<p>Martin Davis, Paramount's ill-tempered chairman, dreamed of publishing a blockbuster book about his career and its crowning achievement--the smooth merger of Paramount and Viacom. But when rival Barry Diller and his QVC Network appeared as spoilers, Davis's literary ambitions, like so many of his plans, became a footnote.<p>The Paramount boss didn't just lose control of his own fate in the much-publicized takeover spat that followed. He also failed to corral the famous writer he had targeted as his Boswell: Bryan Burrough, coauthor of Barbarians at the Gate, the best-selling account of the battle over <a name="NYSE:RN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13122"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>RJR-Nabisco</b></a>.<p>Davis, 67, had figured to spin history by cooperating with Burrough on a definitive book. To woo the writer, he gave Burrough extraordinary behind-the-scenes access--only to discover that the story became a morass soon after Diller's QVC launched its unwelcome bid for Paramount. Burrough emptied his notebook into a none-too-flattering Vanity Fair piece but ultimately decided not to write a book. (Davis, in turn, says he decided not to cooperate after all.)<p>Burrough says he had been fascinated by the cast of oversize egos. But when lawyers and mutual fund managers started dominating the fight, he lost interest: "I've done that already." Another factor was that Burrough and his agent, Andrew Wylie, failed in their attempt to sell publishers on a $1 million package of book and movie rights. Burrough had reportedly received that sum for his last book, Vendetta--a resounding dud.<p>Meanwhile, Davis had lost his early edge in the best-seller stakes. Other prospective authors were eyeing the Paramount-Viacom-QVC fight: Ken Auletta, media critic for The New Yorker; a Wall Street Journal team led by Laura Landro; a Variety team; and Geraldine Fabrikant and Bernard Weinraub at the New York Times.<p>Most of these eventually dropped out as even hardened business buffs got sick of hearing about Paramount. Nonetheless, a Davis spokesman says his boss is still interested in writing a book. With someone else running his company, he'll certainly have enough free time.<p><p><p>

						<p>A tough IRS task force will be the next disaster to shake up Hollywood stars<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Should a starlet be allowed to deduct her designer threads on her tax return this month? Can a box-office hunk justify his daily massages as a professional expense? <p>Not much longer: The Internal Revenue Service has lost patience with such Tinsel Town tax dodges. This tax season marks the first outing for an IRS task force that spent 18 months preparing to take on Hollywood--in part, by having agents take movie-accounting seminars and even film classes at UCLA. "We're ready to put our book smarts to use," says agent Randy Perrin.<p>Of the 30,000 returns expected from the entertainment industry this month, 3,000 will be screened for possible audits; usually only 1 percent of returns get such attention. Entertainers are worried. "If the IRS were going after Sylvester Stallone for deducting a personal trainer, that'd be unfair," says Bruce Stiglitz of the law firm Loeb & Loeb, which represents stars such as Frank Sinatra and Diana Ross. "For someone like Danny DeVito, maybe they'd be right."<p>But IRS agents say many tax evaders think anything can be deducted as a business expense in La La Land. Face-lifts, hair appointments, even cocaine purchases--all are deductions the IRS has seen and won't tolerate. The task force also hopes to kill a longtime bugbear: "loan-out corporations," set up by stars to collect fees, handle contracts, and receive salaries. The task force believes many loan-outs exist solely to avoid taxes or establish tax-favored pension plans and shouldn't be allowed. "They know that's where the pot of gold lies," says tax lawyer Eugene Veenhuis of Mitchell, Silberberg & Knupp, whose clients include Jack Nicholson and Paul Newman.<p>Veenhuis and others think banning loan-outs would boost IRS revenue a lot--hundreds of millions of dollars, by some estimates. That'll take years to happen, but individual players will feel the pinch sooner: The task force already is sending out 300 audit notices a month.<p><p>

						<p>Did any Romanovs survive the 1919 massacre? Genetic testing may decide.<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Science has already solved one great historical mystery--the fate of Russia's last czar, Nicholas II, whose bones were unearthed with those of his family outside Ekaterinberg, Russia, and authenticated by genetic testing.<p>Now the same method will help sort through the muddle of people claiming links to Nicholas's youngest children, Alexei and Anastasia Romanov, believed by many to have escaped their family's 1918 massacre by the Bolsheviks.<p>The stakes are huge: definitive identification of some of history's most romantic figures; a bit part in Russian politics; benefits from a possible media bonanza; and, most intriguingly, a potential claim on a hoard of gold rumored to have been stashed by Nicholas.<p>Most aspiring Romanovs are either charlatans or deluded. But the Ekaterinberg find has touched off a high-tech Cinderella search, attracting many offers of "royal" DNA for comparison to the genetic material in the bones. Efforts are already under way in several cases, including that of the most famous alleged Anastasia, the late Anna Anderson of Charlottesville, Virginia.<p>Like Russian history itself, the hunt for Anastasia and Alexei is populated with weird characters. The Anderson case alone has attracted legal briefs from everyone from the Russian Nobility Association to one "Anastasia Romanov" of St. Petersburg Beach, Florida, who thinks she's Anderson's long-lost daughter. And now an ancient German baron may hold the key to solving the puzzle.<p>Meanwhile, a U.S. public-relations firm called Wink Inc. has emerged as a self-styled clearinghouse for purported Romanovs--including a woman in Scottsdale, Arizona, who says her late husband was the czar's only son. (This particular Alexei taught Ronald Reagan how to ride a horse, Wink claims.) Just how many would-be royals are out there? "We feel there are eight," says Richard Sutz, vice president of Wink. "Five Alexeis and three Anastasias."<p>Of these, the case of Anna Anderson may be the first and most prominent to be resolved. Celebrated in articles, books, and a 1956 Ingrid Bergman movie, Anderson was cremated in 1984 after dying at age 82. Last summer, however, a couple that was friendly with her learned that a Charlottesville hospital still has part of Anderson's intestine from a procedure performed years earlier. Because the czar's alleged daughter had no heirs--she acknowledged no children, and her husband died in 1990--the couple sued the hospital to free up Anderson's tissue for genetic testing.<p>Anderson's friends have a personal motive: The wife, Marina Schweitzer, is a granddaughter of Eugene Botkin, the czar's doctor. Anderson said Botkin was murdered along with her family, but his bones weren't identified with genetic certainty. If Anderson was indeed Anastasia, then Schweitzer would know her grandfather's fate.<p>But as soon as the suit was filed, things got messy. Late last year, the judge gave an official say to the secretive Russian Nobility Association, a group of Emigres that has insisted Anderson was an impostor, and to the long-lost "daughter" in Florida. A bitter Richard Schweitzer thinks the obstructionist RNA wants to protect its self-proclaimed authority on Russian history--and, perhaps, dreams of the gold that Schweitzer says the czar kept in London as dowry for his daughters. The rumored hoard can't be confirmed; the RNA won't comment.<p>The Florida woman, known as Ellen Kailing until she changed her name to Anastasia Romanov last year, is even curiouser. She says she didn't learn her true identity until 1990 but is certain great wealth awaits her--and that the Russian throne awaits her 16-year-old son. "I would say that history will turn 180 degrees around," she says, amid bizarre tales of plots and attempts on her life.<p>To fend off such challengers, Schweitzer thinks he can rely on 86-year-old Baron Ulrich von Gienanth, executor of a series of wills Anderson made while living in Germany in the 1940s and 1950s --probably the only credible Anderson wills in existence. If his legal standing is confirmed, the baron apparently wants Anderson's tissue to be tested as soon as possible.<p>Testing at the English lab that verified the czar's bones would cost the Schweitzers 10,000 pounds ($14,750). But that kind of expense doesn't deter other royal wanna-bes, including Canadian resident Sandra Romanov, who claims her late husband was Alexei. "I would like ten labs to be involved," she says. "That way there'll be no hanky-panky."<p>The Wink PR agency has offered to spring for testing of other alleged Romanovs--in return for book and film rights, of course.Wink's Sutz says the firm considered targeting the gold hoard, too, but decided to skip "an enormously long and difficult legal battle."<p>Thinking of claiming the Russian throne yourself? Beware: Even Wink has standards. "We would have to have some kind of screening," says Sutz. "It's just like a crime: There are always 50 people who will pop up and admit to it."<p><p>

						<p>Tired of being a lottery loser? Stop being a snob and try sweepstakes instead. Many cost only a 29-cent stamp and offer far shorter odds than Lotto. For those too harried to affix every "Early Bird" sticker, some tips: Avoid Ed McMahon and other huge mail shots--the odds are as bad as you think. Focus on obscure contests with opaque rules and lots of runner-up prizes. In general, the harder to enter, the easier to win. The current favorite of Jeffrey Sklar, co-publisher of Winning Sweepstakes Newsletter, is Hershey's "Apple-a-Day II" promotion, a computer giveaway.<p>

						<p>The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000--imaginary, we're afraid--on five items. Our players this month are three daytime talk show hosts: Leeza Gibbons, veteran infotainer turned host of the NBC show that bears her name (but, alas, not John Tesh's anymore); former Cincinnati mayor Jerry Springer, who shuns frivolous prattle for more serious chat about what ails America; and newcomer Bertice Berry, a reformed stand-up comic and professor of sociology who hosts the syndicated show named for her.<p>LEEZA GIBBONS
--$50,000 to bribe Jackie Onassis onto her show.
--$20,000 for shrink sessions for some of her guests. "I mean, one is actually engaged to Richard Ramirez," the serial killer.
--$15,000 for a wet bar and Jacuzzi for the Leeza staff. "They work long, hard hours and deserve it."
--$10,000 to bribe the publisher of the Star, "so they'll stop putting me on the 'Would You Be Caught Dead in This Outfit?' page."
--$5,000 to pay fellow talker Jane Whitney to wear shoes on camera. "This really bugs me."<p>JERRY SPRINGER
--$49,960 for lunch with Claudia Schiffer--in Paris, bien sur. He supplies a scarily detailed breakdown, including airfare and hotel rooms (two) should lunch run late. 
--$11,000 to see every New York Yankees home game in style.
--$27,000 to buy and maintain a horse for his daughter Katie. 
--$5,570 to pay tuition at chauffeur school, get a license, and lease a limo "so I can drive Barbra Streisand around L.A. for three weeks." 
--$6,470 to buy lottery tickets for his audience and staff.<p>BERTICE BERRY
--$50,000 to fund a weekend dance hall for teenagers in Wilmington, Delaware, her hometown.
--$5,000 to thank Charles Barkley for being a role model, "even though he doesn't think he is one."
--$25,000 to establish an after-school vocational program, also in Wilmington. 
--$10,000 to help the homeless in Chicago, where she tapes her show.
--$10,000 to feed two nephews and a niece, of whom she recently gained custody. "Man, do those kids eat."<p>

Nigerian credit bandits are plaguing U.S. card users and eluding the legal system<p>By Emanuel Howard<p>Last month's credit card bill didn't arrive? Before cursing the mailman, consider a more sinister possibility: The bill may have been diverted to a Nigerian crook in any one of a dozen U.S. cities, and he could already be milking the account for cash.<p>Law-enforcement officials say the credit card industry is under siege from a loose network of Nigerian criminals entrenched in cities including New York, Houston, Dallas, Atlanta, New Orleans, and Los Angeles. The West Africans' sophistication and their ever-changing techniques--most recently, a change-of-address scam--are causing big headaches for the Secret Service, the Immigration and Naturalization Service, and credit card issuers.<p>"There's a trail of tears following Nigerians around the country," says John Barker of the National Consumers League, a watchdog agency. Adds a frustrated security chief at a major card issuer: "The U.S. credit system is founded on trust--the Nigerian belief system is different."<p>Nigerian officials angrily reject such talk as offensive and untrue, insisting that the vast majority of their citizens here are law-abiding residents. In fact, they assert, many so-called Nigerian criminals are actually other West Africans masquerading as Nigerians for reasons that aren't clear.<p>"I am not saying we are angels," says Ibrahim Lawal, immigration officer at the Nigerian consulate in New York. "What I am saying is that the rate of people committing crimes that U.S. authorities attribute to my country is not true."<p>But U.S. officials say the Nigerian crime wave is real--"absolutely epidemic," according to one Secret Service agent. Law-enforcement officials have arrested more than 1,000 Nigerians since record keeping started in 1989, accounting for fully 10 percent of the fraud arrests made during that period by the entire Secret Service, which heads a national task force formed to deal with West African crime.<p>The low-profile task force, which has members in 13 cities, has recovered nearly $50 million in money stolen by Nigerians. But agents believe they've tracked down only half the loot from the crimes they've solved. Much of the rest may have been spirited out of the country.<p>According to task-force members, the Nigerian credit crooks are neither hierarchical nor territorial but work in loose bands of 3 to 15. They frustrate local police by shuttling between various jurisdictions, keep meticulous records, and share the details of their high-tech scams with members of other cells. According to several law officials, many train in special "boarding schools" in New York, Houston, and Atlanta after arriving in the U.S. to make a living from credit rip-offs.<p>The latest wrinkle in Nigerian fraud is the change-of-address scheme, the Secret Service says. With just a person's name, the name of the financial institution, and an account number or Social Security number, it's easy to change the address of any credit card account--and from there, to change the secret code number that allows card users access to a cash machine.<p>By tapping the new information into a gadget that encodes the magnetic stripes of old or fake cards, the outlaws create their own duplicate cards. A practiced card shark with a fistful of fake cards can walk away from a cash machine with more than $10,000. Law officials say the crime is ingenious and nearly risk-free. <p>"You've got to be stupid to stick up a bank these days," says Anthony Migliaccio, a Secret Service agent who has run the New York arm of the West African task force. "How many times do you walk away with a million dollars? Usually you get a couple of thousand. But with this credit card fraud you go to one machine, kick the card through a couple of times, and you've got $5,000. Nobody is hurt, nobody is scared."<p>The national task force is making some progress. Last year, for example, agents in Washington, D.C., alone busted 40 people, mostly Nigerian, who were allegedly working as credit bandits. Authorities think the crooks bagged as much as $10 million from thousands of accounts, in part through the change-of-address ruse. But by using cards hijacked in other parts of the country--and by limiting the amount of money they steal in any jurisdiction--most Nigerian criminals escape the attention of an overburdened system.<p>"What they count on is that these crimes are usually dealt with as single episodes that don't lead to significant sentences," gripes an assistant U.S. attorney who has prosecuted Nigerian fraud cases. "They just walk away."<p><p><p>

The Securities industry cracks down on bad brokers by targeting their property.<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>After victimizing their clients, many crooked stock brokers proceed to stiff the securities industry too--by failing to pay fines levied against them by the National Association of Securities Dealers.<p>But that may change as the NASD, the self-policing body for the over-the-counter brokerage business, experiments with hardball tactics more familiar to villains who cross the Internal Revenue Service or the Drug Enforcement Agency. In a pilot program, the NASDhas been trying to seize the cars and boats of brokers who won't pay up.<p>NASD hired a credit-rating service to check into the personal finances of brokers and brokerage executives. By zeroing in on deadbeats with substantial assets and asking that their property be seized, the NASD is hoping to win legal precedents for its approach--and gain a measure of revenge for ripped-off customers.<p>NASD compliance chief John Pinto says it's too early to judge whether the program has been a success, but he's hoping the action sends a get-tough message. "If bad brokers are fined, that's an obligation that will follow them wherever they go," he promises.<p>Perhaps, but that's hardly true at the moment. As little as a tenth of bad-broker fines have been collected in recent years, partly because brokers have little incentive to pay up if they've already been barred from the business. Last year's performance was a bit better--but only because of two blockbuster cases against Equitable Life and Prudential Securities, both of which paid their fines promptly.<p>And despite the new enforcement push, collections aren't expected to skyrocket in 1994. The majority of deadbeat brokers "just disappear," Pinto admits.<p><p>

Most telethon tote boards count a lot more than viewers' phone pledges<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Will pat boone be misleading us again on March 5 and 6? Well, yes.<p>Trusting telethon viewers may think the crooner's Easter Seals tote board merely tallies phone pledges as they roll in. Not so: Most of the total is safe in the charity's coffers long before the show begins. A whopping 84 percent of last year's $47.7 million came from corporate contributions and fund-raising events held over the entire previous year, concedes Easter Seals president James Williams. Those funds were gradually added to the tote.<p>Watchers of the heartrending telethon, however, are encouraged to believe something else. Hosts such as Robb Weller hardly ever mention that the rising numbers have little to do with the viewers they beseech to make that pledge. A true tote would start at $40 million and rise far more slowly--or start at zero and struggle to reach $8 million. Curiously, last year's board debuted at $33,236 and jumped quickly to $1.7 million. Over applause Boone hastily explained that "so much of that is the corporate sponsorship."<p>But if you missed that mention, too bad. It was just about the only caveat in the 21-hour show, says an Easter Seals spokeswoman. "We don't want to discourage people from giving $5 and $10 pledges," she explains.<p>The practice is commonly used to build excitement at telethons. The United Cerebral Palsy telethon does it, for example: Only an estimated one third of last year's total of $24 million came from phone pledges. The United Negro College Fund also includes other fund-raising in its telethon tallies but declines to give details on the $11 million raised this January.<p>Experts on charity don't object. Says a spokesman for the National Charities Information Bureau: "If you start off by saying, 'We've already achieved half our goal, but stick around for the entertainment,' you wouldn't get too many viewers." So the pumped-up tote boards are now legion. Take the Children's Miracle Network, which trumpeted a huge $116.9 million total on its 1993 telethon tote board. A spokesman says the number was "a culmination of the year's efforts" but declines to break down the total exactly.<p>Jerry Lewis doesn't do much better: Of the $46 million tally from his last Labor Day telethon for the Muscular Dystrophy Association, just 35 percent came from phone pledges. The remainder was from direct-mail appeals and fund-raisers held that weekend.<p>"It's true, the perception is that all telethon money is coming in from pledges," says Kay Hollings, associate executive director of the national United Cerebral Palsy group. "That's partly because the hosts mention it only once in a great while. They think the audience is a standing army; it's really just a passing parade."<p><p><p>

Mutual funds lose their apple-pie image as scandals hit Invesco and Fidelity<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>While scandals have rocked Wall Street and the banking industry, the mutual fund industry has remained largely crisis-free. Until now.
Internal probes at two big fund companies have suddenly brought the business face-to-face with its worst nightmare--a muddy scandal that could scare away small investors. Regulators are nosing through reports that portfolio managers at both Invesco Funds Group and Fidelity Investments made dubious deals for themselves in stocks they were also buying for fund shareholders.<p>A venture-capital unit of Fidelity owns Capital Publishing, Worth's parent.<p>Besides hurting both firms, the charges are a reminder that this fast-growing business hasn't yet developed widely accepted ethics guidelines. And they're a black mark for an industry that portrays itself as better than its shark-like counterparts in brokerages, banks, and insurance companies.<p>Investment professionals say the mutual fund troubles may be partly explained by the industry's explosive growth. Fund assets swelled to $1.4 trillion last November, from $568 million at the end of 1990, leaving little time to focus on ethical niceties. "It's amazing how lenient [mutual] funds are," says a longtime Wall Street trader.
That should change as attention centers on conflicts of interest that plague the fund business. The trick will be ensuring that managers can't easily put their own trading accounts ahead of shareholders' welfare--easier said than done right now. Fidelity, for instance, sees stock trading as a good way for employees to learn about markets. Some companies see it as a tool to keep hot portfolio managers aboard.<p>Still, a few fund firms acknowledge potential conflicts. Martin Whitman, who runs the $140 million Third Avenue Value Fund, says fund managers should buy their own fund's shares if they want to invest: "That's what I do. I eat my own cooking." <p>Managers don't benefit just by trading for themselves, of course. A lesser-known conflict has to do with buying the same stock for different funds. Hedge funds are more lucrative for managers than vanilla funds, for example: 20 percent of a hedge fund's profits might go to its manager, compared to 1 percent for a mutual fund. So managers have a big incentive to trade first for their hedge fund, then at the resulting higher price for the mutual fund.<p>Few fund holders are aware of such conflicts; the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't even require mutual fund managers to disclose whether they also run hedged money. But the fallout from the Invesco and Fidelity investigations may lead to tighter rules. High time.<p><p>

						<p>"In 1982 there was a huge write-up in the New York Times about monoclonal antibodies, a promising biotechnology technique. I was working as a broker in Boston and knew about Hybritech, a company using the method. It was risky--the stock would do really well or it would bomb.<p>"On November 5, I had my son Jotham. I decided that Hybritech would be a perfect birth gift for him, since he wouldn't need money for 18 years anyway. But it turned out to be a solid investment.

For inept insurance scammers, death be not profitable. A guide to doing it right.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Dying to make a million bucks? Some folks are--dying, that is. Or at least that's what they want insurers to believe when they have a spouse or relative file big phony death claims.<p>But there's a definite art to dying for dollars. While no industry-wide statistics exist on bogus death claims, the nation's biggest insurer, Prudential Life Insurance, says it catches up to 40 defrauders each year. Only the truly cunning, it seems, can play dead.<p>How to die, then? A primer:<p>Don't act on impulse. Being dead isn't a whim, and it's not for everyone. Loneliness helped drive James Lang, a baker from Washington State, to resurrect himself after only six weeks. Upon returning contrite to his distraught family, Lang went into counseling.<p>Consider drowning. There's no need to provide a body. The downside: "Whenever somebody with a big policy disappears on the high seas, we're suspicious," says William Rodgers, vice president of investigation at Prudential.<p>Plan discreetly. Robert Granberg, a retired New York State investigator, offered a man in a bar $10,000 to assist in his fake-drowning plot. The man declined, then helped convince investigators that Granberg hadn't gone to a watery grave. Granberg was later caught at a motel with his wife.<p>Ditch the address book. "It's not easy to completely give up your past," says insurance-fraud investigator Robert Federspiel. Most defrauders get nabbed when they contact friends or family. Carroll Wayne Baumgarner, for example, was collared at his kin's home in Maryland two years after he faked his death in a Canadian boating accident.<p>Get a new identity. A dead person can't drive, work, or vote. Surprisingly, this trips some people up: California embalmer Melvin Lee Lincoln faked his and his wife's deaths, then tried to renew his driver's license. He ended up repaying $150,600 he'd collected from insurance companies--and he lost his embalmer's license.<p>Lie low. In particular, don't break the law. Phillip Champagne, thought to be dead for ten years, was snagged last year for counterfeiting $100 bills after his restaurant in Washington State went under. Investigators quickly identified him as "the man who could walk on water without getting his feet wet," a reference to his supposed drowning death. Now in prison, Champagne is being sued by Federal Kemper Life Assurance for the $700,000 it paid on his policy.<p><p>

						<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Last spring, Susie and Bill Mosca sparked a trend by unloading their Maine bed-and-breakfast for $500,000 through an essay contest. Since then, property owners have been holding contests to peddle everything from trailer homes to 22-room mansions. But check carefully before launching such a scheme yourself: Some states are declaring the competitions illegal.<p>Here's how the contests work. Let's say you want to sell a house for $1 million in a weak market. Just charge a $100 fee to each of 10,000 essay writers and pick a single winner. Easy--unless you don't get 10,000 entries, a common snag as the contests multiply. Canceling a contest because of low response may violate consumer-protection laws, even if all the money is returned. Says Edgar Dworsky, assistant attorney general of Massachusetts, "What if Publisher's Clearinghouse said, 'We're not giving away a million bucks because we didn't sell enough magazines?'"<p>Massachusetts also regards the contests as thinly veiled lotteries, which can be held only by the state or a charity. Rhode Island takes the same stance; the contests are now outlawed in both states. In California, two civil suits have already been filed, and criminal charges could follow. Herschel Elkins, the state's senior assistant attorney general, says he's seen essay competitions that misrepresent the value of the prize or hand over a property just before the bank arrives to foreclose. <p>

						Two proposed laws would make it harder to win big judgments in liability lawsuits<p>
By David A. Andelman<p>
If some lawmakers have their way, consumers will soon have a harder time hitting the jackpot in two types of liability lawsuits. While neither proposed change has drawn much attention so far, both will be major legislative battlegrounds this spring.<p>
The first measure targets product-liability suits and stands a good chance of passage despite vehement opposition from organized labor and consumer advocates such as Ralph Nader. Aimed at freeing the courts of many suits filed by contingency-fee lawyers, it would be the first federal statute to deal with product defects and liability. Its key provisions propose to limit the enormous awards for punitive damages that are often assessed by juries in state courts.<p>
Companies would be protected, for example, in the case of harmful drugs or medical devices that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. But the bill, introduced by Senator Jay Rockefeller of West Virginia, also establishes a mediation process so that suits involving real economic loss can continue. And in a measure intended to speed the end of cases, companies could be fined up to $50,000 if they turn down a settlement that's less than the amount a plaintiff is ultimately awarded.<p>
The second measure is a securities-fraud bill. Introduced by Representative Billy Tauzin of Louisiana, it would amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which was aimed at protecting investors. In pushing his measure, Tauzin argues that the original law has become "the tool used by speculators to recoup losses from risky investments."<p>
In particular, the new bill is aimed at limiting the kind of class-action suit that is filed whenever a company's stock suffers an unexpected dip. Many people think these suits enrich only lawyers, who collect a hefty reward when the company decides it's cheaper to settle than to fight. Tauzin has lined up some 55 cosponsors in the House and has strong support from oft-sued accounting firms and from Silicon Valley, a frequent target of class-action attorneys because high-tech stocks are known for their sharp price swings.<p>
But the bill's opponents worry that it could simply let guilty companies off the hook. Daniel Schulder of the National Council of Senior Citizens says the proposed changes "would shield thousands of companies...from legitimate private suits brought by individuals injured by financial mismanagement and scams." The elderly, he says, are frequent victims of such schemes.<p>
Both liability-limiting bills are especially galling to consumer groups because they've been proposed by Democrats--not Republicans, the traditional supporters of big business. "For consumers, it's already hard enough," says Linda Lipsen, legislative director of Consumers Union. "Congress should not be making it even harder."<p>

						<p>When Ted Turner decided to colorize his library of black-and-white films in the 1980s, he sent the stocks of his two contractors soaring. But Turner called it quits at 225 movies, and the two colorizing companies, CST Entertainment Imaging and American Film Technologies, have struggled ever since. Now, after lame efforts to diversify, both CST and AFT insist that--skeptics be damned--they're coming back. CST is working on "featurization": colorizing old TV-series episodes and stitching them into new TV movies. The first is a Wyatt Earp movie that features an aged Hugh O'Brian, the original TV Earp, recalling the old days. AFT, which went into bankruptcy last October, is banking on emerging TV systems overseas. CEO Gerald Wetzler claims foreign demand for cheap color product can be met only by colorizing. "Colorization was a fad," he says. "Now it's an economic imperative."<p><p>

						<p>By Dean Robinson<p>By the end of this summer's soccer World Cup, at least nine names will be etched into the minds of the tournament's U.S. television viewers. Diego Maradona isn't one--but Snickers is. In a rare coup, every television commercial surrounding the cup's 52 broadcasts was sold two years ago to a cartel of the tournament's sponsors without being offered to other advertisers. The estimated $20 million deal was engineered by the networks that will carry the games, ABC and ESPN. Even before securing broadcast rights, ABC approached official cup sponsors and "marketing partners," which had paid up to $20 million each for the designation. Four companies quickly agreed to buy all the commercial air time available. That bolstered the networks' bid and blocked competing advertisers from riding World Cup hype. But the initial pact turned out to be a little too effective for the World Cup organizers, who asked ABC and ESPN to admit additional sponsors and partners. After some juggling, the networks ended up with five gold advertisers, each with two minutes of ads per broadcast, and four silver advertisers, each with 30 seconds.

Trash that Pez dispenser when you were five? The Sternfelds will sell it back - for $3,000<p>By David Hochman<p>Who they are: Sue and Richie Sternfeld, key players in the sweet market for Pez candy dispensers, collectible of the moment. <p>How they met: Richie, 50, sold vintage Pez dispensers through hobby magazines; Sue, 36, was a big customer. After two years of telephone transactions, they decided to merge their collections--and their lives. Now they dominate the market.<p>Where they honeymooned: The first day, the newlyweds visited the Pez factory in Orange, Connecticut. The next day, they flew to the first-ever Pez convention.<p>Why they're so pez-obsessed: "Pez has so much personality," says Sue. "If you had a whole house full of Picassos and just one little rack of Pez, people would run up to the Pez and say, 'Wow, these are so cute!'"<p>Another possible reason: They earned more than $10,000 from two Christie's auctions last year.<p>How many dispensers: They own more than 700, including every type ever issued by Pez Candy. They also have some bootleg models, such as the moss-covered Chia Pez and a one-of-a-kind Pee-wee Herman.<p>Most valuable dispenser: Tops in their collection is Make-a-Face, a cross between a regular model and Mr. Potato Head. Fewer than 25 exist; one was sold recently to a Colorado collector for $3,000.<p>Their role in pezmania: "First, they promote Pez in the trade magazines," explains Harry Rinker, a collectibles analyst. "That gets the auction houses interested, which in turn gets the media excited. Pez gets trendy, prices go up--and nobody's happier than the Sternfelds."<p>How hot the market is: Several dispensers, including Muselix, a rare German model, command nearly $2,000 apiece. <p>Who else is playing: As many as 2,000 Pez buffs, says Richard Geary, who runs the annual Pez convention in Cleveland. A decade ago, he adds, there were fewer than 50 Pezmaniacs.<p>What the company thinks: "I don't really understand it," says Pez president Scott McWhinnie.<p>Pez trivia: Dispensers never feature real people. "We've received thousands of letters asking for a Michael Jackson dispenser," says McWhinnie. "Need I say more?"<p>When the fad will fade: "In five years, it's not going to be half as big," says analyst Rinker. "Ultimately, there's a limit to how much someone will pay for something like this, and we're pretty near that point."<p>What they'll do after that: Also stashed in the Sternfelds' tiny apartment in Queens, New York, are hoards of <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> items, Pillsbury Doughboy collectibles, and Colonel Sanders doodads.<p><p>

						<p>The challenge: Blow a tax-free windfall of $100,000--imaginary, we're afraid--on five items. Our players this month are three columnists known for their devoted readership. Irv Kupcinet is hard-nosed author of the softhearted dish in "Kup's Column" in the Chicago Sun-Times. Now at W and WWD, Suzy, a.k.a. Aileen Mehle, has been wagging her pen for 30 years. Compared to these two, Clark DeLeon is a relative rookie, but he's already a favorite for his humorous column in the Philadelphia Inquirer.<p>IRV KUPCINET
$20,000 to fellow gossip Cindy Adams for her pipeline to Marla Maples and Donald Trump.
$30,000 to buy Phil Donahue's old dresses for Howard Stern, the radio shock jock.
$20,000 to pay for bratty actress Shannen Doherty (Beverly Hills 90210) to see a shrink.
$10,000 on behalf of President Clinton to pay for saxophone lessons for Russian proto-fascist Vladimir Zhirinovskiy.
$20,000 for baseball lessons for Michael Jordan.<p>SUZY
$50,000 to lease "an elegant but understated" Bentley, with a driver, for as long as possible.
$45,000 for a yearlong, around-the-world cruise on the QE2: "I need the rest."
$3,000 to add a closet to her townhouse apartment in New York. "But of course, there's no room for one."
$1,000 to her housekeeper Julia "for just being there and smiling, no matter what the weather."
$1,000 to her favorite charity, God's Love We Deliver.<p>CLARK DELEON
$50,000 to fund Just Cholesterol, an eatery serving only the four basic food groups--grease, starch, Italian salami, and beer.
$20,000 to open a cheese-steak stand on the Falklands. "You never know when they'll get sick of lamb chops."
$29,900 to develop a fragrance made with Oscar Mayer wieners. "Now everyone will be in love with you."
$57 to stockpile Heinz Ketchup. "I'm betting they'll make a 'New Coke' mistake."
$43 to develop a Rush Limbaugh Jazzercise video.<p>

						  <p>By Emanuel Howard<p>When the government writes a book, anyone can reprint it without paying royalties. Publishers don't need permission--just a gut feeling that people will pay for turgid prose. And people do. No Clinton tome yet rivals the Warren Commission report: Published by Bantam only 80 hours after it was released, it sold 1.6 million copies. But some Clintonian works have hit the best-seller list, enriching publishers but not the taxpayers who funded the reports.<p>
--The President's Health Security Plan (Times Books, $9)<p>Copies were on bookstore shelves the night President Clinton presented his health plan to the country. Almost 250,000 copies in print.<p>
--Health Security (Touchstone Books, $7)<p>An editor stood in line to buy a copy of the health plan for $34. The publisher had 100,000 copies on sale within five days and has since printed 20,000 more.<p>
--The Gore Report on Reinventing Government (Times Books, $9)<p>After reading a newspaper story on the report, Times Books asked for a copy. Within five days, 75,000 books were on sale. Total copies now at 100,000.<p>
-- Creating a Government That Works Better and Costs Less (Plume Books, $9)<p>Plume took 17 days to get 60,000 copies out. Why so long? Tom Peters, author of the foreword, was in Japan.<p> <p><p>

There'll be no such rivalry at the Winter Olympics. While Reebok has signed up everyone from Jamaican bobsledders to U.S. skater Nancy Kerrigan, Nike is lying low. One reason: Nike's endorsement strategy focuses on its sneakers, non-starters in the Winter Olympics; Reebok is less picky. Says a Nike spokesman, "Write us off as a company that is involved with Winter Olympics athletes."<p>

						 <p>By Carla Koehl<p>Think the '80s are over? Think again. Good times on Wall Street have sparked a comeback of the hubris that marked the Masters of the Universe era: Execs are once more asking tailors to visit them at work. Says a Salomon grandee, "I see a lot of people getting measured again--while they're on conference calls." Bergdorf Goodman notes a buildup of Wall Street calls for its door-to-door tailors. And custom clothier Richard Contratti just had his best season since 1987. "It's not that I stopped ordering after the crash," says Bear Stearns pooh-bah Alan Schwartz, barking orders to his assistant as Contratti fits him for two new suits. "Now I just feel better about ordering a few more." Sherman McCoy would be proud.

So you're confused about zero-coupon bonds? Tell me about your mother.<p>By Laurence R. Stains<p>As we all know, the markets are driven by psychology as much as fundamentals. So how come journalists always quote economists instead of psychologists? To redress this problem, we interviewed Dr. Michael Ascher, a fellow of the American Psychological Association. A professor at Temple University in Philadelphia, he specializes in anxiety-related disorders. We asked Ascher: Why do investors keep making the same crazy mistakes? Here's his diagnosis; the bill is in the mail.<p>Symptom: You sell too low.
Diagnosis: You're swayed by negative scan--you dwell on past losing moves and dismiss previous successes. In a futile attempt to reverse the pattern, you panic and sell in downturns.<p>Symptom: You buy too high.
Diagnosis: Uh-oh. Sounds like a case of emotional reasoning. Though you may know you're paying too much, you talk yourself into it because you fear missing out on further gains.<p>Symptom: You hang on too long.
Diagnosis: The cognitive glitch with your name on it is superstitious thinking. You think the stock will shoot straight up as soon as you sell it.<p>Symptom: You pin all your hopes on one stock.
Diagnosis: The stock has become an object of security--an unproductive emotional attachment has developed, much like Linus and his blanket in the Peanuts cartoons. Well-adjusted adults reserve such infantile behavior for their cars.<p>Symptom: You avoid risk.
Diagnosis: You may have depressive tendencies. Take two Prozacs and call a manic money manager in the morning.<p>Symptom: You take too many unreasonable risks.
Diagnosis: You may be manic --perpetually euphoric. Find yourself a money manager with depressive tendencies.<p>Symptom: You have a weakness for hot stocks.
Diagnosis: A classic case of low self-esteem--you'll trust anyone's opinion about a stock, as long as it's not your own.<p>Symptom: You have a weakness for concept stocks.
Diagnosis: You're susceptible to grandiose thinking--you exaggerate the stock's prospects and, of course, your soon-to-be-heralded brilliance in realizing its massive untapped potential.<p>Symptom: You buy a stock at 17 and ride it up to 85. Then, when it dips to 83, you spaz out at your broker and insist he eat your trading costs.
Diagnosis: You're a pig.

New York City's elite apartment dwellers stop a barbarian from storming the gate<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Billionaire Ronald Perelman went hunting for an apartment after his separation from celebrity gossip Claudia Cohen, but discovered a place where his money didn't work: New York's stuffy co-op market.<p>Despite his wealth, Perelman was rejected as a resident by not one, not two, but three prestigious co-operative apartment buildings in Manhattan. Why? "I have nothing to say to you," says Betsy Green, the real estate broker who presided over Perelman's search. "I don't speak to the press." Can't say we blame her. Such rejections are a black mark that every broker seeks to avoid.<p>Not that Revlon Ron isn't in good company--sort of. Richard Nixon, landing in New York after his resignation, also was turned away by three high-class buildings, including the one where Henry Kissinger lives. More recent famous rejects include Rush Limbaugh, designer Carolyne Roehm (the ex-wife of Henry Kravis), and Madonna.<p>In Perelman's case, the rejections must have been especially galling. By the time he got approved at his new place at 73rd Street and Park Avenue--where he already wants a bigger apartment--Perelman had been shooed away from buildings where his peers are ensconced: John Gutfreund at 834 Fifth Avenue, Gordon Getty at 820 Fifth Avenue, and Sid Bass at 4 East 66th Street.<p>According to tenant advocates in New York City, the only legitimate reason to turn away someone respectable is financial instability--hardly Perelman's problem. But few victims care to tout their reject status, so the board of a co-op--where tenants own shares in a corporation that owns the building--can be picky with impunity. Often, that consists of treating celebrities and the nouveau riche as pariahs. Says broker C.B. Whyte about famous tenants: "It's either a hassle or it costs money [for extra security measures]. That's what boards are supposed to avoid. Who needs it?"<p>However unfair, such snobbery pales in comparison to the horror stories of racism and prejudice that brokers say are common in New York co-opdom. They suspect, however, that Perelman fell victim to a different form of discrimination. "Have you ever met this guy?" says one leading broker. "He's rude, he's newly single, and he's got some very tacky visitors. Trust me, you don't want him in your building."

Led by Virgin, airlines bet that gamblers will take a flier in new casino-class seats<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>
Virgin airways flights, with their on-board magicians, musicians, and massages, already resemble a night in Las Vegas. The experience should get even more realistic this month, as the upstart British airline launches its gambling service on flights from London to Hong Kong. If all goes as planned, the first outing will usher in a high-tech age of airborne wagering.<p>Virgin's gambit, hatched by flamboyant entrepreneur Richard Branson, is the latest twist on the worldwide gaming craze--and a logical follow-up to the growth of riverboat gambling in the U.S. Already, Singapore Airlines, Mexicana Airlines, and other international carriers are thinking of following Virgin. U.S. airlines would like to play, too, but must clear some legal hurdles first.<p>Gaming is a natural for the troubled airline industry. As fares remain stubbornly low, carriers are scrambling for extra income and new gimmicks. So far, this has meant a lot of talk about live stock quotes, video games, and the like. Since many such services will be offered via a small seat-back screen--often equipped with a credit-card reader--it's a small leap to electronic gambling. "It wouldn't be very hard to do," says a spokesman for Northwest Airlines, which has readied six planes for the move.<p>Gambling in the air isn't completely new. In the early 1980s, for example, Singapore Airlines briefly installed full-size slot machines in the back of some planes. But as seat-back screens become more common and gaming continues to explode, the match now makes perfect economic sense. "I think it will take a lot of money from passengers," says Anthony Curtis of Las Vegas Advisor, a newsletter about gambling.<p>Virgin is spending $17 million to fit 6 of its 13 jumbo jets with interactive systems that will allow fliers to win--or lose--small stakes on their credit cards while playing games including blackjack, poker, and roulette. The airline is concentrating on its Pacific routes at first, but transatlantic gaming flights are possible this year too.<p>Before getting its casino flights off the ground, Virgin must get approval from British authorities. That'll be easy compared to the task faced by U.S. airlines, which are prohibited from offering gambling--even in international airspace--by the 1951 Johnson Act. That law was amended in 1992 to exempt U.S. flagged cruise ships in international waters; U.S. airlines have been lobbying for similar treatment. According to one industry study, U.S. carriers will sacrifice $680 million in annual revenue if in-flight gambling isn't allowed.

Now Burton Malkiel is picking stocks. But will he ever get that monkey off his back?<p>By Jim Melloan<p>Burton Malkiel is the patron saint of anyone who hates money managers. His most famous theory--that a blindfolded monkey throwing darts at the financial pages can pick stocks as well as any expert--remains as compelling today as it was 20 years ago. But if his theory is true, why is he running his own investment firm? And did he raid any zoos to build his staff?<p>Well, no. In fact, he's not even using darts to pick his investments. But Malkiel is beating market indexes anyway, casting a big shadow on his own book, the classic A Random Walk Down Wall Street.<p>In Random Walk, Malkiel essentially says stock prices are impossible to predict. But his own results suggest otherwise: Since June 1991, his Princeton Scientific Capital Management has produced an average annual return of 25 percent, compared with 13 percent for the S&P 500--a showing Malkiel immodestly calls "pretty amazing." PSCM manages $40 million, mostly from partner Norton Garfinkle.<p>The Princeton professor sheepishly insists that Random Walk, which has sold more than 500,000 copies, remains valid. But he adds a few caveats to his much-quoted advice that investors should simply assemble a diverse portfolio and watch it move with the market over the long term. For example, Malkiel talks up measurements he once pooh-poohed, such as price-to-earnings ratios.<p>"You can make some money on some of these things some of the time," he says. "The question is, can you assemble a portfolio of investing styles to beat the market over the long pull?" Malkiel now believes he can do just that. Indeed, he'll soon start marketing his talents to institutional investors and rich folks.<p>"I'm surprised my system is doing as well as it is," he says. "I'm a skeptic, even as far as my own theories are concerned."

Ben Franklin may not survive a flood of counterfeit $100 bills from the Mideast<p>By David A. Andelman and Kevin Caliendo<p>Aring of Iranian and Syrian counterfeiters is printing near-perfect $100 bills faster than the U.S. government itself, threatening the current Benjamin Franklin note with extinction.<p>The founding father's face has graced U.S. currency virtually unchanged for the past 80 years, and the $100 bill has reigned as the highest U.S. denomination since the $500 bill was withdrawn from circulation in 1969. <p>But Ben has been in danger ever since "the high-tech $100 bills," as a Federal Reserve Bank spokesman calls them, started appearing early last year. Their quality is so good that for several months, the Fed quietly honored any fake "superbills" submitted by banks for exchange or collection. That unprecedented suspension of policy was never publicly disclosed. It ended May 3, when the banks finally had enough experience to start identifying the superbills themselves --the usual practice for counterfeit notes.<p>Now two congressmen are pushing little-noticed legislation that could lead to the complete withdrawal of the Franklin bill, a move that's favored by the Drug Enforcement Administration. The rationale for such extreme action: Working out of Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, the counterfeiters already have produced as much as $1 billion in superbills, described as the best U.S. currency ever made outside the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.<p>"They're perfect down to the magnetic properties of the ink," says Robert Kupperman, senior advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., and a leading expert on international terrorism. Only $300 million worth of real $100 bills was printed last year. <p>The superbills have thrown top U.S. officials into a panic. For good reason: There's an outside chance the dollar could be destabilized by this flood of counterfeit money--although that would require truly massive quantities of fake notes to be injected into the world economy, a rather far-fetched scenario.<p>More likely, though hardly less worrisome, is that the ersatz money is being produced to buy nuclear weaponry. CIA officials and terrorist experts like Kupperman believe the governments of Iran and Syria are masterminding the operation so they can buy weapons from North Korea, China, or rogue elements within the former Soviet Union. Syrian officials deny any involvement; representatives of Iran, North Korea, and China have no comment.<p>Experts say the only sure way to slow the Bekaa ring is to alter radically, or just do away with, the old-fashioned C-note. Minor changes don't work: The bill was retooled only three years ago to deter counterfeiters, adding a polyester strip that reads "USA 100" when held up to a light. The superbills don't have such a strip but have "USA 100" Imprinted so cleverly it's hard to tell the difference.<p>Legislators and government officials are focusing on damage control. A superbill committee is examining the issue, and a measure cosponsored by congressmen Henry Gonzalez (D-Texas) and James Leach (R-Iowa) orders the Treasury Department to devise a solution, however extreme. Hearings should begin soon. Among those arguing for the death of the $100 bill will be the DEA, which has always hated the large denominations used by drug traffickers. In this case, the fake notes apparently are moving into circulation via well-tested drug routes out of the Bekaa Valley.<p>The Bekaa counterfeiting ring ultimately could reshape U.S. currency. Whatever their solution for the superbill problem, goverment officials will likely have to reevaluate the security of all U.S. paper currency. Ben Franklin and Ulysses Grant--on the $50 bill--may find themselves out of a job, either because of a shift to higher-tech currency, elimination of large bills, or redesign of bills.<p>Says Allan Meltzer, a Carnegie Mellon political economist and supporter of a new $100 bill: "We have a lot of unused presidents."

For taxpayers, it can cost plenty to live where the streets have no name collecting<p>By Dean Robinson<p>One thing stop signs don't stop is theft: They're the most frequently stolen traffic signs. But other signs are popular too. Washington, D.C., for example, has a problem with the all way signs below stop signs. Nevada loses a sign for Highway 50, "The Loneliest Road in America," about once a week. At $320 a pop, that adds up. New York City raises its most-stolen sign, wall st, 45 feet in the air to deter thieves. Alas, the $65 sign still gets stolen the day after it's replaced; now it's replaced only four times a year. Following are some other most-pilfered signs.<p>City: Los Angeles
Sign: Stoner Av
Why? Not just drugs--there are 17 Stoners gangs in L.A.
Cost to replace: $75<p>Cities: Detroit; St. Louis
Signs: Kaline Dr; James "Cool Papa" Bell Av.
Why? Al Kaline is a Hall of Famer;
Bell was the fastest Negro Leaguer.
Cost to replace: $41; $35<p>Cities: Milwaukee; Houston
Signs: Pabst Av; Corona
Why? Party on, dude.
Cost to replace: $80; $35<p>City: Nashville
Sign: Chet Atkins Blvd
Why? Light-fingered fans just love the fast-fingered guitar legend.
Cost to replace: $75<p>City: San Francisco
Signs: Haight, Ashbury
Why? If you can remember why, you don't deserve to keep them.
Cost to replace: $200<p>City: Seattle
Sign: nw 94 St
Why? Those wacky graduating seniors--it was 93 st last year.
Cost to replace: $75<p>Cities: Boston; San Diego
Signs: Beaver Pl; Climax Ct, Dick St
Why? Heh-heh, heh-heh. He said "climax."
Cost to replace: $25; $100

						  <p>Low on cash? Selling blood at $10 a pint, that old standby, is for wimps. For real money, try a kidney or a cornea. Macabre as it sounds, you can sell about 50 percent of your body, legally or illegally, without killing yourself--and those willing to shop around the globe can get close to $80,000 for their marketable parts. Kidneys are most in demand: The going rate is only $1,000 in China but rises to $30,000 in Poland. In India, probably the world's premier chop shop, two whole eyes go for $5,000; in Buenos Aires, it's $7,000 a cornea. Parting with a square inch of skin will earn you $20 in India, and anyone selling an arm or a leg there gets up to $4,000 for the tendons and skin. In Russia, where testicles are used for rejuvenating cream, a pair fetches $4,000. In the U.S., legal options include sperm at $44 a shot, undyed hair at $12 an ounce, and donating (not selling) eggs at up to $1,200--for your time, of course.

Clinton's first year gets a grudging B from our panel of top economists<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>An informal survey of award-winning econo-mists shows only lukewarm regard for President Clinton's economic skills. Clinton's grade for his first year in office, a gentleman's B, was bolstered significantly by his victory on the North American Free Trade Agreement, which overwhelmed the economists' serious doubts about deficit reduction and health care.<p>"The grade may reflect how easily we grade our presidents, rather than how well he really did," says Paul Krugman, a 1991 winner of the John Bates Clark Medal for outstanding young economists.<p>Despite such caveats, each economist hailed NAFTA as a big step toward free trade and praised the president's lobbying ability. "A Republican president wouldn't have been able to get NAFTA through Congress, and most Democrats would've ignored it," says Laurence Meyer, current holder of the Blue Chip Economic Forecasting Award. "He pushed hard to get it. That alone deserves an A."<p>But most economists dock Clinton a grade or two for his other first-year initiatives. "The deficit-reduction bill puts too much reliance on tax increases," gripes William Hummer, the 1990 Blue Chip winner. "Small business is going to bear the brunt of this." Charles Reeder, recipient of the the 1982 Blue Chip, adds: "It's like some sort of punishment for those who made it big in the '80s rather than a sound economic plan."<p>Clinton has his advocates, such as Paul Samuelson, the 1970 Nobel Prize winner. "America is ahead of all the advanced nations in economic recovery," he says. "And Clinton has tried to do something about the baleful Reagan legacy of a bingeing, low- investing society." Says Peter Bernstein, the 1983 Blue Chip winner: "I'm not a deficit-cutting freak, but that's what the markets wanted."<p>Still, the president draws little but scorn from free-market absolutists such as Milton Friedman, a Nobel winner in 1976. "The health plan that Clinton has proposed would be an utter disaster for whomever adopts it," Friedman warns. "It is a straightforward regulated plan, a la Russia in the 1950s."<p>The president's B grade--hardly Rhodes scholar material--was inflated by two grades of incomplete from economists who felt that his policies would ultimately fail but wanted to see more evidence before sending Clinton off to detention. <p><p>

Travel agencies may be reluctant to tell fliers about deals on smaller airlines advisory<p>By Tom Nawrocki<p>Emboldened by upheavals in the airline industry, small carriers have been extending their flexible, low-cost services to bigger markets. The only problem is, some travel agents are unwilling to tell fliers about the small-carrier options.<p>One of the upstarts is Alaska's MarkAir, a former cargo-only airline that has been carrying passengers since 1984. After launching an Anchorage-to-Seattle route two years ago, it recently expanded to serve 14 cities in the lower 48. MarkAir never requires a round-trip purchase and asks as little as $180 for a round trip between San Francisco and Denver.<p>Unlike major carriers that swathe cheap fares in restrictions, many small airlines allow fliers to show up at the gate with a couple hundred bucks. Kiwi International, for instance, offers a round trip between New York and Atlanta on literally a moment's notice for only $169. Here's the catch: Kiwi serves just six U.S. cities and San Juan, Puerto Rico. Other off-brand airlines include Horizon Air and Morris Air.<p>Even frequent fliers may not know about such alternatives, and some travel agents don't volunteer the information to clients. When asked recently for the cheapest rate from the New York area to Denver, for example, Thomas Cook said that "all the carriers" were charging $527 for a round trip. Only a specific query about MarkAir prompted a better quote: $298 round trip. Another agency, Travel Network, said it couldn't find any fares for MarkAir flights from New York to Denver.<p>Why is it so hard to find these cheap fares? Perhaps because travel agents work for commissions, and the larger airlines usually pay higher commissions. Ticket buyers can protect themselves, however. One easy tactic: Always ask an agent directly if there's a cheaper flight available.<p>Fliers should also seek a second opinion on the lowest fare; some agents are more sympathetic to budget concerns. With a bit of homework, December travelers may find that an airline they've never heard of is just what they need: a nice holiday bonus.<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By Karen Benfield<p>Steven Spielberg isn't the only one making money off dinosaurs. As vinyl albums turn into fossils, rare-record dealers are cashing in.<p>Gryphon Record Shop in New York is one of a flourishing breed of vinyl-only outlets, most of which specialize in old classical discs. "Many recordings will never be transferred to CD," says manager Raymond Donnell. And audiophiles pay plenty for hard-to-find pressings: Gryphon charges $100 for a ten-inch album of violinist Mischa Elman playing Mendelssohn, for example.<p>A storefront isn't needed to corral this lucrative market. When Lawrence O'Toole had financial woes last year, he used vinyl to turn things around. "I loved classical music,"he says, explaining how his New York apartment became a clearinghouse for obscure discs. "But mostly it was desperation. I was in hock."<p>He isn't anymore: In the first nine months of 1993, the 42-year-old writer sold more than $50,000 worth of rare classical records, and his business is growing fast. O'Toole now publishes regular mail-order catalogs, and 80 percent of his sales come from overseas--a majority from Japan. Another rare-recording peddler claims an international clientele of 15,000. <p>It's possible to make stellar returns in the vinyl market. Savvy dealers snap up discs for a song at flea markets, record stores, and yard sales; O'Toole once plunked down 99 cents for a recording of pianist Marcelle Meyer playing Mozart and sold it for $501. Value is determined by the rarity of the disc, along with the level of the performance. Interesting jacket art also boosts value. Wondering if there's hidden gold in your record collection? Here are a few highly coveted albums:<p> Wilhelm Furtwangler conducts Beethoven's Fourth (VOX)<p> Ernest Ansermet conducts the Royal Ballet--Great Performances (RCA Living Stereo)<p> Famous Duets from French Opera, with Pierrette Alarie and Lopold Simoneau (Ducretet-Thomson)<p> Any recording by the Barylli Quartet (Westminster) <p> D.E. Inghelbrecht conducts Faure's Requiem (Ducretet-Thomson)<p> <p><p>

Rotisserie players should weigh the risks of a league that's based in the workplace<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>Office workers who take part in popular sports-fantasy leagues--also known as rotisserie leagues--may be gambling for higher stakes than they imagine.<p>Two federal employees recently were suspended and four others were reprimanded for the pastime, in which competitors construct imaginary teams made up of real players from multiple teams in a sport. The employees' sin: Using government computers to swap messages about their league. Meanwhile, in North Lauderdale, Florida, a firefighter lost his job after being arrested for running a league. Attorneys say millions more could be at risk because most fantasy leagues and office pools, while part of corporate life, are actually illegal gambling--except in Montana, where gambling laws exclude fantasy leagues.<p>A crackdown is unlikely, but workers with crabby managers should keep their league out of the workplace. "The people who have to worry are those whose bosses have no life," says Lew Fidler, a New York lawyer who also provides statistics for fantasy leagues.<p>Like most attorneys, Fidler thinks rotisserie players are safe if the boss plays too--and he notes that most authorities are in no position to enforce the law. "I run leagues for the legislature of New York, and another with Mario Cuomo," he says. "The U.S. Congress has one. And Tony Lake, the national security advisor, who can wake Bill Clinton up at any time, is in one as well."<p>Still, the legal situation remains murky. The Fort Lauderdale case didn't set a precedent because it was dropped on a technicality; the firefighter returned to work. In the federal workers' case, no criminal charges were filed and the workers continue to play in fantasy leagues. "But they don't even talk about it at work anymore," says their lawyer. "It takes all the fun out of it."

Spying turns from guns to butter, and spooks start lobbying for NAFTA<p>By David A. Andelman<p>The central intelligence Agency has quietly switched from the cold war to the trade war. And in its first major outing, the new-look CIA is emerging as an unexpected and persuasive lobbyist in the battle to ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement.<p>Intelligence sources say key voters on Capitol Hill--including senators David Boren and Alfonse D'Amato, and House members Bill Richardson and Robert Torricelli--have received classified briefings on NAFTA from senior CIA analysts. The CIA station in Mexico City also has bolstered the pact by hosting lobbyists, politicians, and aides as they pass through on fact-finding visits.<p>The agency's support for NAFTA heralds an era in which spies mainly serve their countries' economic aims, not political or military goals. It's also a crucial test for the CIA itself, as director James Woolsey tries to justify his budget by throwing manpower at issues close to boss Bill Clinton's heart: In addition to two political experts and a couple of military analysts, six economists now work at the agency's Mexico desk.<p>The CIA's briefings to members of Congress hammer on a simple theme: NAFTA will strengthen the Mexican government. People who have attended these sessions say the spooks bring along volumes of agency statistics to support their case. The pitch is focused on politicians who Woolsey thinks can make a difference. Boren, for example, is a swing vote on many economic issues. But the cagey Democrat is also an intelligence junkie; colleagues believe he can be swayed by the CIA.<p>Another important target is Richardson, the powerful New Mexico Democrat. Richardson is already a NAFTA believer, but he's expected to convince others who are sitting on the fence. Democrat Torricelli of New Jersey gets the nod as a maven on hemispheric trade, while spy-friendly Republicans such as John Warner of Virginia and D'Amato of New York are also on the hit list.<p>The CIA doesn't specifically acknowledge its briefings of members of Congress. A spokesman says only that "when we talk about policy issues, it's for the advantage of policy makers." But that's not the whole truth. Supporting NAFTA is good for the CIA too: It needs to keep Mexico's spies on its side as U.S. companies head south and become magnets for industrial espionage.<p>Mexico City is a legendary battleground for spooks. For years the city provided the only regular air route into Cuba, and it's a launching pad for agents being smuggled into the U.S. Small wonder that the CIA works closely with Mexico's spy agency and is currying favor with Mexican power brokers by supporting NAFTA.<p>CIA chief Woolsey is well suited to play Capitol Hill politics. He comes from Oklahoma, the same state as Boren and Democrat Dave McCurdy, former chairmen of the House and Senate intelligence committees, respectively. His hometown is also near the district of Kansas Democrat Dan Glickman, current chairman of the House committee. Ever a good neighbor, Woolsey keeps all three informed on CIA trade concerns. <p>Woolsey, who was expected to testify himself during NAFTA hearings, also may be angling for a closer relationship with Dennis DeConcini, current head of the Senate Intelligence Committee. The Arizona Democrat has pushed for cuts and major changes at the CIA. But he's also a strong supporter of NAFTA and may count Woolsey's help as a favor.<p> <p><p>

Mutual funds try to dampen investors' optimism by predicting lower returns<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Mutual fund companies haven't had to worry about luring new customers for a while now; the bull market has done that work for them. Instead, many companies are trying to ensure that all their new recruits don't bolt at the first sign of trouble. Curiously, their main tactic is to predict worsening performance.<p>"Have recent returns caused your expectations to become too high?" Scudder president Edmond Villani asks in a letter that braces his shareholders for disappointment. Even glummer is the latest missive to Vanguard customers from Chairman John Bogle: "It is clearly not out of the realm of possibility for stock prices to fall precipitously," he warns. Meanwhile, T. Rowe Price adds its own dark note with a $1 million advertising campaign focusing on risk. "People's sense of history is very short," says a spokesman.<p>Why all the doom and gloom? In part, it's out of fear that a market crash will scare away novice fund buyers--just as novices were scared away from stock buying by the 1987 crash.<p>"The specter of '87 is very much on people's minds," says Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical Services. "They know the good times can't last forever."<p>But a bigger worry is that the bull market may simply be petering out just as mutual fund companies are on the verge of changing American investing habits for good. With mutual funds now at the core of many people's portfolios, the argument goes, a bad period could turn the public against funds forever--unless expectations are carefully managed. And that would be devastating for an industry that until recently has attracted $1 billion a day in new investments.<p>"The funds have a tremendous amount of risk on their hands," says Don Phillips of Morningstar, a mutual fund-tracking agency. "If they disappoint, new investors may flee and never come back."<p>This concern makes sense for a few reasons. Many mutual-fund customers are spoiled because they've never seen a major market correction: According to a study by Investment Company Institute, one in ten didn't even own a fund before 1991.<p>Also, first-time fund buyers, as a group, have a median household income of just $40,000. That doesn't leave room for disappointment on Wall Street: It won't take much to send these investors scurrying back to the safety of CDs.<p>But all the caution flags may be counterproductive. T. Rowe Price now advises investors to expect 8 percent to 10 percent annual growth on stocks for the next several years. Vanguard predicts 7 percent to 10 percent for the next decade. That's galling when the Standard & Poor's 500 index returned 14.6 percent annually over the past decade--and 10 percent since 1926. Who wants to underperform the historic average, especially when some outside experts predict a 13 percent return on stocks? <p>The ironic result may simply be to drive investors away from the more downbeat fund companies--which happen to offer many of the best-established, safest, and most reliable funds. "Funds keep saying, 'Don't be so optimistic,' but investors see great returns,"says Phillips of Morningstar. "It may seem like they're crying wolf."<p>Beneficiaries of the scare tactics could include fund companies such as Invesco or Janus, neither of which intends to give customers any extra warnings. Or more money could flow to banks and other newly established fund hawkers with no track record.  <p> <p>

Tax exemption has finally come to the Church of Scientology. This doesn't just mean vindication for L. Ron Hubbard fans; it allows the cult's top-bracket types--Tom Cruise, John Travolta, Priscilla Presley--to claim new tax deductions. A guide to their potential savings:<p> On a 12-hour, $4,000 counseling course: $1,584
 On a $2,000 lifetime membership: $792
 On a $10,000 donation: $3,960
 On a $3,080 Hubbard E-Meter: $0 (not deductible)

						<p>By Jolee Edmondson<p>Instant Irish pubs are hot in Europe, and they're due here soon. Some assembly is required, but the effort is usually worth it--for Guinness, at least.<p>Where in europe can you get a pint of Guinness and retreat to an Irish-made oak snug to enjoy Irish food and music? Well, lots of places actually--France, Denmark, and Russia, to name a few. It's all part of a two-year-old scheme hatched by Guinness to sell more stout. The "Irish pub" concept, which will be exported to the U.S. in early 1994, involves selling aspiring bar owners a prefab kit complete with classic fixtures such as beamed ceilings and high "elbow tables." The kits are made by a group of Irish craftsmen. There are five models, ranging from a $90,000 rural cottage pub to a $400,000 Dublin Victorian pub with mosaic floor and stained-glass windows. Also on tap are services such as business advice and recruitment of Irish workers. So far, 150 entrepreneurs have bought from the County Wicklow-based Irish Pub Co., which got funding from Guinness but is owned by a top Irish architect. The brewer doesn't profit from pub-kit sales but does get extra revenue: The 20 Irish pubs that have sprouted in Italy each sell about 11,000 gallons of Guinness a year--ten times the beer sales of an Italian bar. In the U.S., Guinness will target middle-class urban areas and gentrifying historic sections of cities. The company hopes its brainchild will challenge local taverns and beery hangouts such as Bennigan's and Houlihan's.  <p> <p><p>

						 <p>Who else but a funeral director would be the premier dealer of serial-killer art?<p>Until the late 1980s, Rick Staton's pastime was innocuous enough--collecting, trading, and selling posters from old B movies. Then he read that John Wayne Gacy, one of history's worst serial killers, had taken up painting. Staton's passion for collecting turned macabre, and now, he admits, "most people are nauseated by it." <p>Staton, a Baton Rouge, Louisiana, funeral director and true-crime buff, was so fascinated by Gacy's new artistic bent that he wrote to the killer, who is on Illinois's death row for the murders of 33 young men. The two became pen pals, and within a year Staton was Gacy's "exclusive art dealer."<p>Staton's efforts helped give both men a weird underground celebrity. Now the mortician is using his new contacts and the notoriety of other serial killers to branch out. First up is a six-page catalog of serial-killer art and memorabilia. Included in the collection: The "bizarre pop-up greeting cards" of Lawrence Bittaker, who mutilated and murdered five teenage girls; the self-bound short-story booklets of William Bonin, the Freeway Killer, who murdered 14 in Southern California; and the seascapes and koala drawings of Elmer Wayne Henley, part of a Houston murder ring responsible for killing at least 27 people.<p>The 39-year-old Staton says he'll follow up with a magazine devoted to killers--a forum for infamous criminals to speak their minds, as well as "an outlet for people like myself who collect this stuff." An affable Houston native with a wife and young son, Staton believes such people are legion: The profits from his new efforts will put his son through college, he says. The serial-killer business is hot. Gacy's paintings of clowns quintupled in price, to about $200, after gaining collectors such as movie director John Waters. And they'll likely rise again when Gacy is executed: The paintings of the late Richard Speck, one of the most notorious American mass murderers, now command up to $2,000 each.<p>Since grooming Gacy, Staton has fallen out with his best-known client--he now calls the murderer "insufferable." But he's betting he can still make money by turning lesser-known criminals to art.<p>His labor of love recently has been Henley, the murder-ring member. Staton spent three years drawing Henley out of his shell with regular letters. Finally, "I sort of talked him into capitalizing on his notoriety. ... He had never drawn a picture in his life, and now he's going to do commissioned portraits."<p>About $70 of an average $100 sale by Staton of serial-killer art goes into the murderer's prison account. The remainder goes to Staton himself--though he argues that he'd collect and trade this stuff even if no money were involved.<p>Still, profit isn't far from Staton's mind: "I'm just hoping to make as much money as I can while people are interested," he says.<p> <p><p>

Nudist investors prepare for a bare market <p>By Andrew Gluck<p>The next time your investment-conscious neighbors talk excitedly about a "naked put," be careful how you answer. They may not be using the Wall Street term for selling a stock they don't own.<p>Introducing Bullish Bares, an investment club for nudists. Under its banner, 15 men and women--about half of them retirees--gather monthly in a retired college professor's living room in Cape Coral, Florida, to discuss stock-picking strategies in the buff. "We don't see ourselves as naked," says one member. "When you're talking about buying <a name="NYSE:BMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10232"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bristol-Myers Squibb</b></a>, you're not saying to yourself, 'My, that woman has big breasts.'"<p>Bullish Bares is made up of five married couples and five single people; most belong to the local naturist society. "Nudists have to manage their money, too," says a member. Indeed, the club's founders insist it's nothing special. "We're all straitlaced people," says the retired professor's wife. "A boring group."<p>While the dress code at Bullish Bares is risquE, its portfolio is far from risky. Six of its nine holdings are blue-chip stocks, including <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a> and Quaker Oats--though its largest position is a more daring bet on AFLAC, a small insurance company.<p>After the investment decisions have been made, everyone hops into the pool. But frolicking doesn't get in the way of business: Bullish Bares has trounced market averages, showing a 29 percent return in its first 18 months.  -<p> <p><p>

Personal computers are still dropping in price, but cereal is soaring: <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a> has raised prices three times this year. <p>What's the real inflation rate? And is it headed up or down next? The truth is, no one knows. But lately the markets sure have been acting as if they know. Falling interest rates and rising bond prices show that investors think inflation is sound asleep.<p>RISKY BUSINESS<p>The short-term trend is on their side. for the third quarter of 1993, one measure showed prices climbing at just 2.5 percent on an annual basis, well below 1992's 2.9 percent. But buying bonds on this trend is risky: Inflation must stay at current levels, or go lower, for investors to feel good about earning just 6 percent on ten-year bonds. Even if inflation hits the forecast of just nine months ago--3 percent or more in 1994--bonds could take a tumble.<p>Realizing they're treading the edge of a cliff, smart bond managers are prying apart standard indicators for signs that inflation might wake up. For such worriers, the commonly cited consumer price index is just a starting point.<p>BEHIND THE FIGURES<p>The cpi reflects the price of a "basket" of consumer goods and services, including transportation, food, and housing. By this measure, inflation seems under control. There's also the producer price index, which tracks prices of products before they get to consumers. The PPI rose in September for the first time since April, and seems to be climbing at about a 2 percent annual rate. Still no danger.<p>But some veteran inflation watchers feel the CPI and PPI numbers are misleading. Why? Because many of the trends that pushed prices lower in 1993 may not continue. Tobacco companies aren't likely to slash prices so deeply again, for example. Oil prices look like they've reversed their decline, and the new gasoline tax will also push up consumer energy prices.<p>GOING TO THE SOURCE<p>If the inflation trend is going to change direction in 1994, it will likely show up first in commodity prices. And here the news is disquieting, says Jim Grant, editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer. The production of basic materials from silver to gypsum has fallen behind demand. With silver, copper, nickel, and aluminum near the bottom of their historic price ranges--and with stocks and bonds near historic highs--the current cycle may be near its end. That makes the stocks of commodity-producing companies a better investment than bonds right now.<p> <p><p>

 <p>The man out to topple the Internal Revenue Service by welshing on his debts ("Crazed Like a Fox,"Outfront, October) continues on his unique course. Alex S. Gabor, author of Confessions of a Sex-Crazed Money Man, and his soon-to-be-ex-wife, Aerial Tiger, have filed for bankruptcy protection--claiming $750,000 in debt and $1.9 billion in assets. Gabor argues that the assets are tied to the defunct Marcos regime in the Philippines and can't be used to pay creditors. Gabor and Tiger also still owe much of their bankruptcy-filing fee. "Cases like this are why I stay on the panel," says the court trustee on the case.<p><p>The feds have won a victory in their crackdown against big unreported cash sales, which are often used to launder drug money ("A New Meaning for 'Car Wash,' " Outfront, June). One giant Washington, D.C.-area auto dealer, the Rosenthal group, not only settled federal charges after a sting operation, forfeiting $2.6 million in cash and more than 50 luxury cars; it also agreed to educate other local dealers about cash-sale reporting rules. The harsh terms were a surprise, since the feds didn't show that Rosenthal's owners or top managers were involved in any alleged violations.<p> <p><p>

A university hopes its students can make good grades in the mutual fund industry<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Now that there are more than 4,000 mutual funds, fund managers often use gimmicks to help stand out in the crowd. Even jaded investors may be startled by a new fund's claim to uniqueness, however: It boasts of being run by an unpredictable cast of university students.<p>The SBI Fund isn't merely a school project; it's a real fund that will invest real money. It's sponsored by the School of Business and Industry at Florida A&M University as part of its on-the-job approach to learning. In the past, SBI has sponsored other student-run enterprises--owning and managing a strip mall and an insurance agency, for example.<p>SBI students will be involved in all aspects of the SBI Fund, according to the fund's registration statement. Undergraduates will mostly do clerical work, while M.B.A. students will conduct research and pick stocks. The fund's cheap labor force and not-for-profit structure make for fees that are among the lowest of any stock fund.<p>The students will have plenty of guidance. Final say on investments rests with a professional fund manager--and looking over his shoulder is a star-studded advisory committee, including Dale Frey, president of GE Investments, and Leon Cooperman, a former top Goldman Sachs executive.<p>The SBI Fund, which was expected to open for business in mid-November, will offer two separate investment pools. With minimum investments of $250,000, both are aimed at institutional investors.<p>"It's curriculum for the students and a source of funds for the university," says Sybil Mobley, dean of SBI. Any profits from the SBI Fund will flow back to the school's coffers--an amount that Mobley predicts will be "more than chump change."<p> <p><p><p>

						 <p>At $82 million, Bush's library complex is the costliest presidential shrine yet in progress<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>For George Bush, the next few years could be just as challenging as his term in the White House.<p>Groundbreaking on his ambitious Presidential Library and Center at Texas A&M University is set for early 1994; soon Bush supporters will receive their first mail shot asking for donations. At a cost of $82 million, the project is by far the most expensive presidential shrine ever, eclipsing by some $25 million the previous record set by Ronald Reagan's library.<p>The massive undertaking--which includes a conference center and a government school--has its doubters, even though Texas A&M already has agreed to donate $40 million for snagging the complex. But fund-raisers remain chipper. The Bush Foundation has solicited "lead gifts" since July and has racked up more than $10 million so far. The largest donation is from former media mogul Walter Annenberg, who gave $2 million. "We foresee no problems" raising the entire amount, says Don Wilson, executive director of the future library and center.<p>When the library is opened in early 1997, its operations will be funded for two years out of the original $82 million. Then the National Archives will operate it at taxpayer expense, as it does nine other presidential libraries. (The privately funded Nixon library isn't among them: A campaign to keep it afloat has just been launched.) In all, the government spent $27 million in 1992 on the facilities.

						 <p>For years now, some gay activists have stamped the dollars they spend with pink triangles, slogans, or other signs, hoping to remind people that the homosexual community has, by some estimates, more than $500 billion in annual spending power. The tactic surfaced most recently in Cobb County, Georgia, where officials halted all public support of the arts so that no taxpayer money would go to gay artists. Although defaced currency is still legal tender, stamping money is a crime. Now activists who want to make a statement without breaking the law have an alternative: Pink Inc. of Bethesda, Maryland, has begun offering "gay-pride message checks," complete with pink triangle and microscopic writing that says, "Gay money," "No, she's not my sister," and other phrases. The checks can be printed for any bank account; so far, customers in 33 states have ordered them.<p> <p><p>

Don't answer these "political" surveys<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>The Association for Investor Awareness says it wants to "make your voice heard" inWashington, D.C. But answer its mailing and you'll do the listening--to cold calls from investment pitchmen.<p>AIA sends out mass mailings that challenge government policy on taxes and investing, asking recipients to help prod legislators. The patriotic-sounding patter ends by inviting investors to respond to an "Information Research Survey" about three basic tax rules.<p>So far, so good. But then AIA asks for investment preferences and personal information, including telephone numbers. "The results of this survey will be forwarded to Washington,"it promises.<p>It's true that AIAsent the tally from nearly 19,000 replies to the presidential campaigns of both Bill Clinton and George Bush last year. But that's the only contact AIAsays it has had with politicians. Despite the Washington address on its stationery, AIA has no listed telephone or staff there. Its "executive suite" in D.C. is manned by a service firm that simply collects the mail. AIAisn't among the 40,000 groups registered to lobby Congress, and other shareholder-rights organizations have never heard of it.<p>That's no surprise:AIA Director Mike Casson isn't an activist but a direct marketer by profession, and AIA's main business seems to consist of gathering and selling information. Actually based in Dallas, the group shares an office with American Direct Marketing Services, which sends out brochures as Marketing Investors Group. According to papers filed with the Texas secretary of state, Casson is president of ADMS.<p>ADMS/MIGis a classic name-selling shop,delivering lists of cold-call prospects in categories such as "master investors" and "older money." Reached at ADMS, Casson insists that AIAisn't a front for his direct-marketing business, describing it instead as "a conduit between concerned investors and their elected officials." But he can't cite any such work except mailing the rival presidential campaigns--once. (And all he has to show for that effort is a form letter from a Clinton aide.) Casson says AIA"would like to" start a library for investors, and that "plans are underway" for anewsletter.<p>He adamantly defends selling the names of investors who respond to AIAsurveys. "What we do isn't any different from any other publication or association," he says, noting that Worth sells the names of its subscribers. But AIA doesn't do much except sell names. Says Richard Barton of the Direct Marketing Association:"It has an obligation to tell people. It's not legally required, but. . . we consider it unethical." Casson says he doesn't see any need to disclose AIA's practices in its mailings.<p><p>

A dynasty is born<p>Sirio Maccioni, owner of Le Cirque, New York's venerable four-star restaurant, is tuning in to changing times. By the end of 1994, he plans to set up his three sons in a less formal establishment. The new place, serving "simple, straight" Italian food at reasonable prices, is seen as a model for other Maccioni restaurants. Eldest son Mario, 28, ultimately will run the new eatery by himself, while Marco, 25, will likely run a version in Paris and Mauro, 21, may get his own spin-off in Milan. Maccioni has also been exploring his dream of running a hotel in his native Italy; wife Egiis toying with a fast-food idea. Why all the activity? In part, Maccioni is ensuring a legacy:"I am very close to 60, and that bothers me very much." But he also knows that another Le Cirque isn't viable in the frugal '90s. Plus, it would spoil his sons:"You don't buy a Ferrari as a first car."<p><p>

Speculators make deposits in hundreds of thrifts, hoping to gain more than a toaster.<p>By Emanuel Howard<p>This year will be the most profitable for the troubled mutual-bank industry since its heyday in 1987--and that's great news for a little-known bunch of speculators dubbed "flippers."<p>But thrift bankers have become peeved by the easy-to-copy tactics of these opportunists and are fighting a rising wave of flippers.<p>Flipping is a sure way to make a buck from the trend for mutual banks--banks owned by their customers--to convert to stock ownership by offering shares to the public. When a thrift converts, its depositors get an insider price on the new shares, which can then be resold at a profit.<p>Obviously, reselling is easier if the offering is a big success. But with thrift stocks, that's hardly a gamble:Mutual-bank offerings have been hot ever since 1990. Share prices may pop as much as 50 percent in initial trading.<p>Flippers have turned this fact into a strategy. Now estimated to number a few hundred nationwide, these speculators deposit tiny sums of money in as many as 500 of the 1,300 or so remaining U.S. thrifts. They may wait five years for a thrift to become healthy enough to offer stock. Then they scoop up shares at a steep discount--paying, say, $10 a share--and can take profits as soon as the stock opens at, say, $15.<p>Today's most active flippers have been lying in wait since 1987, knowing that the savings-and-loan crisis eventually would spur a move toward more-stable stock ownership among thrifts. Another force promoting stock offerings:Thrift managers who survived the crisis are eager to cash in--they get the insider price on shares, too.<p>On top of this, a year of solid profits for thrifts means that shares are in demand among investors. Ninety-one thrifts converted last year, making it the first billion-dollar year since 1987. This year will be even bigger, analysts say. SNL Securities, an industry information clearing house, pegs 765 candidates as ripe for conversion. <p>There's nothing wrong or illegal about flipping, but thrift officials hate it because it makes for volatile stocks. When there's a heavy flipper presence, as many as 50 percent of all issued shares change hands shortly after a conversion. Prices may rise in the short term but often retreat soon after, leaving an aura of disappointment.<p>So thrift managers have begun to shut out the flippers--or at least flippers who operate on a nationwide basis. Most mutuals no longer accept out-of-state or mail-in deposits. Insider prices for shares may be restricted to depositors with accounts that have been open for six months or a year.<p>But this is just damage control: "The smart investors have already got their accounts set up," says Eric Luse, a partner at Luse Lehman Pomerenk & Schick, a law firm involved with many mutual-bank conversions.<p>There may still be opportunities for flippers--perhaps even in your neighborhood. Analysts say the Northeast is poised for a conversion boom in 1994, and speculators are scrambling to make deposits in time. States with especially healthy thrifts include New York, Ohio, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Indiana, and North Carolina.<p>"Some of these institutions are the strongest in the country," says Mark B. Cohen of Adams Cohen Securities. "In fact, if you've still got a mutual bank in 1993, it's probably a good one."<p><p>

Rap's new moguls prove that capitalism can come straight outta Compton<p>By Michael Small<p>No rap song pays tribute to spreadsheets and depreciation--yet. But the lexicon of finance is fast appearing in the private lives of many top rappers. As owners and chief executives of their own record labels, they aim to become leaders of a new moneyed class.<p>"I'm an assets person," says Luther (Luke) Campbell, leader of sex-rap group 2 Live Crew, which triggered a First Amendment firestorm in 1990 with songs such as "Me So Horny." "I'm into concrete investments, and I always wanted to work for myself."<p>Insisting on low overhead and plowing profits back into his company, Campbell already has produced about 35 artists on his Luke Records label. He's pulled in acts from genres other than rap--including H-Town, a rhythm-and-blues group that hit platinum sales this year.<p>Campbell isn't the only one using capitalism to expand beyond rap's usual boundaries. Eazy-E, former head of the vicious "gangsta" rap outfit N.W.A (Niggaz With Attitude) and boss of his own Ruthless Records, is banking on his new Jewish duo, Blood of Abraham. Seattle's Sir Mix-a-Lot is releasing the jazz-backed poetry readings of Jazz Lee Alston.<p>Indeed, in 1993 a corporate logo has become rap's ultimate status symbol. New Jersey's Queen Latifah and Long Island's Parrish Smith started their own labels this year, while MC Lyte and others recently formed artist-management companies.<p>"Rappers used to invest in cars, jewelry, and Moet," says Michael Gonzales, coauthor of rap guide Bring the Noise. "But Eazy-E and Luke showed that you can make some money if you get an office, buy a Xerox machine, and run a company."<p>Other rock and pop stars have launched successful labels--Prince heads Paisley Park, Herb Alpert created A&M --but the new rap moguls surpass most artists when it comes to signing hit acts year after year. Campbell's Poison Clan hit the Billboard Top 100 chart recently, for example. Eazy-E's biggest earners include Michel'le and MCRen, whose 1992 EPwent platinum.<p>By contrast, none of the new artists on Madonna's Maverick label have gone gold.<p>Many of rap's new entrepreneurs are backed by large distributors, but Campbell and Eazy-E have kept surprising independence. Campbell released his first 2 Live Crew single in 1985 with $10,000 he earned as a Miami DJ and party promoter. He kept costs low and could afford to cut out the middleman by distributing and manufacturing his own records.<p>Eazy-E, who grew up as Eric Wright in impoverished Compton near Los Angeles, started Ruthless with $25,000 he earned from illegal activities. He sold his records from the back of a car at swap meets. "Eric learned his sense of business from the streets," says former rock promoter Jerry Heller, a 50-year-old M.B.A. who has been Eazy-E's top employee since 1986. "He has a very Machiavellian sense of power and control."<p>After releasing several local hit singles, Eazy-E signed a distribution deal with Atco, followed by similar deals. He recently shifted most business to Relativity Records, where he negotiated for more control. "I ain't into up-front money," he says. "A deal is about getting the right percentage at the back end."<p>Campbell and Eazy-E spend between $175,000 and $275,000 of their own cash to make a record, video, and marketing plan for each new artist. In such a money-conscious atmosphere, even the finances of new proteges come under scrutiny. Parrish Smith asks the rappers on his PMD(Parrish Making Dollars) label to save 40 percent of their income: "We try to get them to put off buying the Benz and buy a cheap house instead."<p>The stars themselves also dabble in investments outside the industry. Eazy-E is a major shareholder in a bank and a software company, for example. Smith rents out homes on Long Island, while Campbell plays in blue-chip stocks and made a bundle as an early investor in ClearlyCanadian drinks.<p>Running a label, however, is the only form of capitalism that's as much fun as rapping. "It's a gamble," says Eazy-E of business. "But you might as well take the chance. If I make $500, I'll either turn it into $1,000 or I'll leave with nothing."<p><p><p>

						<p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>Among today's politically aware baby boomers, it's a rare couple that doesn't manage its investments as a team:The macho money man is a dying breed. But while they may agree on investment goals--well, sometimes, anyway--men and women still speak different languages when it comes to money, according to financial planners, brokers, and psychologists. Here's a brief guide to the comments these professionals hear from couples every day.<p>
On their lousy track record:<p>She:We've never been very good with money.<p>He:I've been too busy working.<p>On their investment skills<p>She: I'm not sure we're on the right track.<p>He:We've done okay.<p>
On risK:<p>She:I don't want to lose this.<p>He: How fast can we make this grow?<p>On indecipherable jargon<p>She:I don't understand what you just said.<p>He:I've been reading up on that. Could you go through it again?<p>
On losers:<p>She:We should never have bought that stock. That was stupid.<p>He:We should never have listened to that broker. He was a jerk.<p>On winners<p>She:I was lucky.<p>He:I've always had a feel for technology stocks.<p><p>

Is the market a Taurus or Ursa Major? Financial seers seek answers in the stars.<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Heaven knows whether the economy will falter or whether stocks will reach dizzying new heights. That's why we asked four noted financial astrologers what the stars have been saying lately:<p>Henry Weingarten, who says he manages about $9 million in assets, thinks a "Clinton crash" could hit this month or next--and that economic catastrophe is coming. Although the Dow Jones Industrial Average topped 3600 recently, Weingarten predicts a plunge to 2800 by December and a 1994 low of 2000. On the bright side, the conjunction of Uranus and Neptune, which brings chaos and confusion, will ultimately result in "a new vision," whatever that means. The new year will be good to real estate, he says, and gold will top $500 an ounce.<p>Cambridge grad Graham Bates was expecting a sharp dip in stock prices on September 30. After a brief recovery, he augured, a 300-point drop in the Dow would likely happen in late October or early November. Bates, a London-based astrologer who's a former pension-fund manager and a mathematician by training, tracks correlations between planetary and economic patterns. The opposition of Jupiter and Saturn that accompanied the Depression is happening again, he says, and a buildup of planets in Capricorn indicates great volatility for stocks in 1994. But by the end of 1994, sustained economic growth will lift the market back to all-time highs.<p>"I'm expecting a continued bull market in stocks, because [low] interest rates will continue until November 1998," says Grace Morris, an Oak Lawn, Illinois, astrologer and psychotherapist. Neptune is now in the earth sign of Capricorn, which tends to bring low rates. Morris expects that Virgo companies such as Coca-Cola and Texaco will have tough times in 1994 and 1995, when Saturn goes into Pisces and opposes their sun. But based on the 11-year nodal cycle of the moon, real estate is now reversing a low and won't top out until 2000.<p>Arch Crawford, perhaps the best-known of the celestial seers, has been expecting a big drop in the stock market since April; he says now it might come as late as February 1994. The Uranus-Neptune conjunction, which happens just once every 171 years, is unfolding as Saturn stands at a 90-degree angle to Pluto, itself a 33-year cycle. "If you like the status quo, that's bad," says Crawford. "But if you like change, it's good."He sees fear and political uncertainty knocking the Dow as low as 1200 by 1996 and was planning to sell gold in October so he could buy it back cheap in July 1994. That way, he'll ride out a bout of hyperinflation later in 1994--and be fully prepared when the U.S. is placed under martial law.<p><p>

Getting a car across the country is no joyride if you pick the wrong shipper<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Aileen gersing was told a $600 deposit and a one-page contract would get her Olds Cutlass trucked from Florida to Seattle in two weeks. Instead, she says, A. Aaron's Auto Shippers sent her car to California, leaving it in a lot where it racked up parking fees until she agreed to pay her $600 balance--which hadn't been due until the car reached Seattle. <p>"They held it hostage," she says of an ordeal that cost her $750 more than planned. (She had to hire another trucker to finish the job.) A. Aaron's president Mitchell Winik declines to comment on Gersing's charges, contained in a complaint filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission, but he previously has blamed a subcontractor for the delay.<p>Gersing is one of hundreds of people each year who run into trouble with car shippers. "It's a big problem, and it's only going to get worse," says Gregory Morrow, senior trial attorney for the ICC, which regulates the trucking industry. "There's no repeat business in car shipping. Why should they care if they screw you over?" Complaints this year describe cars that arrive with 2,000 extra joyride miles on them, cars that arrive damaged beyond repair, and cars left in lots while the company vanishes with customer deposits.<p>Nearly 400 complaints like Gersing's recently prompted the California attorney general to sue Palm Springs-based A. Aaron's, seeking more than $3 million in penalties for alleged nationwide deception of consumers. Resulting injunctions have kept the company out of action since June. Now A. Aaron's is striking back--starting with a suit against <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> for cutting off its toll-free telephone number. <p>To protect yourself:
-  Sign a contract with the company actually transporting the car, not just a company brokering the job. (A. Aarons is a broker.)<p>-  If the contract contains a "benefit of insurance" clause, don't sign. Such clauses require customers to claim car damage or loss on their own policies before demanding repayment from the carrier. <p>-  Check with the ICC that the company's insurance is paid and its record is clean--and send along a copy of the contract. Officials there don't give legal advice, but they'll warn about a bad deal.<p><p>

					<font size=4>
						<p>By Jim Jubak<p>It's been a spectacular downhill run for interest rates. In 1981 short-term rates hit 20 percent, while long-term rates clocked in at 13 percent. Today, 30-day Treasury bills pay just about 3 percent, and the 30-year "long bond" returns a little more than 6 percent.<p>Is this the end of the ride?<p>Probably, even though rates may drift a mite lower in the next six months. That's important for investors to know. Anyone who bought the long bond ten years ago would have earned, on average, almost 15 percent a year-only slightly worse than the S&P 500's performance during the period. (Existing bonds, with their higher interest payments locked in, rise in price when interest rates fall.)To match that showing for another year, however, long-term rates would have to drop another whole point, an unlikely prospect.<p>further declines aren't impossible, of course. after all, rates fell for 27 years from 1873 to 1900:The yield on railroad bonds, the benchmark of that era, sank to 3.18 percent from 6.5 percent. The greatest decline of this century sent rates even lower, to 2.45 percent on high-quality corporate issues in 1946, from 5.98 percent 26 years earlier. But while those bond rallies lasted a quarter century each, this one has matched their declines in half the time.<p>By this measure, the bottom is surely near.<p>The same conclusion comes from looking at real interest rates, rather than nominal rates. Nominal rates are what bonds, CDs, and bank accounts pay out-the number touted in your bank's window or in your broker's memos. To figure real rates, just subtract inflation.<p>Nominal rates jump all over the lot, following inflation, but real long-term rates remain remarkably stable at 3 percent, says David Munro, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in New York. With inflation now hovering at about 3 percent, nominal interest rates near 6 percent are in line with the historic norm.<p>betting on significantly lower rates, then, amounts to a risky guess that the 1990s will prove a historical anomaly. Such periods do exist:In the mid-1930s, for example, nominal rates ranged from 4 percent to 7 percent while inflation was essentially zero-a boon for investors. In the 1970s, rampant inflation meant that real rates were negative 1 or 2 percent for much of the decade.<p>The 1990s could also buck history, but Munro doesn't think it's likely. "Those were boom and bust periods," he says. "This economy is singularly neither a boom nor a bust."<p>That said, the current inflation number may overstate the health of the economy. The true figure, maintains Munro, is closer to 2.5 percent, giving rates a bit of room to fall yet. Investors can expect a few blips in rates, but "we're wobbling down" to a target of about 5.5 percent on the long bond, he predicts. <p>whether that's positive depends on your point of view. Paltry economic growth paired with modest inflation is good for economists and the bankers at the Federal Reserve, who despised the boom-and-bust economy of the 1980s. But for investors, it's come time to squeeze the last drops from the bond market and look elsewhere for double-digit returns.<p><p>

						<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Well, the rehabilitation of <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a> (CCI) is complete. In July, Fortune put its stamp of approval on the company's new seriousness. The bank, it seems, will be generating profits instead of red ink from now on.<p>Most of Wall Street agrees. The megabank has shed 14,000 jobs and pared $1.3 billion in costs over the past two years. All that, the herd says, should now drop to the bottom line. As of midsummer, 15 of the 27 analysts tracked by Research Holdings Limited have buys or buy/holds on the stock.<p>But wait. We hear skeptics crying in the wilderness__at least the wilderness not tracked by RHL. The bank, the skeptics say, has again only papered over its problems. Frankly, given Citicorp's history, we think the outnumbered bears deserve a listen.<p>
BUY: "I think that a powerful earnings recovery is in the making, and you have a very cheap stock on your hands. Citicorp is trading at 1.3 times book average while most regional banks are trading at 1.8. It's more investable today than at any other time in the past 20 years."
Projected earnings: $2.85 for this fiscal year, $4.25 for '94.<p>Arthur Soter, Morgan Stanley<p>
BUY: "In the long term, I think CCI has a unique franchise, with substantial stakes in high-growth areas of the world."
Projected earnings: $2.85 for this year, $4.75 for '94.<p>David Berry, Bruyette & Woods <p>
MAY SELL: "Citicorp is the least well-capitalized of the banks we follow. We think their capital needs will be greater than they've been saying. Citicorp has to raise $4 billion or $5 billion of common equity, and they've already done a lot of the easy things. Also, management at Citicorp is unknown at this point. Why should shareholders have to put up with that when there are better options out there?"
Projected earnings: $2.30 for this year, $2.75 for '94.<p>Raphael Soifer,
Brown Brothers Harriman<p>
SELL: "I advocate shutting the bank down. Look at their reserves for bad loans. The Feds are basically carrying Citicorp by not requiring them to take write-offs. It's going to be a disaster. Unless you believe in the miraculous real estate recovery, these guys are doomed. The numbers they're publishing are ridiculous."<p>Projected earnings: $2.50 for this year, $3.00 for '94.

Wal-Mart, Merck, and Philip Morris, to name three, are all trading between 25 percent and 40 percent lower than they did earlier in the year. Do any of these stocks have a chance of rebounding soon? Unfortunately, stocks don't rebound simply because they declined in the first place. Yes, the stock market is capable of overreacting to short-term problems, and yes, the essence of long-term investing is, in part, to hold on and weather the hard times. However, the plain truth is that downtrodden stocks tend to need a true catalyst to reverse direction.<p>Wal-Mart (WMT) may not get the catalyst it needs. Until this year, the sales growth at stores open at least one year exceeded 10 percent, far above the rates reported by other discount retailers. When the company announced same-store sales-growth expectations of 7 to 8 percent__good, but apparently not good enough__earlier this year, Wal-Mart stock slid and has yet to recover.<p>The decline in same-store growth is only part of the story. Wal-Mart, although still the class of the retail industry, cannot possibly maintain its historic growth levels: Earnings per share grew at a compound annual rate of 29 percent over the last eight years, fueled by the company's rapid expansion into new territory. <p>Wal-Mart stock will come back, but not because it is a bargain. Even today, Wal-Mart trades at 26 times its expected 1993 earnings, a decided premium to the overall market. The expected comeback is therefore likely to be a protracted one, coming from steady, somewhat lower growth.<p>Merck & Co. (MRK) shares have been weak, along with virtually everything else in the pharmaceutical sector. What the stock needs in the short term is for investor psychology to improve, which presumably would happen if the Clinton administration's health-care sanctions turn out to be less damaging to these companies than is expected.<p>Not all drug companies, however, are created equal. Although Merck is better positioned than such companies as <a name="NYSE:LLY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10509"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eli Lilly</b></a>, Syntex, and Upjohn__which are all facing similar periods of declining earnings__disappointing sales of Merck's Proscar prostate treatment and the company's apparent overdependence on pricing power have chipped away at its traditional industry leadership position. By contrast, shares of <a name="NYSE:SGP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11326"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schering-Plough</b></a> have almost fully made up the ground they lost in the first half of 1993 on the strength of the company's existing products and its new drug pipeline. Industry leadership appears to be changing, and a rebound for Merck cannot be assumed.<p>That leaves Philip Morris Cos. (MO). Pricing power had for years been the company's main strength, so when it announced sharp price cuts for its Marlboro cigarette brand earlier this year, the $77 stock crashed to $45 almost immediately. Yet now, with the stock trading under $50 a share, the $2.60 dividend gives Philip Morris a yield of more than 5 percent, the highest among the 30 Dow industrials. The dividend is sustainable on the company's non-tobacco earnings alone. <p>What this means is that Philip Morris shares have a new basis for valuation, one that provides downside support as investors await signs that the domestic tobacco business is improving. When these signs appear__or when the dividend is raised__the stock should react favorably and begin to move off the bottom.<p> <p><p><p>

Activists rebuff a politician who voted their way on the budget<p>By Emanuel Howard<p>In no state has the tax revolt of the 1990s run hotter than in New Jersey. It almost cost Bill Bradley his senate seat in 1990. It made "Dump Florio" bumper stickers the automotive accessory of choice. (Governor Jim Florio became the bte noire of the movement after he raised taxes in 1990.) And in 1991 it was pivotal in ending 17 years of Democratic dominance in the state legislature when it handed Republicans a lopsided majority.<p>But the beast still isn't satisfied. Just ask Frank Lautenberg, New Jersey's other Democratic senator. Lautenberg's vote on the budget against his own party's president is clear evidence that the tax revolt has not spent its energy __ even if the movement is increasingly vague on exactly what concrete measures it wants.<p>In the first round of voting in June on Clinton's tax plan, Lautenberg was one of six Senate Democrats who turned their backs on the president and voted with Republicans against the budget bill. "It's rather like supporting Franklin Roosevelt in 1932 and then not voting for the New Deal in 1933," says Republican New Jersey State Assemblyman Leonard Lance.<p>To hear Lautenberg tell it, he took a great political risk to protect the interests of the poor, elderly, and middle-class people of New Jersey. Lautenberg's spokesman, Steve Schlein, insists that the senator's vote was "fairly consistent" with his record and that the 40,000 postcards delivered to his office in a wheelbarrow by the Coalition Against Higher Taxes did not influence him.<p>"Bull," says Dick Zimmer, Republican congressman from New Jersey's 12th District and contender for the senator's seat in 1994. "Frank Lautenberg's vote was expedient." Prior to the Senate vote Zimmer harnessed the energies of New Jersey's anti-tax forces and led the charge against the state's senators. Bradley, who is halfway into his six-year term, wasn't swayed.<p>So what did Lautenberg get for his trouble?<p>"I think that absent the tax revolt of 1990, [Lautenberg's vote against the bill] would have never happened," muses Bobbie Horowitz, co-chair of Hands Across New Jersey, a key member of the anti-tax coalition in the state. "So I do think it's significant. But is it sincere? Probably not. And if it really mattered, if the party really depended on Lautenberg's vote, I'm not sure that it would not have been there." Says Patricia Ralston, the group's other chair, "I know that if Lautenberg wasn't up for reelection he would have voted yes. And I'm going to do everything in my power to have him knocked out of office." <p>Laments Schlein, "You can't win."<p>In fact, the tax revolt in New Jersey may be entering a new phase in which no politician wins. In 1992, when the movement peaked, rivers of blood ran down the Democratic side of the state legislature. Since then, the Republican-controlled body has done little to reverse Governor Jim Florio's tax package, save repeal a penny of the state's sales tax. Elected ears are burning in both parties. "We know the Republicans aren't pure because Bob Dole is a big tax man himself," says Tom Pearson, president of Bergen County-based Tax Revolt North. "The last biggest tax bill in history was his, in 1984." The anti-tax coalition recently met with Ross Perot's tactician, Orson Swindle.<p>The next test of the clout and strategy of the revolt comes this fall when Florio runs for reelection. After falling to single-digit approval ratings, Florio has rebounded. The polls in July were showing a virtual dead heat, with both Florio and his expected Republican challenger Christine Todd Whitman at 38 percent.

With the country mired in the most anemic economic recovery in decades, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan failed to meet the Fed's own 1992 goals for money supply growth. Time, then, to change the measure of money.<p>By Curtis Lang<p>Does money matter? Well of course it does, as anybody who's ever been a nickel short at the bus stop knows. But we don't mean that kind of money. We mean the kind the Federal Reserve Board worries about, the kind that's measured in billions and that includes the dollars in the consumer's wallet, the money deposited in checking accounts, and the balances in mutual funds. Economists believe that the supply of this kind of money is directly linked to the health of the economy. <p>Expand the supply of money too fast and inflation results, according to monetary theorists like Milton Friedman. Shrink it too much and the economy spirals into recession.<p>That seems simple enough. Unfortunately, many economists, politicians, and money managers believe the Fed has lost track of what money is. The truth may be even worse: The Fed's uncertainty is a smokescreen, a way to avoid political flak that virtually guarantees economic upheaval in the future.<p>Here are the facts, or at least those that the Fed carefully doles out. Every year the Fed sets its goals for the growth of the money supply, measured by a touchstone indicator called M2, which includes cash, checking accounts, savings accounts, time deposits, and money-market mutual funds. In 1992, the Fed wanted M2 to grow by 2.5 percent to 6.5 percent; it grew by only 1.9 percent. For 1993, the central bankers lowered their target for M2 to 2 percent to 6 percent, and still they missed. During the first quarter of 1993, as the fragile Clinton recovery sputtered along, M2 posted its first quarterly decline since 1959, in sharp contrast to previous recoveries, during which the Fed's aggressive easing of monetary policy has typically resulted in M2 expansion of 6 percent to 14 percent. <p>Congress, which has to face voters who believe the country is still in a recession despite the rosy scenarios pushed by pundits, hasn't been pleased, to say the least. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez and others in Congress say that Greenspan's failure to meet his own monetary targets undermines public faith in the Fed's ability to manage the economy. <p>Nobel Prize winning MIT economist Paul Samuelson told Congress late last year that Greenspan's 24 rate cuts from 1989 to 1992 were too little, too late to offset the bursting of the '80s bubble economy__and unhappy Bushies, who remember Greenspan's glowing forecasts of a no-recession "soft landing" from the boom, might agree. Samuelson says that Greenspan's lowered M2 targets for 1993 are an extension of Bush-era Fed policy that will result in continued stagnation unless someone provides a fiscal stimulus. Clinton and Congress, struggling to cut the budget, know there isn't any such stimulus around. They see the money supply as the only rabbit in town, with the Fed stubbornly refusing to pull it out of Greenspan's hat.<p>Greenspan's defense has amounted to a "did not"/"did too" argument couched in technocratic jargon. He told Congress that the feeble growth of M2 "does not pose a threat to the economic expansion," and added that M2 doesn't function well as a leading indicator of economic activity anymore. Look instead at M1, he urged. M1, a stricter definition of money that counts just cash, traveler's checks, and checking and NOW accounts, has been soaring for the last 13 months. And besides, yield-hungry investors have moved their cash out of CDs and money-market funds and into bond and equity mutual funds, which aren't included in M2. By Greenspan's new measures, the economy is actually__whaddaya know__expanding.<p>Inflation hawks within the Fed, like Vice Chairman David W. Mullins Jr., Wayne Angell, Lawrence Lindsey, and members of the Shadow Open Market Committee, a group of hard-money monetarists led by Carnegie Mellon's Allan Meltzer, disagree. The debate about M2 is beside the point, they say. They argue that with M1 soaring__up 12.3 percent in the year ending June 28__and Fed reserves ballooning while the central bank lets banks borrow at low cost and then sells them treasury bonds, Greenspan's monetary policy is already far too loose. Since the economy clearly hasn't picked up much speed, the hawks see stagflation resulting.<p>The view from Europe is even less sanguine. Dr. Kurt Richebcher, an economist and historian, says that the schizophrenic U.S. money-supply numbers reflect a two-tier economy, with Wall Street soaring and Main Street shrinking. "The M1 surge, while inflating the financial markets, completely fails to impact the real economy," Richebcher says. "Although the Fed talks tough, its action betrays continuing aggressive ease. But instead of stimulating the economy, it stokes a financial mania. Surging M1 is a sign of [a kind of] inflation that has nothing to do with the real economy. It's a most disastrous kind: financial inflation. Big financial bubbles, sooner or later, must end in a bust. The experiences of 1929, 1937, and 1987 are undeniable evidence."<p>Even if Greenspan's monetary theories are total hogwash, as political tactics they are priceless. Congress and the economic community are wrapped up in arguing such arcane mysteries as what defines M2, how to measure velocity, and the like. The uproar has drowned out all significant public debate about the potential for impending stagflation, deflation, or inflation. <p>"I think the winners are the central bankers, who can gather and congratulate each other on what a wonderful job they're doing, and be tough and stern and all the other good words," legendary Republican economist Paul McCracken snarls. "The losers are clearly those without a job and trying to get employed." <p> <p><p><p>

Some money-market funds want investors so badly they'll cut their fees__at first<p>By Tim Middleton<p>Money-market yields have been cut to the bone. Taxable funds, which make up three-quarters of the market, currently net just 2.6 percent, and tax-frees a paltry 1.8 percent, according to IBC/Donoghue.<p>But those are just average yields. Some funds are doing much better by their investors, and others much worse. Pretty much all of the difference is due to the amount that a money-market manager charges investors to run the fund. Some managers in the $574 billion industry charge four times as much in fees as others. And every cent of that comes out of the interest an investor could be earning.<p>In this environment, it makes sense to search for a money-market fund with low expenses and better-than-average returns. But before investors switch, they should read a bit of fine print. Some funds run genuinely tight ships, with expenses lower than the industry average of 60 basis points. (Fund-management expenses are measured in basis points, 100 of which make one percentage point.) But other funds look good only because the fund company has decided to waive all or part of its expense charges, a practice called undertaking. Half the nation's 930 funds, up from one-quarter just two years ago, are undertaking. Eight of the ten least-expensive funds as ranked by Donoghue, including Strong U.S. Treasury, First Union Treasury, and INVESCO Treasurer's, are atop the list only because they undertake. <p>What's so bad about this? A fund can decide to stop undertaking at any time. These funds are betting that eating expenses now will pull in investors who either won't notice when the fund stops undertaking or will be too lazy to move their money even if they do notice. Investors, therefore, have two good choices. They can avoid the undertakers and stick with funds that really have their expenses under control, or they can go with the deal now and be ready to move when the expense-waiver is rescinded.<p>For example, the exceptional 3.3 percent return offered on the Aetna Money Market Fund is possible only because the $72 million portfolio has been absorbing fees and expenses since the fund's inception in January 1992. Aetna reckons its actual fees and expenses total 70 points; imposing them would make it just another face in the crowd. Some 40 percent of customers are new to the insurer-cum-mutual fund complex. "Yield shoppers will switch funds to pick up 20 or 30 basis points," notes Christian Thwaites, an Aetna marketing aide. Aetna hopes they'll tarry to sample other wares such as annuities.<p>On the other hand, some money-market funds are run by genuine skinflints. One of the few true low-cost operators, Vanguard Group, has annual charges that reduce gross yields on its money funds by 30 points or less, and actual returns therefore run well above average. And Vanguard keeps expenses low despite offering all the bangles offered by more expensive funds, such as unlimited check writing ($250 minimum). "When you look at our expense ratios, you're looking at what it costs for all the bells and whistles," says Ian MacKinnon, boss of the group's $48 billion fixed-income portfolio.<p>Exactly what do those higher expense ratios go for at other funds? Profit for the fund manager is the simple answer. One of the highest-cost operators, Shearson Money Market Portfolio, deducted 130 basis points from a gross yield of 3.39 percent in the first quarter. That left just 2.09 percent for investors. Shearson also limits use of the cash to its own family of mutual funds; outright withdrawals can result in a back-end load of up to 5 percent.<p>It isn't that hard to escape the high-fee graveyard. High rollers can seek out funds with huge minimums: Vanguard's Admiral requires a balance of $50,000, but charges are a rock-bottom 15 points. Low-cost offerings with above-average net yields and the more conventional minimum of $3,000 include the U.S. Treasury Fund from Gabelli, another true skinflint.<p>Anyone who still insists on paying top dollar, incidentally, has plenty of choices. Oppenheimer Cash Reserves, SunAmerica Money Market Securities, and Mutual of Omaha Money Market Account each recently charged 129 points or more and reported net yields in the low 2 percent range.<p>A readily available benchmark on yields, published daily in the "Money Rates" table in newspapers, is the net return on <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> Ready Assets Trust. It's a top performer and its charges are about average.

The mania for REITs makes a bad deal possible<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Golf is more popular than ever. So are real estate investment trusts. Putting the two together in National Golf Properties, a real estate investment trust (REIT) that will own golf courses, would appear to be a stroke of genius. Savvy investors instead score this a bogey that illustrates how the popularity of REITs is making it possible to sell some questionable deals.<p>National Golf is part of a drive by <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley & Co.</b></a> to capitalize on the REIT craze now sweeping Wall Street. The blue-chip Wall Street firm, which has limited experience with REITs, is expected to rake in $15 million in fees for raising about $200 million from investors in an initial public offering that was in the works in mid-July. But National Golf is a REIT that, as it was structured at press time, scores better for the investment bankers than for investors.<p>"This is a deal that probably shouldn't get done at just a 7 percent yield," says Ken Campbell, an Upper Saddle River, New Jersey, money manager who specializes in real-estate securities. "But because it's got golf in the name and it's a REIT, it just may do well."<p>Golf is hot on the street right now. The only other pure plays on golf are both smashing successes: <a name="NYSE:ELY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15521"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Callaway Golf Co.</b></a>, which makes the Big Bertha club, has nearly doubled in price since its February 1992 initial public offering; <a name="NASD:ALDA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16236"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Aldila Inc.</b></a>, which makes graphite tubing used in golf clubs, went public in June at $14 a share and within weeks soared to $26.<p>Because National Golf isn't just a golf play, it's raking in the green. A heavy calendar of upcoming public offerings ensures that 1993 will be by far the biggest year yet for REITs. And REIT stocks have risen smartly since real estate bottomed in 1990, showing a total return of 36 percent in 1991, 12 percent in 1992, and 16 percent in the first half of 1993, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts in Washington, D.C.<p>But real estate pros say they wouldn't touch National Golf's initial public offering with a ten-foot nine iron. The company is fraught with conflicts of interest, and its unusual corporate structure could jeopardize its special tax status as a REIT.<p>REITs, which are formed to buy properties, mortgages, and other real estate assets, were created by a 1960 federal law that exempts real estate companies from taxation if they pay out at least 95 percent of their income as dividends. Typically, the special tax status accorded a REIT sails past the IRS without a question. But National Golf isn't a typical REIT.<p>"We think there's a real risk of the IRS stripping the company of its REIT status, and that would be a catastrophe for the stock," says Robert Steers, chairman of Cohen & Steers, which manages a top-performing real estate mutual fund.<p>National Golf is an untested kind of REIT, one of just a half-dozen "umbrella partnership" REITs, or UPREITs. The first UPREIT went public less than a year ago__and the IRS hasn't yet ruled on its tax status. The agency may eventually find that UPREITs don't qualify for the favorable tax treatment accorded REITs.<p>Unlike traditional REITs, shareholders in UPREITs don't own real estate directly. The property is owned by a limited partnership, and the REIT owns the partnership. Investors in National Golf will own 53 percent of the units in the partnership; the rest will be owned almost entirely by David G. Price, who heads one of the premier golf-course management companies in the nation.<p>Price chose the UPREIT vehicle because it allowed him to transfer 47 golf courses he owned to the partnership without actually selling them, thus avoiding any capital gains taxes. That too could hurt National Golf, says Steers, if the IRS rules that Price's transfer of the golf courses was actually a sale for tax purposes.<p>While National Golf's status with the IRS may be in doubt, the conflicts of interest posed by the deal are clear. The worst is an unusual clause in the prospectus that permits Price to sell all his units in the limited partnership back to the company for cash. "Price might decide to sell his units back to the REIT when golf-course prices are peaking, and the company might be forced to sell new shares of stock or leverage up in order to pay him off," warns William Ackman of Gotham Partners, a hedge fund in New York that invests in REITs.<p>None of this means the deal won't go down, however. With interest rates lower than they've been in decades and investors dissatisfied with a return of less than 3 percent on a money market fund, National Golf's 7 percent annual dividend may seem an irresistible attraction. Ackman urges discretion. "Investors are being yield pigs," he says. "They don't understand that return of capital is more important than return on capital."<p> <p><p>

He's number one, but should any investor bet on Thieme?<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>"I don't have a strategy," says mutual fund manager Heiko Thieme. "I just do whatever's necessary to shoot for returns of 15 to 25 percent a year." Lately, he's delivered. But should any investor be willing to follow this daredevil, even for that kind of return?<p>The stage for Thieme's high-wire act was set in February 1990, when the German-born lawyer left his job as a stock strategist for the American subsidiary of Deutsche Bank to take over the <a name="FUND:AHERX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AHERX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Heritage Fund</b></a>, a battered 40-year-old stock fund. Thieme paid just $10,000 for the fund-management company. Paying more than a pittance would have been crazy, because American Heritage wasn't just a bad fund: It was the worst mutual fund in the nation over the preceding five years. Ever the showman, Thieme viewed that as a strength. "I thought, if I own the worst- performing fund, that will be newsworthy," he says.<p>But 1990 was almost a disaster. Thieme sank about $200,000 of his own money into the venture, for overhaul and administration. Despite 90-hour workweeks, Thieme showed a dismal 30 percent loss that first year.<p>The next year, Thieme turned things around. Between the beginning of 1991 and the end of last June, American Heritage has been number one, according to Lipper Analytical Services Inc., up nearly 200 percent__more than four times the gain of the average stock fund. American Heritage gained 96 percent in 1991 and 18.9 percent in 1992, and was up 30 percent in the first six months of 1993.<p>Thieme's technique seems to be frenetic activity, and lots of it. He has turned over his portfolio in the last three years five times more often than the average fund manager has. He's also served up a smorgasbord of unusual tactics that includes shorting stocks, day trading, making dividend plays, and a touch of market timing. "I have ten years' experience running a trading desk at Deutsche Bank," he says. "Why shouldn't I use it?" It's not uncommon for Thieme's $100 million fund to trade in and out of $10 million of stock in a single day.<p>Such techniques are rare for a mutual fund manager, and Thieme's main profit-making tactics are more mainstream. But they are equally aggressive. He times the market (he has maintained a 25 to 35 percent cash position in recent months, for fear of a market pullback) and he makes big bets on beaten-down blue chips and small growth companies no one has ever heard of.<p>For a blue chip to qualify, it must be hated by most other investors. Three of the fund's five largest positions were contrarian plays on America's most out-of-favor, well-known brand names: <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip MorrisL</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>.<p>The rest of the fund's stock position is in scantily covered midsize and small-company stocks that are often too small or too risky for institutional investors. For instance, Senetek (ADR OTC), a British biotech company with a market capitalization of about $25 million when Thieme bought it in September 1992, is the fund's largest position, accounting for 7 percent of assets in early July. No other fund tracked by Morningstar owned even a single share of Senetek, according to analyst Amy Arnott.<p>"I am a risk taker," says Thieme, who studied law in Hamburg, Edinburgh, and Berkeley before moving to the United States for good in the late 1970s. "But I take only calculated risks." Thieme's leisure-time activities belie that claim. He flies planes and skydives, and he claims to have eaten razor blades. In 1972, he bluffed his way up the Matterhorn, telling an instructor he had climbed Mount Whitney in California. "He asked me which side I climbed," recalls Thieme. "I said, 'Not the easy side.'"<p>Thieme, an intensely public man, has assiduously courted the press, averaging at least one appearance a week on financial TV talk shows, where he unabashedly hypes his record. Time will tell whether Thieme's turnaround of American Heritage is a fluke or the first outing of a masterful investor. Either way, the show should be a great one.<p>Investors with weak hearts, however, might be better off just watching.

						Don't Cry for Argentina<p>
Madonna's star turn as Evita has stirred up the pride of the Peronists in Argentina. Perhaps she will inadvertently stir up the Argentine market, too, by reminding U.S. investors that more than Mexico and Telmex stock lie south of Texas. Argentina's Merval stock index could be ready for a nice run. After all, with so many markets flying high in 1996, Argentina's looked mediocre with only a 16 percent gain.<p>
Yet economic conditions are good in Argentina. The toughest challenge of the past three years has arisen not internally but from Mexico. All of Latin America has suffered from the devaluation of the Mexican peso in late 1994, an experience known in the markets as the Tequila Effect: Investors caught in Mexico's stock-market crash felt as if they had swallowed the worm at the bottom of the tequila bottle. They concluded that finances elsewhere in Latin America must be much worse than official reports claimed and assumed that governments couldn't be trusted not to devalue their currencies.<p>
Argentina, however, has been pushing real economic measures and public-relations policies to demonstrate its commitment to a solid currency, a responsible fiscal budget, and economic reforms. The key to Argentina's economic credibility is its Convertibility Plan, which prevents the government from artificially pumping up the money supply and inciting inflation, which averaged a whopping 6,800 percent in 1990. Essentially, the government has pegged the Argentine peso to the U.S. dollar and promised that anyone can exchange pesos for an equivalent number of dollars. It guarantees this trade-in value by printing only as many pesos as it has dollars. At the height of the Mexican crisis, Argentine officials pledged to buy back every single peso if they had to. That's a strong commitment -- so strong that comforted investors didn't take them up on it.<p>
While the plan saved Argentina's credibility, it pinched the economy. In order to continue attracting foreign investors and keep those dollars in its vaults, Argentina had to jack up interest rates, which in turn slowed the economy. Peso CD rates jumped from average returns of 8 percent in 1994 to 11.67 percent in 1995. The gross domestic product, which grew at 7.4 percent in 1994, shrank to 4.4 percent in 1995. Unemployment leaped from 11.5 percent in 1994 to 17.4 percent in 1995. Last year, it hardly improved, drifting down to 17 percent.<p>
Such wrenching changes in the economy put tremendous pressure on President Carlos Menem's government. But Menem had a convenient fall guy: then economy minister Domingo Cavallo. Since Cavallo was widely known -- and hailed -- as the father of the Convertibility Plan, he was blamed for its painful side effects. Once the economy started growing again in 1996, Menem removed Cavallo, a future political rival.<p>
Like Evita's life, Argentina's economy has drama and captivating personalities. Right now, that story is in a good phase. The economy has been pulling out of the recession for a few quarters, racking up a 6.6 percent GDP gain in the third quarter of 1996, paced by a 17 percent jump in fixed investments -- a sign of renewed confidence. Cavallo's replacement enjoys a reputation for fiscal toughness and has the stature to resist political attacks on the Convertibility Plan. Like all emerging markets, Latin America's are allergic to higher U.S. interest rates, which tend to keep speculative money at home. But barring Federal Reserve Board tightening, 1997 may be the most relaxing time in Latin America since Mexico exploded in December 1994.<p>

						The 30-year bond may yet rally enough to drive its yield decisively below the magical 6 percent mark, but investors will have to wait until later in 1997. The bond fell 3.2 percent in value during the first three weeks of December, cruelly disappointing the many buyers who had expected a rally through the Christmas holiday. Only a weaker-than-expected Christmas retail season is likely to move interest rates lower quickly and give investors who are speculating on rates the reward they seek. This page displays the results of our search for high-yielding investments that offer different levels of safety and liquidity, depending on an investor's goals and investment horizon. Our top picks below represent the best choice for the investor who (1) needs cash, (2) wants near-term yield, or (3) seeks long-term returns.    <p>
**As Safe and Liquid as Cash**
Our picks with an emphasis on safety<p>
We look at Treasury bills, money-market funds, bank money funds, and short-term CDs -- instruments that lock up money for no more than three months -- for this category. Safety is paramount here. The competition for savers' dollars has heated up: Many banks are now offering high promo rates, while many top-ranked taxable money funds are waiving at least a portion of their fees. Fund managers continue to maintain longer-than-average maturities as they lock in rates in anticipation of declines in short-term rates. The average maturity for taxable money funds is now 54 days (out of a maximum 90 days), while the typical tax-free fund averages 50 days. <p>
TAXABLE<BR>
Fund, Telephone Number, Yield<BR>
OLDE Premium Plus Money Market Fund, 800-872-6533, 5.70%<BR>
Strong Heritage Money Fund, 800-368-1030, 5.70<BR>
Southern Pacific Thrift & Loan (CA), 3-mth. CD, 800-428-5056, 5.65<BR>
Bluebonnet Savings (TX), 3-mth. CD, 800-343-5874, 5.56<BR>
Abbotsford Bank (WI), Money Market Account, 800-288-2229, 5.55<BR>
<BR>
TAX-FREE<BR>
Montgomery Federal Tax-Free Money Mkt. Fund, 800-572-3863, 3.54%<BR>
Strong Municipal Money Market Fund, 800-368-1030, 3.46<BR>
Vanguard Muni. Bond/Money Mkt. Portfolio, 800-662-7447, 3.42<BR>
Kemper Tax-Free Money Fund, 800-621-1048, 3.30<BR>
Fidelity Spartan Municipal Money Fund, 800-544-8888, 3.26<BR>

<BR><p>
**Saving for a Goal Two to Three Years Away
Our picks with an emphasis on safety and yield<p>
The ten funds below offer the best performance based on 12-month yield and three-year total return. We exclude candidates that had a loss of more than 3 percent during any three-month period in the past five years. The top-producing taxable and tax-exempt funds on our list have recently moved to boost yields by buying lower-quality bonds. Strong Short-Term Bond has 57 percent of its assets in bonds rated BBB or lower. USAA Tax-Exempt Short-Term Fund has 23 percent of its portfolio in BBB or lower bonds. This strategy can add risk, although both funds have histories of low volatility. Both also continue to maintain an average credit quality of A.
<BR>
TAXABLE<BR>
Fund, Telephone Number, Yield, 3-Year Total Return<BR>
Strong Short-Term Bond, 800-368-1030, 6.90%, 5.49%<BR>
Fidelity Mortgage Securities, 800-544-8888, 6.52, 8.00<BR>
Sit U.S. Government Securities, 800-332-5580, 6.23, 6.06<BR>
Strong Advantage, 800-368-1030, 6.08, 5.88<BR>
Vanguard Fixed-Income S-T Corporate, 800-662-7447, 6.00, 5.65<BR>
<BR>
TAX-FREE<BR>
T. Rowe Price Tax-Free Short-Interm., 800-638-5660, 4.33%, 4.10%<BR>

Vanguard Muni. Limited-Term, 800-662-7447, 4.07, 4.20<BR>
Dreyfus Short-Intermd. Muni. Bond, 800-645-6561, 3.70, 3.63<BR>
Vanguard Municipal Short-Term, 800-662-7447, 3.59, 3.72<BR>

<BR><p>
**Investing for a Goal at Least Five Years Away**
Our picks with an emphasis on total return<p>
In the picks below -- suitable for a patient investor able to tolerate sizable near-term dips -- we emphasize five-year total returns and high current yields. We don't ignore safety altogether; top choices must have a demonstrated ability to limit downside risk. Strong Short-Term and Fidelity Mortgage, in fact, place extra emphasis on safety (they are meant to appeal to savers) but have still achieved impressive five-year returns. Northeast Investors Trust employs a different approach. It ventures into lower-quality bonds than many other junk funds -- seeking high returns -- and counts on managers Ernest and Bruce Monrad's due diligence to limit risk.  
<BR>
TAXABLE<BR>
Northeast Investors Trust, 800-225-6704, 8.69%, 15.57%<BR>
Vanguard Fixed-Income GNMA, 800-662-7447, 7.10, 7.04<BR>
Strong Short-Term Bond, 800-368-1030, 6.90, 6.73<BR>
Fidelity Mortgage Securities, 800-544-8888, 6.52, 7.40<BR>
Dreyfus Basic GNMA, 800-645-6561, 6.15, 7.57<BR>
<BR>
TAX-FREE<BR>
T. Rowe Price Tax-Free High-Yield, 800-638-5660, 5.78%, 8.03%<BR>
Sit Tax-Free Income, 800-332-5580, 5.50, 7.20<BR>
Vanguard Municipal High-Yield, 800-662-7447, 5.47, 8.06<BR>
USAA Tax-Exempt Intermd.-Term, 800-382-8722, 5.14, 7.04<BR>
Vanguard Municipal Intermd.-Term, 800-338-2550, 4.58, 7.32<BR>

The Prudent Speculator
Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.
<a name="NASD:DFLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13173"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DATAFLEX </b></a> (Nasdaq: DFLX)  Up to $3.15
Dataflex (Clearwater, Florida) sells, services, and supports desktop-computer equipment, primarily through contracts with large companies. (Its lines include the likes of <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple</b></a>.) In 1994 and 1995, Dataflex undertook a series of acquisitions that left it saddled with heavy debt. In 1996, however, the company embarked on a major consolidation, shedding nearly two-thirds of its businesses and pruning its debt to $22 million from $65 million. I expect profitability to return quickly. The stock now trades near an eight-year low and considerably below its book value of $4.96 a share. My three- to five-year target price is six dollars.<p>
Jim McCamant
Medical Technology Stock Letter 
Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.
GENEMEDICINE Up to $6
GeneMedicine (the Woodlands, Texas) is at the forefront of the biotech industry in developing gene-therapy products that will be used more like traditional drugs -- a breakthrough that will allow physicians to control the dose and length of treatment. GeneMedicine has strategic partnerships with Roche Bioscience to develop treatments for severe asthma and with Boehringer Ingelheim  to develop cancer treatments. The company has ample cash reserves, and I expect the stock to react positively to the impending announcements of additional corporate partnerships and the initiation of clinical trials. My 18- to 24-month target for the stock is $10 a share.<p>
Michael Murphy
California Technology Stock Letter
Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.
<a name="NASD:OCTL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14306"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>OCTEL COMMUNICATIONS</b></a> (Nasdaq: OCTL)  Up to $25
Octel (Milpitas, California) is the leading maker of equipment for voice-messaging systems. The company has solid underlying financials, and sales have grown an average of 21 percent a year since 1992. Six months ago, the stock was trading as high as $31 a share, but when Octel delayed a product release, the market came down hard -- shares plummeted to $14. But the company has won three large new contracts with cellular companies in South America and Asia and has recently bought back 1.5 million shares. I predict Octel will still earn $1.15 a share for the fiscal year that ends June 1997 and $1.35 a share for fiscal year 1998. My year-end target price is $40.<p>
Louis Navellier
MPT Review
Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks.
<a name="NYSE:SFY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12354"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SWIFT ENERGY</b></a>(NYSE: SFY)  Up to $38
Swift Energy (Houston, Texas) is a 17-year-old oil-and-gas company that focuses on exploration and development in 15 states and around the world. For the nine months ended September 1996, Swift's revenues were up 97 percent, and earnings were up 172 percent. The company's oil production increased 17 percent during the period, and its natural-gas production jumped an astounding 98 percent -- in part because of the successful completion of a project in Texas, where the company more than doubled its position in 1996. With continued growth from partnerships and joint ventures, earnings should reach $1.15 a share in 1996 and $1.45 a share in 1997.<p>

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which he considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after December 20, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these managers are meant to illustrate a range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy stock, Worth recommends they conduct their own due diligence.<p>

<a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value</b></a>
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $500 million.
<a name="NASD:RIVL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12649"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>RIVAL</b></a>  (Nasdaq: RIVL)   Up to $27
If you agree with Peter Lynch's idea that investors should consider companies whose products and services they use, then Rival (Kansas City, Missouri) is a good candidate. Who has never used a Rival Crock-Pot or can opener, a Pollenex showerhead, or a Patton fan? Rival is emerging from a period of flat earnings triggered by recent acquisitions -- last year, for example, the company bought Bionaire and Fasco Consumer Products. As these and other acquisitions begin to pay off over the next two years, Rival should enjoy robust earnings. At about 11 times my 1997 earnings estimate of $2.10 a share, the stock is undervalued and underappreciated.<p>
James P. Craig
<a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>
Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.
<a name="NYSE:FMS"></a><b>FRESENIUS MEDICAL CARE</b>  (NYSE: FMS)   Up to $32  
Fresenius Medical CareNorth America (Lexington, Massachusetts), the nation's largest provider of dialysis services and products, was created by the merger of National Medical Care and the German manufacturer Fresenius. The result is a dominant and highly efficient company whose 21 percent market share is three times that of its nearest competitor. I expect revenue to grow more than 20 percent a year over the next three to five years, in large part because kidney failure is one of the fastest-growing disease classes in terms of patient numbers. The stock should earn $1.37 a share in 1997 and $1.83 in 1998. My six- to nine-month target for FMC is $40.<p>
Shelby M. C. Davis
New York Venture Fund
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.
<a name="NYSE:BAC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10178"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BANKAMERICA</b></a> (NYSE: BAC)   Up to $100 
BankAmerica (San Francisco) is one of the country's largest holding companies, with holdings that include Bank of America, the biggest bank in California, and banks in seven other states. BankAmerica has ridden out the tough times in California, and now, with the state's economy continuing to gain strength, it should prosper. Cash earnings, including goodwill, have progressed nicely and should be over $9 a share in 1997 and $10 a share in 1998. New chairman David Coulter is bent on raising return on equity as much as 20 percent by pursuing growth initiatives, cutting costs, and repurchasing shares. My two- to three-year target price for the stock is $140. <p>
Daniel B. Leonard
Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology
Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.
<a name="NYSE:TXN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11462"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TEXAS INSTRUMENTS</b></a> (NYSE: TXN)   Up to $70  
Texas Instruments (Dallas) is one of the world's largest manufacturers of semiconductors, electronics, and software. Because of the sharp decline in the price of dynamic random-access-memory (DRAM) chips, 1996 was a down year for the company. However, the company recently reached an agreement with Samsung Electronics whereby Texas Instruments will receive more than $1 billion in royalty payments over the next ten years. In addition, TI is expected to announce its intention to sell its defense division. These events should provide the company with enough cash flow to lower debt and buy back stock. My 12-month target is $90 a share. <p>
William J. Nasgovitz
Heartland Small-CapContrarian Fund 
Buys stocks of small domestic companies believed to be undervalued.
<a name="NASD:TPMI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16754"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT</b></a> (Nasdaq: TPMI)   Up to $9  
Personnel Management (Greenwood, Indiana) provides temporary services, a business in which revenue should grow at least 12 percent annually for the next five years. The company had a difficult 1995. While it was busy acquiring mom-and-pop temp operations, it lost sight of its financials. Costs ran out of control, and growth slowed in the company's core Indiana market, where it holds a dominant position. Today, however, Personnel Management has a new CFO and a new COO, and they're turning around the business. I expect the company to post earnings gains of 50 cents a share in 1996 and 75 cents a share in 1997. My 12- to 18-month target price is $13 to $15.<p>
Eric E. Ryback
Lindner Dividend Fund
<a name="NASD:TESC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46295"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TESCORP</b></a> (Nasdaq: TESC)  Up to $6  
Tescorp (Austin, Texas) owns and operates cable systems in rural Argentina, where 90 percent of the population owns a TV set and 55 percent receives cable. Tescorp's strategy, in a time of significant merger activity within the industry, is to buy subscribers at favorable prices and boost cash flow by consolidating overlapping systems and eliminating duplicate costs. The company plans to increase its subscriber base from 58,000 to 150,000 over the next few years. By then, Tescorp will be buying subscribers at a higher rate, so I wouldn't be surprised to see it acquired by a large telecommunications company. My 18-month target price is $11 a share.<p>
Ralph Wanger
Chuck McQuaid
Acorn Fund
Holds stocks of small companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.
<a name="NYSE:ADZ"></a><b>APPLIED INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES</b> (NYSE: ADZ)  Up to $30
Applied Industrial Technologies (Cleveland), formerly known as Bearings, changed its name in January (at press date the ticker symbol hadn't been set) to better reflect its product mix. The company distributes mechanical and electrical drive systems, specialty maintenance products, industrial rubber products, and bearings. It is centralizing its inventory into state-of-the-art warehouses to provide better service and has signed several new supply contracts. Both of these moves should boost revenues. The stock is cheap at less than 13 times estimated June 1997 earnings of $2.20 a share and should do well when sales accelerate. My two-year target price is $44.<p>
Donald A. Yacktman
Yacktman Fund
Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion.
<a name="NYSE:DFS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16233"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DEPARTMENT 56</b></a> (NYSE: DFS)  Up to $25
Department 56 (Eden Prairie, Minnesota) designs and distributes a variety of collectibles and giftware, such as porcelain houses and figurines. Since I recommended the stock in June 1996, earnings have rested slightly, in part because some of the company's manufacturers relocated. That's resulting in more-efficient production, which has helped Department 56 bring its successful Heritage Village and Original Snow Village series to the retail shelves much more quickly to meet the growing demand. Orders for the third quarter of 1996 increased 3 percent versus the same quarter in 1995. I expect Department 56 to earn $2.45 a share in 1996, with goodwill included.

						10 to Avoid:
Steven Romick, a portfolio manager for Los Angelesbased First Pacific Advisors, manages the UAM FPA Crescent Fund. The fund is the fourth-best performer over the past three years among the 190 balanced funds tracked by Morningstar. Romick plays a defensive game, looking for stocks with limited downside risk that are either undiscovered or misunderstood by Wall Street -- which explains why he has not had a down quarter during the past three years, a period when the major stock and bond indexes have suffered. His portfolio consists of high-yield bonds and stocks that sell for lower book values and lower multiples of earnings than the market. Romick finds the current market full of overvalued stocks, including U.S. Filter, which sells for 54 times its 12-month earnings despite producing a meager 10 percent return on investors equity. Many competitors of bar-code-scanner manufacturer Symbol Technologies have reported falling margins -- telling Romick that these products are becoming commodities. Software developer and distributor GT Interactive Software has warned investors to expect disappointing sales, and Wal-Mart, its biggest customer, is rumored to be considering dropping the company.<p>

10 To Consider: 
Christine Baxter co-manages the $1.4 billion PBHG Emerging Growth Fund, the top-performing small-company growth fund for the past three years, according to Morningstar. (She is also the lead manager of the new PBHG Limited Fund, which opened in July.) Baxter, who joined Wayne, Pennsylvaniabased Pilgrim, Baxter & Associates as a research analyst in 1991, is a disciple of famed momentum investor and Emerging Growth Fund co-manager Gary Pilgrim. Baxter looks for small companies that produce outstanding sales and earnings growth. Because these companies are increasing sales and earnings at 40 to 60 percent a year, their stocks often trade at 60 to 90 times earnings. Her current favorites include Sitel, which has boosted earnings more than 45 percent a year by providing companies with toll-free telephone-service facilities. Inso, a spin-off from Houghton Mifflin, sells software that allows users to view complex documents over the Internet; around one-third of its sales are to Microsoft. Baxter expects Target Therapeutics, a maker of micro-catheters for minimally invasive brain surgery, to increase earnings by 40 percent now that it has received FDA approval of its GDC micro-catheter product.

Update:
The February 1996 "10 Stocks to Consider" picks by John Wallace, manager of the Robertson Stephens Growth & Income Fund, gained 30.2 percent in the 52 weeks ended December 12, versus an 18 percent gain in the S&P 500. Wallaces biggest winner, Vans, jumped 75 percent, while Monsanto rose 62.5 percent. The "10 Stocks to Avoid" chosen by Potomac, Marylandbased hedge-fund manager Peter Frorer gained just 14.5 percent. General Acceptance dropped the most, falling 78 percent.<p>

						Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan's not-so-cryptic December warning about investors' "irrational exuberance" set the stage for a volatile final month of 1996 for stocks. Earnings surprises and the continued deluge of takeover activity added to the uncertainty. Some high-profile professional money managers profited from the volatility -- others wound up on the wrong end of trades.<p>
WINNER: George Long, Oppenheimer Capital
Oppenheimer chief investment officer Long has been buying up huge blocks of <a name="NYSE:MD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10975"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonnell Douglas</b></a> stock for his institutional clients since 1994. Liftoff occurred on December 16, when <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a> announced it would buy the rival aircraft maker for $13 billion. The one-day gain for Oppenheimer's 26-million-share position: a whopping $275 million.<p>
LOSER: Michael Price, Franklin Mutual Series Funds
Legendary value investor Price gave up on McDonnell Douglas a little too soon, selling 800,000 of his 1.7 million shares in the company just a few months before its takeover by Boeing was announced. His Mutual Series Funds missed out on a possible $8.4 million windfall when McDonnell's shares jumped $10.50 on news of the deal on December 16.<p>
WINNER: Jeffrey Vinik, Vinik Asset Management
Former Magellan Fund manager Vinik's new $800 million hedge fund got off to a quick start last fall, snapping up shares of small companies like electromagnetic-product maker <a name="NASD:INVX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13774"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Innovex</b></a>. Vinik bought 636,000 shares of Innovex in early November, at an average price of $27.25, then sold off more than a third of them as news of his stake drove the stock to nearly $50.<p>
LOSER: Robert Sanborn, Oakmark Fund 
The 3.8 million shares of <a name="NYSE:BDK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10214"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Black & Decker</b></a>Black & Decker owned by Sanborn's Oakmark Fund fell more than $7 a share the second week of December after the power-tool company pre-announced disappointing earnings. "The market overreacted," says analyst Kevin Grant, who downplays the fund's $28 million loss because "the company's fundamentals are still good."<p>
LOSER: James Stowers III, American Century Investments   
Stowers's Twentieth Century Ultra Fund's 2.5 million shares of Oakley plunged 24 percent on December 5, when the sunglass maker warned investors to expect a sharp decline in fourth-quarter earnings. Ultra, which usually invests in companies with upward price momentum, bought almost 1.3 million shares in the third quarter, according to CDA/Spectrum.<p>
LOSER: Paul Wick, <a name="FUND:SLMCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SLMCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Seligman Communications and Information Fund</b></a>
The stock of disk-drive-component maker <a name="NASD:KMAG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13912"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Komag</b></a>, one of longtime technology investor Wick's largest positions, got nailed the second week of December, when the company announced that manufacturing problems would lower earnings. The 1.9 million shares of Komag in Wick's fund dropped more than 11 points for the week -- a loss of nearly $22 million.<p>

The National Business Conduct Committee, a division of the National Association of Security Dealers regulatory arm, has permanently expelled the brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont from the securities industry. In addition, Stratton Oakmont's president, Daniel M. Porush, and head trader, Steven P. Sanders, were barred from the business as a result of the decision. Stratton had been operating under a Securities and Exchange Commission injunction and was the subject of disciplinary actions by the NASD, including charges of securities fraud, stock manipulation, and violations in connection with initial public offerings. Current Stratton Oakmont accounts will be handled by J. B. Oxford, a Los Angeles brokerage firm.<p>
The new inflation-indexed ten-year Treasury notes haven't generated much investor interest, according to a survey of 57 fixed-income investment firms by Capital Access, a data-research and information-services company in Murray Hill, New Jersey. Only 5 percent of the firms surveyed planned on investing in the notes. Those firms that did show interest said the notes would make up no more than 10 percent of their government portfolio. Uncertainty about the notes, especially in light of potential changes in the consumer price index -- the benchmark against which return on the bonds will be indexed quarterly -- was a reason for the caution.<p>
The board of directors at the New York Stock Exchange has agreed to raise the trigger mark for the "circuit breaker" on the Dow Jones Industrial Average. A drop of 350 points will now trigger a half-hour shutdown; a 550-point drop will result in an hour-long shutdown. Former circuit-breaker limits of 250 points for a half-hour shutdown and 400 points for an hour-long shutdown were set eight years ago, when the broad market was trading at a far lower level than it is today. At the current level , a 350-point drop would equal a decline of about 5 percent.<p>
A majority of high-net-worth individuals surveyed by Bankers Trust said that their financial and legal advisers don't encourage them to be philanthropic. The survey also found that the most often cited factors discouraging philanthropy were a lack of time and a lack of confidence that the money would be put to good use.<p>
The SEC expanded its suit against Charles Huttoe, former chairman and CEO of teleconference-equipment maker Systems of Excellence, who has been accused of writing false press releases about the company through an Internet newsletter -- SGA Goldstar Whisper Stocks -- and then selling the stock as the price grew. In a revised complaint, the SEC said that certain employees of SGA Goldstar Research, the firm that puts together and distributes the newsletter, were bribed with stock to recommend Systems of Excellence. The proposed amended complaint calls for the disgorgement of $12 million, the amount of illegal profits the SEC alleges was obtained through the sale of the security by Huttoe and the other defendants. This is the first case in which the SEC has examined specific use of the Internet in manipulation of a public security. Says SEC assistant director of enforcement Erich T. Schwartz: "It won't be the last." <p>
A new variety of bond fund, offered by fund families like Fidelity and Benham, may make investments in bonds look attractive again. These "target time-line" bond funds have a designated maturity date and offer an assumed yield, which, in Fidelity's case, may vary by plus or minus 50 basis points per year. Investors must keep their money in the fund until the maturity date in order to earn this yield. These bonds, however, are not guaranteed, and anything from a market shake-up to volatile interest rates could stir the fund further away from its quoted yield.<p>

						Interest rates, trade deficits, and our place in the global Ponzi scheme<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
December produced a parade of prophets predicting the end of this rally: first, Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan, then Goldman Sachs guru Robert Hormats, and finally Morgan Stanley heavyweight Barton Biggs. They took their best shots, and the market dissed them all.<p>
But as any reader of the Old Testament knows, the prophet who gets pelted with stones is the most worth studying. The comments of our latter-day prophets, even when wrong, clearly outline the shape of the market for the next three to six months.<p>
Greenspan was first out of the blocks. On December 5, he speculated that the stock market might be displaying signs of "irrational exuberance." A wave of selling initially rolled around the globe with the sun. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped nearly 145 points before a mid-morning rally cut the loss to 55 points. After thinking about it overnight, the market decided the Fed chairman's implicit threat to raise interest rates to rein in speculation was just hot air. The Dow climbed 82 points the next day.<p>
Greenspan was trying to jawbone himself some room to maneuver. The Fed can't raise interest rates to cut this market down a peg without taking the chance that higher rates will send this slow economy into a recession. Even worse, if the market stays at this level and the economy slows enough so that the Fed should lower rates to spur growth, the Fed will have to risk either doing nothing (recession) or cutting rates (hello, bubble market). For now, the Fed is a paper tiger.<p>
Let's consider Barton Biggs next. On December 16, Biggs, a managing director at Morgan Stanley, advised his clients -- and clients take seriously the advice of a man who manages $51 billion at one of the world's most powerful investment firms -- to cut their positions in stocks by almost 25 percent. The Dow, which had started the day strong, finished down 37 points. But Biggs's pessimism didn't stick. The Dow rose in the next three sessions by a total of 205 points.<p>
The reaction to Biggs's remark shows just how tightly investors in this market are wound. Everyone secretly fears that the market is overvalued and has one eye on the exit. But the indexes will once again outperform most money managers. No manager can afford to be in cash, no matter how pricey stocks are. Managing risk becomes little more than a matter of racing for the door when someone like Biggs hiccups.<p>
The last of our prophets, Robert Hormats, a vice-chairman at Goldman Sachs, let lose another market flurry when he was quoted in the December 11 Wall Street Journal speculating that the Japanese were losing their appetite for U.S. Treasurys. Mind you, there's no solid evidence that the Japanese, the mainstay of the U.S. bond market, are slowing the pace of their buying. At the moment, that's not something they can even consider.<p>
Why? First, the Bank of Japan is in the midst of re-capitalizing the loss-plagued Japanese banking system. The discount rate in Japan is now a meager 0.5 percent. Japanese banks can borrow at that rate in Japan, buy U.S. Treasurys that are paying 6 percent, and reap a low-risk 5.5 percent. This interest-rate differential pulled $8.8 billion from individual Japanese investors into U.S. Treasurys in October. That helps keep U.S. interest rates low and boost the stock market.<p>
Second, the enormous American trade deficit is one of the few friends the Japanese economy has. Same goes for the German economy. The money flows abroad as we buy German machinery and Japanese cars (and Italian shoes and Swiss watches...). That big a deficit would normally put pressure on the dollar -- foreigners are holding a lot more of them each month -- and the Fed would probably raise interest rates both to support the dollar (higher rates would entice foreign investors to hold on to dollar-denominated notes) and to cut domestic consumption by slowing the economy.<p>
But these aren't normal times. Economies around the world are in the doldrums. The Japanese and German governments need those sales to the U.S. To keep the U.S. humming, foreign central banks have been buying up dollars in their markets and then buying U.S. Treasurys. That keeps U.S. interest rates low and encourages U.S. consumers to buy more goods of all sorts -- including those made abroad.<p>
It isn't much more than a global Ponzi scheme, a crazy edifice constructed of mispriced currencies and low U.S. interest rates. It isn't sustainable indefinitely. We are consuming beyond our means, and foreign savings are subsidizing that consumption.<p>
So Hormats is wrong in the short run. Foreign money isn't going to flee the U.S. bond market any time in the next six months. Investors should not waste time worrying about that.<p>
What they should worry about is the inevitable revival of the German and Japanese economies. That's when investors in those countries will have good reasons to keep their money at home. When they do, the foreign money that propped up U.S. stock and bond prices will dry up. U.S. financial assets will go from overvalued in comparison to financial assets elsewhere in the world to fairly priced or perhaps eventually undervalued.<p>
That's the longer-range truth that all three of our prophets are preaching. Sometime in the future, investors in this country will have to learn to live with higher U.S. interest rates, a much weaker dollar, and slower growth. In the long run, U.S. financial assets are too expensive. In the long run, everything must balance. In the long run.<p>

						This summer's U.S. equity roller coaster put market gurus to the test, as this new feature shows. After reaching all-time highs in late May and early June, stocks began a slow descent that soon turned into a free fall. During just the first two weeks of July, the Dow Jones dropped more than 6 percent, and the Nasdaq composite index plummeted more than 11 percent. By August, however, both indexes had reversed course, eventually reaching new highs in October. That volatility created both big profits and big losses.<p>
WINNER: Foster Friess: <a name="FUND:BRWIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BRWIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Brandywine Fund</b></a>
Friess responded to a 12 percent loss in June and July by buying technology, energy, and consumer cyclical stocks that fit his "high growth at low cost" criterion, says portfolio manager William D'Alonzo. Brandywine bounced back in August and September, gaining 15 percent.<p>
WINNER: Gary Pilgrim: <a name="FUND:PBHGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PBHGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PBHG Growth Fund</b></a>
Pilgrim, usually fully invested, went into June with 15 percent in cash. By mid-July, he began to use that reserve to buy companies whose earnings were still on target, "especially those in technology," says colleague John Force. PBHG Growth gained almost 14 percent in August and September.<p>
WINNER: Garrett Van Wagoner: <a name="FUND:VWEGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWEGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Van Wagoner Emerging Growth Fund</b></a>
By the end of May, Van Wagoner had built up a cash hoard equal to 20 percent of his portfolio. "I hadn't been able to find anything to buy," he says. In July, he used that cash to snap up his favorite technology stocks, helping his fund to rebound nearly 15 percent in August and September.<p>
LOSER: Garrett Van Wagoner: Van Wagoner Emerging Growth Fund
Van Wagoner was too quick to pull the trigger. He bought aggressively in early July as the market was still on the way down, and his fund took a beating, falling 17.5 percent for the month. "I just wish I had waited," he says. Still, on the year, his fund was up 37 percent through October 23.<p>
WINNER: Edward Yardeni: Deutsche Morgan Grenfell  
By Friday, July 19, chief economist Yardeni knew the market slump was over. "I saw it as one of these 10 percent quick and dirty corrections," he says. That day, Yardeni told clients to use the drop as a buying opportunity; he is now calling for the Dow to hit 10,000 by the year 2000.<p>
LOSER: Elaine Garzarelli: Garzarelli Capital   
Garzarelli's July 23 warning that stocks would fall 25 percent rattled markets for a day -- and then the Dow resumed its climb. The exLehman Brothers strategist stands by her call. "Sometimes [my model] is four to six months early," she says. She blames election-year euphoria for the delay.<p>

The Prudent Speculator
Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.
<a name="NYSE:NAV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11063"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Navistar International </b></a> (NYSE: NAV)  Up to $10.12
Navistar International (Chicago) manufactures trucks and truck engines and operates the largest truck-parts distribution network in the U.S. Navistar's 1996 earnings will pale in comparison with its 1995 earnings of $1.83 a share, but the company has remained solidly profitable during the trucking industry's current cyclical downturn. We think the slump has run its course and that cost-cutting measures will soon help the bottom line. The stock is currently trading at a 25-year low of $9.25 a share -- below book value. We believe Navistar is currently undervalued at seven times earnings and four times cash flow. Our three- to five-year target price is $20. <p>

<a name="NASD:CTII"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15573"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CytoTherapeutics</b></a>  (NASD: CTII)  Up to $15
CytoTherapeutics (Providence) develops implantable (and easily removed) systems that deliver therapeutic protein for the treatment of central-nervous-system disorders. The company has developed technology to implant encapsulated cells that have been genetically engineered to deliver necessary proteins across the blood-brain barrier for diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's. Clinical trials with the company's partner, Astra, have proved that the technology works. The stock is trading at around $9 a share; it should continue to respond positively to results in further trials and to additional corporate partnerships over the next year. <p>

California Technology Stock Letter
Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.
<a name="NASD:ROSS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11793"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ross Systems</b></a>  (NASD: ROSS)  Up to $9
Ross Systems (Atlanta) distributes and manufactures client/server software and applications, focusing on the process-manufacturing, nonprofit, and health-care sectors. Ross took some losses during its shift from a proprietary operating system to open UNIX systems, but the company has been profitable every quarter in 1996. We expect it to earn 47 cents a share in the fiscal year ending next June. Ross is adding to its product line, and its systems will soon be able to operate on Windows NT. While most client/server software companies sell for two to five times sales per share, Ross's stock price is right at sales per share. My 12-month target price is $18. <p>

MPT Review
Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks.
<a name="NYSE:COA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10356"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coachmen Industries</b></a>  (NYSE: COA)  Up to $35
Coachmen Industries (Elkhart, Indiana) manufactures and distributes recreational vehicles under a variety of brand names, including Travelmaster, Viking, and Saratoga. The company also builds modular homes, which accounted for 16 percent of sales in 1995. Revenue was up 18 percent for the third quarter of 1996 compared with the third quarter of 1995. Coachmen is a growth stock with a low price-to-earnings ratio; it's currently trading at just 13 times forecasted earnings. With manufacturing plants operating in seven states and the demand for recreational vehicles and modular housing continuing to grow, Coachmen looks very attractive.<p>

						By Jim Jubak<p>
Want to know if the economy's headed for a slowdown that could send the market tumbling? Look around your local <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a> this Christmas. Crowded stores? The feared slowdown isn't imminent. Big markdowns and desultory buying? Trouble sooner rather than later.<p>
The holiday-shopping season -- the period from November 15 to December 25 -- is always critical for U.S. retailers. Those few weeks account for about 25 percent of their annual sales. But in 1996, this end-of-the-year shopping frenzy is even more important than usual: Weak holiday sales will show that the consumer is too tapped out to keep the economy humming.<p>
The consumer certainly looks over-extended. Total payments on mortgages, credit cards, and auto leases climbed to 14.6 percent of disposable personal income in the third quarter of 1996, according to Economic Analysis Associates in Greenwich, Connecticut. A larger percentage of income is now going toward those monthly debt payments than at any time during the long market rally that began in Ronald Reagan's first term. Not surprisingly, retail sales in the third quarter of 1996 were basically flat compared with sales in the previous quarter.<p>
What would a bad Christmas mean for investors? In the short term, lousy fourth-quarter sales would kill corporate earnings in the first quarter of 1997. Retailers and their suppliers build up inventory to meet anticipated holiday demand. If that demand doesn't materialize, they are forced to cut prices to move aging stock, which hurts profits, and they don't make new buys until that old merchandise is off their shelves, which hurts sales. A slow Christmas would also generate downward pressure on prices. No one will ask consumers to pay more when unsold goods clog the sales channel.<p>
Not all companies are equally vulnerable to a Christmas slowdown. In the retail sector -- which is still contracting after a wave of overbuilding left the U.S. with too many stores -- watch out for companies that have been losing market share to competitors in relatively good times. In the home-improvement category, for example, <a name="NASD:HECHA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13666"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hechinger</b></a> seems especially vulnerable; it has been steadily losing business to <a name="NYSE:LOW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10920"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lowe's Companies</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>.<p>
Technology companies are also facing big Christmas worries. Last year, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>'s Windows 95 generated new sales across the computer industry as consumers bought faster and more powerful machines to take advantage of the heavily promoted new software. This year, in contrast, there's hardly a ripple of excitement to send even committed technophiles to the stores. Earlier this year, even well-run companies, such as <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq Computer</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>, had trouble managing their inventories to avoid stocking too much of the wrong product. With profit margins lower now, similar mistakes this Christmas could be painfully expensive for companies and investors.<p>
In the longer run, poor end-of-the-year sales could speed up an ongoing shift in market psychology. For most of the year, investors have essentially ignored slowing economic growth or seen it as a positive force -- since slow growth would prevent the Federal Reserve from raising interest rates. But in the third quarter of 1996, investors started to worry about how companies could keep delivering accelerating earnings growth while the economy slowed. In the reporting season that followed the September 30 close of the quarter, the market punished the stocks of companies that delivered predicted earnings but failed to increase sales.<p>
Take <a name="NASD:COKE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13014"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, for example. On October 15, the company reported earnings of 39 cents a share, up 22 percent from earnings in the third quarter of 1995. But still the stock dipped. Analysts pointed to troubling "top line" numbers in Coke's results. Worldwide sales volume grew just 6 percent, and operating revenue fell by 5 percent. If not for a $396 million drop in income-tax payments, earnings would have actually declined in 1996.<p>
Coke is not alone in facing the results of slowing sales. For example, shares of <a name="NYSE:EDS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41915"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electronic Data Systems</b></a> dropped more than $15, about 25 percent, when management noted that the number of new business contracts written in the fourth quarter looked "somewhat lower." The extreme reaction to the EDS announcement says something important about this market. Investors are worried that the long period in which cost cutting and downsizing produced increased profit margins may be over.<p>
They have good reason to worry. Currently, the return on equity (a measure of profitability that looks at how much a company earns on each dollar invested in it) of the companies in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index is well above 20 percent. The average since 1947 falls between 10 and 15 percent. If profit margins fail to grow and sales stagnate, companies won't be able to deliver the earnings growth investors now demand. Even worse, return on equity could actually fall while sales are sinking. Earnings would dive.<p>
Impossible? It's already happening to some companies that operate in slow-growing and exceedingly competitive parts of the economy. On October 25, <a name="NYSE:K"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10841"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kellogg</b></a> reported that sales fell 8.8 percent as both sales volume and prices in the U.S. declined. The company's earnings dropped 31 percent for the quarter compared with the third quarter of 1995.<p>
After years of focusing on the bottom line -- earnings -- investors must now pay attention to the top of the income statement, too. In 1997, think sales.<p>

						By John Fried<p>
The Treasury Department's new "inflation indexed" bonds will be available in January. The notes, valued at a minimum of $1,000, will be targeted primarily at conservative investors -- they'll carry a lower interest rate than traditional ten-year Treasurys, but the principal value of the notes will be adjusted to the consumer price index. One advantage of the new instruments: They should offer better returns than cash instruments (such as money-market funds) without leaving bondholders vulnerable to inflation. The basic disadvantage: Any increase in principal will be taxed the year it is credited, even though the investor might not get the cash for years. Critics point to certain scenarios -- involving a low coupon rate combined with high inflation -- in which investors in the highest tax brackets could actually pay more in taxes on the principal than they earn in interest. <p>
News from the supermarket: Two more brokerages -- Quick & Reilly and Prudential Investments -- have unveiled plans to launch mutual-fund supermarkets, programs that offer customers an array of no-load mutual funds from different money managers. Merrill Lynch has initiated a rewards program to encourage investors to keep all their money with Merrill. For example, an investor who keeps $100,000 in eligible investments pays an annual fee of 1.5 percent of assets to cover all commissions on a dozen securities transactions, a 0.25 percent break on margin interest, and financial-planning advice.

The Securities and Exchange Commission has moved to curb abuses of Regulation S offerings of stocks and bonds. Under Regulation S, American companies sell securities to foreign buyers for less than they are worth on the American market.

The new SEC rules require issuers to make more frequent and more timely disclosures of Regulation S sales.<p>
President Clinton has signed the National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, which, in his words, will eliminate "regulatory overlap between the states and the federal government." While the act will primarily affect financial institutions, individual investors will see a difference as well. The act, Clinton said at a signing ceremony, "strengthens the SEC's hand in addressing fund names that use words such as government,' guaranteed,' or insured,' which can cause investors to conclude, incorrectly, that their investments are guaranteed by state or federal authorities."<p>
Corporations are providing employ ees more investment options in their 401(k) plans, according to a survey by the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America. The survey found that 74 percent of the 668 companies queried offered at least five investment options in 1995, up from only 16 percent in 1990.<p>

The Treasury Department's new "inflation indexed" bonds will be available in January. The notes, valued at a minimum of $1,000, will be targeted primarily at conservative investors -- they'll carry a lower interest rate than traditional ten-year Treasurys, but the principal value of the notes will be adjusted to the consumer price index. One advantage of the new instruments: They should offer better returns than cash instruments (such as money-market funds) without leaving bondholders vulnerable to inflation. The basic disadvantage: Any increase in principal will be taxed the year it is credited, even though the investor might not get the cash for years. Critics point to certain scenarios -- involving a low coupon rate combined with high inflation -- in which investors in the highest tax brackets could actually pay more in taxes on the principal than they earn in interest. <p>
News from the supermarket: Two more brokerages -- Quick & Reilly and Prudential Investments -- have unveiled plans to launch mutual-fund supermarkets, programs that offer customers an array of no-load mutual funds from different money managers. Merrill Lynch has initiated a rewards program to encourage investors to keep all their money with Merrill. For example, an investor who keeps $100,000 in eligible investments pays an annual fee of 1.5 percent of assets to cover all commissions on a dozen securities transactions, a 0.25 percent break on margin interest, and financial-planning advice. At higher asset levels, the benefits increase and the fee decreases. Finally, The Wall Street Journal reports that Charles Schwab plans to expand its mutual-fund business into banks and smaller brokerage firms. <p>

						What's Up Down Under?<p>
By Todd G. Buccholz<p>
To place a bet on world economic growth, look down under. So many Australian stocks are wrapped up in commodities -- the building blocks of industrialized countries -- that as world prices of copper, minerals, wool, and natural gas go, so goes Australia's All Ordinaries Index. For example, demand for copper, which accounts for more than 5 percent of Australia's exports, tracks the global economy so well that it's called "the commodity with a Ph.D. in economics." In its heavy dependence on commodities, Australia is economically more like faraway Canada than like its Asian neighbors. Even the Australian and Canadian dollars tend to move in sync.<p>
The Australian economy has looked impressive in the past few years, with the gross domestic product averaging about 4 percent growth. True, the unemployment rate is problematic at 8.5 percent, but it's down from 9.7 percent in 1994. On the budget front, Liberal Party prime minister John Howard is prescribing the kind of tough medicine that has cheered the bond market and brought Australian interest rates much closer to U.S. rates. The spread between ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds and ten-year Australian government bonds has shrunk from about 250 basis points in January 1996 to 90 this past October. This means cheaper financing and more investment opportunities for Australian firms. And Howard's budget calls for reducing Australia's deficit-to-GDP ratio from 3.6 percent in 1994 to a small surplus in 1998.<p>
Before trading your suburban ranch for one in the outback and swapping Fido for a dingo, however, consider the potential pitfalls. Most importantly, Australia seems to be moving from strong and steady growth to the more sluggish pace that in recent years has spread over the world like a communicable disease. We used to call it "Eurosclerosis" until the Japanese caught it. Now even Asian Tigers like Thailand are suffering from slower growth and disappointing corporate performances. (The Thai stock market has plunged nearly 28 percent this year.) Australia has a limited number of weapons to battle such a slowdown. Since the government has already launched an ambitious and laudably tight fiscal policy, Australia won't be "priming the pump," or stimulating consumption through government spending. In fact, the government will be acting like a drag on the economy.<p>
So the Aussies may come to depend on either a sudden spurt in world economic growth, with the consequent rise in commodity prices, or lower interest rates. The Reserve Bank of Australia cut short-term interest rates by 50 basis points last July and will likely cut them again if the economy continues to soften. The RBA has an advantage over the Eurosclerotic central banks that have confronted slowdowns: It's free to slash rates without fear of a currency plunge. This is because the government is on the road to a balanced budget, making Australia less dependent on foreign investors, and because there is no effort to peg the nation's currency directly to that of another country -- as France, for example, is trying to nail the franc to the deutsche mark. Thus, if the RBA cuts rates and the Aussie dollar slides a bit, the RBA needn't sweat. Indeed, as you might expect in a land where trade with other countries usually makes the difference between prosperity and hard times, the RBA may even cheer if the cheaper currency gives Australian exports a kangaroo bounce.<p>

						10 STOCKS TO AVOID
Wayne Archambo manages $260 million worth of stock in small- and mid-sized companies for Boston Partners Asset Management, a firm that oversees a total of $6 billion for institutional investors. Archambo, a value investor, looks for companies that have solid balance sheets, are reasonably priced, and possess an "identifiable catalyst" that will cause earnings to rise in six to nine months. Archambo's portfolios have outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index by more than five percentage points since their inception in mid-1995. In Archambo's view, the market is full of stocks supported by unrealistic earnings expectations. As a result, companies that report even slightly disappointing earnings get pummeled. Especially overvalued, in his view, are the shares of Chesapeake Energy, which sells at 14 times annual cash flow while its gas-exploration peers sell at only 9 times cash flow. Competitors can easily start new driving ranges, he says, yet Family Golf Centers sells for 30 times earnings. Net profit margins at software maker PeopleSoft, which sports a price-to-earnings ratio of 68, have slipped from 13 percent at year-end 1995 to 12 percent in the first half of 1996. <p>

10 TO CONSIDER
David King is a value investor at heart. He and Anthony Kreisel, who co-manage Putnam Investments' $20 billion Fund for Growth & Income, scour their universe of 500 or so large U.S. companies with above-average yields or low price-to-book and price-to-sales ratios in search of undiscovered values. Since they took over the fund in 1993, its 16.1 percent annualized return has trounced the average growth-and-income fund by more than two percentage points. How do they know when they've spotted a winner? Says King, "We're looking for cheapness and change -- inexpensive out-of-favor companies that have had some change in leadership, incentives, or structure that alters their business." Kmart has been one of their favorites since new CEO Floyd Hall shored up the company's balance sheet and improved its merchandising. King says new management at USF&G and Pharmacia & Upjohn should help those companies turn around as well. Change, however, doesn't need to be so dramatic. King expects Hewlett-Packard to see accelerating growth as more of its revenue comes from disposable goods, such as printer cartridges. And wholesale bank J. P. Morgan is well on its way to becoming a premier financial franchise.<p>
