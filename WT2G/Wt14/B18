Opportunity to do clinical practice in sites outside the Clemson area and/or South 
Carolina is subject to availability of appropriate faculty.
<P>
<B>The Program</b>
<P>
The Master of Science program with a major in nursing is designed to build upon the first 
professional degree. The student acquires knowledge and skills in advanced nursing 
practice and may select a nursing specialty and a role area or the practitioner emphasis. 
Areas of practice specialization are adult health, child health, gerontology and maternal-
infant health. Role areas include education, management and clinical specialization. The 
practitioner emphasis is the family nurse practitioner. Upon graduation, students will be 
prepared for advanced practice in a designated area of nursing. Health assessment is a 
prerequisite to enrollment in the graduate program. 
<P>
A thesis or nonthesis option is available. Normally, 37 semester credit hours are required 
for awarding the Master of Science degree; 43 semester credit hours are required for the 
family nurse practitioner emphasis with the nonthesis option, and 46 hours with the thesis 
option.

Frankie Felder</H1><P>
<H2>Associate Dean of the Graduate School</H2>
<H3>
Dr. Felder has served as Associate Dean of the Graduate School since July 1994.  In this
capacity she provides administrative oversight of the Graduate Curriculum Committee,
graduate teaching assistant training and development program, academic grievances, and
enrolled student services.  In an enhanced role for the Graduate School, she is responsible for
developing opportunities to increase minority graduate student enrollment and for creating
programs to augment the visibility of the Graduate School.  In 1987 she initiated the
University's participation in the Patricia Roberts Harris Fellowship Program (of which she is
director), and in 1994, established the University's membership in the National Physical
Sciences Consortium (of which she is Clemson's representative).  She has established a
Graduate School liaison to undergraduate minority students at Clemson, and to historically
black colleges and universities across the country.  She has also established Graduate and
Professional Student Appreciation Week as a new Graduate School tradition which links the
teaching, research and public service activities of graduate students to the communities in the
University's immediate local vicinity and propagates success of graduate students through the
publication of <I><B>Profiles of Excellence:  Graduate Students at Clemson
University</I></B>.
<P>
Prior to her service in the Graduate School, Dr. Felder served for five years as Associate
Dean for International Programs and Services for Clemson University.  She served on and
participated in international, national and regional boards, organizations and committees
concerned with issues related to international education, and minorities and women in
underrepresented disciplines in higher education.  She is a tenured assistant professor in the
College of Health, Education and Human Development.

Application</title></head>
<body>
<center><h2>Financial Assistance Application Instructions</h2>
<B>Clemson University Graduate School</B></center>
<P>
There are four types of financial assistance for graduate
students:
assistantships, fellowships, traineeships, and loans. Assistantships are
taxable as income for services rendered but carry a reduction in
academic fees. Fellowships and traineeships require no service to
the University; however, they do not carry a reduction in
academic
fees. The amount of the fellowship in excess of academic costs is
considered taxable income. These types of assistance may be held
concurrently.
<P>
Offers of financial assistance by Clemson University after April
15 of a given year are contingent on the applicant's supplying
written  notice that he or she has secured written release from
any commitments to accept offers made by other graduate schools
prior to that date.
Likewise, a commitment to Clemson University left in force after
April 15 is to be honored unless written release is secured from
the department making the offer.
<P>
Loan applications are available from the 
<a href="http://www.clemson.edu/curedesign/studentinfo/financial.aid.html">
Office of Student
Financial Aid</a>.
<P>
Although full biographical information is requested in the
application for admission to the Graduate School, the modest
repeat requested here is necessary because this information may
be
received by the department prior to the review of that
application.

<H3>Financial Assistance</B></H3></a><P>
<P>
     About 90 percent of full-time graduate students at Clemson
University
     receive some form of financial assistance, primarily through
graduate
<a href="fin.htm">
     assistantships, fellowships or traineeships</a>. Assistance
also
is available
     through hourly employment and loans. Graduate students who
are not graduate
     assistants pay academic fees as South Carolina residents or
out-of-state
     residents. <P>
<P>
     Graduate assistantships are available on an annual or a
nine-month basis
     in academic departments involving primarily instruction,
research or
     extension, and in nonacademic departments involving
primarily administration.
     Decisions regarding the awarding of these assistantships,
and the duties and
     work periods assigned, are made by the departments. 
Applicants should make
     their first contact with the department. Assistantships
carry stipends ranging
     from $2,000 to $16,000 per year. Graduate assistants are
granted partial 
     remission of academic and other fees and enjoy some benefits
provided for
     University faculty and staff.<P>
<P>
     Graduate resident assistantships are available to qualified
graduate students.
     This part-time employment on the program staff of the
residence halls requires
     20 hours of service per week. Compensation includes a free
room or apartment,
     partial remission of academic and other fees, and
approximately $1,000 per 
     semester. <P>
<P>
     Fellowships and traineeships are granted to outstanding
graduate students.
     Funds for these awards come from a variety of alumni,
foundation, governmental,
     individual or industrial sources and do not require service
to the University.
     Stipends range from $2,500 to $18,000 per year. Most of the
fellowships and
     traineeships are administered by the individual colleges and
departments;
     others are University-wide awards administered by the
Graduate School.
     Fellowship recipients are eligible for appointment as
departmental graduate
     assistants.<P>
<P>
     Employment on an hourly basis for a portion of a semester or
session is
     possible in some departments. Graduate students may not be
employed by the
     University for more than 30 hours per week. <P>
<P>
     The Office of Student Financial Aid coordinates and
administers loan 
     assistance available to graduate students. The primary loan
program is
     the Federal Stafford Loan. Other miscellaneous loan programs
are available
     to accommodate the particular needs of students.<P>
<P>
     Further information and assistance are available from the
individual
     departments or from the Office of Student Financial Aid, G01

<P>
<B><A NAME=Academic Costs></A><H3>Academic Costs</B></H3><P>

     Graduate assistants pay flat rates of $460 per semester and
$154 for each
     summer session. These charges may be deferred in the regular
semesters
     through payroll deductions.  Other graduate students pay
rates as follows:<P>

<b><i>Ultra-High B/T Facility - Microkelvin Laboratory</b></i><p>

	A special annex facility for studies of materials at ultra-high values of the ratio of magnetic field to temperature (B/T) is being developed as a collaborative effort between the NHMFL and the Microkelvin Laboratory (MKL) at the University of Florida. This facility will provide users with the ability to carry out experiments that simultaneously require fields up to 20 T and temperatures down to 500 K. The B/T ratio of 4x104 T /K will be the highest available anywhere, and will allow users to study new phenomena that require the establishment of high spin polarizations or high magnetizations.<p>

	The facility design consists of a complex two-magnet system: an 8 T nuclear demagnetization refrigerator with 5 moles of PrNi5 providing cooling to at least 500 K, and a 19/20 T persistent superconducting magnet for the experimental region. The diameter of the experimental volume is 2.5 cm with a central field homogeneity of 100 ppm over a 1cm DSV. The two magnets are separated by a compensating coil to minimize field variations at the sample during demagnetization.<p.

<i><b>Figure-1</b> Research is underway in one of the three experimental bays of the Microkelvin Laboratory at the University of Florida.</i><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><BR><BR>





The system is designed to provide a cooling capacity of a few nanowatts at 500K. The refrigerator and immediate experimental apparatus are located in an ultra-quiet environment with carefully designed vibration isolation and tempest quality shielding from electromagnetic interference and noise. The high field magnet is expected to be completed by summer 1995 and the facility would be open to external users in the fall of 1995 through a peer review proposal process. A full-time research scientist, J. S. Xia, has been part of the design team and will be available to coordinate and assist with the assembly and design of the experiments.<p>

	The Ultra-High B/T Facility is located in one of the three experimental bays of the Microkelvin Laboratory, an independent facility established in 1986 to conduct research at ultra-low temperatures. Two of the bays of MKL are equipped with copper nuclear demagnetization stages and are used for experiments down to 45 K. Experiments currently in progress include studies of nuclear magnetic ordering, quantum solids, heavy fermions, and Fermi liquids. Although not an official part of the NHMFL program, the MKL provides the opportunity for research at ultra-low temperatures for users on a collaborative basis.<p>

<b><i>Structural Biology and the Brain Institute</b></i><p>

	The development of new high field interests in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) with the NHMFL has contributed to the development of a new program, the Center for Structural Biology in the College of Medicine at the University of Florida. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and high field MRI are powerful techniques for the determination of form and function of biological structures from the molecular to the cellular scales of organization. The new center will have as its tour-de-force the installation of a 12 T, 40 cm bore magnet to study whole animals as models of disease using NMR imaging and spectroscopy.  As an example, the study of spinal cord repair using NMR has been very successful at low fields and the higher fields will provide dramatic enhancements of the spatial resolution. The 12 T magnet will be housed in the Brain Institute at the University of Florida.<p>

	In addition to the 12 T magnet, the College of Medicine currently operates a 4.7 T, 33 cm magnet for small animal research as part of an NIH-funded center for NMR imaging. A 4 T whole-body magnet for human studies will be commissioned for the Brain Institute by the end of 1996. These resources and the planned development of the facilities for the Center of Structural Biology support and enhance the science programs of all faculty involved in magnetic resonance in association with the NHMFL programs at the University of Florida.<p>

<b><i>Materials Science Program</b></i><p>

	Renovation of new NHMFL laboratory space was completed in August. Since then, progress has focused in the area of instrumentation and laboratory development. We are currently putting the finishing touches on a custom-designed, multi-gun, multi-substrate UHV sputtering system for the fabrication of ultrathin metallic films and multilayers. Highlights include a wide-range UHV 800 l/sec turbomolecular-drag pump with a drag pump / diaphragm pump backing system (entirely oil-free), 220 l/sec ion pump with titanium sublimation pump, multi-gas flow control with downstream pressure control valve, two UHV axial sputtering guns with pneumatic shutters, 2 UHV sputtering guns with in-situ tilt capability and integrated pneumatic shutters (for the deposition of alloy films from separate targets), rotating substrate holder with quartz crystal thickness monitors, RF and DC power supplies, and residual gas analysis. Additional capabilities in the near future will include substrate heating/cooling, computer automation of gas control, substrate positioning, and deposition parameters, as well as load-lock capability for increased throughput. First deposition runs are expected in January or February, 1995.<p>

	This system will be used to fabricate single layer and multilayers-films with individual thicknesses down to a few . Insulators, semiconductors and metals, and well as alloys and composite materials, can be deposited. With base pressures in the 10-9 torr range and 10-6 ppm Argon gas impurity levels, ultrathin films of outstanding purity can be obtained. The first scientific projects to be carried out will include the study of spin-dependent conduction in alloy-based multilayers, and the fabrication of magnetoresistive hybrid amorphous/crystalline multilayers. Measurements at NHMFL will include high-field magnetometry/magnetoresistance, as well as investigating the magnetic coupling and relaxation of interfacial magnetic spins.<p>


	We are acquiring several supporting instrument systems, including a tabletop atomic force microscope system, which will be used for accurate thickness calibration of ultrathin films, and to investigate the grain structure in sputtered films on a routine basis. We will develop a low-field magnetotransport measurement system to measure the magnetoresistive properties of our multilayer films. Finally, a multi-investigator proposal has been submitted to NSF for the acquisition of a commercial SQUID magnetometer / AC susceptometer instrument. Together with the outstanding materials characterization facilities in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering, we are looking forward to have at our disposal all the necessary elements to produce and characterize nanoscale magnetic films and structures.<p>

	The NHMFL component at Los Alamos National Laboratory provides magnetic field facilities for university, government, and industrial researchers. The NHMFL development of high magnetic field experiments and technology is complemented through collaboration and interaction with the extensive Los Alamos scientific and technical infrastructure. The emphasis of NHMFL at Los Alamos is on pulsed fields because of the unique facilities for the production of pulsed electrical power and dedicated sites for flux -compression experiments. The NHMFL experimental hall is located adjacent to a 1.4 GW synchronous motor-generator that will be the power source for the largest pulsed magnets in the world.<p>

	The pre-existing capability for 100 - 200 T flux compression was made available to general users for the first time through NHMFL beginning in 1991. In December 1992, capacitor-driven magnets of 50 T and 60 T became available to users at the completion of the 1.1 MJ capacitor bank. NHMFL staff wound  the first of these magnets at the laboratory of Prof. F. Herlach (Katholieke Universiteit Leuven, Belgium) according to a well-tested design. The development program at NHMFL (Tallahassee) to advance the technology of pulsed magnets includes the Leuven-style design among others.
	In August 1993, one of three NHMFL 20 T, 52 mm bore, superconducting magnets was installed at Los Alamos to support both pulsed field experiments and dedicated continuous field experiments. In the latter role the 20 T magnet is a regional user facility providing state-of-the-art superconducting fields. The Los Alamos magnet has an on-axis compensation coil 32 cm from the field maximum that reduces the field to near zero, which permits the convenient use of accurate thermometers at millikelvin temperatures.<p>

<i><b>Figure-1</b> With a halo formed by a scale drawing of the ninth coil of the 60 T quasi-continuous magnet, D. Rickel demonstrates the nesting of the first two coils. A 400 MW supply will power the finished magnet.
</i><br><br><br><br><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><BR><br>




The principal magnet at NHMFL, Los Alamos, is nearing completion. This is a 60 T, 34 mm bore, quasi-continuous, controlled pulse magnet that will be the first of its kind in the United States and the most powerful of its kind in the world. It is made possible by the Los Alamos 1200 ton, 1.4 gigawatt synchronous motor-generator mentioned above. Because the generator produces ac power, which can be easily controlled, the magnet will be capable of producing a wide range of pulse shapes such as linear ramps, steps, and other programmed curves. A steady, maximum field of 60 T can be sustained for 0.1 s (and 50 T for 0.5 s). The multi-ton magnet is scheduled to be on the floor in 1995, and we look forward to establishing a user research program based on this one-of-a-kind magnet in the United States.<p>

	Progress and developments in facility construction in the past year centered around preparations for installing the power conversion and control modules for the 60 T quasi-continuous magnet. These modules will have a rating of 400 MW and are an 
important infrastructure investment in capability for both future upgrades and new magnet designs. No other magnet laboratory in the world has such a power supply, nor has one in process. The ultimate limits to this type of magnet, which effectively substitutes high power and energy for material strength to achieve higher fields, have not been reached.<p>

<b>Summary</b><p>

	By the end of 1994, NHMFL at Los Alamos had successively established and operated user facilities at current world field intensity standards for explosive flux compression (March 1991), non-destructive capacitor-driven magnets (December 1992), and superconducting magnets (August 1993). In some areas of instrumentation, such as laser spectroscopy, capability is still being built. In others, such as low temperature, the capabilities are among the foremost in the world.<p>

The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is a National Science Foundation
funded facility for providing high magnetic fields to anyone who needs them.
Its main subdivisions are the DC field facility at Florida State University in
Tallahassee, the pulsed field facility at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in
Los Alamos, New Mexico, the Ultra-High B/T facility at the University of
Florida in Gainesville, and the Center for Interdisciplinary Magnetic Resonance
(CIMAR), headquartered at Tallahassee.  CIMAR contains groups focussing on
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron magnetic resonance (both electron
spin and cyclotron resonance) (EMR), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and ion
cyclotron resonance (ICR).<p>
This pamphlet describes the facilities and services available as of March,
1995.  It is available as a printed document and electronically through the
NHMFL World Wide Web site.  To access the latter use the following URL address:<A HREF="http://www.nhmfl.gov"> http://www.nhmfl.gov</A>.  This document appears as the Users page.
<blockquote><i>The NHMFL facilities are available to qualified users by a
proposal process that is designed to provide quick initial access.  There is
usually no charge to the user except for consumable supplies like liquid
helium.  A list of contact people for all of the facilities listed is at the
end of this brochure.  Any of the people listed will be happy to help
prospective users get started.</i></blockquote>

<dt>Power Supply:<dd>The capacitor bank provides 1.1 megajoules at 10 kV. There
are 8 sub-modules with 4 in use and 4 in reserve.  Presently the system uses
ignitron switches for both the initial switching and the crowbar.  
<br>The switching noise is about 0.05% of the magnet's dB/dt, except for
switching transients.  Recent deHaas-van Alphen measurements on gold in a
stainless steel cryostat enjoyed a signal to noise ratio greater than 100 at 4
K.
<dt>Magnet Cells:<dd>Different pulsed field magnets can be installed
interchangeably in either of three magnet cells.  The magnet is cooled to 77 K
before being pulsed.  The cool-down time following a pulse at the highest field
is about one hour.  A magnet dewar with optical windows is available for
through-bore optical transmission experiments.<dt>Magnet and Cryostat

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC2">DC
power supply:
</a></h4>
The resistive magnets are powered by a highly regulated 40 MW DC power supply. Considerable effort has gone into limiting ripple and noise in the magnets by tuning and controlling internal noise in the power supplies and by designing the magnet cooling water system and magnet housings for minimum vibration. <br>
The homogeneity of the fields in the general purpose magnets is 0.02 % to 0.05 % over a 10 mm diameter sample volume. A specially designed 24.5 T magnet and specially compensated sample holders have been installed for magnetic [resonance] measurements at high fields.<br>
The power supply is made up of four independent rectifiers with passive and
active filter/regulators.  The units can be used separately or run in parallel
to provide higher currents to single magnets.  The table shows the modes for
maximum power operation (all four power supplies in a single magnet).

<p>
Considerable effort has gone into limiting ripple and noise in the magnets by
tuning and controlling  internal noise in the active filter/regulators and by
designing the magnet cooling water system and magnet housings for minimum
vibration.  The results so far are as follows:

<center>
<table border width="100%"><line=center>
<tr><td>Ripple and noise (2-2500 Hz):</td><td>&lt;10 ppm</tr>
<tr><td>Instability, (0-2 Hz):</td><td>&lt;100 ppm</tr>

<tr><td>Resolution between adjacent steps of current set point:</td><td>= 10 ppm</tr>
</td></tr></line=center>
</table>
</center>
<p>
The homogeneity of the fields in the general purpose magnets is 0.02 % to 0.05
% over a 10 mm diameter sample volume.  A specially designed 24.5 T magnet and
specially compensated sample holders have been installed for magnetic resonance
measurements at high fields.<p>
Each magnet is surrounded by a platform at a height that allows the user to
reach the sample holder in the top of the cryostat in the magnet without
excessive reaching or bending.  The platform is wide and strong enough to
support equipment as well as users walking on it.  Most access is from the top,
but access from below is possible.<p>

maximum field.  The compensation coil reduces to near zero effects of the main
field on temperature sensors, optical detectors, etc. placed in the minimum
field zone.  A variable temperature insert (1.5 K to 300 K) and a bottom
loading dilution refrigerator are available for users.  The minimum temperature
reached by the dilution refrigerator is 10 mK; it maintains 15 mK at 19.5 T.
The sample space is 32 mm diameter for samples in vacuum and 16 mm diameter for
samples in the mixture.<p>

A 45 tesla hybrid magnet will be operational in Tallahassee in late 1996.  It
will have a 32 mm bore and will therefore allow use of sample holders built for
other NHMFL high field magnets as long as allowance has been made for the extra
length required to reach the center of the magnetic field.  Prospective users
who plan to bring their own sample holders should discuss dimensions with the
Director of Instrumentation and Operations at the Tallahassee facility.<p>

NHMFL@FSU has installed a Bruker Model IFS 113v Fourier transform infrared
spectrometer.  The specifications of the spectrometer and its accessories are:
<ul>
<li>	Range:  10,000 to 10 cm<sup>-1</sup>
<li>	Resolution:  Better than 0.03 cm<sup>-1</sup>
<li>	Sources:  SiC glowbar, W lamp, and Hg lamp
<li>	Beamsplitters:  Ge on KBr, 4 mylar films and CaF2
<li>	Detectors: DTGS with KBr and polyethylene windows, Si bolometer with dewar
and preamp, InSb detector with dewar and preamp
<li>	Automation:  3 sources, 4 apertures, 4 filters, 6 beam splitters, and 4
detectors
<li>	Sample holders:  A cryostat with light pipe and sample changer for
transmission measurements and a cryostat with light pipes for reflection
measurements may be used in the superconducting and resistive magnets in the
Tallahassee facility.  Sample temperatures can be controlled between 1.6 and
100 K.  The sample can be angled between 60 and 90 degrees to the field
direction.  We have recently found that excellent measurements can be made at
frequencies up to 3000 cm<sup>-1</sup> with the light pipe system.</ul>An
infrared laser is available for use in transmission and reflection measurements
and for optical pumping.  The laser is shared with the Electron Magnetic
Resonance group of CIMAR for electron spin resonance in high magnetic fields.<p>
There has been vigorous discussion with present and prospective users of
facilities for infrared research in high fields.  All agreed that the equipment
must be user friendly.  A big part of that is having someone locally to use,
maintain and improve the equipment and to help users.  The NHMFL therefore
supports research in semiconductor physics using IR spectroscopy as part of its
in-house science program.<p>

All of the sources and spectrometers at the NHMFL now are coupled to the
experiment in the magnet via optical fibers.  This allows the lasers and some
of the spectrometers to remain in one place even though experiments are done in
pulsed magnets, resistive magnets or superconducting magnets located at some
distance.  Experiments can be done at wide ranges of temperature and pressure.
Similar capabilities exist in Los Alamos and Tallahassee.<p>
Complete laser systems provide wavelengths from the near ultraviolet to the
near infrared at both locations.  Each includes a Coherent MIRA 900 dual mode
locked Ti:Sapphire laser capable of operating in the pulsed (femtosecond or
picosecond) or continuous wave modes, a 10 W argon laser to pump the
Ti:Sapphire, and a 7 W, UV capable argon laser.  The lasers have the following
wavelengths: 351.1 nm (300 mW), 363.8 nm (300 mW), 488.0 nm (2.4 W), 514.5 nm
(3.3 W), and a tunable band for the Ti:Sapphire (&gt;=100 mW continuous wave
output) of 700 - 1050 nm .  The time scales of the Ti:S laser in modelocked
operation are 130 fs and 2 ps, and the wavelength range is 720 nm to 1000 nm.<p>
The following equipment is available for pulsed fields and in the 20 T
superconducting magnet in Los Alamos:
<ul>
<li>	0.25m, f/4 Jarrel-Ash monochromator with a thermoelectrically cooled GaAs
photomultiplier and a liquid nitrogen cooled Ge photo-detector for operation in
the visible and near IR (300-1600 nm)<sup>1 </sup>
<li>	0.6m, f/10 Spex `Triple-Mate' spectrometer<a
href="magneto_optics_vis_fn.html#fn0">[1 ]</a>with a Photometrics Model 9000
CCD array detector<a href="magneto_optics_vis_fn.html#fn1">[2]</a> for the
300-1050 nm region
<li>	0.28m, f/4 Acton Instruments monochromator with a Princeton Instruments
CCD array detector<a href="magneto_optics_vis_fn.html#fn2">[3]</a> for
operation in the 300-1050 nm region.
<li>	Sample holders for both pulsed and superconducting magnets at temperatures
from 1.6 to 300 K.  Samples may be oriented either parallel or perpendicular to
the applied field.
<li>	Diamond anvil cells for optical studies at pressures up to 25 GPa.
<li>	Techniques used have included photoluminescence, transmission and
reflection spectroscopy.</ul>Users of the resistive and superconducting magnets
in Tallahassee have available a MacPherson 0.75 m single grating
monochrometer/spectrometer.  The accessories on hand provide 0.01 nm resolution
and cover wavelengths from 300 to 900 nm (7 gratings).  It is highly automated
and features a UV coated 1024 X 256 CCD array detector for rapid spectroscopy
in high fields (over 125 spectra in a single 3.5 hour shift).<p>
The following other equipment is available for use in the resistive and
superconducting magnets in Tallahassee:
<ul>
<li>	Holographic notch filters at 488.0 and 514.5 nm.
<li>	Sample holders are available for all of the superconducting and resistive
magnets.  
<li>	Sample temperature control from 1.6 K to 300 K while situated in a vacuum
can in the helium dewar.  
<li>	The sample holder for the 50 mm  bore resistive magnets has sample
changing capability for up to seven 5 mm diameter samples. 
<li>	Techniques used have included photoluminescence and reflection
spectroscopy.</ul>

Pickup coils are available for magnetization and de Haas - van Alphen
measurements in the pulsed magnets.  <p>
The silicon cantilever beam method of force magnetometry can be used in any DC
resistive or superconducting magnet to measure the torque on an anisotropic
sample in an isotropic field or  an isotropic sample in an anisotropic field.
The  balance can measure forces in the range from 10<sup>-4</sup> to
2X10<sup>-2</sup> dyne*cm without the nulling mode and has been extended to
10<sup>-1</sup> in nulling mode.  It can resolve 10<sup>-7</sup> emu
(10<sup>-10</sup> J/T) in a field gradient of 0.1 T/cm.  It can resolve
10<sup>-9</sup> emu of torque at 20 T.  The temperature range of the cantilever
beam method is from 20 mK to 300 K.<p>
A vibrating sample magnetometer may be used in the 20 T superconducting magnet
in Los Alamos,  and one will be purchased for use at the NHMFL at Tallahassee
for hysteresis measurements and samples such as pressure cells that are
inappropriate for the cantilever beam method.<p>
Apparatus for measuring AC susceptibility in samples at temperatures from  0.5
K to 300 K is available.<p>

A thermal expansion (and magnetostriction) cell has been built by Alex Lacerda
for use in the 20 T  superconducting magnets.  Its sensitivity, dL/L =
10<sup>-9</sup> normally with 10<sup>-11</sup> possible.  It operates from 20
mK to 300 K.  The next generation cell will be non-metallic for use in the 50 T
pulsed magnets.  Thermal expansion is particularly useful for studying
materials near magnetic instabilities.<p>
Precise calorimeters for specific heat measurements in the resistive and
superconducting magnets are being developed be LANL, NHMFL, and UF researchers.
Users can consult them about collaboration or develop their own.<p>

A high pressure facility is now available for all magnets at NHMFL to perform
both electrical transport and optical measurements over a wide range of sample
volumes and attainable pressures under conditions of both hydrostatic and
uniaxial stress.  Conventional miniature piston-cylinder cells that can reach
1.7&nbsp;GPa and have provisions for fiber optic access and electrical leads
are available, but the main thrust in high pressure techniques is focused on
diamond-anvil cell [DAC] technology.  Although the available sample space in a
DAC is small (typically a 300-700 um diameter cylinder, 60-120 um thick), two
to six electrical leads can be attached to single crystal platelets only 100 um
on an edge and as thick as 40 um.  Spectroscopic measurements are limited only
by the 10 kN load that the DAC can sustain and the optical window material,
diamond.  Type II diamond anvils will be available for infrared studies.  UV
studies can be carried out in a sapphire-ball cell designed by Professor
Daniels from the University of Delaware.<p>
To address the experimental restrictions of sample orientation and cryogenic
temperatures in DC and pulsed magnetic fields, three different DACs have been
designed (see table below).  All are made entirely of BeCu and have optical
ports and provisions for either miniature triaxial cable or shielded twisted
pairs.  The largest of the three DACs provides the highest pressures.  DAC #2
was designed with its small diameter and thin wall to minimize eddy current
heating of the sample prior to data acquisition in pulsed magnets.  This
particular cell is small enough to freely rotate within a 12 mm sphere and thus
enables orientation dependent work to millikelvin temperatures and pulsed
fields to 50 T and higher.  Both cells #1 &amp; #2 support a minimal load of 10
kN.  DAC #3 is intended for microkelvin work and possibly heat capacity
studies.<p>

Transport measurements are possible in combination with optical irradiation and
microwave irradiation.  They can be done as a function of temperature,
pressure, and/or the angle between the sample and the magnetic field.  The
ranges of several parameters that can be varied as resistance is measured are
shown in the table below.  The parameters listed cannot all be varied
simultaneously in all situations.  People with special requirements should
discuss them with one of the contact people listed at the end of this
document.<p>

Transport measurements require the highest fields, low vibration, field
reversal, temperatures from as low as possible to above room temperature, and a
good ground.  NHMFL has taken extra steps in the design and construction of all
of its  facilities to minimize vibration and magnetic field ripple, and to
provide a good ground for low noise measurements.<p>
Standard equipment available includes such things as low frequency lock-in
amplifiers, very sensitive digital voltmeters and preamplifiers with negligible
pump out current at the input leads (especially of digital noise).<p>
Many NHMFL sample holders use standard non magnetic 8 or 16 pin DIP sockets for
holding the samples.  The leads chosen as twisted pairs can easily be arranged
to suit the user's sample mount.<p>

<IMG SRC="/gifs/bluebar.gif"width=478 height=5 BORDER=0 HSPACE=00><br><br>
There are some important problems in condensed matter physics than can be
addressed by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, even in the low
homogeneity (20 ppm/mm)  general purpose magnets.  Instrumentation for such
experiments is available and various avenues for development of more homogenous
high field magnets are being followed.  Techniques and magnets for high field
magnetic resonance experiments in the pulsed magnets are also being
developed.<p>
Three spectrometers are now available for experiments in the general purpose
magnets of the NHMFL:
<ol>
<li>	Pulsed, single frequency, 10 to 1000 MHz, made at NHMFL.
<li>	Continuous, 500 to 2000 MHz, made at NHMFL.
<li>	Continuous, 10 to 300 MHz, manufactured by TecMag.</ol>The pulsed
spectometer covers all commonly used nuclei except <sup>1</sup>H and
<sup>19</sup>F in fields to 27 T.  The high frequency limit will be increased
as higher field magnets become available.<p>
Sample holders are available for the 20 T superconducting magnets and all of
the resistive magnets.  Those on hand cover the frequency range from 350 to 900
MHz and have a sample temperature range of 1.6 to 300 K.  A sample holder for
temperatures down to 20 mK is being developed.<p>

<IMG SRC="/gifs/bluebar.gif"width=478 height=5 BORDER=0 HSPACE=00><br><br>
<br>
The power supply is made up of four independent rectifiers with passive and active<br>
filter/regulators. The units can be used separately or run in parallel to provide higher currents to single magnets. The table shows the modes for maximum power operation (all four power supplies in a single magnet). <br>
<ul>
<li>	<b>Nominal rating</b> <br>
	24 MW<br>
		32 MW<br>
			40 MW<br>
<li>	<b>Voltage</b> <br>
	400 V<br>

			40 MW<br>
<li>	<b>Maximum operating time</b> <br>
	indefinite<br>
		12 hours<br>
			1 hour<br>
</ul> <BR>
Considerable effort has gone into limiting ripple and noise in the magnets by tuning and controlling internal noise in the active filter/regulators and by designing the magnet cooling water system and magnet housings for minimum vibration. The results so far are as follows: <br>
<ul><li>	<b>Ripple and noise (2-2500 Hz): </b> <br>
<10 ppm<br>
<li>	<b>Instability, (0-2 Hz): </b> <br>
<100 ppm<br>
<li>	<b>Repeatability error, including ripple: </b> <br>
<100 ppm<br>
<li>	<b>Resolution between adjacent steps of current set point: </b> <br>
= 10 ppm<br>
</ul> <br>
The homogeneity of the fields in the general purpose magnets is 0.02 % to 0.05 % over a 10 mm diameter sample volume. A specially designed 24.5 T magnet and specially compensated sample holders have been installed for magnetic <a href="resonance.html">resonance</a> measurements at high fields.<br>
<br>
A sine wave signal can be added to the power supplies' control signal to <a href="modulationamplitude.html">modulate</a> the field produced by any of the resistive magnets. Modulation of the field can be done at higher frequencies and amplitudes with a <a href="coil.html">coil</a> specially wound for a particular experiment. <br>

The magnetic resonance program spans all three institutions of the NHMFL.  The
primary facilities for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron magnetic
resonance (EMR, including electron paramagnetic, spin, and cyclotron
resonance), and ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) are housed in Tallahassee.
Strong ties have been established with the Structural Biology Program, the
Center for Materials and Research Technology, and the Supercomputing
Computational Research Institute at Florida State University (FSU); the Center
for Structural Biology of the College of Medicine at the University of Florida
(UF); the Chemical Science and Technology Division at Los Alamos National
Laboratory; as well as with individual research groups in Biology,
Biochemistry, Chemistry, Materials Science, and Physics at the three NHMFL
institutions.  The primary site for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the
University of Florida Brain Institute, which offers extensive animal care and
surgical facilities.  A prime and unique feature of CIMAR is its large-scale
integration of NMR, MRI, EMR, and ICR spectroscopies, which share many
conceptual (e.g., pulse sequences, heterodyning, quadrature
excitation/detection, double resonance, two-dimensional FT methods, etc.) and
technical (magnets, rf electronics, Fourier transform data reduction, etc.)
aspects.  Continued cross-fertilization between these fields is facilitated at
NHMFL in several ways through a broad-based external and internal user
program.<p>

Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) includes conventional ESR/EPR,
ferro/antiferromagnetic resonance, ferrimagnetic resonance and electron
cyclotron resonance.  For g=2 systems the combination of high magnetic field
and high frequency is expected to increase resolution (when the linewidth is
independent of the magnetic field, as for hyperfine interactions), and to
increase sensitivity. <p>
For field induced transitions (one-dimensional antiferromagnetism, organic
conductors), the motivation for high-field experiments derives principally from
the magnetic field dependence of the spectra.  For large Zero Field Splitting
systems that are spectroscopically silent at low frequency, the motivation
obviously lies in the frequency dependence of the spectra. <p>
Instrumentation for EMR is being developed for use before June, 1996.  It will
use a 15/17 T dedicated superconducting magnet and the general purpose DC
resistive magnets.<p>

ICR Magnets with their associated instrumentation are as follows:
<ul>
<li>	9.4 tesla magnet, 200 mm diameter horizontal warm bore Oxford magnet (NSF
National High-Field FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Facility).  Scheduled for
operation in May 1995, it will be the highest-field Fourier transform ICR mass
spectrometer in the world, and will be devoted mainly to electrospray of large
biomolecules (e.g., proteins up to 150,000 Dalton or higher), and nucleic acids
(RNA, DNA) to 100,000,000 Da or higher. It will be available to outside users
nationwide and worldwide. 
<li>	7.0 tesla, 150 mm diameter horizontal warm bore Oxford magnet (Marshall
research group).  This instrument is designed for the first direct measurement
of optical absorption of mass-selected gas-phase ions and should provide direct
information about ion structure (as shown for neutrals fifty years ago). 
<li>	6.5 tesla, 150 mm diameter horizontal warm bore Oxford magnet (NSF
National High-Field FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Facility). This magnet is a
platform for development of the 9.4 tesla system.  If possible it will be
configured for matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and other
laser-based FT-ICR experiments.  <b></b>
<li><b></b>	3.0 tesla, 150 mm diameter horizontal warm bore Extrel/Waters
magnet (Marshall research group).  This instrument is the workhorse for general
analytical and chemical applications, including ion-molecule reaction
chemistry, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization, and MS/MS. This
instrument is available for collaborative work with outside users. </ul>Access
to the FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Facility is as follows. No prior approval is
required for members of the initial Co-Investigator Group<b>.</b>  Access by
anybody else simply requires a brief (1-2 page) proposal of a given experiment
for review by the Advisory Panel.  Large blocks of instrument time will be
partitioned by the Advisory Panel, and short-use periods will be scheduled
locally.  For extended user visits (more than a week or two), salary, travel,
and lodging support are available for a limited number of graduate students
selected from non-local user groups. Costs for experiments will be borne
largely by the NSF High-Field FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Facility grant.<p>

A special annex facility for studies of materials at ultra-high values of the
ratio of magnetic field to temperature (B/T) is being developed as a
collaborative effort between the NHMFL and the Microkelvin Laboratory (MKL) at
the University of Florida. This facility will provide users with the ability to
carry out experiments that simultaneously require fields up to ~20 T and
temperatures down to 500 K. The B/T ratio of 4X10<sup>4</sup> T/K will be the
highest available anywhere, and will allow users to study new phenomena that
require the establishment of high spin polarizations or high magnetizations.<p>
The diameter of the experimental volume is 2.5 cm with a central field
inhomogeneity of 100 ppm over a 1 cm DSV. The two magnets are separated by a
compensating coil to minimize field variations at the sample during
demagnetization.<p>
The facility is expected to be open to external users in the fall of 1995.<p>

<br>
The Materials Development and Characterization Group (MD&C) was established to investigate the physical and mechanical properties of state-of-the-art materials proposed for use in superconducting and resistive magnets. The group supports internal magnet design teams by generating engineering design data as well as conducts basic applied research for the improvement of magnet materials. This capability requires unique facilities and personnel that enables detailed characterization of prototype structural materials and electrical conductors, as well as commercial materials. The facility descriptions and  specifications are given below. <br>

The facility developed for testing structural materials at the extremes of temperature, centers around a 100 kN capacity hydraulic test machine. Figure 1 shows the mechanical test system equipped with a test cryostat. This system is used to evaluate mechanical properties, using a variety of test methods, with emphasis on small samples that meet ASTM test specifications. With the use of the cryostat and temperature controllers, test temperatures can be varied between 400-4 K with an accuracy of  1 K. Computerized; test control, data acquisition, and data analysis, aids researchers in the highly sensitive characterization of the stress and strain response of materials. <br>
<br>
<b>Small Scale Critical Current Measurement Facility</b><br>
Two unique facilities exist for the characterization of superconducting materials.  The first is designed to allow measurement of the effects of applied strains on the transport current of superconducting wires and tapes.  It consists of a load frame that is situated above a split solenoid magnet and its cryostat as shown in Figure 2.  This test station can supply loads of up to 4 kN and currents up to 1 kA to conductors in magnetic fields up to 13 T. The magnet and it's cryostat are also used, independent of the test machine, for critical current measurements in field without applied strain. <br>
<br>
<b>Large Scale Critical Current Measurement Facility</b><br>
The second facility, used for testing very large conductors, is shown in Figure 3.   Critical current as a function of strain can be measured in monolithic, cabled and cable-in-conduit conductors.  This systems consists of a 250 kN (25 ton)  capacity hydraulic test machine that is integrated with a structural cryostat and a 14-Tesla, 150-mm bore, split solenoid magnet.  The system has access to the laboratories main power supplies allowing use of sample transport currents of up to 10 kA. <br>
<br>
<b>High Force Mechanical Test System</b><br>
Higher force test equipment is readily available upon mutual agreement at the State of Florida Department of Transportation's, Structural Research Center. There facility is located within our campus in a building that houses a variety of test machines. Forces up to 2.5 MN (250 ton) can be applied at room temperature and 77 K. <br>
<br>
<b>Microanalysis Facility</b><br>
The laboratory also has in-house facilities for microstructural characterization and sample preparation.  Among these are several X-ray diffraction systems, a Transmission Electron Microscope (TEM), an Environmental Scanning Electron Microscope (ESEM) equipped with Back-scatter Kikuichi Diffractometer (BKD), a metallographic preparation laboratory, and heat treating and alloy preparation furnaces. <br>
<br>
<b>Programs</b><br>
There are several cryogenic materials research projects ongoing in the MD&C group.  These investigations include: The development of new stainless steel alloys for cable-in-conduit superconducting magnets; mechanical and electrical  testing of advanced superconducting wires; an international cooperative program (VAMAS) to standardize low temperature test methods and analyses; testing of structural composites; research to investigate mechanical and electrical properties of  cable-in-conduit conductors. <br>
<br>
Investigations of resistive magnet materials include:  Measurements of the mechanical and electrical properties of high-strength, high-conductivity copper alloys, such as CuNb, CuAg, CuBe; mechanical tests of advanced Bitter magnet insulation systems; and tests of composite conductors, such as Cu-stainless steel wires for pulsed magnet applications. <br>
In addition the MDCL provides testing and analysis services to industrial and academic researchers with interest in cryogenic or magnet materials. <br>

The Microkelvin Laboratory is an independent facility established in 1986 to
conduct research at ultra-low temperatures.  Two of the bays of MKL are
equipped with copper nuclear demagnetization stages and are used for
experiments down to 45K. Experiments currently in progress include studies of
nuclear magnetic ordering, quantum solids, heavy fermions, and Fermi liquids.
Although not a part of the NHMFL program, the MKL provides the opportunity for
research at ultra-low temperatures for users on a collaborative basis.

<IMG SRC="/gifs/bluebar.gif"width=478 height=5 BORDER=0 HSPACE=00><br><br>
The NHMFL has contributed to the development of a new program, the Center
for Structural Biology in the College of Medicine at the University of
Florida.   Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques and high field
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are used to study the form and function of
biological structures from the molecular to the cellular scales of
organization.  The tour-de-force of the new Center will be a 12 T, 40 cm
bore magnet to study whole animals as models of disease using NMR imaging
and spectroscopy.   This new magnet system will be housed in the University
of Florida Brain Institute when it opens in the fall of 1998.
<p>
The Center for Structural Biology currently operates both a 300 MHz and 600
MHz NMR spectrometer with microscopy capabilities, and a  4.7 T, 33 cm
magnet for small animal research.  In addition, the College of Medicine, in
collaboration with the Veterans Affairs Medical Center, operates a 3 T
whole-body magnet for human studies.  These resources and the planned
development of the facilities for the Center of Structural Biology support
and enhance the science programs of all faculty involved in magnetic
resonance in association with the NHMFL programs at the University of
Florida.  Opportunities exist for outside users to participate in a
collaborative mode.

<IMG SRC="/gifs/bluebar.gif"width=478 height=5 BORDER=0 HSPACE=00><br><br>
Dynamic Experimentation Division<p>
This well developed, but specialized, technique uses chemical explosive to
compress flux, generated by capacitor discharge, into a small volume.  The
sample is sacrificed and the experiment is necessarily conducted outdoors at a
secure firing site.  Approximately two shots a day can be produced at a cost of
about $8,000 each. DeHaas-vanAlphen oscillations and the upper critical fields
of high temperature superconductors have been successfully measured.<p>
Through cooperation between the Los Alamos Dynamic Experimentation Division and
scientists from the Scientific Research Institute of Experimental Physics,
Arzamas-16, Russia, a small number of generators have been obtained that are
capable of producing 1,000 T in a 10 to 12 mm bore. Although not part of the
NHMFL program, these generators can be available for NHMFL experiments of high
scientific importance on a non-interference basis during scheduled testing.
The cost, must be negotiated by the experimenter.<p>
Characteristics: pulse period is less than 10 microseconds; temperatures are
approximately 2 to 300 K.  Magnet fields and bores are:

<pre>
   Field (T)      Bore Size (mm)   
      200               28         
      500               15         
      1000           10 to 12      

</pre>
<p>
Sample holders covering temperatures from 0.5 to 300 K are available.  Data
acquisition and other support is provided to users.<p>

<b><i>Introduction:  </i></b><BR>There are several ways to do research using the
facilities of the NHMFL; all are described below.<p>
The "Users' Resources" of the NHMFL are for those who want to work
independently using the general purpose DC and pulsed magnets and their
associated instrumentation, certain of the NMR instruments, or the Ultra High
B/T Laboratory.  Visits are scheduled for an appropriate length of time
(usually about a week), NHMFL staff help the user get started, and then the
user works independently with occasional assistance if needed.  <p>
Access to laboratories and instruments funded primarily by grants other than
the NSF cooperative agreement with the NHMFL depends on the terms of the other
grants and usually involves collaboration with the principal investigator to
whom the grant was given.  Potential users should contact the principal
investigator they wish to work with or see the Users page of the NHMFL WWWeb
site.<p>
The NHMFL Science Program funds and supervises longer term research involving
NHMFL scientists and outside collaborators.  The criteria to be met by such
research are described below.<p>
The Visiting Scientist program funds sabbaticals, summer research, and other
visits of a month or more by users of the Users' Resources.<b></b>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC2">Users' Resources
</a></h3>
User access to NSF-funded NHMFL facilities is controlled by a two-step proposal
and review process that is administered by the Director of Continuous Field
Facilities and the Director of the Pulsed Field Facility.<p>
To provide rapid response to new science opportunities, only a  brief initial
proposal is required. It is reviewed by NHMFL staff and approved or denied by
the Director of NHMFL. Then, every quarter, a summary listing of all user
programs is compiled and ranked in order of magnet use. Users who are likely to
consume a significant portion of resources (about 2%) within the year ending
during the next quarter are then required to submit a more detailed proposal
based on their present and future work in high fields. Users in this category
are the largest users that collectively account for at least 80% of the annual
total facility use. In addition, all users of the 45 T hybrid magnet will be
required to submit such a proposal for peer review. Each accepted proposal is
in force for three years. The final decision for use of the High Field Facility
rests with the Director of the NHMFL.<p>
A detailed proposal is reviewed by one member of the Users' Committee, one
outside reviewer (not NHMFL or Users' Committee), and one member of the NHMFL
Science Program Committee. Each reviewer gives the proposal a score on a
"0-to-10" scale. The total of the review score determines the priority and
amount of magnet time given to the proposed experiments. The Principal
Investigators can indicate specific scientists who should not review the
proposal if a conflict of interest exists. The NHMFL and its reviewers treat
proposals as confidential documents and respect the intellectual property
rights of the authors.<p>
The detailed proposal process is waived for any research program that is
supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation, the Department of
Energy, the National Institutes of Health, or any other public or private
agency that follows a peer-review process acceptable to the NHMFL. This waiver
assumes that the research proposed is fully described in the grant proposal or
award and that funds were included to support the high magnetic field research
activity.<p>
Most of the NMR Spectrometers, Electron Magnetic Resonance Facilities, FT-ICR
Mass Spectrometer Facilities, Isotope Geochemistry Facilities, and the Magnetic
Resonance Imaging Facilities are supported by other grants; access to the
resources is governed by the terms of the grants or the Principal
Investigators. Many of these facilities are available through collaborative
programs.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC3">Science Program Resources:
</a></h3>
<b><i>Criteria and Procedures: </i></b> <BR>The NHMFL has established criteria and
procedures for evaluating proposals for research to be included in and funded
by the NHMFL Science Program. These procedures will guarantee that a fair and
equitable selection of the most meritorious research projects occurs. They have
been established with a sensitivity to the additional requirements set forth in
the NSF Cooperative Agreement and in the knowledge that the external users
provide a broad expertise base and points of view outside the NHMFL that should
be included. All proposals requesting support from the Science Program are to
be submitted to the NHMFL Director of the Science Program, who also serves as
Chair of the Science Program Committee. The Science Program Committee will
recommend for funding those proposals that pass the peer review process and
will monitor their performance annually.
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC4">The following criteria will be used in the evaluation of all proposals:
</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>	The same criteria applied by the NSF in reviewing proposals are included
in the NHMFL's review criteria. They include: <ol>
<li>	research performance competence
<li>	intrinsic merit of the research
<li>	utility or relevance of the research, and
<li>	effect of the research on the infrastructure of science and
engineering.</ol>
<li>	The proposal must fulfill the explicit requirements of the NSF Cooperative
Agreement "(1) that it is of the highest intellectual quality, and (2) that
this research requires NHMFL facilities and will lead to the improvement of
these facilities."
<li>	Proposals that involve multi-institutional activities and external users
as well as NHMFL researchers will be given high consideration. Support for
external users may include travel, summer or sabbatical stipends for time spent
at a NHMFL facility, specialized equipment, and support for students and
postdocs who spend a majority of their research time at an NHMFL facility.
<li>	Proposals submitted by young researchers, i.e., researchers within 7 years
of the most advanced degree, will be given a high funding priority.
<li>	The evaluation will be based on a combination of internal and external
peer review. The NHMFL Science Program Committee will screen all proposals and
pre-review them to be sure that they meet the basic requirements set forth by
the NHMFL. The NHMFL Science Program Committee, appropriately augmented with a
few additional members if necessary, will evaluate and rank reviewed proposals,
with all proposals required to have at least two external reviews and one
internal review. The Science Program Committee will submit a ranked list of
proposals to the Director of the NHMFL who will make the final decision on
funding in consultation with the NHMFL Executive Committee.</ul><h3>
<a name="RTFToC5">NHMFL Visiting Scientist Program
</a></h3>
Funds are provided annually by the State of Florida for a Visiting Scientist
Program in support of the laboratory research programs. Each year the Executive
Committee will recommend allocation of limited visitors funds to specific
departments with the balance of the funding remaining in the Director's office.
Departments will then be free to select visitors within the limits of their
funding. Additional proposals for visiting faculty can be submitted to the
Director. These proposals will be reviewed by the Executive Committee and
recommendations made to the Director.<p>

NHMFL@FSU has negotiated low rates ($39 per night in 1995) with some motels
near the lab.  Car rental and restaurant prices in Tallahassee are relatively
low so that per diem expenses for one researcher are under $100 per day.  Two
researchers sharing a room and car cost only slightly more.<p>
Visitors to the NHMFL facilities in Los Alamos will find a variety of
accomodations.  Rooms cost $60 to $70 per day.  A car is about $40 per day.
Low cost housing is available for students.<p>
Users of the Ultra High B/T facility can stay in the Reitz Union on the UF
campus for about $35 per night.  A car is not required to reach the lab or
restaurants.<p>
Some travel support is available to first time users of the NHMFL.  Interested
persons should inquire when they call to discuss using the facilities.<p>
Laboratory and office space are available for sample mounting, data analysis,
etc.<p>

Anyone interested in research using high magnetic fields is eligible to join
the NHMFL Users' Organization.  The benefits include the right to vote for
members of the Users' Committee and receipt of quarterly newsletters describing
recent events, new instrumentation, recent research, and other items of
interest relating to the several sites and activities of the laboratory.  There
have been three meetings of the Users' Organization on the Sunday prior to the
American Physical Society March Meeting.  Meetings of researchers interested in
chemistry, biology and other disciplines that can use high magnetic fields are
planned for the future.  Anyone wishing to join the organization and get on the
mailing list should contact Bruce Brandt. (<a href="mailto:brandt@magnet.fsu.edu"">brandt@magnet.fsu.edu</a>)<p>
<b>Users' Committee:</b><p>
<b></b>Established by the Cooperative Agreement, the Users' Committee is
elected by the NHMFL user community. Members reflect the broad range of users
including the users of DC Fields, Pulsed Fields, Ultra-High B/T Facilities, and
the CIMAR instruments. The Users' Committee meets twice a year to provide
guidance on the development and use of NHMFL facilities and services in support
of the users. The Users' Committee Chair represents users' interests during
National Science Foundation site visits and is a member of the External
Advisory Committee. Members of the Users' Committee help evaluate users'
proposals. The Users' Committee activities are supported by the Director of
Pulsed Fields and the Director of Continuous Fields.<p>

The NHMFL has established a full in-house Environmental Health and Safety Unit
in response to the requirements of the NSF Cooperative Agreement. The in-house
group reports directly to the Chief Administrative Officer and coordinates
activities with the FSU Department of Environmental Health and Safety. The
NHMFL Safety program encourages involvement by a large percentage of the
laboratory staff in the safety program through rotating memberships on the
Safety Committee. This committee meets regularly to review safety issues, and
it participates in the development of procedures and training programs, as well
as the environmental audit inspections.

<IMG SRC="/gifs/bluebar.gif"width=478 height=5 BORDER=0 HSPACE=00><br><br>
<ol>
<li>	Handling of cryogenic liquids:<ol>
<li>	Face masks and gloves are provided in each cell.  Protective aprons are
available.  Gloves <b>must</b> be used when inserting and removing the transfer
siphon from the dewar.  Doing so prevents freezing your skin.  It also reduces
the probability of damaging the siphon so that it will be available for your
next transfer.  
<li>	More people are injured with liquid nitrogen than liquid helium because it
is more commonly handled directly.  Wear gloves when you might touch cold metal
tubing</ol>
<li>	Bare feet and open toed shoes, such as sandals are not allowed in the cell
area.  Your footwear must provide secure footing on stairs and ladders and some
protection of your feet from spilled liquids.
<li>	Equipment must be arranged in the cell neatly with reasonable working
space.  Cables should be out of the way so people don't trip on them or catch
them with moving equipment.  Gas bottles must be in the wall mounts.  If the
wall mounts are not convenient, ask the Control Room or Operations personnel to
help you do what you want.
<li>	The experimenters are responsible for the cleanliness of the cell during
an experiment and for returning all equipment and supplies to their proper
places after finishing.
<li>	The magnets are powered by one or more ungrounded 500 V / 20,000 A power
supplies that have contacts in each cell.  Be aware of where that power is and
make sure that neither you nor your probe comes in contact with this power.
This could lead to severe damage to the experimental equipment or sample not to
mention the experimenter.  The power supplies probably will not be damaged.
<li>	The magnet housing is connected to the magnet through the cooling water.
The housing is grounded, however, to be completely safe, treat the magnet
casing as if it could suddenly rise to a 500 V potential at any time.
<li>	High pressure water is in the magnet housing and in the connected pipes.
For this and reasons above do not spend long periods of time on top of the
magnet unless necessary.  Please inform the control room if you absolutely must
be up on the magnet platform when there is current in the magnet.
<li>	Do not enter the area around the magnet under the platform.  There are
many ways to injure yourself there and no good reason to go in.  If you drop
something down there, contact the Control Room to get someone to retrieve it.
<li>	Be aware that strong magnetic fields exist around the magnet.  Lines at
the 10G and 100G level are drawn on the floor of the cell.  Credit and ATM
cards should be kept behind the 100G line.  <b>Steel, iron or other magnetic
objects should be fastened down or kept behind the 10G line.</b>  Be especially
aware of compressed gas cylinders.  Be very sure that screwdrivers, wrenches
and other hand tools are not left around the magnet.  Steel chairs are
<b>NOT</b> allowed in the cells under any circumstances.
<li>	There shall be one person in the cell whenever there is current flowing in
the magnet.  <b>Control room personnel are instructed to immediately ramp the
magnet down if a cell is left unattended.</b>  It is best to have two persons
present and participating in the experiments.  Two people make fewer mistakes,
solve problems quicker, do experimental procedures quicker, and generally make
more efficient use of magnet time.  This becomes especially important after
normal business hours when Operations staff are less available.  If you need an
extra person temporarily to help with an operation or if you need to leave the
cell and cannot ramp the magnet down.
<li>	Continuous contact between the experimenters and the Control Room must be
maintained over the intercommunication system during operation of the magnet.
The experimenter can start the communication by pressing and releasing the Call
Button on the speaker cabinet and saying, for example, "Cell five calling the
Control Room."  Do not press the Call Button after the Control Room has
answered, just speak in a fairly loud voice directly into the speaker cabinet.
<li>	A plastic barrier chain should be across the cell entrance when running.
The experimenter is responsible for the safety of everyone other than
Operations staff, who is in the cell during a magnet run.  The experimenter
should warn anyone entering the cell that the field is on and can direct anyone
who is not a member of the Operations staff to leave the cell.
<li><b>	</b>There is a red Emergency Off button located near the exit in each
cell.  It will shut off electric power to all the magnets in use if it is
pressed.  In case of an emergency hit this button as you rapidly but calmly
exit the cell.  Safety circuits detect magnet and other cell faults and shut
off power in milliseconds, so most cell emergencies are over in less time than
most humans require to react.  Panic may cause to you injure yourself.</ol>The

Tallahassee, FL

<p>
	
Talbot "Sandy" D'Alemberte, President of Florida State University, announced today that a tentative agreement has been reached between FSU, the FSU Research Foundation, and EURUS Technologies, Inc. to relocate the firm to a new headquarters building located in Innovation Park in Tallahassee, Florida.
<p>
	EURUS Technologies, Inc. , currently located in East Hampton, New York, is a high-tech company specializing in taking emerging technologies into the marketplace; EURUS' affiliate, EUS Tecnologias, S.A. (Spain) is a supplier to CERN, the European Nuclear Research Center. EURUS is the first commercial company to develop state-of-the-art expertise in high temperature superconductor (HTS) current leads and materials technology. Superconducting devices have no resistance to the flow of electricity at temperatures well below room temperature and consequently have a wide range of potential commercial applications.
<p>
	EURUS is also one of the first manufacturers of off-the-shelf and customized proprietary HTS material for medical diagnostics, electric power distribution, particle physics, and magnetic separation. Commercial clients for these cutting-edge products represent the largest installed base of HTS current leads of any manufacturer. EURUS has sold products in Europe, Asia, and the United States and continues to broaden the market for HTS materials through its collaborative design and systems analysis work worldwide.
<p>
	EURUS and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory, also located in Innovation Park in Tallahassee, have implemented a program to co-develop and test an ultra-high current lead utilizing the remarkable properties of high temperature superconductivity. These leads may eventually be used in the laboratory's most advanced magnet systems, such as the 45 tesla hybrid magnet which will produce a magnetic field that is one million times the Earth's magnetic field.
<p>
	EURUS currently employs nineteen scientists, engineers, and industry specialists, some of whom would relocate to Tallahassee. A majority of the EURUS executive team will relocate as well. Plans call for significant growth in staff and increased space requirements in the upcoming years. EURUS will be located in a new building currently under construction in Innovation Park. EURUS is expected to occupy that building in January 1997.
<p>
	The Florida State University Research Foundation, with its Board chaired by President D'Alemberte, worked closely with local leaders including the Tallahassee Chamber of Commerce in attracting EURUS to Tallahassee. "We could not be more pleased to have a company like EURUS become our tenant in Innovation Park and become a close neighbor and working partner with the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. We think this signals the new beginning of a new technology era for this region and our state, as the magnet laboratory and FSU attract new jobs and enhance our economy."
<p>
	EURUS President Marilyn S. Adams was also pleased with the upcoming relocation to Tallahassee. "EURUS has devoted serious, extensive effort to identify, analyze, and select a location for our consolidated U.S. operations and headquarters. As a young company in a young industry, we looked for a location where building for the future was an established pattern in the community and where our existing international relationships would be enhanced. We are delighted that this search has led us to Florida State University and its Research Foundation. EURUS is proud to join the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Innovation Park, and we look forward to active participation in the Tallahassee academic and business communities, which have already made us feel so welcome."
<p>
	The Florida State University Research Foundation, Inc., is a not-for-profit corporation and a direct support organization of FSU. Established in 1993, the FSU Research Foundation is the repository of income derived from FSU's privately-funded contracts and grants, as well as income resulting from licenses and royalties received from patents and copyrights held by FSU faculty. Funds are used for the furtherance of research and training activities.
<p>
	For more information on EURUS products, services, and collaborative efforts with world-class research facilities, please contact John Romans at 1-800-850-1135, email Info@TeamEURUS.com, or web site http://www.TeamEURUS.com.

	Tallahassee, FL-EURUS Technologies, Inc., representing state-of-the art expertise in high temperature superconductor (HTS) current leads and materials technology, and the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) have initiated a program to co-develop and test an ultra-high current lead utilizing the remarkable properties of high temperature superconductivity. Superconducting devices have no resistance to the flow of electricity at temperatures well below room temperature and consequently have a wide range of potential commercial applications. The leads eventually will be used in the NHMFL's magnet systems, such as the 45 tesla hybrid magnet, which will produce a magnetic field that is one million times the earth's magnetic field. The agreement with EURUS is the first such on-site program that the NHMFL has concluded with private industry.
<P>
	The results of the program will report the mechanical, electrical, and thermal properties of the new class of current leads under varying cryogenic conditions. It will culminate in the production of the world's first commercially available 10,000-amp-class, encapsulated, high temperature superconducting current lead suitable for deployment in ultra-high magnetic field applications, such as in magnetic energy storage, which responds to emerging power industry needs, and in new magnet systems for materials processing.
<P>
	President of EURUS Technologies, Lyn Adams stated, "We know that EURUS is among the first to offer commercially available HTS products today...and we expect to be here in five years when HTS is well up the learning curve and fully integrated into the electric power, medical diagnostics, environmental remediation, transportation, and electronics industries. Our partners at the NHMFL encourage us in this ambition, and we are proud to be collaborating with them."
<P>
	EURUS manufactures off-the-shelf and customized proprietary HTS material for medical diagnostics, electric power distribution, particle physics, and magnetic separation. Commercial clients for these state-of-the-art products represent the largest installed base of HTS current leads of any manufacturer. EURUS has sold the products in Europe, Asia, and the United States and continues to broaden the market for HTS materials through its collaborative design and systems analysis work worldwide.
<P>
	The NHMFL is the world's premier research institution in the fundamental science and technology of magnetic fields. Supported by the U.S. National Science Foundation and the State of Florida, the laboratory is operated by Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory and offers its facilities to qualified users internationally.
<P>
	"The laboratory is extremely pleased with this opportunity to partner with EURUS Technologies. Their emerging product line holds tremendous promise for addressing many near-term and future needs for the NHMFL and beyond. In particular, the high-capacity cryogenic current lead systems, on which we will work closely together, should have a very prompt impact on emerging technologies. We expect to obtain significant heat-load reductions vs. conventional systems through the use of HTS materials while retaining safety levels that are essential when mating them to large magnet systems with extremely high levels of stored energy. For example, such leads will be critical to the efficient operation of superconducting magnet systems designed for electrical energy storage and management, magnetic separation, and medical applications such as MRIs," stated John Miller, head of the Large Superconducting Magnet Systems Group at the NHMFL.

Tallahassee, FL
<P>

The W. M. Keck Foundation of Los Angeles, California, awarded $600,000 to Florida State University and the University of Florida for a state-of-the-art, high-field, resistive magnet system that will be designed, built, tested, and used at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee. The grant was authored by a scientific team led by Alan G. Marshall (Florida State University) and Neil Sullivan (University of Florida). In response to the notification, NHMFL Director Jack Crow said, We are extremely pleased to have this opportunity to work with the Keck Foundation, an organization with a reputation for supporting extraordinary research at the frontiers of science.
<P>
	The Keck grant will be split equally between the two universities and will be matched by over $1.5 million from the NHMFL, FSU, and UF. The new magnet development effort represents just the latest partnership undertaken by the institutions. Established in 1990, the NHMFL is a user facility supported by the National Science Foundation and the State of Florida and operated by FSU, UF, and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. The laboratory has scientific research facilities at all three sites. The NHMFL, which boasts numerous cooperative ventures with the private sector, captured for the United States the international leadership position for research in high magnetic fields by designing and building a series of uniquely powered magnets that have set world records in field strengths.
<P>
	The magnet system supported by the Keck grantfeaturing an innovatively-designed 25 tesla, high resolution, resistive magnetwill be equipped with new specialized instruments for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron magnetic resonance (EMR), and ion cyclotron resonance (ICR). These technologies are fundamental to understanding complex chemical mixtures (e.g., crude oil) and molecular structures (e.g., proteins). Until now, due to various technical limitations, NMR, EMR, and ICR research was generally conducted in superconducting magnet systems that could reach only about 17 tesla. Because of the NHMFLs unique infrastructure and the multi-disciplinary research and engineering design teams, the new magnet system will extend magnetic resonance research opportunities to 25 tesla.
<P>
	A tesla is a measure of magnetism, and one tesla is 20,000 times the earths magnetic field.  High magnetic fields are among the most important, effective, and non-invasive scientific tools to probe nature, and the higher the field the greater the opportunity for understanding and discovery. Research in high magnetic fields leads to improvements in basic and new materials that are critical to such modern technologies as semiconductors, high temperature superconductors, diagnostic imaging techniques, computers, polymers, transportation, environmental restoration, and energy storage.
<P>
	The W. M. Keck Foundation is one of the nations largest charitable organizations and focuses much of its support toward the fields of science, engineering, medicine, and higher education.

A Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) senior engineering student who conducted research at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) was recently awarded a prestigious National Science Foundation (NSF) Graduate Fellowship. The award to Kali-Nicole Hodge was based in part on her honors electrical engineering undergraduate thesis, "New Geometry for Quadrupole Ion Guides," performed at the NHMFL's National Center for Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR). She worked under the direction of her thesis adviser, Dr. Frank Gross (FAMU), with additional supervision by Drs. Yulin Huang (now at Northeastern University), Shenheng Guan, and Alan G. Marshall from the NHMFL and Florida State University (FSU).<P>
	The NHMFL is a national user laboratory supported by NSF and the State of Florida. It is operated by FSU, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, and has facilities at all three sites. Established and headquartered in Tallahassee in 1990, the NHMFL has quickly captured for the United States the international leadership position for research in high magnetic fields and the technological development of world record magnets. This research is fundamental to advances in technology and improvements in materials, such as semiconductors, high temperature superconductors, diagnostic imaging techniques, computers, polymers, transportation, environment restoration, and energy storage.<P>
	The laboratory also has extensive educational programs that address the nation's critical need to enhance science and math education at all levels. One example of the success of these efforts is Kali-Nicole Hodge, who worked in the laboratory's ICR program. Hodge was one of eleven undergraduates, including three from FAMU, who have participated in research efforts at the ICR Facility since its start-up in fall 1994. <P>

	Ion cyclotron resonance was invented in 1931 as a tool for high-energy physics, but became useful for chemistry in 1973 when ICR Program Director Marshall and co-inventor Melvin Comisarow showed how an improved technology, called Fourier transform ICR mass spectrometry, could detect, resolve, and identify thousands of molecules in complex mixtures, such as crude oil. For example, Guan, working in collaboration with Amoco, separated and identified for the first time dozens of sulfar-containing compounds out of thousands of chemicals. The method also can detect a single intact DNA and protein molecules, the building blocks of modern biotechnology. Research and development efforts continue at a fast pace in Tallahassee, as in February, 1996, scientists designed, constructed, and tested the world's highest-field mass spectrometer for ICR.<P>

<B><H2>NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION AWARDS  SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN RENEWAL OF NATIONAL HIGH MAGNETIC FIELD LABORATORY</H2></B>
<P>

Tallahassee, FL
<P>
 Today the National Science Board, the policy-making arm of the National Science Foundation (NSF), awarded a renewal grant of $87.5 million to the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) for the next 58 months.  The new support for the world's highest field and largest laboratory of its kind represents a significant increase of almost 50% from it initial grant of $66 million in 1991.
<P>
	"This federal award is a strong ratification of the extraordinary partnerships that were forged five years ago between the State of Florida, the NSF, Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory to advance science education and technology," stated Chancellor Charles Reed.  "The new funding represents strong support for the outstanding success the national magnet lab has already achieved and recognizes its enormous potential to advance the frontiers of magnet-related science and technology in the international arena." 
<P>
	During September of 1995, the NHMFL was peer-reviewed by a committee of experts from academia, other national laboratories, and industry.  Their report was unanimous in its praise for the new laboratory, "In a short period of time, the NHMFL has already become an internationally respected institution.  The scientific potential is enormous."
<P>
	"The NHMFL is extremely pleased and enthused with the strong vote of confidence  the NSF and the scientific community has given the laboratory with this new level of funding, especially in these very tight budgetary times," stated NHMFL Director Jack Crow.  "The NHMFL will be able to continue its pursuit of the best science  for the interests of users of the facility and the nation's scientific and technology communities.
<P>
	Just two weeks ago, the NHMFL set its third world record for continuous magnetic field produced by a resistive or electro-magnet when it attained 33 tesla (660,000 times earth's magnetic field).  Within a couple of hours of this achievement,  an in-house research group used the new magnet system to collect significant data on organic superconductors that had been undetectable at slightly lower fields.  With the use of a field concentrating technique, these experiments pushed the field limit for the study to 36.2 tesla.  The new magnet system surpasses the old record of 30 tesla set by the NHMFL in March 1995 and is the latest in a long line of innovative resistive magnet designed by the laboratory.
<P>
	The NHMFL is operated by a consortium of the University of Florida, Florida State University, and Los Alamos National Laboratory with user facilities in all three locations.  High magnetic fields are one of the most effective and non evasive scientific tools to probe nature and offers users from nearly all areas of science and engineering to explore basic and new materials critical to modern technology.  Some of these technologies include semiconductors, higher temperature superconductors that lose their resistance to electrical currents, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the human body, complex chemical and biological structures, and magnetic materials used in computers, VCRs and CD players.
<P>
	The NHMFL was awarded in 1990 to the Florida/Los Alamos consortium  in a peer review competition with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (M.I.T.).  Vice President Al Gore officially dedicated the NHMFL in October 1994.

 A reflectance probe for infrared spectroscopy has been built and
tested recently at NHMFL/FSU.  It has been proved to be a very useful
addition to the infrared instrumentation available to users of the 20 T
superconducting magnet at the NHMFL.  The sample temperature can be varied
from 2.2 K to 50 K.  The spectral range it covers is 20 to 3,000
wavenumbers.  This probe has a sample holder that can hold 4 samples (or 3
samples and 1 reference) at the same time.  The sample can be changed
without changing the field or temperature.
<P>        Four different kinds of samples (a high temperature superconductor,
a heavy fermion system, a spin Peierls system, and heavily doped
semiconductors) have been studied during the first few weeks of the probe's
use.  A noise level better than 1% of the signal can be reached easily in
the low frequency range (below 200 wavenumbers).

The highest DC field ever attained by a resistive magnet is 33.1+/- 0.2 T
and was attained around 5:00 pm EST Monday 5 Feb. 1996 in resistive magnet
cell 12 of the NHMFL.  This new magnet uses the high strength, high
conductivity CuAg alloy developed at the National Research Institute for
Metals in Tsukuba, Japan for the innermost coil.  This is also the first
attempt at the NHMFL of building a poly-Bitter magnet.
<P>
Bruce Brandt et al. have fabricated Dysprosium pole pieces for this magnet
and will be using them to concentrate the flux an additional 3T later
today.
<P>
The field was measured with a Hall probe up to 30 T and extrapolated in the
current thereafter.  NMR measurements will be performed in the near future.
<P>
Any persons interested in using the new magnet should contact Bruce Brandt
or Merry Ann Johnson.
<P>
We would like thank all the operations personnel for their assistance in
testing the magnets as well as the facilities personnel for their
assistance in testing the power supplies and the fiscal personnel for
assisting in the ordering process.

<P>
<B><H3><i>May 4, 1995</i></H3></B>  
<P>
<H4>
Tallahassee, FL 
<P>
The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) once again takes center stage in
the world of magnetic-related research when it hosts the Second Physical Phenomena at
High Magnetic Fields Conference (PPHMF-II) from May 6-9. Over 170 leading scientists
and researchers from Germany, France, Switzerland, Sweden, Japan, Australia, Russia, and
the United States will gather in Tallahassee to assess ongoing research, new directions for
science and technology, and the uses of high magnetic fields in basic and applied research.
NHMFL hosted the first such conference in 1991. 
<P>
Scientists will begin gathering this weekend at the Gus Turnbull Center at Florida State
University. The directors of the world's other major high magnetic field laboratories,
located in France, Japan, and the Netherlands, will be attending. Conference proceedings
begin at 8:30 Saturday morning, May 6, and conclude on Tuesday, May 9, at noon. 
<P>
Among the leading presenters will be Dr. Klaus von Klitzing of the Max Planck Institute
for Solid State Research in Stuttgart, Germany, who won the 1985 Nobel Prize for Physics.
His award-winning discoveries made it possible to probe the conductive properties of
electronic components with extraordinary precision. His experiments were performed in a
magnetic field up to 20 tesla at the High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Grenoble, France.
This magnetic field is roughly 400,000 times stronger than that of the earth's surface
magnetism. 
<P>
The NHMFL's 20 tesla magnets are nearly identical to the magnet system used by Dr. von
Klitzing. Since its establishment in 1990, the NHMFL has set new world records for
magnetic field strengths not once but twice. Using new design applications, the
laboratory in Tallahassee built a world record 27 tesla magnet in June 1994 and eclipsed its
own record in March 1995 with another powered magnet that reached 30 tesla. This
water-cooled copper-alloy magnet system yields a magnetic field approximately 600,000
times the earths magnetic field-the largest continuous magnetic field produced by any
resistive magnet. Since March, the NHMFL has commissioned a second 30 tesla magnet
and expects to produce a 33 tesla magnet by the end of the year. 
<P>
The NHMFL Science Program, directed by Chief Scientist and Nobel Laureate Robert
Schrieffer, is hosting the conference. Overviews and discussions will focus on various
areas of research, including semiconductors, the quantum Hall effect, heavy fermions,
superconductivity, organic solids, and chemical systems. Dr. Neil Sullivan, who directs the
NHMFL site in Gainesville and chairs the University of Florida Physics Department, will
speak on "NMR Studies of Quantum Solids at High Magnetic Fields and Low
Temperatures." 
<P>
The NHMFL is a consortium supported by the National Science Foundation and the State
of Florida. This new laboratory, with sites in Tallahassee, Gainesville, and Los Alamos,
NM, offers users from nearly all areas of science and engineering-biology, bio-medical,
bio-engineering, chemistry, geology, materials science, and physics-expanded
opportunities to explore basic and new materials critical to modern technology. Included
among them are new low-dimensional semiconductors, superconductors that lose their
resistance to electrical currents at low temperature, and magnetic resonance, which
supports research in chemical and biological structures, pharmaceuticals, and
environmental areas.

<P>
The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) produced 30 tesla in a water-cooled copper alloy magnet on March 18, 1995, in the laboratory facilities in Tallahassee, FL.  This new magnet system produces a magnetic field approximately 600,000 times the earth's magnetic field and is the largest continuous magnetic field produced by a resistive magnet.  The announcement came at a Users Group meeting held in conjunction with the 1995 American Physical Society March Meeting in San Jose, CA.
<P>
	This new magnet system surpasses the world record magnetic field strength of 27 tesla for a resistive magnet attained by the NHMFL in June 1994.  It incorporates several entirely new features, including a new concept of cooling to cope with the extremely high power density (12 W per mm3) and the stresses due to the Lorentz force (800 MPa).  Other unique features of this magnet are its compact construction, easy access, user friendliness, and its extremely low vibration and noise levels.
<P>
	NHMFL is operated by Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory and is supported by the National Science Foundation and State of Florida. The laboratory's main facilities are located in Tallahassee, FL, with other sites in Gainesville, FL, and Los Alamos, NM.  This laboratory is the newest national laboratory and was dedicated by Vice President Al Gore along with representatives from the National Science Foundation, the State of Florida, and others on October 1, 1994.
<P>
	The laboratory has been charged by the National Science Foundation to develop and maintain facilities open to qualified researchers in support of magnet-related research in all areas of science and engineering.  Because of the unique aspects of this 30 tesla magnet, researchers will have greater opportunities to explore new materials critical to many highly visible areas, including, new low-dimensional semiconductors, superconductors that lose their resistance to electrical currents at low temperature, and magnetic resonance, that support research in chemical and biological structures, pharmaceuticals, and environmental areas.
<P>
	This new magnet is a milestone since it will provide user friendly access to an extremely high magnetic field that had been available only in a hybrid magnet. Hybrid magnets, composed of a superconducting magnet and a resistive insert, do not provide the flexibility of operation and responsiveness to researcher needs that will be available with this new magnet.
<P>
	The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is developing additional, unique high magnetic field research facilities to support the needs of institutional and private sector users.

<P>
 Members of the prestigious American Physical Society recently elected Dr. J. Robert Schrieffer as its Vice President.  Dr. Schrieffer will assume the presidency in 1996 of the major organization for physicists in the United States and a significant force in physics internationally.
<P>
	The nearly century old American Physical Society has a membership of 43,000 scientists worldwide from academia, industry and government laboratories.  The American Physical Society advances the knowledge of physics through the publishing of influential physics journals and organizing scientific meetings that facilitate the exchange of basic physics research.  The Society also sponsors prizes and awards recognizing distinguished achievements in physics and develops outreach programs in education.
<P>
	Dr. Schrieffer was the first faculty appointment to the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in April 1991, and he has a joint appointment at Florida State University and the University of Florida as University Professor and Chief Scientist.  Dr. Schrieffer shared the 1972 Nobel Prize in physics for the first successful theory of superconductivity, the phenomenon of zero electrical resistance in certain materials, primarily at low temperatures.  In 1957, when he was 26, he published the work for which he was later awarded the Nobel prize in the American Physical Society's Physical Review. 
<P>
	  Dr. Schrieffer earned his bachelor's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his master's and doctoral degrees from the University of Illinois.  In addition to his Nobel prize, he has also been awarded the National Medal of Science and the Oliver E. Buckley Solid State Physics Prize.

<P> </B>The National Science Board, the policy-making arm of the National Science Foundation (NSF), 
awarded a renewal grant of $87.5 million to the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) for the next 
58 months. The new support for the world's highest field and largest laboratory of its kind represents almost 
a fifty percent increase from its initial grant of $66 million in 1991. The announcement came after nearly 
a year of site reviews and proposal evaluations and was especially good news in light of ongoing 
federal budgetary complications.

<P>     &quot;This federal award ratifies the extraordinary partnerships that were forged five years ago between 
the State of Florida, the NSF, Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos 
National Laboratory to advance science education and technology,&quot; stated Florida State University System 
Chancellor Charles Reed. &quot;The new funding represents strong support for the outstanding success the national 
magnet lab has achieved already and recognizes its enormous potential to advance the frontiers of 
magnet-related science and technology in the international arena.&quot;
<P>
<P>     During September of 1995, the NHMFL was peer-reviewed by a committee of experts from academia, other 
national laboratories, and industry. Their report was unanimous in its praise for the new laboratory: &quot;In a short period of time, the 
NHMFL already has become an internationally respected institution. The scientific potential is enormous.&quot;
<P>
<P>     NHMFL Director Jack Crow was extremely pleased by the strong vote of confidence given to the laboratory by NSF and 
the science community. Speaking on behalf of everyone at the laboratory, Dr. Crow said that with the new level of funding, 
&quot;the NHMFL will be able to continue its pursuit of the best science and engineering for the interests of users of the facility and 
the nation's scientific and technology communities.&quot;

<img src="bt.gif">
<P>
<P>     The Ultra-High B/T facility is being developed at the University of Florida as a user facility 
in collaboration with the university's Microkelvin Laboratory. The purpose of the facility is to meet the 
needs of users for studying new phenomena that require the existence of high spin polarizations or high 
initial magnetizations and thus a high ratio of B/T of applied field to temperature.
<P>
<P>     The facility consists of a complex double magnet system: an upper stage superconducting magnet for 
a nuclear demagnetization refrigerator using the enhanced nuclear magnet 
PrNi5 to cool samples to at least 500 microkelvin (or lower depending on the heat load), and a sample stage consisting of a 20 
tesla superconducting magnet of moderate homogeneity (100 ppm over a 1 cm DSV). This system will allow 
one to carry out experiments simultaneously at high fields and low temperatures for a B/T of at least 4.0 x 
104 T/K, which will be the highest available anywhere for high cooling capacities (1 nanowatt at 500 
microkelvin). (The Los Alamos pulsed facility can provide 50 T at 25 mK for time durations of the
<P>order of milliseconds (B/T = 2.0 x 103 T/K). The two magnets are separated by a carefully 
designed compensation coil to maintain the field constant in the sample space during demagnetization. 
<P>The complete facility is housed in a specially designed ultra-quiet environment of the Microkelvin Research Laboratory. 
The refrigerator and experimental recording area is completely enclosed in a tempest quality radiofrequency shielded room 
(better than 120 dB isolation from 100 kHz to 1 GHz), and the refrigerator is supported by a specially designed support system, 
with dynamic pneumatic mounts sitting on concrete piers that are mechanically isolated from the building.
<P>
<P>     The precooling dilution refrigerator has been assembled and tested, and the 
PrNi5 nuclear refrigerator has been completed together with the experimental mounting stations (see photo page 1. with Drs. Xia and Adams). We are now waiting for 
completion of the magnet system at Cryomagnetics, Inc., who plan to test the magnet system this month. After commissioning of the 
system this summer, we plan to be open for users in the fall of this year. Potential users should contact Dr. J.S. Xia 
(352-392-0484, <I>jsxia@phys.ufl.edu</I>), who will be responsible for users operations at the facility for the NHMFL.
<P>
<P>     A number of experiments have been considered by users, both internal and external to NHMFL, and these include studies 
of: (1) the electrical and thermal transport in quantum heterostructures at low temperatures and high fields, (2) 
new quantum magneto-kinetic transport in highly polarized fermi liquids such as dilute liquid 
3He-4He mixtures, (3) tests of the scaling properties of non-fermi liquids, the studies of the nuclear spin dynamics in highly polarized HD and 
D2 which is important for feasibility studies of potential targets for inertially confined fusion, (4) exploration of the 
spin and charge correlations in highly correlated electronic systems using high field NMR techniques, and (5) the 
high-field behavior of superfluid 3He and solid 3He.

<h2><P><I>Driving Magnet Science and Technology Into the 21st Century</B></h2></I>
<P>
<P>     The decision has been made: The National Science Foundation has renewed our contract through 
the year 2001 with a healthy increase over the commitment for the first five years (see cover story). 
Their recognition of our early successes, along with their support and confidence for our planned activities 
is enormously gratifying. A quote from the NSF 1997 Budget Request for National Facilities and 
Instrumentation further encourages us:
<P>
<P><I>Emphasis will be placed on selected national facilities as well as major equipment development 
for shared multidisciplinary use. Particular attention will be given to high magnetic field research 
and technology at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory at Florida State University, a 
laboratory with unsurpassed magnet capability that enables experiments that will greatly advance 
knowledge in physics, chemistry, materials science, and biology. The future expectations of this research is 
that it will lead to important technology applications such as new devices for the computer 
industry, new materials with exceptional strengths, and major advances in medicine.</I>
<P>
<P>     So how do we ensure that we continue to exceed all expectations for the magnet laboratory and 
maximize the exciting science and technology opportunities at hand? Certainly we must not rest on our laurels. 
The key will be to expand our collaborative efforts with private industry, with federal and state agencies, 
and with other magnet laboratories. Much of the groundwork for new initiatives was laid in the first five 
years. For example, in his article on technology transfer on pages 8&#173;9, Jim Ferner, our Director of Facilities 
and Administration, discusses the NHMFL's participation in the Gulf Coast Alliance for Technology 
Transfer (GCATT). GCATT was formed in 1992 for the purpose of fostering the climate for technology transfer 
and enhancing industrial and economic development by transferring member technologies to the private 
sector. Night vision devices, automated robotic heavy equipment, and licensing of low frequency noise 
attenuation material are a few of GCATT's early success stories.
<P>
<P>     Partnerships with ABB Industrial Systems, Alpha Scientific Electronics, Intermagnetics 
General Corporation, Gibson Tube Company, PCM Products, Inc., Cryomagnetics, and others have been 
economically viable and successful relationships for the partners 
<I>and</I> for the users of the NHMFL. The 
international collaboration with the National Research Institute for Metals (NRIM) in Tsukuba, Japanwhich helped 
us produce the new world record 33.6 tesla resistive magnet reported in the Winter Issue of 
<I>NHMFL Reports </I>and updated in this issue (page 13) exemplifies how cooperative ventures can achieve significant 
new advances in magnet-related science and technology and open new research opportunities for the users.
<P>
<P>     Proud as we are of these established partnerships, we are committed to establishing new initiatives 
that will enhance U.S. competitiveness and drive magnet-related technology into new directions. We 
believe that there are many untapped opportunities, particularly in the areas of magnetic resonance, 
magnet manufacturing, magnet-related instrumentation, materials processing in magnetic fields, and electric 
power storage. Future <I>NHMFL Reports </I>will include a series of articles focusing on the technological 
opportunities ahead. Many of these were very nicely summarized in the papers presented at the International 
Workshop on High Magnetic Fields: Industry, Materials and Technology, held in February, 1996, at the NHMFL 
and co-hosted by the NHMFL and NRIM (see page 6).
<P>
<P>     If you would like further information, please contact me or any of the program directors of the 
laboratory. I would encourage you to do one more thing:  
<I>Speak out for science and basic research in 
America.</I> Steven Schiff, chairman of the U.S. House Subcommittee on Basic Research, recently remarked, &quot;The 
science community is going to have to make its voice heard if it is going to be treated fairly.&quot; Dr. Robert 
Schrieffer, NHMFL Chief Scientist and President of the American Physical Society, has similarly urged your 
activism. It is imperative that all of us do our part to inform and educate the public and the policymakers about 
the value of science and technology, and the need to support fundamental research. Policymakers at local, 
state, and federal levels will not respond to unheard voices. The users and industrial partners of the NHMFL 
must play a more proactive role in shaping the scientific and technological future of the United States.

<img src="bob.gif"><I><H2>Building the NHMFL's Interdisciplinary Science Program</H2></I></B>

<P>     While attending several meetings recently, the question arose &quot;<i>How is the Magnet Lab doing?&quot;</i> 
No doubt this same question has been asked of many members of the NHMFL family. It is hard to resist 
the temptation of reciting our great successes in beating the world's record again and again in strength 
of magnetic field versus bore size, field to temperature ratio, field and pressure, etc. Also, the recent 
NSF renewal of the five-year NHMFL grant at a level nearly fifty percent higher than that in the first five 
years is a dramatic recognition of the success and potential of the laboratory.
<P>
<P>     While many scientists are aware of several of the outstanding NHMFL appointments to the faculty 
and staff in their own areas of research, they are largely unaware of the breadth of the science and 
technology programs in the laboratory. In essence, the word is out that great things are underway as evidenced by 
a sharp increase in the number of inquiries from potential users and visitors wishing to collaborate with 
the research staff. This is an exciting time for science at our unique center, and we have a singular 
opportunity to build one of the world's most outstanding research facilities based on this initial remarkable level 
of success.
<P>
<P>     As we know, building a world's leading magnet science and technology program has much in 
common with the challenges involved in building a corresponding science program. Attracting highly creative 
engineers and scientists and providing the right environment is a difficult task in both cases. Clearly, we have 
succeeded beyond the expectation of even our most ardent supporters in this regard. Nevertheless, there is an 
added complexity in constructing a science program, partly because of the technical expertise required in 
each subfield, which acts as a barrier to communication, and ultimately to cross fertilization among these 
areas of research.
<P>
<P>     The management of science is a notoriously risky venture. A large degree of scholarly freedom 
to pursue the forefronts of science is generally found to be the most productive approach. Most scientists 
will acknowledge, however, that without the stimulation of respected colleagues, science begins to dry up 
and important opportunities are missed. How are we to balance in our very busy professional lives the need 
to move forward on specific scientific projects, yet benefit from and in turn contribute to building a 
vibrant intellectual community involving in-house and user scientists? Also, coupling to the magnet science 
and technology group is crucial. While many new ideas are being formulated to construct unique 
additional facilities, e.g., the 100 T long pulse facility and large gradient field configurations, the opportunities 
lying ahead are likely to be even more exciting if we pursue our dreams together.
<P>
<P>     As I have written earlier, a strong positive force in unifying science in the NHMFL is the 
Science Program Committee, chaired by John Graybeal, Director of Science. Through the careful planning of 
the NHMFL's Executive Committee and Directorate, substantial resources will be devoted to developing 
novel in-house initiatives across the scientific disciplines in the NHMFL. Hopefully, those projects will 
help develop new collaborations between the three sites of the laboratory as well as attract new users to 
join these activities. The support of younger staff members, allowing them to venture into new directions is 
also important. Of great importance is the excellence of the research, with potential for future external 
funding being a key issue.
<P>
<P>     Another activity to which we must devote our energy is that of communicating the fundamentals of 
our areas of specialization across disciplinary boundaries, the beginning of which was carried on through 
a series of &quot;show and tell&quot; brown bag lunches last year. Several suggestions have been received 
concerning the format of another series along these lines.
<P>
<P>     Equally important is the establishment of a sequence of courses that discuss in depth magnetic 
phenomena and technology from a number of vantage points. No doubt courses can be woven into a sequence 
suitable for many of our students. Written material might also emerge from these courses, strengthening the 
community service of the NHMFL.
<P>
<P>     If you have some reaction to the above and/or further ideas in this regard, I would be pleased to 
hear from our readers and begin a dialogue.

<P><B>&#183;</B>     <B><I>Geoffrey 
Bodenhausen</B></I> (NMR), <B><I>Naresh 
Dalah</B></I> (EMR), and <B><I>Alan 
Marshall</B></I> (ICR) have been appointed to the editorial board of the 
<I>Journal of Magnetic Resonance</I>the premier journal in its field. This honor and 
recognition is further evidence that the NHMFL's Center for Interdisciplinary Magnetic Resonance (CIMAR) has 
quickly become a top international center for spectroscopic research involving magnets (see related recognition for 
Krzystek and Brunel).
<P>
<P><B>&#183;     <I>Nick Bonesteel</B></I>, Condensed Matter/Theory and FSU assistant professor of physics, received the prestigious 
Sloan Research Fellowship from the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation. The fellowship carries a grant of $35,000. FSU 
Physics Chair Joseph Owens said of the award: &quot;It is another clear indicator that world-class science is being done by 
the faculty and research staff at the FSU physics department and the magnet lab.&quot;
<P>
<P><B>&#183;     <I>Russ Bowers </B></I>at UF was one of only four experimental physical chemists (out of seventeen) to win an NSF 
Career Award. The award is for $75,000 for four years, plus $50,000 for equipment. According to UF Physics 
Dept. Chair and NHMFL Co-Principal Investigator Dr. Neil Sullivan, &quot;This award is particularly noteworthy because 
it falls in the interdisciplinary area of physics and chemistry.&quot;
<P>
<P><B>&#183;</B>     <B><I>Vladimir 
Dobrosavljevic,</B></I> (Condensed Matter/Theory and FSU assistant professor of physics) and 
<B><I>Yang Wang</B></I> (Isotope Geochemistry and FSU assistant professor of geochemistry) won FSU First-Year Professor 
Awards. These awards (two of only twenty-two given university-wide) provide beginning faculty the opportunity to 
devote their first summer of employment at FSU on initiating research.
<P>
<P><B><I>&#183;     Jurek Krzystek</B></I> (EMR) and 
<B><I>Louis-Claude Brunel </B></I>(EMR) have been invited to present their recent results on 
high field electron paramagnetic resonance at the Third International Conference on Millimeter and 
Submillimeter Waves Spectroscopy, to be held August 4&#173;9 in Denver, Colorado. The spectrometer used in their research 
has been operational for only five months (see <I>NHMFL 
Reports</I>, Winter 1996), but this honor confirms that the 
next generation of high field EPR spectrometers is currently under development at the NHMFL. The paper to 
be presented is entitled, &quot;Millimeter and Submillimeter Wave EPR&quot; by J. Krzystek, L. Pardi, A. Hassan, and 
L.C. Brunel.
<P>
<P>     On another high note, Brunel, who heads the EMR Program of CIMAR at the NHMFL has been invited to 
serve on the Executive Committee of the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory.
<P>
<P><B>&#183;</B>     <B><I>Justin Schwartz</B></I> (Magnet Science and Technology and FSU associate professor of mechanical engineering) 
and <B><I>Tim Moerland</B></I> (CIMAR and FSU associate professor of biology) won two of only five Developing 
Scholar Awards for 1996 given by FSU. At the award ceremony on April 8, FSU President Sandy D'Alemberte 
praised the awardees for their &quot;exceptional promise.&quot; He also noted the enormous growth in contract activity at

<P>
<img src="ed.gif">
<P>
<P>     The faculty and staff of the NHMFL take their responsibility to enhance science, math, and 
engineering education very seriously. As a national laboratory, we have outstanding facilities and resources that may 
be shared in unique ways to expand access to laboratory equipment and educational resources, to 
broaden teacher and classroom education, and to improve overall science and technology literacy in the 
United States. Some of the education programs, which range from K-12 through graduate school, have been 
featured in <I>NHMFL Reports</I>, and we are pleased to report several recent successes:
<P>
<P>&#183;     One project featured in the &quot;Middle School Students Present Results of Semester Research&quot; article 
in the last issue of <I>NHMFL Reports</I> was selected at the regional science fair for further competition at 
the state level.
<P>&#183;     Applications for the NHMFL Summer Minority Internship Program (for undergraduate students) 
doubled this year and came from fifteen states.
<P>&#183;     An undergraduate researcher from Florida A&amp;M University who worked in the NHMFL's 
National Center for Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectroscopy won an NSF Graduate Fellowship (see above).
<P>
<P>     A recent addition to the NHMFL's K-12 educational efforts are our Outreach Programs. These 
currently consist of large group presentations and small group hands-on lessons conducted at the schools. Each 
program is designed to excite and educate students about science and related concepts and is 
tailored to the various age groups and audiences. The programs have been designed by award winning educators and are 
conducted by NHMFL staff specially trained and selected for these presentations. In the first three months of 1996, 
we reached over 1,400 students. Current programs include:
<P>&#183;<I>     What Does a Scientist Do?</I> (grades K-5)
<P>&#183;<I>     Magnets - What's the Attraction?  
</I>(grades 4-8)
<P>&#183;<I>     Moving with Magnets</I>   (grades 4-12)
<P>&#183;<I>     Magnets and My World</I> (grades K-3)
<P>&#183;<I>     Magnets and the Environment</I>   (grades 2-7)
<P>&#183;     <I>What's a Matter?  Molecules, Resistance, and 
Superconductivity</I><B>  </B>(grades 7-9).
<P>
<P>     Another initiative is the NHMFL's STAR TREE (Science Teachers And Researchers Translating 
Research Experiences into Educational materials) Program, which is supported by the Florida Department of 
Education. STAR TREE brings together teams of outstanding middle school science teachers from northern 
Florida, university educators, and research scientists to design and develop curriculum materials for middle 
school students.
<P>
<P>     The first summer session of STAR TREE will convene in Tallahassee on June 17 and end July 
26. During the first part of the session, teachers will  learn about the NHMFL and the research that is 
being conducted and planned. The teachers will work alongside leading NHMFL faculty in magnet-related 
sciences gaining insight into their research and the process of magnetic field science and materials development.
<P>
<P>     The second phase will be devoted to curriculum development, a goal of which will be to translate 
the laboratory's ongoing research and development efforts for middle school students. The STAR TREE 
teachers will have access to the new multimedia development and teacher resource laboratory of the NHMFL.
<P>
<P>     Another related outreach effort is the NHMFL's course on 
<I>Magnetic Fields in Science and Technology</I>, which is offered as part of NSF's 1996 National Chautauqua Short Course Program (see page 7). 
Through these programs and many others, the NHMFL is communicating new ways to teachand 
learnscience, math, and engineering.

<P>
<P>&#183;     Need for development of materials with improved performance to respond to emerging 
technological needs
<P>
<P>&#183;     Role and impact of research institutions such as the NHMFL in encouraging the synergy of these areas.
<P>
<P>     Invited speakers presented overviews and critical assessments of their specific areas of 
expertise, including:
<P>
<P>&#183;     Technologies that impact present and future industrial applications such as energy storage, 
particle accelerators, fusion, separation, materials processing, suspension and levitation, and NMR imaging 
for materials science
<P>
<P>&#183;     Magnet materials for technological needs such as oxide and metallic superconductors, insulation 
and structural materials, high-strength/low-resistivity conductors, and permanent magnets
<P>
<P>&#183;     Magnet and cryomagnetic technologies with the focus on high field systems and design challenges 
for the future (resistive, pulsed, superconducting, hybrid magnets) and modern cryogenic techniques 
such as cryocoolers and pulse tubes.

return to the State of Florida for its investment in the NHMFL facilities by attracting industries with interests 
in magnet-related technology. Now that the laboratory facilities are complete and the in-house research 
programs are fast becoming fully established, we are increasing our emphasis on promoting technology transfer 
and regional economic development.

<P>     We set the stage for technology transfer early by becoming one of the founders of the Gulf 
Coast Alliance for Technology Transfer (GCATT), a voluntary cooperative organization of federal 
laboratories and colleges and universities founded in 1992. There are ten federal laboratoriesAir Force 
Development Test Center, Air Force Civil Engineering Support Agency, Army Aeromedical Research Laboratory, 
Armstrong Laboratory (Environmental Quality), EPA Environmental Research Laboratory, Naval Aerospace 
Medical Research Laboratory, Naval Coastal Systems Station, Navy Education and Training, Wright 
Laboratory Armament Directorate, and Wright Laboratory Air Base Systems Branch; four universitiesFlorida 
State University (FSU), University of Florida (UF), University of West Florida (UWF), and Florida 
Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU); Okaloosa-Walton Community College, and the NHMFL. 
These organizations joined together to foster  technology transfer and to enhance industrial and 
economic development by transferring member technologies to the private sector. GCATT is affiliated with the 
Southern Technologies Application Center funded by NASA and operated by UF.

<P>     GCATT assists its members by evaluating their research activities, identifying marketable 
technologies, assessing commercialization and market potential, identifying potential industries and companies 
to commercialize the technology, and negotiating appropriate licensing agreements. GCATT has a number 
of potential technologies in its market portfolio ranging from unique test facilities in electromagnetic 
interference (EMI) and compatibility, night vision devices, automated robotic heavy equipment, and particle 
detection to multi-media software. One of the unique and successful transfers of technology was the licensing of 
low frequency acoustic noise attenuation material developed by the Navy Aerospace Medical Research Laboratory.

<P>     The NHMFL has been a leader in involving industry in its magnet development activities. 
Beginning with our four 10 MW high precision power supplieswhich were developed by ABB Industrial 
Systems, Alpha Scientific Electronics, and NHMFL staff memberswe have worked closely with industry to 
achieve our technological breakthroughs.

<P>     Development of the 45 T Hybrid magnet system, a partnership between the Francis Bitter 
Magnet Laboratory and the NHMFL, has been a broad-based cooperative development effort with industry. The 
key partnership has been with Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC) and Gibson Tube Company that 
has resulted in new facilities and techniques for producing long lengths of cable in conduit conductor 
(CICC) systems for NbTi and Nb3Sn CICCs. IGC is also a major partner in the winding of the 
Nb3Sn layer wound coils, including the insulation, heat treatment, and epoxy impregnation of the coils. Everson Electric 
is working with the NHMFL in the insulation and epoxy encapsulation of the NbTi double pancake 
coils. Everson Electric also was a major partner in the building of the 60 T long pulse magnet being installed 
at NHMFL Los Alamos (see <I>NHMFL Reports</I>, Winter 1996).

<P>     PCM Products, Inc., has worked closely with the NHMFL Resistive Magnet Group in developing 
the photo etching process for making Bitter magnet plates, which was a key factor in making the Florida 
Bitter
Plate design a practical option resulting in the record setting 33.6 T magnet.

<P>     IGC has entered into a cooperative research and development agreement with the NHMFL for the 
900 MHz nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) magnet program. We have a cooperative agreement 
with Cryomagnetics for the development of the magnets for the Ultra-High B/T Facility at UF. 
We have been working with instrument manufacturers in developing and testing scientific instruments, 
particularly cryogenic temperature measurements. Ongoing research with the UF's Materials Science and 
Engineering Department has resulted in new epoxies with very low viscosity and long shelf life that are needed 
for impregnation of large, tightly wound, magnet systems. We are currently finalizing an agreement with 
an industrial partner involving the development of high temperature superconducting (HTS) products.

<P>     Another very recent partnership has been established with Varian Instruments. The NHMFL has 
ordered a 400 MHz wide bore spectrometer, and Varian is providing an HTS probe system which the NHMFL 
will test as a beta site. The NMR group will explore a wide range of applications and evaluate the advantages 
in biomolecular research. The system will be open to outside users to enable them to determine whether 
it would be attractive for them to purchase similar HTS probes.

<P>     Of course, our first, most popular and successful commercialization is the various lines of 
NHMFL neckties produced by Stonehenge, Ltd.&#174; using Mike Davidson's photomicrographs of such things as 
vitamins, moon rocks, and ice cream as the pattern. This activity is expanding into other areas and has been 
an attention &quot;grabber&quot; that increases public awareness in science through its associations with art. Mike 
also has applied the technology to producing very high quality photographs of computer chips.
<P>
<P>     We are interested in building more private&#173;public sector partnerships by setting up cooperative 
research and development programs with industry in areas of magnet technology, HTS materials development 
and application, cryocooler development and applications, magnetic resonance instrument components and systems, 
magnetic levitation and electro-magnetic launch, magnetic materials separation, and superconducting energy storagejust to name 
a few areas of interest.
<P>
<P>     Regional economic development is also high on our list of priorities, and we are encouraging start-up companies 
as well as established firms to consider locating in the North Florida Region. Through our representation on the Board 
of Governors of Innovation Park (the university research park of FSU and FAMU), we are working with the FSU 
Research Foundation to develop additional building space at Innovation Park that will provide incubation facilities for new 
industry. In addition, we expect the new buildings to make space available for short-term lease so that industry might establish 
a presence near the NHMFL. We also are working closely with the city and county governments, the Regional 
Economic Development Commission, and the State Department of Commerce to develop facilities and assist industry in 
establishing facilities nearby.

<P>     How do we work with industry and how are intellectual property rights handled? There are several approaches:
<P>&#183;     <I>Cooperative Research and Development Agreements 
</I>generally involve joint activity on a program. Industry may 
provide in-kind resources leading to the development of a device that would be used in the NHMFL. The NHMFL provides 
the technology and know-how capabilities. In exchange for the contribution of resources, industry gets the rights 
to commercialize the NHMFL technology or know-how on favorable terms.
<P>&#183;     Under a <I>Sponsored Research 
Agreement</I>, industry funds the NHMFL activities directed to the stated problem. 
Industry generally ends up with the exclusive rights to commercialize the technology developed.
<P>&#183;     Finally, we can <I>license existing technology through our participating institutions for reasonable 
royalties</I>. Where technology is developed from activities funded by the NSF, ownership of the technology remains with the 
inventor's institution, subject to certain rights that the NSF retains due to federal law.

<P>     Industry is always welcome as a user of the NHMFL facilities for research or product testing. If the work is to 
remain proprietary (meaning the results are not to be published), fees equal to the cost of providing the research will be 
charged. The user always retains all rights to intellectual property.

<P>     We welcome inquiries from companies that are interested in the possibilities of cooperative research and 
development 
programs with the NHMFL.

<P><B><H2>HTS Conductor Development for High Resolution 25 T NMR Insert Magnets</B></H2>
<P>
<P>J&ouml;rg Ke&szlig;ler, NHMFL
<P>
<P>     In recent years the resolution of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems has steadily improved by increasing the 
field strength of the required magnets. Today at the NHMFL a 900 MHz wide bore system is being designed and represents the 
first step toward meeting our charge of producing high resolution NMR systems at and beyond 25 tesla (T). The heart of this 1.1 
GHz (25 T) NMR system will be a superconducting magnet with fields higher than 21 T at the inner coil, which is close to the limit 
of today's commercially available superconductors because at higher fields the superconducting current decreases drastically. 
To boost the magnet subsequently to higher fields, the innermost coil will be replaced by an insert coil made of a 
superconducting material with improved properties in fields up to 25 T. Such materials can be found in the high temperature 
superconductor (HTS) family.
<P>
<P>     High temperature superconductors are famous for their high critical temperature, but more important for NMR 
magnet design is their ability to carry large critical current densities at high fields and low temperature (Figure 1). In 
particular Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox, the material we are developing, has excellent superconducting properties at very high fields. At present, 31 T 
is the highest field in which they have been measured, and the ultimate field limits can only be estimated. This makes 
Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox and other high temperature superconductors unique for application in the highest field magnets.
<P>
<P>     Several methods have been developed to shape this brittle ceramic material into coil forms. The NHMFL is using 
the powder-in-tube process because it is relatively easy to upscale by increasing the dimensions of the starting billet. It also 
protects the superconductor from the environment by coating it with a metal sheath and improves the mechanical properties of the 
wire. Precursor powder is filled in a tube made of silver or silver alloy and by swaging and drawing the composite, it is 
mechanically deformed into a wire of about 1 mm diameter consisting of a powder core and a metal sheath (Figure 2). To achieve 
highest critical currents, a smooth interface between the silver and the filament after the cold working is essential. A heat treatment 
in oxygen with temperatures close to 900&#176;C is necessary to connect the grains of the powder. Silver is compatible with 
the superconductor and permeable to oxygen at the high annealing temperatures. A deviation of the annealing temperature of 
more than 1&#176;C from the optimized annealing temperature can degrade the critical current in the final coil.
<P>
<P>     A further improvement in current carrying capability is achieved by rolling the wire into a flat tape because this forces 
the plate-like shaped grains to grow textured to the tape surface. This avoids large-angle grain boundaries that act as weak links 
and reduce the critical current in the final conductor. Since thinner tapes lead to a better texture of the superconductor and the 
minimal thickness of a tape is limited by machine parameters and handling restrictions, the development of multifilament wires is 
a necessary improvement. Multifilament wire also has advantages for magnet design. Therefore a monocore wire of 
appropriate size is cut into pieces. These are restacked in a tube and then again swaged and drawn to wire that now contains many 
sub-wires (Figure 2 and Figure 3). By rolling this wire into a tape we can achieve smaller filament thicknesses.
<P>
<P>     The maximum critical current densities of our in-house tapes are comparable to those of other groups. In particular, 
new results on long lengths of conductor make us confident that the final goal is in reach.
<P>
<P>     The final amount of wire that is needed to build a 25 T magnet insert can be produced only on an industrial scale. 
Therefore close cooperation with industry is necessary and is being pursued.
<P>
<P>     The wire is only one system component of a high temperature superconductor coil. In addition, a new insulation 
technique is in development that is compatible with the heat treatment of the wire. Superconducting joints that allow the magnet to run 
in persistent mode show promising results. Other issues like stress and strain limitations, mechanical reinforcement, electrical 
and thermal stability, have to be addressed. As a result, several small insert test coils made of both industry conductor and 
in-house conductor are currently built at the NHMFL and are being investigated in background fields up to 20 T.

<P><B><I>Users' Group Meeting Follow-Up</B></I>

<P>     The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory Users' Group is open to anyone interested in research that 
requires high magnetic fields. Membership in this group is automatically granted to anyone who sends e-mail 
to <I>johnson@magnet.fsu.edu</I> and asks to be added to the list. Members receive the newsletter that you are now 
reading and other notices that the NHMFL or the National Science Foundation want addressed to the largest set of 
potential users. The group's annual meeting was held, as usual, from 6 to 8 PM on the Sunday evening before the start of 
the American Physical Society March Meeting, which this year was held in St. Louis, Missouri. About 120 curious 
users and potential users attended.
<P>
<P>     Jack Crow began the formal part of the program by reporting on the status of the NHMFL's funding and 
laying out the evolving vision for development of the lab's programs and facilities for the next five years. Larry 
Campbell and I reported on the new magnets, instruments, and experimental capabilities set up in the pulsed field and DC 
field facilities since March, 1995. We also noted that the total number of users' projects (DC, pulse, and magnetic 
resonance) increased from about 80 in 1994 to over 200 in 1995. Demand has increased to the point that waiting lists for 
some magnets and instruments are two months or longer.
<P>
<P>     Horst St&ouml;rmer, Chairman of the Users' Committee, initiated a discussion of ways for users to make their 
desires for new facilities, improved service, etc., known to the NHMFL via the Users' Committee. He said that he 
welcomed any message by e-mail, phone, or whatever from a user with a suggestion or complaint, and emphasized that he 
would keep the source confidential if desired (908-582-3380, 
<I>horst@physics.att.com</I>). The Users' Committee meets at 
least once per year to discuss NHMFL plans from the users' point of view and to make users' wishes known to the 
lab's management. The next meeting will be May 31 and June 1 at the NHMFL in Tallahassee. Various questionnaires 
and other more or less formal ways of seeking user opinions have been considered by the committee, but the 
conclusion has been to rely on the diversity of the Users' Committee and the informal communications already taking 
place among users, Users' Committee members, and laboratory staff. 
<P>
<P>     Horst called for nominations for three new members of the Users' Committee, to be submitted to the 
Users' Group for a vote this summer and to take office in January, 1997. Information on the work involved, the 
nomination and election process, and the names and research interests of the retiring committee members was sent to all 
members of the Users' Group recently by Mike Naughton, Users' Committee Secretary. Contact him 
at <I>NAUGHTON@ubvms.cc.buffalo.edu</I> if you did not receive the information.

<P>Director, Pulsed Field User Programs</B>
<P>
<P><B><I><a name="pulse">The NHMFL Long Pulse Magnet </A></B></I>
<P>
<P>     The pulsed field capabilities of NHMFL have been stretchedby a factor of 25. This occurred with the 
construction and successful testing in April of a high inductance magnet whose pulse shape is shown in the figure. It will find 
use in various types of magnetization and high temperature superconductor critical current measurements where 
the longer pulse gives advantages in equilibration, reduced heating, and, possibly, signal-to-noise ratios, while 
retaining the benefits of ramped field.
<P>
<P>     This research magnet provides the highest field with the longest pulse in the United States, but not in the 
world. That distinction belongs to the magnets of Prof. S. Askenazy of Toulouse, France, who has developed long 
pulse magnets for many years and who generously shared his experience with the NHMFL for this project.
<P>
<P>     Physically, the magnet weighs more than any of the Principal Investigators at this time308 pounds. It is 
wound of soft copper with a cross-section of 2.4 x 3.6 mm. The insulation is Imideze, chosen for high flexibility and 
high dielectric strength. Between all layers is a 0.05 mm wrap of glass fiber cloth, with 3 additional 0.5 mm layers of 
S2 glass fiber on the inner conductor layers to help reduce distortion during operation. There are 36 layers 
with approximately 51 turns per layer, for a total of 1849 turns. Surrounding the coil is a 50 mm thick reinforcing 
and protection shell of Nitronic 50 steel.
<P>
<P>     The team that constructed the magnet was headed by Paul Pernambuco-Wise and drew upon the talents of 
Paul Gilmore and Benny Lesch. The 1.1 MJ capacitor bank at Los Alamos required an upgrade to 1.5 MJ to effectively 
use the magnet. The testing and training was carried out over a period of several days by Dwight Rickel, who said, 
&quot;This was an exciting magnet to test.&quot; One difference a user immediately notices with this magnet is the sound of 
an adjacent equipment rack that is set rocking back and forth by the long pulse and strong fringe field.
<P>
<P>     Although calculations say the magnet should withstand fields of 42 T and possibly 45 T, its lifetime 
undoubtedly would be shortened (not to imply a one-pulse lifetime). Until more experience is obtained, the magnet will be 
operated no higher than 40 T, consistent with the prudence that becomes a user facility. Also, no tests to deliberate 
destruction were made because of the expense of construction and the desire to get a long pulse user magnet on-line at 
NHMFL-Los Alamos as soon as possible.

<P>     </B></I>As reported in the last issue of 
<I>NHMFL Reports</I>, the NHMFL set a third world record for the 
highest continuous magnetic field produced by a resistive magnet when it attained 33.1 tesla in a 32

was operated at 33.6 T.
<P>
<P>     This success was made possible in part by an important collaboration with the National Research 
Institute for Metals in Tsukuba, Japan, that resulted in a very advanced Cu alloy that was used as conductor 
material for the two innermost coils.

<P><B><I>NMR Research Extended to 30 Tesla at the NHMFL</B></I>
<P>
<P>W.G. Moulton, P.L. Kuhns, and A. Kleinhammes, NHMFL
<P>
<P>     Over the past 50 years, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) has proven to be a very valuable experimental technique 
in condensed matter physics research, complementing neutron diffraction, optical studies, specific heat, transport, and 
other microscopic and macroscopic measurements. Systems studied by NMR include new magnetic materials, metals, 
superconductors, low dimensional systems, highly correlated electron systems, semiconductors, and many others. The results of NMR research 
in condensed matter have been widely utilized in developing the theories of these systems. The magnets used in NMR work for 
the past two decades have been superconducting magnets, and, until now, have been confined to fields well below 20 tesla (T).
<P>
<P>     Recently, using high field resistive magnets, physicists at the NHMFL have extended condensed matter NMR research to 
30 Thigher than at any other laboratory in the world. This has opened an entirely new research regime in condensed 
matter physics that has attracted several groups of collaborators/users from the United States and Europe. The new 25 T, 10 
ppm, &quot;higher homogeneity Florida Bitter&quot; magnet (see 
<I>NHMFL Reports</I>, Summer 1995) has opened new doorways for the broad 
line NMR encountered in most condensed matter research. This work led to one invited paper and five contributed papers at 
the March 1996 Meeting of the American Physical Society. A few examples of some very recent NMR work beyond 20 T at 
the NHMFL follow.
<P>
<P>&#183;     The NMR technique played an important role in the early tests of the BCS theory of superconductivity. Since the 
development of the high temperature superconductivity in the cuprates, NMR experiments have played, and continue to play a crucial role 
in understanding these important systems, and the results are heavily utilized in the development of the theory of these 
materials. Important results include those on the interplay between magnetism, conductivity, and superconductivity; the role of oxygen 
and the dynamics of the oxygen atoms; the question of s or d wave superconductivity; the interesting fluxoid melting phase 
diagram; as well as many other valuable results. At the NHMFL, NMR experiments have been carried out in collaboration with 
W.P. Halperin and A.P. Reyes (Northwestern University); P.C. Hammel and J.A. Martindale (LANL); and C.H. Pennington 
(Ohio State), at fields to 30 T, to study the fluxoid phase diagram at more than twice the field of previous experiments, and to 
measure Knight shifts at fields up to 25 T where diamagnetic corrections are small. These latter experiments should throw new light on 
the s vs. d wave controversy.
<P>
<P>&#183;     We are also studying 7Li NMR in Li doped cuprates. The hole introduced by the Li, which substitutes for the Cu, is 
unlike most other dopants in that it is not mobile. These experiments over a range of fields, and particularly above 20 T, will help 
us understand how doping holes into the CuO2 plane destroys the antiferromagnetism and for dopants other than Li leads to 
metallic behavior and/or superconductivity. An example of the spin lattice relaxation time data is shown if Figure 1.
<P>
<P>     These studies have led to unexpected results. One is that the 
7Li line does not broaden on going through the 
antiferromagnetic transition, indicating that the hole either reduces the nearest neighbor Cu moment to a very small value, or that the 
nearest neighbor exchange is dramatically reduced. Another is the peak in 
1/T1 near 60 K, which we believe can be explained by 
a variable range hopping mechanism. Work is underway to test this model. We plan to extend this work into the more general 
area of highly correlated electron systems to include work in spin-ladders, Haldane gap systems, and giant magneto resistance.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Another area in which NMR in condensed matter systems has had a large impact is in semiconductor physics. In 
collaboration with C. R. Bowers (UF), we have used the unique fast sweep characteristics of the resistive magnets to study the NMR 
detected optical dynamic nuclear polarization efficiency in GaAs and InP as a function of field to beyond 20 T, with new and 
interesting results. Plans are underway to extend this work to the relatively new field of quantum well structures at high fields to 
investigate Landau levels. (See <I>NHMFL 
Reports</I>, Spring 1995.)
<P>
<P>&#183;     Yet another very interesting problem currently being studied, in collaboration with Jim Brooks and Sveinn Valfells of 
the NHMFL, is that of low dimensional systems. These organic conductors display a very rich phase diagram of charge 
density waves, spin density waves, metallic, semiconducting, and superconducting behavior. NMR experiments have played a 
crucial role in the current understanding of these materials, which is far from complete. None of the previous work has been carried 
out above 12 T, and work up to 25 T and above is important. High fields allow access to nuclei more tightly coupled to the 
conduction electrons than the previous proton NMR, and it allows NMR studies of previously inaccessible field induced phase 
transitions. Recent studies at the NHMFL of the 77Se NMR in 
(TMTSF)2PF6 have been carried out to 24.6 T, to investigate both the 
dynamic and static features of the spin density wave state. An example of the spectrum in the metallic state above the spin density 
wave transition is displayed in Figure 2, showing the splitting of the non-equivalent Se sites.
<!-- Generation of PM publication page 22 -->

<P>
<P>     The transition to the spin density wave state occurs at about 12 K where the line broadens to about 400 kHz and 
interesting new behavior of T1 is observed. Some previous data show a change of unknown origin in the spin density wave state near 3.5 
K, which has sparked considerable controversy. The 
T1 data, shown in Figure 3, shows a striking change near 3.5 K, and is 
currently being analyzed to determine the nature of the change. Also, a decrease in 
T1 by a factor of three in going from 16 T to 24 T 
has been observed, reinforcing the value of high field NMR in understanding the details of exotic magnetic systems.
<P>
<P>     Nuclear magnetic resonance continues to play a very significant role in the development of condensed matter physics 
and materials science. The extension to fields in excess of 25 T at the NHMFL opens exciting new regimes for NMR studies of a 
wide range of condensed matter physics that will play a key role in future research.

<font size=6><B>High Pressure Experiments at NHMFL-Experimental Considerations<VSPACE=20></font size=6></B>
<IMG SRC="/gifs/bluebar.gif"width=478 height=5 BORDER=0 HSPACE=00><br><br>
Here is a list of questions and comments that should help users have the best
chance for success with their high pressure experiments.  Each user should take
time to read over the list and respond to any that concern his/her particular
experiment.  Any additional comments are always welcomed.<p>
<p>
Please provide a list of citations (a review article would be ideal) of
literature that pertains to this research.  Please send any available optical
or electrical ambient and high pressure data for this sample or a similar
system.  These items and the samples should be sent to Stan Tozer at least two
months before the experiment is to be performed.<p>
<p>
For communications prior to your arrival, is email, phone, or FAX preferred?<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Sample Preparation and handling:</b><p>
The sample must be thinner than 40 um for optical work and 30 um for electrical
work.  Experiments above 20 GPa require even thinner samples.  Typically,
thinning the sample to these dimensions is done by cleaving or lapping.  The
lapping process entails mounting the sample(s) onto a brass chuck with a hot
wax.  The sample is then ground down to approximately 60 um using oil and
diamond impregnated plates.  The sample is further thinned and polished to the
final thickness and a 1/10 um finish using diamond paste.  In using this
mounting wax, the sample will be exposed to temperature between 150 and
200 C for a period of 3-10 minutes.  If this process will damage the
sample, a pine resin can be used in place of the wax.  Would the sample be
contaminated by direct contact with the brass plug, the wax or pine resin, the
diamond paste, or the lapping oil?  For semiconductors grown on GaAs
substrates, a final 10-20 second etch is done with a room temperature solution
of 0.5-1% Bromine in methanol to remove any residual damage from the lapping
process.  If there is a more appropriate etch, please specify the etchant, etch
rates at various temperatures, required time of exposure, temperature of bath
and stopper solution.  Samples 1 x 1 mm<sup>2</sup> in area will be required
for lapping.  Please send a sample at least four times this size.  Samples
taken from the edge of a wafer are not suitable for thinning.  Please state the
best method for cleaving or dicing the sample.<p>
<p>
Is the sample(s) susceptible to humidity or static charge?<p>
<p>
How fragile/soft/brittle is the sample?  Will sonicating the sample cause
damage?  Are there any special handling requirements?<p>
<p>
Please explain any hazardous properties associated with the sample.  Is it
toxic, flammable, radioactive, etc.?<p>
<p>
If the sample is radioactive<i>, please specify  the number of microcuries
.</i><p>
<p>
Please state the exact sample formula, buffer layers, and any substrate.
Please specify whether the sample is bulk, ceramic, single crystal, or thin
film.  If it is on a substrate, please scratch an "x" on the substrate side and
specify all means by which the substrate can be removed.<p>
<p>
Will any of the following chemicals or gases damage the sample?<p>
ethanol<p>
methanol<p>
methylene chloride<p>
ethylene chloride<p>
tetrachloride<p>
acetone<p>
isopropyl alcohol<p>
water (hot, cold, and steam)<p>
Toluene (GE varnish solvent)<p>
N,N-Dimethyacetamide  (used to dissolve conductive epoxy; requires boiling in
this solution at approximately 120 C for 15 minutes)<p>
N,N-Dimethyl Formamide<p>
formic acid<p>
nitric acid<p>
sulfuric acid<p>
hydrochloric acid<p>
butyl acetate<p>
Acetic Ester  (conductive paint solvent)<p>
Decyl Acetate  (conductive paint solvent)<p>
Octyl Acetate  (conductive paint solvent)<p>
Ethylene Glycol Mono Ethyl Ether Acetate  (conductive paint solvent)<p>
<p>
<p>
What maximum pressure is required for the experiment?  Is the sample
susceptible to strain or stress?  These answers will dictate the sample volume,
anvil tip size, and pressure fluid.   One of the following will be used as a
pressure fluid.  Which ones must not be used?  <p>
glycerin<p>
helium<p>
argon<p>
nitrogen<p>
xenon<p>
3M FC77<p>
3M FC70<p>
methanol:ethanol:water::16:3:1<p>
methanol:ethanol::4:1<p>
<p>
<p>
 <b>Specific questions/comments for optical work:</b><p>
Please specify the required excitation wavelength and maximum permissible laser
power density.<p>
<p>
Please indicate the ambient pressure signal level and wavelength as this
dictates the type of anvil to be used -- type I or II diamond or sapphire.<p>
<p>
Ruby is used as a pressure manometer.  Will any spectral features of the sample
be obscured by the ruby doublet?   The ambient pressure, room temperature
values of R1 and R2 are 694.2 and 692.8 nm, respectively, and the value of R1
is 693.4 at 4.2 K.  The lines shift 0.365 nm/GPa into the red at all
temperatures.  <i>Do you expect these lines to interfere with your experiments?
 We have some alternative ways to measure pressure.</i> <p>
<p>
Because the final injection point for the excitation source is 1.5 mm (the
typical thickness of a diamond) from the sample, the light emitted from the end
of a fiber optic spreads significantly and illuminates the entire sample and
any exposed substrate edges.  Collection of the sample signal is also not as
efficient as that obtained with a lens system.  Can a fiber optic be used to
bring the excitation and signal to and from the sample or will direct focusing
by lenses be required?  A lens system is far more time consuming to implement
and use.<p>
<p>
Will ambient pressure data be required?<p>
If so, can the fiber be directly attached to the sample with GE varnish (there
will be no varnish between the sample and fiber end)?  <i>If not, the sample
will be placed in a cup with a small gap between it and the fiber end.</i><p>
<p>
Is the sample isotropic?  If not, please supply a sketch showing the sample,
the required field direction, and the light path.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Specific questions/comments for electrical work:</b><p>
Please describe all the ways contacts have been made to this material and tell
which ones worked best.  For the described contacts, please list the ohmic
behavior and the Ohm-square cm achieved.  We typically perform a 30 to 60
second low energy argon sputter etch followed by sputtered contacts of gold
(1000&Aring;) defined by a metal mask to improve the contact resistance.  This
method will be used unless it will damage the sample.<p>
<p>
Contacts are sometimes made with indium or indium alloy solder or low
temperature cure epoxies.  What is the maximum temperature to which the sample
can be subjected and for what period of time?  Will an inert gas or vacuum
environment be required while the temperature is elevated?<p>
<p>
Contacts can sometimes be enhanced by passing 1 to 3 second pulses of 0.5 to 3
mA of current.  Will this damage the sample?<p>
<p>
How do you remove surface oxides from the sample?  How rapidly does the oxide
regenerate after exposure to air?<p>
<p>
Is the sample isotropic?  If not, please supply a sketch showing the sample
with its contacts and the required field direction.<p>
<p>
Is the sample photoconductive?  A fiber optic system without lenses is used to
bring 488 nm laser light to the ruby chip used for pressure calibration.  Will
this light affect the sample?  If so, how?<p>
<p>
One or more of the following epoxies/paints may be used in the sample prep.
Are there any problems with the resins or the metals used in them with regard
to this sample?<p>
3M #8 epoxy<p>
3M #9 epoxy<p>
3M #10 epoxy<p>
Epotek H20E<p>
Crest 4954<p>
3M DP 460<p>

<p>

between ambient and 70 C cause problems?:<p>

<b>Experiment Planning - Pressures, Fields, and Temperatures:</b><p>
The resistive magnets are scheduled in 3.5 hour shifts, four shifts per day,
with most users getting two shifts per day.  A typical magnet sweep from zero
to maximum field to zero takes about 6 to 20 minutes.  Users must take as much
data as possible while they have magnet time and plan on changing samples and
doing other time consuming preparation when their power is off.  The
superconducting magnets are scheduled by the week.  A magnet sweep from zero to
maximum field to zero takes about 45 minutes.  Superconducting magnets are
available 24 hours per day, but sample changes and other things that require
help from NHMFL staff members must be scheduled when the staff members are at
work.  The questions and information below will help users plan their
experiments realistically.<p>
<p>
What maximum pressure do you want?  <p>
What is the lowest pressure you want?  <p>
If ambient pressure data is required,  do you want to use the  small piece of
sample in the high pressure cell with no pressure fluid, or can you use a
different, larger piece?<p>
<p>
<i>Changing  and equilibration of the pressure takes 30 -90 minutes.  Warming
the sample from 1.2 K to room temperature, changing the pressure, and cooling
it to 4.2 K takes  2--3 hours.  Each magnet shift is 3.5 or 7 hours long.  You
can do between 4 and 15 pressure points in a week.  How many pressure points do
you want to do?  </i><p>
<p>
The pressure in the cell changes with temperature.  If there is a pressure
induced phase transition near the maximum pressure desired, the pressure can be
changed at the temperature of interest.  The risk associated with this
procedure is that the pressure may not be hydrostatic.<p>
<p>
Measurements can be done between 25 mK and 600 K.  Each temperature point takes
between 20 and 60 minutes, sometimes longer.  The time depends on the thermal
characteristics of the sample holder, how the temperature is controlled, and
the number and speed of magnet sweeps at each temperature.  <p>
Please list the temperature points to be used with each sample.<p>
 <p>
How much will the sample signal change with a 1% (10%) variation in
temperature?<p>
<p>
Does temperature cycling damage the sample?  Does a rapid temperature change
damage the sample?  If so, how fast do you want to change the sample
temperature?<p>
<p>
Will it be necessary to keep the sample cold/hot for several days once the
experiment has started?<p>
<p>
Do you want to cool (or heat) the sample very slowly with the magnetic field
on?  If so, please describe the process and tell how high the field must be.<p>
<p>
What is the maximum value of field (DC and pulse) that you need?<p>
<p>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Year five for the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL)-1995-was
an exciting year of transition, as the laboratory moved aggressively from
building and developing the world-class infrastructure to supporting vigorous
user and science programs. This year also completes the first funding cycle,
and a thoughtful renewal proposal describing our vision for the next five
years was submitted to the NSF and will be considered by the National Science
Board in early 1996. The next phase of the NHMFL will build upon the synergy
of three principal missions:  (1) activities in support of the users' needs
in broad areas of science and technology, (2) activities in close partnership
with the private sector that advance magnet technology and magnet materials
engineering, and (3) the development of an in-house science program that
uses the existing facilities for excellent research and enhances those facilities
on behalf of all users. The laboratory's outreach efforts in education,
international cooperation, and partnerships with industry span all three
areas and have been vigorously pursued during this year.<BR>
<BR>
	The laboratory marked its move from the construction phase to a science-driven
phase with numerous conferences and workshops. Most notable was the International
Conference on Physical Phenomena at High Magnetic Fields-II held in Tallahassee
on May 6-9. This conference was the second in a series of conferences focusing
on science areas where high magnetic fields play an important role. The
conference brought together approximately 300 experts to assess the current
status of such research and to identify promising new directions for science
and applications. The conference proceedings will be published by World
Scientific. Two workshops were held in conjunction with this conference:
one focused on research opportunities at and beyond 1000 tesla (T) and the
other was the first workshop on European-United States cooperation on magnet
and magnet materials technology for non-destructive 100 T capability. Later
in the year the NHMFL hosted five other major meetings including the Advanced
Materials for Pulsed Magnets-Cooperation with Industry Workshop held on
October 12-13, at Los Alamos; the annual meeting of the Southeastern Section
of the American Physical Society, November 9-11, Tallahassee; the Southeastern
Magnetic Resonance Conference, November 30-December 2, Tallahassee; a meeting
of the Hypersonic Magnet Levitation Group, December 12, Tallahassee; and
the Third International Symposium on Magnetic Suspension Technology, December
13-15, Tallahassee. The Southeastern Magnetic Resonance Conference was developed
initially around a regional focus but has grown into an important international
meeting: over 200 participants from around the world came to Tallahassee
for the conference.
<BR>
Not only are leading scientists, researchers, and engineers coming to the
NHMFL for conferences and meetings, they are coming-more importantly-to
use the facilities. In 1995, user groups doubled over the previous year
and fifty percent of the users were from the external community. The NHMFL's
in-house, interdisciplinary research groups, which bring together theory
and experimental efforts, have developed into an invaluable resource for
users of the facility. The laboratory sponsored numerous seminars during
the year, and presenters included both users and guests of the laboratory.
Partial support for external users is provided by the NHMFL Visitors Program
funded by the state of Florida. Within the NHMFL, the multi-institutional
program called the Center for Interdisciplinary Magnetic Resonance (CIMAR)
started users' programs that are supported by in-house scientists.<BR>
<BR>
<ul><B><I>Users' research activity has increased <BR>
significantly at the DC Field Facilities <BR>
in Tallahassee and the Pulsed Field <BR>
Facilities in Los Alamos.<BR></UL>
</UL>
<BR>

</I></B>
One of the great strengths of the NHMFL is the full integration of laboratory
programs across the three sites of the NHMFL at Gainesville, Los Alamos,
and Tallahassee. This inter-institutional cooperation has proven to be extremely
successful and has exceeded all expectations. During 1995, two new and unique
facilities were initiated that will expand future research opportunities
significantly. In Gainesville, construction was started on a new system
capable of generating temperatures as low as 500 microkelvin in a field
of 20 T. This new user facility will be completed early in 1996 and will
provide the highest B/T ratio in the world.<BR>
<BR>
The second initiative is the start of a design program that will lead to
the construction of a non-destructive pulsed magnet system capable of reaching
100 T with a pulse length of at least 20 ms above 50 T, i.e., more than
1,000 times longer than existing, destructive facilities. This impressive
and challenging project is jointly funded by the U.S. Department of Energy
and National Science Foundation, and is an outstanding example of the NHMFL's
quest to provide facilities in response to user needs. This effort, when
combined with a currently available dilution refrigerator and pressure cell
capabilities at Los Alamos, will provide unique science opportunities covering
the extremes in parameter space (100 T, 20 mK, 25 GPa), and is planned to
be available for the user community by 1998.  Other significant additions
to the NHMFL user facilities include:<BR>
<BR>
<UL>
<LI>The new 9.4 T Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) Mass Spectrometer significantly
enhances the mass resolution and trapping time over that which is available
with the roughly dozen 7 T ICR mass spectrometer systems located around
the world. Prior to the installation and commissioning of the 9.4 T system
at the NHMFL, the highest field available for mass spectroscopy was 7 T.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>The Pulsed Field Facilities at Los Alamos acquired a dilution refrigerator
for use in pulsed magnets. This added capability extends the range of temperatures
available to users down to 25 mK.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Several new nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) systems were installed
during 1995.  These included the 720 MHz high resolution NMR spectrometer
given to the laboratory by Oxford Instruments and Varian, and the 600 MHz
wide bore, high resolution NMR spectrometer that was procured from Bruker.
The 600 MHz wide bore is the first of its type in the world. At the end
of 1995, Magnex delivered and installed the 20 T (i.e., 850 MHz for proton
NMR) solid state NMR magnet that reached 19.4 T in preliminary tests. After
a minor reconfiguration, it is expected to achieve its design field of 20
T. These new instruments significantly enhance our capacity to respond to
the challenges and opportunities for high field NMR. In addition to the
superconducting NMR magnets, a new magnet was developed by the NHMFL's Magnet
Science and Technology Group-a 24.5 T high homogeneity resistive magnet.
The magnet has less than 20 ppm variation over 15 mm along the magnet axis
and temporal stability of 10 ppm. Efforts to further stabilize the magnet
and to improve its homogeneity are underway. Since its installation in July
1995, this magnet has been used extensively for NMR studies of high Tc superconductors
and quantum wells.
</UL>
<UL>
<LI>The 15-17 T high resolution Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) spectrometer,
which is the highest field, high resolution EMR system in the world, was
installed during the fall of 1995. Within a few days of installation, this
new spectrometer was used by several external research groups. This instrument
and the resistive magnets, including the 24 T with 20 ppm homogeneity powered
magnet, provide new research opportunities in EMR not available anywhere
else in the world.</UL><BR><BR>


<Ul><B>New instruments significantly <BR>
enhance our capacity to <BR>
respond to the challenges <BR>
and opportunities for high <BR>
field NMR.<BR></UL>
<BR>
	</B></B></I>This year, the Magnet Science and Technology Group added to the
successes of previous years. The world record 27 T powered magnet that was
commissioned in June of 1994 logged more than 1,100 operating hours before
being retired to build the 24.5 higher homogeneity magnet. This extraordinary
number of operating hours is more than double the typical operation time
for such magnet systems. The success of the 27 T magnets was eclipsed in
March 1995 by the commissioning of a 30 T magnet, which set a new world
record for powered magnets. The NHMFL is hopeful that the 30 T magnet will
be superseded by an even more impressive accomplishment of the 34 T powered
magnet that is nearing completion and should be operating in early 1996.<BR>
<BR>
	The NHMFL is adding significantly to the high resolution research capabilities
of the laboratory. The 1.1 GHz (25 T) high resolution NMR magnet program
got a boost from the establishment of a partnership between the NHMFL and
Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC) on the fabrication of the 900 MHz
(21.1 T) very wide bore, high resolution NMR magnet.  The contract signed
between the NHMFL and IGC on January 11, 1996, includes a collaboration
on the engineering design and fabrication of this unique magnet system and
an IGC commitment of $1,000,000 to the project. IGC has played another critical
role in the laboratory's program to build a 1.1 GHz NMR magnet by partnering
with the NHMFL on an NIH-funded Phase II SBIR program to build a 2.5 T,
high transition temperature, superconducting coil as a prototype for the
5 T insert; this will be coupled with the wide bore 900 MHz (21.1 T) outer
magnet to reach the &quot;Holy Grail&quot; of the NMR community:  1 GHz
high resolution NMR.  The partnership with IGC is only an example of the
NHMFL's outreach to the private sector. These cooperative alliances utilize
the laboratory's unique facilities and resources to advance magnet and magnet
materials technology and at the same time provide a return on the private
sector investment in the form of new technological capacity and improved
market position. <BR>

In addition to the advances made in the facilities area, we have had numerous
scientific successes in the first year of full operation of both the continuous
and pulsed field facilities. The following is a glimpse of the breadth of
users' research over the past year.<BR>
<UL>
<LI>A user group headed by Roy Weinstein, University of Houston, attained
a world record field for trapped field magnets-10.1 tesla at a temperature
of about 42 kelvin. This benchmark was achieved in a 2 cm diameter by 3.2
cm long, high temperature superconductor, containing four quasi-crystals,
produced at the University of Houston. Ten tesla had been the group's goal
for several years. The group's achievement was acknowledged with The Workshops
Materials/Device Performance Award at the 1995 International Workshop on
Superconductivity, jointly sponsored by the International Superconductivity
Technology Center and the Materials Research Society.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>An international team from the University of Nijmegen, the Electrotechnical
Laboratory in Tsukuba, Japan, and the NHMFL led by NHMFL scientist James
Brooks, used a specialized pressure device to apply uniaxial stress to induce
and enhance superconductivity in low-dimensional molecular conductors. Very
high magnetic fields (near 30 T) allowed a magnetic &quot;x-ray&quot; to
monitor the changes in structure and electron behavior that produced the
higher superconducting transition temperature. Such analysis is not possible
by any other method. Further theoretical work is underway to determine what
parameters may lead to higher transition temperatures in molecular conductors.
These organic-based materials provide an alternative path to the quest for
superconductivity at higher, economically viable temperatures.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>R.G. Mani, K. von Klitzing, and K. Ploog from the Max-Planck-Institut
f&uuml;r Festkorperforschung in Stuttgart, Germany, conducted measurements
on &quot;multiply connected&quot; quantum Hall systems in which it is possible
to realize two quantum Hall effects in a single sample. These studies have
addressed fundamental questions related to the nature of edge currents in
the Hall effect as well as practical questions related to the breakdown
of the quantum Hall effect at high voltages with important implications
for metrology.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Russell Bowers of the University of Florida used a 20 T, 50 mm bore
magnet and laser system to dynamically polarize the nuclei at high magnetic
fields, thereby permitting the NMR observation of spins within several semiconducting
systems. The combination of high field and rapid ramp rate of resistive
magnets allowed these unique studies of optical pumping efficiency as a
function of magnetic field strength.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>William Halperin of Northwestern University used the 24.5 T high homogeneity
magnet for NMR study of the flux lattice/flux melting /flux glass phase
diagram to fields much higher than the previous 9 T measurements.<BR>
<BR>
<LI>Stan Tozer and Scott Hannahs of the NHMFL have extended the frontier
for optical and electrical transport studies at high pressures and high
magnetic fields simultaneously using diamond-anvil cells in DC and pulsed
fields and to temperatures of 20 mK. These studies of reduced dimensional
systems are being carried out with the hope of observing a reentrant behavior
predicted to occur at fields in excess of 75 T. To obtain this magnitude
of field, advanced materials being studied at NHMFL and a pulse magnet optimization
code developed at NHMFL will be brought together to achieve what will be
a world record field for this type of magnet. Extensively nonmetallic diamond
or sapphire-anvil cells also are required to minimize eddy current heating
during the pulse. These new developments will feed directly into the 100
T, magnetization, and NMR high pressure programs planned for the future.
</UL>
National laboratories have unique resources of scientists, engineers,
and facilities that can be used in innovative ways to strengthen learning
experiences in science. The NHMFL shared its resources with over 150 undergraduate
and graduate students who worked on research or affiliated programs at the
laboratory during 1995. The NHMFL also continued to provide challenging
educational and research opportunities for minority and women scholars,
as well as young students. This year the laboratory expanded its educational
outreach programs, particularly those for the grades K-12, and since the
NHMFL open officially in 1994, several thousand K-12 students have toured
and listened to lectures at the Tallahassee facility. On  September 30,
1995, the anniversary of the dedication of the laboratory, the NHMFL held
its second annual open house. The open house attracted over 800 visitors,
and the majority were young people who enjoyed the numerous hands-on exhibits
displayed throughout the laboratory. <BR>
<BR>
Thanks to a collaboration with nearby Tallahassee Community College, which
assigned an educator to the NHMFL, we are exploring new cooperative programs
among the universities, community colleges, and regional school systems
that will build on the state-federal partnership and the investments made
in the NHMFL. The Florida Department of Education has provided the NHMFL
with a $75,000 grant to begin a summer mentorship program at the NHMFL for
Florida science teachers. One of the objectives of this grant is to provide
a number of science teachers selected from throughout the state with an
opportunity and the  tools to develop new educational units by utilizing
the laboratory's facilities and interacting with the NHMFL's faculty. These
units will be made available to other teachers in Florida (and eventually
elsewhere) via the Internet and other modes of electronic communications.
During the fall semester, twenty-three local gifted middle school students
participated in a scientist-mentorship program at the NHMFL. Each week,
these students participated in hands-on research projects under the direction
of their mentors and made oral presentations of their research results at
a mini workshop held at the NHMFL on January 9, 1996. This program proved
to be so successful that it will be repeated in the fall of 1996.<BR>
<BR>
For the third consecutive year, the laboratory provided research opportunities
for scholars from groups underrepresented in the fields of science and engineering.
For the first time this year, the NHMFL expanded its minority and women
summer research program to include all three sites, i.e., Tallahassee, Gainesville,
and Los Alamos. Ten students participated. A 1995 participant, Larry Sears,
commented,"...the entire experience was just what my education needed.
 Books and classrooms are fine but application of all those theories is
so much more beneficial.&quot;  This program received considerable assistance
from the Florida-Georgia Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) and other
AMP directors around the country. The laboratory will continue to expand
this program and will work with AMPs to develop and introduce new programs
that offer exciting research participation opportunities for undergraduates
from underrepresented groups.<BR>
<BR>
This annual report provides the reader with an overview of the research,
collaborative, and educational activities accomplished by the NHMFL during
1995. The laboratory has established itself as a world leader in magnet-related
research and development, and the future looks extremely bright.<BR>

<IMG SRC="fpt1.gif" WIDTH="455" HEIGHT="256">  

		<i>1Increased homogeneity (10 ppm over 2 mm DSV) magnet for magnetic resonance experiments.</i>
<P>
	The general purpose DC resistive magnets in Tallahassee continue to impress users with their reliability and freedom from vibration and power supply electrical noise. The two 30 T magnets in the new housing design came on line this year and have become the new "workhorse" magnets. The first 27 T resistive magnet in the world was retired after 1080 hours of service, and the inner coil was restacked to provide higher field homogeneity for magnetic resonance experiments. This 24.5 T, 32 mm bore magnet is being used for studies of a number of condensed matter systems. It is also helping to guide the design of a future resistive magnet with 1 ppm inhomogeneity. New resistive magnets planned to be completed in 1996 include one of ~34 T and 32 mm bore, one of ~20 T and 200 mm bore, and the 32 mm bore resistive insert for the 45 T hybrid.
Instruments for Users of the General Purpose Magnets
<P>
	Only a few pieces of major equipment were purchased or developed for the DC High Field Facility during 1995, but considerable effort went into improving the array of available instruments and experimental techniques based on our increasing experience meeting users' needs.
<P>
<B>Magneto Optics</B>
<P>
	A sample holder for doing infrared reflectance measurements in the 20 T superconducting magnet was built for use with the Fourier transform infrared spectrometer by Bradley Love, FSU Physics Graduate Student; Yong-Jie Wang, NHMFL Postdoctoral Fellow; and Prof. Hon-Kie Ng, FSU Physics.  It covers 20-3000 cm-1 frequency range and has a stage that rotates one of four samples into the light path. The temperature range is approximately 2 K to 50 K. 
<P>
	An optically pumped far infrared (FIR) laser (Edinburgh FIRL 100) was purchased this year. The laser output covers the wavelength range from about 40 mm to 500 mm with the standard glass cavity, and a few additional lines up to 1000 mm are added if the optional brass cavity is used. The output power for the strongest 118 mm line is over 100 mW. One of the more interesting techniques made possible by the FIR laser is optically detected cyclotron resonance. This is a very powerful technique that relies on the detection of changes in a photoluminescence (or reflectivity) signal while exciting the sample with the FIR laser and sweeping the magnetic field. Cyclotron resonance for both free carriers and impurity related transitions can be observed in any of the resistive magnets.
<P>
	Recent improvements by Thomas Schmiedel, NHMFL Postdoctoral Fellow, in the visible optics facilities include sample holders and equipment for some new as well as basic techniques. New fiber optic-based sample holders for transmission measurements have been built, and there is a new sample holder with high efficiency direct lens optics for polarized light in conjunction with NMR measurements. A special sample holder for optically detected cyclotron resonance has been successfully tested in luminescence and reflectivity modes. All of these sample holders can be used from 1.8 K to 300 K, and a new double sample holder has been built for use in 3He to 0.4 K. So far, all sample holders can accommodate samples up to at least 5x5 mm2. A xenon lamp was purchased for use as an ultraviolet excitation source.
<P>
	A new HeCd laser (325 nm, 40 mW) and a high efficiency single fiber sample holder have been used to measure changes in the excitonic emission from the GaN band edge. The sample holder provides up to 25 mW of laser light to the sample and allows detection of emissions at wavelengths as low as 335 nm through a sharp-onset long-pass filter.
<P>
	New data acquisition programs for controlling the magnet, the high resolution spectrometer and CCD detector allow recording of spectra while the magnet is swept. These spectra can then be fed into a peak fitting program to be analyzed immediately after the magnet sweep. Previously users were required to hold the field fixed while a spectrum was recorded, ramp to a new field and repeat the process for the desired field range, so the new software greatly accelerates data acquisition and analysis.
<P>
<b>Magnetization</b>
<P>
	Murali Chaparala, NHMFL Postdoctoral Fellow, has improved the facilities for magnetic measurements by developing stiffer cantilevers for studying strongly magnetic materials by force magnetometry. The magnetization of chrome alum [KCr(SO4)2.12H2O], a spin 3/2 paramagnet, measured with this cantilever, shows the expected collapse of the data onto the universal Brillouin curve. A new sample holder for magnetic force measurements permits separation of the torque term from the magnetization signal. A new rotating stage sample holder allows angular dependence measurements in the 50 mm bore resistive magnets. The system has a resolution of 5 millidegrees and is designed for use in a helium three refrigerator in the 50 mm bore resistive magnets. It can be used for temperatures from 0.4 K to 300 K, and is not limited to magnetization measurements.
<P>
	Two different groups have done simultaneous magnetization and transport measurements with the cantilever beam force magnetometer; measurements that would be very difficult, if not impossible with other methods. Prof. M. J. Naughton et al. used simultaneous deHaas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-deHaas measurements on a so called "Tl-Se" ET salt as a function of angle to study its Fermi surface. U. Welp et al. looked at flux lattice melting in YBCO using simultaneous magnetic moment and resistivity measurements.

	Proposals for a vibrating sample magnetometer to be used in all of the resistive magnets, including the hybrid, were sought and evaluated in 1995. The chosen design is due for delivery in March, 1996.
<P>
<b>General Purpose Instrumentation for Use in Resistive Magnets</b>
<P>
	The improvements to the general purpose instrumentation available to users of the general purpose DC magnets fall into the general category of "more copies of things to serve more users more conveniently." Included were two new dewars (one for 32 mm bore and one for 50 mm bore magnets); three new helium-3 cans, two for the 32 mm bore magnets, one for the 50 mm bores; three new He-4/He-3 gas handling systems (for a total of four); two general purpose vacuum pumps; a high speed turbo pumping station specifically for pumping down the dewars for resistive magnets. A dewar with a larger helium reservoir was purchased to allow longer use between fills when the experiment boiled helium, or other cryogen, at a high rate. A 200 ampere high current probe was built for superconducting wire testing in the new large body dewar. A neon liquifier that works with the high current probe and the large body dewar was built for testing high temperature superconductors. This work, and the work on the dilution refrigerator and other superconducting magnet systems (below) was done by Scott Hannahs, Eric Palm, Tim Murphy, Bobby Pullum, and Chris Immer.
<P>
	Proposals for a portable, top-loading, dilution refrigerator for use in the hybrid and other resistive magnets were sought and evaluated in the fall of 1995. The new refrigerator is expected to be delivered in July, 1996.
<P>
<b>Improvements to the Dilution Refrigerator in the 20 T Superconducting Magnet</b>
<P>
	The sample rotating probe was rewired with 12 twisted pairs of phosphor bronze wire. These leads have a lower resistance than the original ones, so sample and temperature sensor resistance measurements are simplified, but the wires' high thermal resistance still allows the dilution refrigerator to make the same base temperature.
<P>
	The original grounded micro-coax on both probes was replaced with isolated micro-coaxial cables that terminate in a standard BNC connector on the probe head. These new connectors also make it possible to expand the number of isolated coax to four in the future if so desired.
<P>
<center><IMG SRC="fp1.gif" WIDTH="251" HEIGHT="272">
<P><i>20 T superconducting magnet and dilution refrigerator 
<br>with 20 mK base temperature.</i></center>
<P>
Other improvements to the dilution refrigerator include:
	<ul><li>Installed larger, more efficient cold traps to reduce plugging.
	<li>Replaced the sealed pump with one that shows when a worn shaft seal is leaking before it causes a problem for the dilution refrigerator.
	<li>Replaced the 1K pump with a larger, higher speed pump that allows probes to be inserted and cooled faster. The new pump also fixes a problem that occurred when the lambda refrigerator was run. The 1K pot would warm because the pump could not keep up with the increased flow of helium from the bath.
	<li>Mapped the cooling power of the dilution refrigerator with different combinations of pumps, and provided a chart for the users.
	<li>Successfully controlled the sample temperature with a standard temperature controller using a heater in close proximity to the thermometer. Sample temperature can now be controlled to within 1% of the set point for set points between 20 mK and 800 mK.
	<li>Replaced the yoke on the rotator with a new stronger material.
</ul>
<P>
<i>Improvements to Other Superconducting Magnet Systems</i>
<P>
	<ul><li>The general purpose 20 T superconducting magnet was repaired by Oxford Instruments, tested, and placed back into service.
	<li>A 15 T superconducting magnet donated by IBM was placed into service, and a variable temperature insert and sample holder were built and used in it.
</ul><P><P>
<b>Instruments Developed by NHMFL, Florida State University, and Visiting Scientists</b>
<P>
<i>Magnetic Field Modulation Coils</i>
<P>
	Prof. Roy Goodrich and Donovan Hall, graduate student, of Louisiana State University, collaborated with NHMFL staff to develop a water cooled coil for modulating the magnetic field at the sample for de Haas-van Alphen measurements in the 32 mm bore magnets. The modulation field was 94 mT, peak to peak, at 17 Hz. Future designs will aim for higher amplitude modulation.
<P>
<i>NMR Spectrometers for High Field, Low to Medium Resolution Experiments</i>
<P>
	There are some important problems in condensed matter physics that can be addressed by nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, even in the low homogeneity  general purpose magnets. Over the past two and a half years the Condensed Matter NMR group has developed instrumentation for performing NMR in the resistive magnets at the NHMFL at fields up to 30 T and over a temperature range from 1.5 K to 300 K. Experiments have been routinely carried out for the past year in a wide variety of condensed matter systems with collaborators both within the NHMFL and from elsewhere. The principle limitation in this work until August, 1995, was the 100 ppm over 1cm DSV inhomogeneity of the magnets, thus confining the research to systems with very broad NMR lines, such as magnetic systems, or to T1 measurements. 
<P>
	In August a new magnet developed by the resistive magnet design group was installed. The measured inhomogeneity proved to be about 10 ppm over 2 mm DSV. There are many very interesting systems with natural line widths that exceed this magnet limitation, and several have already been studied with this magnet. Examples of condensed matter physics research currently in progress with the group's collaborators includes studies of magnetic phase transitions in the cuprates, optically pumped dynamic polarization studies of InP and GaAs detected by NMR, studies of high temperature superconductors, and investigation of the high field spin density wave phases of one and two dimensional organic conductors. Nuclei that have been studied to date include: 1H, 2H, 19F, 63Cu, 65Cu, 7Li, 31P, 35Cl, 37Cl, 139In, 77Se, 69Ga, 17O, 27Al and 39K.
<P>
	A 15 T at 4.2 K, 17 T at 2.2 K, superconducting magnet, 1ppm homogeneity, has been ordered for condensed matter NMR research, and as a staging magnet for NMR experiments in the medium homogeneity resistive magnet.
<P>
	Improvements to the Condensed Matter NMR instrumentation were made by Phil Kuhns and Alfred Kleinhammes, NHMFL; and Bill Moulton, FSU Physics.

<P><i><center>NMR research in a resistive magnet.</center></i> 


 
<P><i>High Pressure Research</i>
<P>


	A high pressure facility has been created to perform both electrical transport and optical measurements over a wide range of temperatures (20 mK to 350 K), sample volumes, and attainable pressures under conditions of both hydrostatic and uniaxial stress. The principal components of this facility were described in the 1994 NHMFL Annual Report. Improvements made by Stan Tozer, NHMFL scientist, in 1995 include:
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="fp3.gif" WIDTH="252" HEIGHT="152"></center>
<P><i><center>The largest of the diamond anvil cells, shown disassembled. The coin diameter is 19 mm.</center></i>  


<P><ul><li>Diamond Anvil Cell (DAC) #3, (mass = 1.7 g, sample volume = 0.5 X 0.08 mm2) has been successfully taken to 2.7 GPa and used to perform electrical transport measurements at this pressure on a single crystal organic conductor. A variable temperature holder for this DAC fits into the sample cryostats used in the DC resistive magnets, and the 50 T, 24 mm and 60 T, 15 mm bore pulsed magnets. The DAC is suspended from the optical fiber that is used for pressure calibration and other optical measurements. There are leads for the diode temperature sensor, heater, dB/dt coil, and up to six leads for the sample.
<li>DAC #2 has been used successfully in an optical experiment to pressures of 5.7 GPa at liquid helium temperatures. The variable temperature probe for this DAC fits into the sample cryostats used for the DC and pulsed magnets, except for the 15 mm bore pulsed magnets.
<li>DAC rotators are available for the 20 T DC and 50 T pulsed magnets. Another rotator for the smallest DAC has been designed for the 32 mm bore DC magnets.
</ul> 
<P>
Materials Testing
<P>
	A facility for the evaluation of cryogenic materials and magnet components supports measurements of transport currents in superconductors, testing of large scale magnet components, and mechanical properties testing of superconductors, high strength normal conductors, structural alloys, and composites. The activities and accomplishments of this facility are described by Leonard Summers in the Magnet Science and Technology section of the Research Reports.
<P>
<b>Infrastructure for Research Support</b>
<P>
<i>Mechanical Instruments</i>
<P>
	The Mechanical Instrumentation Facility has added a high precision Hardinge Lathe for close tolerance machining and micromachining and a computer controlled vertical machining center for machining large components. These machines complete the basic requirements for a well equipped machine shop. Three temporary machinist positions were upgraded, and one new machinist was hired to meet increasing demand.
<P>
<i>Electronic Instruments</i>
<P>
	Staff and minor equipment were added to the Electronic Instrumentation Facility during 1995 to support the increasing demand for new special electronic instruments for NHMFL researchers and to carry out repairs and calibrations as needed.
<P>
<i>Computers and Networks</I>
<P>
	The Computer Support Group continued to expand the telecommunications and computing facilities of the NHMFL as the laboratory expanded. New system security measures were installed to meet the increased complexity of the challenges faced by the networks.

	<b>20 T Superconducting Magnet Instrumentation</b>

<ul><li>A probe was constructed that allows photoluminescence measurements from 2.2 K to 250 K.
<P>
<li>A magnetostriction cell design was tested successfully in a prototype. This cell measures either thermal expansion or magnetostriction of a sample of dimensions 0.5 to 4.0 mm. It is a volume magnetostriction cell, so it can be rotated 90 degrees in a magnetic field. The current sensitivity of the prototype is 1 part per billion. This sensitivity is expected to be exceeded with installation of the second version in the 20 T magnet in 1996.
</ul>
<b>Capacitor Driven Magnet Improvements</b>
<P>
<ul><li>Three independent magnet stations were completed, one of which contains a 50 T, 24 mm bore magnet dedicated to the dilution refrigerator (see below). The remaining two cells are fitted with whatever types of magnets are needed by the scheduled users.
<P>
<li>In response to a user's request, experiments were conducted for the first time in a maximum field gradient which turned out to be 11 T/cm at a field of 28 T, as shown in the figure on page 166.
<P>
<li>A 42 T, long decay magnet has been wound and is expected to be installed in early 1996.
<P>
<li>Oxford Instruments completed commissioning of the dilution refrigerator in February, 1995. The base temperature is 25 mK and temperature recovery following a field pulse occurs within 15 to 20 minutes. (The empty cell warms to approximately 60 mK during a 50 T pulse; any temperature rise in the sample depends on its conductivity and size.) This is possible because the refrigerator contains non-metallic components in key places. This is the lowest temperature ever reached in 50 T fields.

<b>60 T Quasi-Continuous Magnet</b>
<P>
<i>Generator Facility, Power Modules, and Control System</i>
<P>
Josef Schillig of NHMFL collaborated closely and extensively with ABB on the third design of the power supply transformer. This design passed the short-circuit test in October, 1995, and will be used. Jim Ferner and Heinrich Boenig also monitored the ABB effort closely. Five of these transformers are required for the 60 T quasi-continuous (q-c) magnet.
<P>
The current limiting device (CLID) control and protection wiring was completed and the CLID commissioned. Likewise for the load breaker.
<P>
About half of the man-machine interface screens for the control system were completed under the direction of Josef Schillig. Progress was also made on the reversing switches, the crowbar switch, the dummy load, and coil monitoring and protection systems.
<P>
<i>Magnet Progress</i>
<P>
Everson Electric completed fabrication of the 60 T long pulse coils. The major design on the frame, dewar, magnet power busbar, and liquid nitrogen handling systems (which support, hold, and service the coils) was completed by Jim Sims and John Rogers; and fabrication was begun. All nine coils, which were designed by Sims, have arrived and have passed acceptance tests. Four of these weigh more than a ton.

<P>
<b>Non-Destructive 100 T Magnet</b>
<P>
Preliminary studies by Yehia Eyssa, Paul Pernambuco-Wise, and Heinrich Boenig showed that a 2 MJ capacitor bank is sufficient to provide the energy for a 50 T insert magnet installed in the bore of a 50 T background field to provide a 100 T nondestructive magnet. To provide a large amount of flexibility and some amount of redundancy, the capacitor bank was designed by Boenig as a system containing four independent 600 kJ units. The units have voltage standoff capability to allow all four units to run either in parallel at 6 kV, in series at 24 kV, or in a set of two units in parallel and series at 12 kV. In addition three units can operate in series at 18 kV. This wide combination of voltages allows many different coil types at voltages from 6 to 24 kV to be tested with energies up to 2.4 MJ at 6, 12, and 24 kV.

All the capacitors were ordered for the total bank. The capacitors are designed to survive 50,000 full voltage shots. Delivery of the capacitors from Aerovox and the first charging supply from NWL (National Winding Laboratory) are expected at the end of the first quarter in 1996; delivery of the solid state switches from Silicon Power Corp. is expected in the second quarter.
<P>
<b>Spectroscopic Facility for the Visible and Near IR Regions</b>
<P>
	A spectroscopic facility was established through the efforts and supervision of Prof. Clive Perry of Northeastern University. Three spectrometers became operational:
<P>
<ul> <li>0.25 m f/4 Jarrel-Ash monochromator with a thermoelectrically cooled GaAs photomultiplier and a liquid nitrogen cooled Ge photo-detector for operation in the visible and near IR (300-1600 nm).
<P>
<li>0.6 m f/10 Spex Triple-Mate spectrometer with a Photometrics Model 9000 CCD array detector for the 300-1050 nm region.
<P>
<li>0.28 m f/4 Acton Instruments monochromator with a Princeton Instruments CCD array detector for operation in the 300-1050 nm region.
<P>
</ul>
Fiber optic cables with core sizes from 62.5 to 600 mm connect any spectrometer to sample holders located in either the 20 T superconducting magnet or the 50 T and 60 T pulsed magnets. Low temperature (1.5-4.2 K) facilities are currently available for photoluminescence, reflection or absorption spectroscopy with both perpendicular (Faraday) or parallel (Voigt) magnetic field geometries. Excitation sources consist of a broad band white-light source, a Coherent Radiation Innova Model 310, 8 W multiline Argon laser, and a Mira 900-D femtosecond/picosecond Titanium-Sapphire laser that is tunable from 710-1060 nm. A Pockels cell shutter is used to synchronize the spectroscopic data acquisition with the "flat-top" region of the pulsed magnetic field. All spectrometers, detectors, and pulsed magnet field operation are under computer control. (Some of the above equipment was acquired by loan; it is being replaced by equivalent NHMFL equipment as funds allow.) An 8.5 T, 30 mm bore superconducting magnet was loaned to NHMFL to use as a staging magnet for optical probe and technique development and for calibration of samples and probes prior to pulsed magnet experiments.
<P>
<b>Other Los Alamos National Laboratory Facilities Available to NHMFL Users</b>
<P>
	Funding was secured by another laboratory program (Pegasus) to design a method for flux compression to 600 T using an existing Los Alamos capacitor bank. If successful, this will be a second potential source of megagauss fields for NHMFL users, in addition to the explosive flux compression.
<P>
	Arrangements were made through other laboratory programs to pursue a series of explosive flux compression shots in early 1996 using Arzamas generators that potentially can reach 1000 T. These shots will carry experiments suggested by NHMFL users, which NHMFL will assist through its pulsed field facilities and program.

<H2>Ultra-High B/T Facility-Gainesville</H2>



<Table Border=0 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=6>

<TD>
<P>
	A special annex facility for studies of materials at ultra-high values of the ratio of magnetic field to temperature (B/T) is being developed as a collaborative effort between the NHMFL and the Microkelvin Laboratory at the University of Florida. This facility will provide users with the ability to carry out experiments that simultaneously require fields up to 20 T and temperatures down to 500 mK. The B/T ratio of 4 x 104 T/K will be the highest available anywhere, and will allow users to study new phenomena that require the establishment of high spin polarizations or high magnetizations. Plans for the facility were described in the 1994 Annual Report and are available on the NHMFL World Wide Web Site.
<P>
	The dilution refrigerator and dewar have been installed and tested. With a minimum temperature of 4 mK, the high-cooling power dilution refrigerator reaches 10 mK in 10 hours. Infrequent transfers of helium will be required since the vapor shielded dewar has a hold-time of a week. Rapid bottom-loading of samples can be accomplished using a slide tube-andbellows arrangement that allows the dilution refrigerator to be withdrawn from the dewar, then reinserted, without warming the dewar and magnets. The turn-around time from 10 mK is about 24 hours. Additionally, samples may be top loaded with some loss in the minimum temperature.

<i>Ultra-High B/T Facility at UF (B<20 T, T>500 mK).</i> </center>
<p>
	Assembling, installation, and testing of the PrNi5 demagnetization stage will be completed in January, 1996, with delivery of the high-field magnet expected about the same time. After commissioning of the magnet and testing on in-house experiments, the facility will be open to external users. A full-time research scientist, Jian-Sheng Xia, has been part of the design team and will be available to coordinate and assist with the assembly and design of the experiments.

<b>Institutional Integration</b>
<left><IMG SRC="cimar1.gif" WIDTH="168" HEIGHT="173">  </left>
<P>
	The magnetic resonance program spans all three institutions of the NHMFL. The primary facilities for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), electron magnetic resonance (EMR, including electron paramagnetic, and cyclotron resonance), and ion cyclotron resonance (ICR) are housed in Tallahassee. The primary site for magnetic resonance imaging and in vivo spectroscopy (MRIS) is at the University of Florida (UF), which offers extensive animal care and surgical facilities. Furthermore, UF is developing a new Center for Structural Biology, and the NHMFL has contributed resources for equipping that Center. Strong ties have been established with the Structural Biology Program, the Center for Materials and Research Technology, and the Supercomputing Computational Research Institute at Florida State University (FSU); the Center for Structural Biology and the Department of Radiology of the College of Medicine at UF; the Chemical Science and Technology Division at Los Alamos National Laboratory; as well as with individual research groups in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Materials Science, and Physics at the three NHMFL institutions. Thus, the NHMFL magnetic resonance program is strengthened by taking advantage of the combined resources at its three host institutions.
<P>
<B>Scientific Integration</B>
<P>
	A unique feature of CIMAR is its large-scale integration of NMR, MRIS, EMR, and ICR spectroscopies, which share many concepts and techniques. Continued cross-fertilization among these fields is facilitated at NHMFL in several ways through a broad external and internal user program.
<P>
	In addition to "monodisciplinary" seminars, which tend to focus on special areas of NMR, EMR or ICR, frequent "multidisciplinary" seminars are targeted at the full range of magnetic resonance researchers. Visits by eminent speakers ensure regular injection of new ideas.
<P>
	In December, 1995, NHMFL and CIMAR hosted the Southeastern Magnetic Resonance Conference (SEMRC). This high-level meeting provided an opportunity for many prominent scientists from the United States and abroad to visit the NHMFL and appreciate our achievements.
<P>
	CIMAR faculty meetings have been held, approximately once every six weeks since June 1995, in Tallahassee, Gainesville, or Steinhatchee. These meetings provide a forum where investigators, research staff, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students with an interest in magnetic resonance can meet and exchange their views. The meetings feature scientific presentations by selected investigators who present work related to CIMAR, and provide an opportunity to discuss matters of scientific priorities, staffing, and budget. Weekly meetings of the CIMAR committee (Bodenhausen, Brunel, Mareci, and Marshall) ensure a high level of coordination.
<P>
	The magnetic resonance research groups in Tallahassee are housed in shared or contiguous laboratory and office space, including a shared reading room to encourage cross-talk and education across disciplinary lines. Close proximity of the research groups allows for efficient sharing of space and equipment: a common biochemical sample preparation laboratory, shared rf and microwave frequency synthesizers, counters, amplifiers, etc., and a computer network for interactive molecular graphics and other computations.
<P>
	The NHMFL has hired and will continue to hire experts in the field of magnetic resonance to build strong in-house programs in NMR, MRIS, EMR, and ICR. External users are expected to be attracted to the NHMFL not only for its high-field spectrometers, but also because of new techniques, instruments, and applications developed by its in-house researchers.
<P>
	A great deal of attention has been paid to the needs and interests of potential users, and a growing number of external users are beginning to make use of NHMFL's exceptional magnetic resonance facilities. Users are normally requested to give seminars about their work, so that the NHMFL staff can appreciate the scope of their research, thus providing improved opportunities for constructive collaboration.

<b>ICR Program</b>
<p>
	Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) provides the most versatile and highest-performance mass analysis: e.g., mass resolving power of 1,000,000 for protein ions up to 30,000 Da, and detection of a single (multiply-charged) ion up to 108 Da; determination of ion-molecule reaction pathways, kinetics, equilibria, energetics, and mechanism by manipulation of massselected trapped ions; mixture analysis; surface analysis; high sensitivity (e.g., attomole (10-18 moles) detection of peptides and phospholipids); speed (typically 1 second for a full mass spectrum); etc.  During 1995, the number of FT-ICR systems worldwide increased by about 10% (to 185).
<p>
	Although ion cyclotron resonance was not included in the original mission and funding of the NHMFL, an ICR program was initiated in 1993 from State of Florida funds, with the hiring of Alan G. Marshall (Director of the ICR Program) and Shenheng Guan (Associate Director). In 1994, these two investigators combined with UF's John R. Eyler for a $5 million five-year NSF High-Field Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry Facility designed to develop and provide state-of-the-art FT-ICR capabilities to external users (university, government, and industrial labs) nationwide. NHMFL's critical role lies in providing the infrastructure and high-field magnets that will make possible the highest-performance FT-ICR experiments in the world.
<p>
	As in FT-NMR spectroscopy, resolving power in FT-ICR mass spectrometry scales linearly with magnetic field, B0. Thus, the magnets available to NHMFL's ICR Facility [9.4 T (supercon), 20 T (resistive, available in early 1996), and 25 T (resistive, proposed for 1997)] project improvement in ICR mass resolving power by factors of 34% to 357% compared to the largest
-field (7 T) ICR magnets anywhere else. Moreover, a higher magnetic field offers a host of additional advantages for FT-ICR, as outlined briefly in Table 1. Apart from obvious major improvements in mass resolving power and upper mass limit (which scale as B0 and B02), the higher magnetic field also greatly reduces the rate of ion loss by radial diffusion (which scales as B0-2), and thus improves all FT-ICR experiments because ions remain confined to the center of the ion trap. Finally, various nonlinearities are greatly reduced at higher magnetic field: e.g., unwanted coalescence of closelyspaced peaks scales as B0-2.

<p>
During 1995, the FSU ICR group's main activity was the design, construction, and assembly of new instruments. As new techniques and experiments are developed on the NHMFL instruments, those methods will be implemented on external-user instruments in the NSF National High-Field FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Facility. In addition to the construction program, the FSU ICR group produced 12 refereed publications and 52 invited and contributed talks at scientific meetings, universities, and government and industrial laboratories (see lists elsewhere in this Report) during the present reporting period. Specific highlights include:
<p><ul>
<li>Design, construction, and testing of homebuilt high-performance data systems, with Pentium platform, LabWindows command structure, and VXI bus-mounted modules for control of r.f. and DC voltages, stored waveform excitation, up to 96-channel experimental event sequence pulse programmer, high-resolution (21-bit) 5 MHz analog-to-digital converter, broad-band receiver preamp, FFT data reduction, and menu-driven command structure with no more than three mouse clicks to reach any command. Five systems are under construction (two of which are hardware-complete), and several other research groups have expressed interest in helping to develop and use the system.
<li>Design and construction of 9.4 tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer with homebuilt electrospray source and dual octupole ion guides. This instrument awaits only final delivery of a flange-mounted Penning trap, and should be completed early in 1996. Preliminary results are quite promising.
<li>Design and construction of 7.0 tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer with homebuilt matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) source and wire-in-cylinder ion guide. This instrument is currently under test and should be operational early in 1996.
<li>Design and construction of 3 tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer for detection of fluorescence from mass-selected gas-phase trapped ions. This system is currently under test.
<li>Design of 20 tesla resistive-magnet FT-ICR mass spectrometer with homebuilt (MALDI) fiber-optic source. This small-bore system is currently under construction and should be ready for testing by the second quarter of 1996.
<li>New record for detection limit (9 x 10-18 moles) achieved for a peptide produced by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI).
<li>Record mass resolving power (1,500,000) achieved for MALDI of a peptide.
<li>Identification and structural analysis of phospholipids (polar head group, fatty acid side chains) from femtomole amounts of sample, including mixtures.
<li>Magnitude-mode multiple-derivative spectra for resolution enhancement without loss in signal-to-noise ratio (applies to all forms of FT spectroscopy).
<li>Simulation and construction of a wire-in-cylinder ion guide, for transfer of ions from an external ion source to the center of a solenoidal superconducting magnet. Based on our design, such an ion guide has been installed in an FT-ICR instrument at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
<li>Simulation of a "matrix-shimmed" Penning trap that promises to provide near-perfect electric excitation, detection, and trapping potentials based on simple cubic geometry. Design and fabrication of such a trap are under way.
<li>The UF group developed a DC glow-discharge elemental ion source, coupled to an FT-ICR instrument. Their work on a separate inductively-coupled plasma elemental ion source is now under way.
<P><b>
Ion Cyclotron Resonance Spectrometers Available in December, 1995</b><p>
	The NHMFL Tallahassee site ICR capabilities derive from the magnets listed below. All have 10 ppm inhomogeneity. Additional superconducting magnet-based FT-ICR instruments at UF serve as development sites for other applications (e.g., DC glow-discharge ion source, inside-the-bore electrospray ion source).

<H2>NMR Imaging and In Vivo Spectroscopy</H2>



<Table Border=0 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=6>
<TR Valign=top>


    

<TD>

<p>
	NMR provides a unique, non-destructive method of imaging materials. By use of the resonance of abundant spins (mostly 1H), magnetic field gradients can be used to map the distribution and physical environment of the material under study. In addition to important applications in materials research, NMR imaging has extensive applications in medicine. Currently, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the premier tool of diagnostic radiology giving unsurpassed definition of soft tissue anatomy. However, the rich information content (relaxation, chemical shift, coupling constants, and diffusion) available with NMR can provide a detailed picture of the material under study that is not available with any other technology.
<p>
	In addition to imaging, NMR can provide a direct measure of the biochemical processes in living tissue with in vivo spectroscopy. As examples, important compounds in the brain can be measured with 1H spectroscopy and the metabolic status of various tissues determined using 31P spectroscopy. At higher fields, other spins of great interest in biology (13C, 15N, 17O) become accessible to direct measurement. There is no other technique that compares to in vivo NMR spectroscopy for the direct, noninvasive, dynamic study of biochemistry in living systems.
<p>
	The NMR Program of the NHMFL is developing capabilities for imaging and in vivo spectroscopy at its sites in Tallahassee and Gainesville. At the Health Sciences Center of the University of Florida in Gainesville, two NMR instruments, which received partial support from NHMFL, have been developed for NMR microscopy. Both a 7 T, 50 mm bore and a 14 T, 50 mm bore spectrometer have been equipped with gradients and used to study excised human and animal (rat and cat) spinal cord samples. At the Tallahassee site of the NHMFL, a 14 T, 89 mm bore magnet was recently installed. The larger bore of this magnet system allows microscopy of larger samples.
<p>
<center><IMG SRC="cimar3.gif" WIDTH="196" HEIGHT="220"></center>
<p>
<i><center>This 4.7 T, 330 mm bore magnet system is part of a small animal imaging spectrometer at UF.</i></center>
<p>
	In addition to instruments directly supported by the NHMFL, the College of Medicine of the University of Florida houses other NMR imaging spectrometers used for research. Studies of whole animal systems are performed on a 4.7 T, 33 cm bore magnet system, and human studies are carried out on a 1.5 T, 1 m bore magnet system. Also a 3 T, 80 cm bore magnet system for human studies was installed in the Veterans Administration Medical Center during the fall of 1995. The magnet system was acquired though a collaborative effort of the Veterans Administration Medical Center, the Shands Hospital at the University of Florida, and the University of Florida Brain Institute (through the UF Office of Research, Technology, and Graduate Education). This system is used for imaging, angiography and in vivo spectroscopy. Of particular interest at this time is the development of functional brain and spinal cord imaging for the study of neuronal processing. Other important applications include localized in vivo spectroscopy in cancer studies.
<p>
	In order to investigate the use of high-field NMR in biological systems, extensive studies have been undertaken to measure the field dependence of longitudinal and transverse relaxation of 31P NMR in important phosphorus containing compounds (creatine phosphate, and adenosine triphosphate) and to evaluate gains in signal-to-noise ratio that can be expected at high fields.
<p>
	The following are some specific projects on which substantial progress was made in 1995:
<ul><li>Development of novel radiofrequency coils for large bore magnets for MRIS.
<li>Development of novel transverse field gradient assemblies for large bore magnets and for NMR microscopy.
<li>Development of novel contrast agents for MRI.
<li>Relaxation mechanisms of particulate suspension MRI contrast agents, especially related to water diffusion through local susceptibility gradients, and the field dependence of that relaxation.
<li>Structure and dynamics of peptide substrates and inhibitors of HIV proteinase (PR), and of inhibitor-HIV PR complexes.
<li>31P magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) of in vivo intact human gastrocnemius (calf) muscle under physiologic stress (reduced blood flow) in low-intensity exercise trained and untrained individuals.
<li>31P MRSI of in vivo intact human gastrocnemius (calf ) muscle under physiologic stress (cardiac insufficiency) in untrained and low-intensity exercise trained individuals with and without L-carnitine supplementation.
<li>31P MRSI of the in vivo intact human cardiac muscle in normal and cardiac heart failure individuals.
<li>31P MRSI of cell growth and cell death of a humanosteosarcoma cell line perfused in a bioreactor or implanted into nude mice.
<li>31P MRSI of cell growth and cell death of treated and untreated therapy sensitive and therapy resistant human osteosarcoma cell line perfused in a bioreactor and implanted into nude mice.
<li>31P MRSI therapy monitoring of patients with muscluloskeletal tumors of the leg.
<li>Measurements of diffusion anisotropy in excised spinal cord tissue.

<p>
	Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) includes electron cyclotron resonance and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). Electron cyclotron resonance has long been a major tool for physicists in high magnetic field laboratories. The cyclotron frequency of an electron in a magnetic field depends on the inverse of the "effective" electron mass; this is used to study the band structure of semiconductors. This technique has been used at the NHMFL with a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (Bruker 113uv) and with the newly acquired, optically pumped, Far Infrared Laser (Edinburgh FIRL 100).
<p>
	In EPR, an unpaired electron is often used to probe the structure or the rigidity of its environment in materials ranging from metals to biomolecules. Because of the nature of the interaction between electromagnetic radiation and paramagnetic centers, it is far more difficult to observe EPR than to measure electron cyclotron resonance. The EMR program at the NHMFL has developed two spectrometers, a high field instrument based on the resistive magnets, and a high resolution instrument with a superconducting magnet. The scientific projects of the in-house scientists are drawn from physics (high Tc superconductors), chemistry (molecular magnetism), and biology (photosynthesis and proteins).
<p>
<b>High Field EMR Spectrometer</b>
<p>
	On July 5, 1995, the EMR group obtained the first EPR spectrum with a resistive magnet at the NHMFL. The sample was BDPA, a molecule commonly used as a standard for EPR spectroscopy; the source was a phase locked Gunn diode from ABmm (ESA 1-110); and the detector was an InSb fast electron bolometer from QMC Instruments. The experiments performed on July 5 allow us to evaluate precisely the possibilities of the NHMFL resistive magnet facilities:
<p><ul>
<li>Maximum magnetic field: 30 T now, higher in the future.
<li>Maximum frequency: 3 THz with the FIR Laser (useful for systems with large zero field splittings like metalloproteins).
<li>Resolution: 1 mT for a cubic sample of 5x5x5 mm3, at 10 T. This is limited by the inhomogeneity of the magnet and the ripple noise of the resistive magnet power supplies.
<li>Sensitivity: better than 1013 spins/gauss for a sample at 4.2 K.
<li>Temperature of the sample: 4.2 K - 300 K.
</ul>
<p>
	These specifications will be improved as soon as EPR calibrations are run in the 24.5 T resistive "enhanced homogeneity" magnet. NMR measurements have shown that the homogeneity and stability are at least ten times better than in standard magnets.
<p>
<b>High Resolution EMR Spectrometer</b>
<p>
	In another major development that came to fruition late in 1995, high resolution EMR (0.01 mT) is now possible with a 15/17 T, 52 mm superconducting magnet specially designed for EMR experiments up to 450 GHz. Research by in-house and visiting users has already begun with this system. One user has been successful in observing spectra of iron-based proteins over an extremely broad frequency range: 44 to 330 GHz, and zero field splittings have been measured. Another user measured high field EPR at 330 GHz of linear-chain Heisenberg anti-ferromagnets.
<p>
	An EPR X-band spectrometer (Bruker ECS 106 )is available in the laboratory to check samples at 9 GHz .

<H2>ICR Program</H2>

<TD>
<p>
	Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) provides the most versatile and highest-performance mass analysis: e.g., mass resolving power of 1,000,000 for protein ions up to 30,000 Da, and detection of a single (multiply-charged) ion up to 108 Da; determination of ion-molecule reaction pathways, kinetics, equilibria, energetics, and mechanism by manipulation of massselected trapped ions; mixture analysis; surface analysis; high sensitivity (e.g., attomole (10-18 moles) detection of peptides and phospholipids); speed (typically 1 second for a full mass spectrum); etc.  During 1995, the number of FT-ICR systems worldwide increased by about 10% (to 185).
<p>
	Although ion cyclotron resonance was not included in the original mission and funding of the NHMFL, an ICR program was initiated in 1993 from State of Florida funds, with the hiring of Alan G. Marshall (Director of the ICR Program) and Shenheng Guan (Associate Director). In 1994, these two investigators combined with UF's John R. Eyler for a $5 million five-year NSF High-Field Fourier Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance Mass Spectrometry Facility designed to develop and provide state-of-the-art FT-ICR capabilities to external users (university, government, and industrial labs) nationwide. NHMFL's critical role lies in providing the infrastructure and high-field magnets that will make possible the highest-performance FT-ICR experiments in the world.
<p>
	As in FT-NMR spectroscopy, resolving power in FT-ICR mass spectrometry scales linearly with magnetic field, B0. Thus, the magnets available to NHMFL's ICR Facility [9.4 T (supercon), 20 T (resistive, available in early 1996), and 25 T (resistive, proposed for 1997)] project improvement in ICR mass resolving power by factors of 34% to 357% compared to the largest
-field (7 T) ICR magnets anywhere else. Moreover, a higher magnetic field offers a host of additional advantages for FT-ICR, as outlined briefly in Table 1. Apart from obvious major improvements in mass resolving power and upper mass limit (which scale as B0 and B02), the higher magnetic field also greatly reduces the rate of ion loss by radial diffusion (which scales as B0-2), and thus improves all FT-ICR experiments because ions remain confined to the center of the ion trap. Finally, various nonlinearities are greatly reduced at higher magnetic field: e.g., unwanted coalescence of closelyspaced peaks scales as B0-2.

<p>
During 1995, the FSU ICR group's main activity was the design, construction, and assembly of new instruments. As new techniques and experiments are developed on the NHMFL instruments, those methods will be implemented on external-user instruments in the NSF National High-Field FT-ICR Mass Spectrometry Facility. In addition to the construction program, the FSU ICR group produced 12 refereed publications and 52 invited and contributed talks at scientific meetings, universities, and government and industrial laboratories (see lists elsewhere in this Report) during the present reporting period. Specific highlights include:
<p><ul>
<li>Design, construction, and testing of homebuilt high-performance data systems, with Pentium platform, LabWindows command structure, and VXI bus-mounted modules for control of r.f. and DC voltages, stored waveform excitation, up to 96-channel experimental event sequence pulse programmer, high-resolution (21-bit) 5 MHz analog-to-digital converter, broad-band receiver preamp, FFT data reduction, and menu-driven command structure with no more than three mouse clicks to reach any command. Five systems are under construction (two of which are hardware-complete), and several other research groups have expressed interest in helping to develop and use the system.
<li>Design and construction of 9.4 tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer with homebuilt electrospray source and dual octupole ion guides. This instrument awaits only final delivery of a flange-mounted Penning trap, and should be completed early in 1996. Preliminary results are quite promising.
<li>Design and construction of 7.0 tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer with homebuilt matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) source and wire-in-cylinder ion guide. This instrument is currently under test and should be operational early in 1996.
<li>Design and construction of 3 tesla FT-ICR mass spectrometer for detection of fluorescence from mass-selected gas-phase trapped ions. This system is currently under test.
<li>Design of 20 tesla resistive-magnet FT-ICR mass spectrometer with homebuilt (MALDI) fiber-optic source. This small-bore system is currently under construction and should be ready for testing by the second quarter of 1996.
<li>New record for detection limit (9 x 10-18 moles) achieved for a peptide produced by matrix-assisted laser-desorption/ionization (MALDI).
<li>Record mass resolving power (1,500,000) achieved for MALDI of a peptide.
<li>Identification and structural analysis of phospholipids (polar head group, fatty acid side chains) from femtomole amounts of sample, including mixtures.
<li>Magnitude-mode multiple-derivative spectra for resolution enhancement without loss in signal-to-noise ratio (applies to all forms of FT spectroscopy).
<li>Simulation and construction of a wire-in-cylinder ion guide, for transfer of ions from an external ion source to the center of a solenoidal superconducting magnet. Based on our design, such an ion guide has been installed in an FT-ICR instrument at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
<li>Simulation of a "matrix-shimmed" Penning trap that promises to provide near-perfect electric excitation, detection, and trapping potentials based on simple cubic geometry. Design and fabrication of such a trap are under way.
<li>The UF group developed a DC glow-discharge elemental ion source, coupled to an FT-ICR instrument. Their work on a separate inductively-coupled plasma elemental ion source is now under way.
<P><b>
Ion Cyclotron Resonance Spectrometers Available in December, 1995</b><p>
	The NHMFL Tallahassee site ICR capabilities derive from the magnets listed below. All have 10 ppm inhomogeneity. Additional superconducting magnet-based FT-ICR instruments at UF serve as development sites for other applications (e.g., DC glow-discharge ion source, inside-the-bore electrospray ion source).

<h2><b>Institutional Integration</b></h2>



	<p>
<b>Isotope Geochemistry Program</b><p>
<i>Program Description</i>
<p>
	The inclusion of isotope geochemistry and isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) in the in-house research program has broadened the research base of the facility. The program was initiated in 1994. 1995 was devoted mostly to construction of the laboratory facilities and the commissioning of the instrumentation. The construction of an 800 square foot Ultra-Clean Chemistry Laboratory was completed in 1995, and two isotope ratio mass spectrometers were put into operation. A new faculty member (Yang Wang) was hired jointly with the FSU Department of Geology. 1996 will be the first fully operational year of the Isotope Geochemistry/Mass Spectrometry Laboratory.
<p>
	The isotope geochemistry facility specializes in the precise and accurate determination of trace metal concentrations at very low levels in both natural and synthetic materials as well as the measurement of the natural variation in isotopic composition of materials. In addition to dating processes that occur on the timescale of thousands to billions of years, the techniques are also used to investigate the chemical structure of the earth as well as to allow investigations into the sources, severity, and remediation of heavy metal pollution in the environment.
<p>
	The addition of new faculty has broadened our expertise to include the "light" elements (hydrogen, carbon, oxygen and sulfur). The isotopic composition of these elements reveal information about the cycle of these elements in the environment and the anthropogenic influence on the hydrosphere.
<p>
	Access to the facilities in Isotope Geochemistry are open to any user on a collaborative basis. Requests should be made by contacting one of the investigators. The operating cost of the facility is primarily borne by grants to the individual investigators.
Instrumentation
<p>
	The Isolab 54 secondary ionization mass spectrometer represents the state of the art in secondary ion IRMS, and is used primarily for the determination of thorium and hafnium isotopes. Experiments involving the measurement of mercury isotopes have shown great promise and the technique for mercury isotopes will be further developed in 1996.
<p>
	A Finnegan MAT 262 RPQ was purchased with an NSF grant and state matching funds and delivered in September 1995. The 262RPQ is a thermal ionization mass spectrometer outfitted with nine collectors, an ion counting system and a Retarding Potential Quadrupole (RPQ). The RPQ addition to the mass spectrometer allows filtering of ions that interacted with the residual gas on their path to the analyzer, thereby increasing the abundance sensitivity. The 262RPQ currently defines the cutting edge in moderate mass resolution, high abundance sensitivity thermal ionization mass spectrometry. It will be used for the determination of the isotopic compositions of Sr, Nd, Pb, U, Th, Hf, and Os as well as for measuring the concentration of a large variety of trace elements using isotope dilution techniques.

<B>Industrial, Inter-Agency, and International Programs
</B><P> 
	From its inception, the NHMFL has recognized that the private sector must be an integral part of the laboratory's efforts to meet the challenges outlined in the National Science Foundation (NSF) solicitation leading to the establishment of the NHMFL:
<P> <i>...the laboratory is expected to engage in the development of future magnet technology. The development of new materials for high field magnets will be an important aspect of this activity.</i>

	<P> A partnership with the private sector broadens the talent pool and helps focus magnet and magnet materials development efforts. Thus, the laboratory has aggressively sought collaborations with the private sector and other institutions in order to respond effectively to the NSF charges and to broaden the impact of the federal and state investment. This led to the establishment of the NHMFL Industrial Affiliates Program during the first five years.<P> 

<B>NHMFL Industrial Affiliates Program</b>
<P> 
	The NHMFL Industrial Affiliates Program features several very important collaborations that (1) have enhanced the laboratory's capacity to address the needs of the users, (2) have leveraged the state-federal investment, and (3) are leading to stronger competitive positions for our affiliate industries. During the last year, the NHMFL expanded its collaborative efforts with the private sector to take greater advantage of numerous agencies' small business initiatives, such as SBIR and STTR programs, and explored new avenues for increased international cooperation leading to mutually beneficial partnerships. In addition, during 1995, the laboratory initiated a workshop program specifically focused at industrial applications of magnet technology and partnerships with the NHMFL, e.g., the second NHMFL materials workshop, Advanced Materials for Pulsed MagnetsCooperation with Industry, held October 12-13 at Los Alamos, and the Third International Symposium on Magnetic Suspension Technology held in Tallahassee on December 13-15 and co-sponsored by NASA and the NHMFL. We are planning The International Workshop on High Magnetic Fields: Industry, Materials, and Technology, which will be held in Tallahassee on February 28-March 1, 1996, The primary activities pursued during 1995 are summarized as follows.
<P> 
<i>Cryomagnetics, Inc., Oak Ridge, Tennessee.</i> Cryomagnetics, Inc. and the NHMFL are collaborating to develop a 18-20 T superconducting magnet system for the NHMFL's Ultra-High B/T facility at the University of Florida. The collaboration includes a sharing of magnet design, development, and testing information, along with specific projects focused on joint and impregnation areas. In addition, the NHMFL and Cryomagnetics, Inc., submitted an SBIR to develop a 20T+, 60mm+ warm bore, medium resolution (0.1 ppm over a 10 mm DSV) NMR system. This project will transfer the needed technology for Cryomagnetics, Inc., to develop a commercial high-field NMR program. The magnet resulting from this SBIR will be housed in the laboratory and support users programs.
<P> 

<i>Dow Chemical Co., Freeport, Texas. </i>CRADA with Los Alamos National Laboratory to study polymer and liquid crystal processing in high magnetic fields. This research uses NHMFL facilities at Los Alamos. A special furnace for polymer processing at temperatures up to 200 C was constructed and is being used in the 20 T superconducting magnet.
<P> 

<i>DuPont Central Research and Development, Experimental Station, Wilmington, Delaware. <i>DuPont, in collaboration with the ICR program, is concentrating on characterizing the size and shape of isolated gas-phase polymer ions. This experiment is the gas-phase analog of hydrodynamic determinations of frictional coefficients of macromolecules in solution.
<P> 

<i>Handy & Harman, Fairfield, Connecticut. </i> This collaboration focuses on the development of high-strength, high-conductivity wires, and plates for high-field resistive magnets. Advanced processing methods will be tested in consultation with material scientists from McMaster University who are also closely associated with the NHMFL.
<P> 

<i>Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC), Latham, New York. </i>An agreement has been reached to provide input and guidance in an Advanced Technology Program supported by NIST and awarded to IGC and DuPont on Technologies for High Temperature Superconductors for Magnetic Resonance Applications.

<TD>
<i>Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC), Latham, New York.</i> Collaborations on the design of the 45 T hybrid magnet already have resulted in unique and new manufacturing capabilities for the United States. IGC in cooperation with Gibson Tube developed a manufacturing process to produce extremely long cable-in-conduit conductors. During the last year, these facilities were used to process the cable-in-conduit conductor for both the Nb3Sn and Nb-Ti conductor for the superconducting outsert. This collaboration has increased U.S. competitiveness in large magnet systems, e.g., magnet systems responding to the need for the fusion program and superconducting magnetic energy storage devices.
<P> 

<i>Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC), Latham, New York. </i>IGC and the NHMFL jointly submitted to NIH a Phase II-SBIR proposal entitled: HTS Magnets for Ultra-High Field NMR Spectroscopy that has been funded. This laboratory-private sector program will develop a high Tc superconducting coil to provide an additional 2.5 T in a background field of 20 T and will help feed the 1.1 GHz (25 T) NMR magnet development program.
<P> 

<i>Intermagnetics General Corporation (IGC), Latham, New York.</i> IGC has entered into a collaborative program with the NHMFL to develop the 1.1 GHz high resolution NMR magnetPhase I, which is the design, fabrication, and installation of the wide bore 900 MHz NMR magnet. IGC is contributing $1,000,000 to this project. This joint effort will significantly advance U.S. industry another step toward establishing credibility in NMR magnet areas.
<P> 

<i>Intermagnetics General Corporation Advanced Superconductors, American Superconductors, Oxford Superconducting Technology (Carteret, NJ), Naval Research Laboratory.</i> Development and testing of advanced superconductors based on high Tc conductors is being conducted.

<TD>
<i>Oxford Instruments, Inc., Concord, Massachusetts.</i> Collaborations with Oxford Instruments focus on the development and testing of NMR performance under persistent and powered operations at reduced helium temperatures. Future high resolution NMR magnet systems for fields beyond the present commercial limits of 750 MHz will most likely require that the system operate in a pumped helium mode and possibly, non-persistent operation. The 720 MHz high resolution NMR that was delivered to the NHMFL during 1995 will be used to explore NMR performance at reduced temperatures, i.e., 2.2 K and under powered conditions. In addition, Oxford Instruments and the NHMFL are co-developing a 14 T split superconducting magnet for materials testing at the laboratory that was also delivered during this year.

<i>Supercon, Shrewsbury, Massachusetts. </i> Supercon, Inc. and the NHMFL have established a cooperative program to develop Cu-Stainless Steel (CuSS) wire for pulsed magnets. Supercon uses CuSS as electrical feed-throughs for some glass containers and have made several short lengths of wire for evaluation. Supercon is also cooperating with the NHMFL on the development of CuAgNb micro-composites, and this cooperative effort resulted in a Phase I SBIR proposal that was submitted to NSF.

<B>Inter-Agency Activities</B>
<P>
	The multi-disciplinary aspect of the laboratory and its commitment to magnet science and technology have led to opportunities to develop inter-agency programs that mutually benefit the laboratory's ability to response to user needs while addressing the mission-related goals of several other agencies. The multi-disciplinary programs in magnetic resonance and the unique instrumentation being developed by the NHMFL will respond to the goals of the Department of Energy, National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Defense. There are many other magnet technology areas where inter-agency cooperation has proven to be mutually beneficial.
<P>
<i>Department of Energy. </i>The NHMFL has entered into a cooperative program with the Department of Energy and Los Alamos National Laboratory to design and develop a 100 T, 24 mm bore, non-destructive magnet. This magnet has long been a dream of the U.S. user community and will significantly expand research opportunities at extremely high fields.
<P>
<i>National Aeronautics and Space Agency. </i>NASA and the NHMFL have established several areas of cooperation. The NHMFL, in collaboration with NASA, has designed and will build a 0.15 T, 3 KW, 190 mm bore shielded, water-cooled Bitter magnet for crystal growth in zero gravity. The magnet system and crystal growth experiment will be flown on a future shuttle flight. The NHMFL is also working with NASA on the design of a wide gap magnetic suspension system for levitating test models during wind tunnel testing. The laboratory and NASA also co-sponsored the Third International Symposium on Magnetic Suspension Technology, which was held in Tallahassee on December 13-15, 1995.
<P>
<i>Department of Defense. </i>The DoD has provided partial support for the development of the new University of Florida Brain Institute including the development of a 12 T, 40 cm warm bore MRI/S magnet that will be the centerpiece of the NHMFL MRI/S facility to be housed at the Institute. This user facility will be in a new 200,000 sq. ft. building and will provide a variety of MRI/S instruments in support of bio-medical research.

<B>Technology Transfer</B>
<P>
	The NHMFL is a founding member of the Gulf Coast Alliance for Technology Transfer (GCATT) that consists of eleven federal laboratories, four universities, and a consortium of community colleges in Northwest Florida. GCATT is an unprecedented, innovative partnership that links government technology and test facility assets to industry's technological needs. The ultimate goal is to foster and enhance the industrial and economic development of the states and region through the transfer of technology from federal and state engineering and science activities.<P>
<B>International Cooperation</B>
<p>
The NHMFL has pursued and established numerous international collaborations focusing on co-development agreements for new magnet systems, scientific exchanges, advanced magnet materials, and magnet designs including magnet optimization codes and test results. Most of these cooperative efforts are directed to non-commercially viable magnet systems, such as powered magnets and pulsed magnet technology and materials development. These cooperative programs have benefited the laboratory in many areas, and the NHMFL senses that international cooperation needs to remain an integral part of facilities development and utilization plans. A brief summary of the cooperative programs and target areas of cooperation are summarized below.
<P>

<i>A. A. Bochvar Institute, Moscow, Russia. </i>A CIS-IPP (Commonwealth of Independent States-Industrial Partnership Program) contract was funded by the U.S. Department of State for collaborations to develop, produce, and deliver advanced high strength, high conductivity wire for use in high field pulsed magnets. Special emphasis will be placed on CuNb, although other materials such as CuAg and stainless steel clad copper will be considered. The NHMFL and the Bochvar Institute also have established a complementary cooperative program in further development of low and high temperature superconductors for high field applications including examining the strengthening mechanism which may improve the overall performance of these conductors. The NHMFL will help focus this collaboration on specific conductor configurations critical to the NHMFL project goals and use the laboratory facilities to test and characterize material produced by the Bochvar Institute.
<P>

<i>All Russian Institute of Experimental Physics, Arzamas-16.</i> The NHMFL, the All Russian Institute of Experimental Physics, and LANL are collaborating to explore broad research opportunities in all areas of science at ultra high magnetic fields, i.e., in the 2,000 T regime. Through cooperation between the Los Alamos Dynamic Experimentation Division (DX) and scientists at Arzamas-16, a small number of flux compression generators have been obtained that are capable of producing 1,000 T. These devices are being made available to researchers, who explore science areas at extremely high magnetic fields.
<P>

<i>CNRS/MPIF High Field Magnet Laboratory, Grenoble, France. </i>This joint cooperation addresses the development of resistive magnets and housings with particular attention on 24 MW systems. It will help reduce each laboratory's individual costs to develop this next generation of powered magnet systems.
<P>

<i>European Community 100 T Pulsed Magnet Joint Development. </i>The NHMFL and representatives of the European Community have established a joint program to explore avenues for cooperation and testing leading to the design and development of non-destructive 100 T pulsed magnet systems. This collaboration will share material data, design concepts, and testing results, and will develop areas for additional international cooperation focused on the development of 100 T pulsed magnet systems. Two meetings of the Unites States-European coordination committee were held this year.
<P>

<i>High Magnetic Field Laboratory, Institute of Plasma Physics, Academia Sinica, Hefei, China. </i>The NHMFL and the High Magnetic Field Laboratory of the Institute of Plasma Physics signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on October 5, 1995. The MOU specifically focuses on cooperative programs to enhance the scientific and engineering competence of both laboratories through collaborative research and development programs and scientific exchange. Specific areas of cooperation include the design of resistive and hybrid magnets, the development of new high power density, high stress level Bitter plate geometries, and cooperation on the development of a 45 T, 2 second flat top, quasi-continuous, water cooled magnet for the laboratory in China.
<P>

<i>National Research Institute for Metals (NRIM), Tsukuba, Japan. </i>NRIM and the NHMFL have established a cooperative program to develop and evaluate high-strength, high conductivity wires and plates for applications in pulsed and continuous field magnets. In addition, the cooperation includes a sharing of magnet design efforts focused on the development of efficient resistive magnets in support of each laboratory's respective research needs and scientific exchanges. One aspect of the scientific exchange will be jointly sponsored conference or workshop each year rotating between the United States and Japan. This year, NRIM sponsored the International Workshop on Advances in High Magnetic Fields, February 20-22, and the second workshop, International Workshop on High Magnetic Fields: Industry, Materials and Technology, will be held in Tallahassee on February 29-March 1, 1996.
<P>

<i>Other.</i> In addition to the international collaborations listed above, the NHMFL has developed ongoing exchanges in a variety of areas with other international institutions, including, Laboratoria Nacional de engenharia e tecnologia Industrial, Portugal; McMaster University, Dept. of Materials Science and Engineering, Hamilton, Ontario Canada; the University of Iceland, Iceland; University of Manchester, England; Warwick University, England; University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Clarendon Laboratory, Oxford University, UK; and Service National de Champs Pulses, CNRS, Toulouse, France.

National laboratories have unique resources of scientists, engineers, and research facilities that can be used in innovative ways to strengthen learning experiences in science. The NHMFL is ever mindful of its role and responsibility to enhance science education at all levelselementary through postdoctoralas well as through vocational cooperatives and continuing education for science teachers. As an institutional citizen of the local community, state, and nation, the NHMFL strives to be an active contributor to making science education more participatory, especially for underrepresented populations.
<P>
During 1995, the NHMFL expanded its role in K-12 education programs. Locally and regionally, the NHMFL is a popular destination for K-12 students and classes: over 700 students visited and toured the facility this year, and another 800 people attended the annual Open House. Although students of all ages find magnetism interesting and provocative, there is a scarcity of quality educational tools and curricula to teach the importance of magnetism in our daily lives. The Florida Department of Education awarded the NHMFL a $75,000 grant to develop a summer mentorship program for science teachers. Several teachers representing various regions of Florida will spend six weeks at the laboratory paired with leading scientists, and, during this time, they will develop teaching units and hands-on experiments that build on their research participation. Not only will these new teaching resources go back to the classrooms of the teachers involved, but they also will be disseminated widely throughout Florida.

In the fall semester of 1995, the NHMFL participated in a mentorship program for local middle school gifted students. Teamed with in-house scientists, these students spent one day a week at the laboratory working on projects that were presented in a formal poster session. Twenty-three students performed some of the following projects: building and testing a pulsed magnet at 11 tesla; studying the transport properties of various materials including high Tc superconductors, conventional superconductors, normal metals, and semiconductors; developing a circuit to conduct tests of commercial amplifiers needed to make measurements in magnets at low temperatures; preparing, fabricating and testing superconducting tape; and growing and investigating crystals of drugs, cholesterol, and vitamins with polarized optical microscopy.
<P> 
	Neighboring Tallahassee Community College (TCC) and the NHMFL have formed a unique reciprocal relationship that has established a new position for the coordination and further expansion of the laboratory's K-12 education programs. Allen Mortham brings to this new position twenty-one years of experience in one of Florida's largest school systems, including teaching in grades K-12 and high school administration. A mentorship program at a local high school with an underrepresented population has been established for students with a proclivity toward science and math. Several enrichment workshops for high school teachers are being planned to better inform teachers on the impact of magnetism on modern science and technology and to obtain essential input from teachers in order to develop new educational tools in the numerous areas of magnet-related science and technology. TCC and the NHMFL are developing a summer program for outstanding high school math and science students that includes instructional as well as actual laboratory experience.

<P> 
	In close proximity to the NHMFL in Tallahassee, there are two elementary schools and one middle school, all with culturally diverse and mostly low-income student populations. The schools have formed a partnership to establish the Southside Academies for Mathematics, Science, and Technology that will be funded by a Goals 2000 grant from the federal Department of Education. The NHMFL is a partner in this project and will sponsor field trips and develop programs for interactions between students and scientists at the laboratory. Low-income students traditionally have had less access to the broad range of highly demanding mathematics and science courses, and this grant will open new opportunities for quality instruction in these critical curricula.
<P> 
	For the third consecutive year, the NHMFL conducted a summer research internship program for minority and women undergraduate students. The program is sponsored by the NSF. The Georgia-Florida Alliance for Minority Participation (AMP) and AMP directors throughout the country were extremely helpful to the NHMFL in identifying potential students. We look forward to continued cooperation between the AMP groups and the laboratory in expanding opportunities for minority students. For the first time this year the program was expanded to all three sites, and ten students participated. A 1995 participant, Larry Sears, commented, ...the entire experience was just what my education needed. Books and classrooms are fine but application of all those theories is so much more beneficial. Another participant, Noel Florez, who is majoring in Electronics Technology at New Mexico State University, interned at Los Alamos and conducted critical current experiments using the LANL 50 T pulse magnet and 20 T superconducting magnet. Intern Ton Cao is a Chemical Engineering student at the University of Florida, and he worked in Gainesville on the development of high performance resins for potting superconducting and pulse magnets.

<P> 
	For the second consecutive summer, three students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University (NC A&T) spent the summer working with scientists at the Pulsed Field Facility at Los Alamos on a grant from the Department of Energy and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities Outreach Program. The goals of this initiative are to promote competitive studies in the physics of new materials research and to assist faculty members in the Physics Department at NC A&T in attracting external funding and to promote students for graduate studies in physics. To accomplish these goals, Los Alamos is setting up satellite projects that are tied to the efforts at the NHMFL and LANL and are establishing an extended faculty visitor program. The satellite projects are focused on materials growth and characterization, magnetic-impurity studies of high Tc superconductors, and high magnetic field measurements in highly correlated electron systems.
<P> 
	In August the NHMFL hosted twenty-two undergraduate students participating in the NSF's Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) program at the University of Florida. The students hailed from colleges and universities from across the United States, and while most of these sophomores and juniors were chemistry majors, there were also aspiring teachers and mathematicians in the group. They spent the majority of their time at the laboratory meeting with scientists in the magnetic resonance group. Three students had the valuable experience of presenting papers to an assembly of peers and NHMFL researchers. The UF Chemistry Department recently had this NSF/REU program renewed through the summer of 1997.

<P> 
	The largest electric utility in the State of Florida, Florida Power & Light, is the first corporation to respond to our efforts to develop an undergraduate engineering fellowship program. Florida Power & Light will provide support of $5,000 per year for five years for a minority undergraduate engineering fellowship at the NHMFL and the FAMU/FSU College of Engineering. The NHMFL will provide a $5,000 match to the fellowship. The program will provide support for several talented engineering students to enter the College of Engineering and to participate in research at the NHMFL that complements their undergraduate studies in Mechanical or Electrical Engineering.

<P>
	The NHMFL and faculty are continuing to participate in the nation's only graduate engineering program in Magnet and Magnet Materials Technology at the joint FAMU/FSU College of Engineering. Students concentrate primarily on magnet design and magnet-related materials. For three years, the NHMFL in Tallahassee has participated in a highly successful cooperative program with vocational students from Taylor Technical Institute in nearby Perry, Florida. Each quarter, two or three students from the Electrical and Instrumentation Technology Program at the vocational school work in the laboratory and gain valuable practical experience. These students have been significant contributors to NHMFL operations, and several have become full-time employees.

<H2><b>NHMFL Achieves 33 T with 
New Magnet Technology</center><P></B></h2>
<p>
The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee set a third world record for the highest continuous magnetic field produced by a resistive magnet when it attained 33.1 tesla (T) in 32 millimeter diameter bore on February 5, 1996. Within hours of this event, a research group, using Dysprosium pole pieces to concentrate the flux, enhanced the field to 36.2 T and measured the Shubnikov-de Haas effect  in  the  organic  superconductor k-(BEDT-TTF)<sub>2</sub>Cu(NCS)<sub>2</sub> <a href="/focbrooks.html">(see Focus on Science).</a>

<p>
<i>Figure 1. NHMFL magnet site during mounting of coils.</i></center>
<p><p>
	The recent magnetic field record was made possible through two successful developments: the new technology of the "Florida-Bitter" design applied in a poly-Bitter configuration, as described later in this article; and the equally important cooperation between the Japanese National Research Institute for Metals (NRIM) and the NHMFL that resulted in a very advanced Cu alloy, consisting of Ag nanofilaments in CuAg matrix, that could be used as conductor material for the two innermost coils. This material combines, in a unique manner, high mechanical strength with high electrical and thermal conductivity and is the ideal conductor for very high field magnets. The material had been developed by NRIM and was made available to the NHMFL in the framework of a continuing cooperation.
<p>
		When operating, the 33 T magnet requires 140 liters of water per second. The pressure drop across the magnet is 35.5 bars. The water temperature rise is 33.5 degrees C, and the power consumed is 18.9 MW. The magnet weighs approximately 3.5 tons: about 1 ton of copper and 2.5 tons of stainless steel.
<p>
	This new resistive magnet system surpasses the old record of 30 T set by the NHMFL in March 1995 and is the latest in a long line of innovative resistive magnet designs that are focused on building user friendly magnets. The series of, as we call it, "small magnets," i.e. for up to 20 MW power consumption, has been revolutionary in reliability, extremely low vibration and noise level, accessibility, and ease of use. Now, with the new magnet, field levels are available to the user that previously were reserved only to hybrid magnets that are much bigger and more difficult to operate. Figure 1 shows several members of the Magnet Science and Technology team mounting coils at a magnet site.
<p>
	In 1993 at the NHMFL, we reconfirmed by Finite Element calculations that the traditional round cooling holes of Bitter magnets induce large stress and current density concentrations. A substantial increase in strength and reduction of power could be attained by using holes elongated in the circumferential direction. Stamping non-circular holes, however, was believed to be more expensive than round holes, so an alternative manufacturing procedure was sought. We discovered that photo-chemical machining could provide holes of nearly arbitrary shape with tolerances rivaling those of stamping. We then observed that highly elongated holes in a staggered grid result in a disk that is much more compliant in the radial direction than in the circumferential direction. This increased compliance reduces the radial stress transmission of the coil and, therefore, the stresses at the inner diameter considerably.<sup>1,2</sup> The culmination of these ideas was the 30 T "Florida Bitter" magnet design. Two of these magnets were delivered in March and April 1995 and have now accumulated over 600 and 500 hours of runtime respectively.
<p>

<p>
<i>Figure 2. Poly-Bitter coils of 33 T magnet are stacked at the NHMFL.</i></center>
<p><p>
	The 33 T magnet  is called the "Florida poly-Bitter" construction. The innermost (A) coil of the 30 T design has been replaced by two "sub-coils" (A1 & A2) connected electrically in parallel (see Figure 2). With this construction, the current density distribution is highly optimized, close to what can be achieved in a poly-helix magnet. The assembly cost, however, is much less and comparable to that of a Bitter coil. In addition, the cooling holes through the coil eliminate the cooling surface to copper volume constraint of the poly-helix concept.<sup>3,4 </sup>The A1 coil has only a 20 mm radial thickness while the A2 coil is 34 mm. With coils this slender, traditional 6 mm tierods would introduce stress and current density concentrations beyond the strength of the coils.  New, stronger obround (non-circular) tierods were developed for the A2 coils that are only 4 mm wide. The A1 coil has scallops at the outer diameter in which glass fiber rods are placed for alignment. Clamping of the A1 coil is provided by the tierods of the A2 coil.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
	To date, more than 120 different user groups have conducted research in NHMFL's resistive magnets. Their experiments have spanned a wide spectrum of science and engineering, including, hysteresis of magnetization, resonant tunneling, NMR, angular dependent magnetization, magneto-luminescence, critical fields, de Haas van Alphen, Shulbnikov-de Haas, superconductivity, magnetoresistance, hall voltage, pressure induced effects on conducting polymers, electron cyclotron resonance, quantum well structures, critical current versus field, and field dependence of far infrared spectra.

<H2><b>From the 
Director's Desk</B></h2><img src="jc.gif" width=57 height=59 >
<p>
The year 1996 marks the beginning of the second five-year period for the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. As we go to press with this issue of the NHMFL Reports, we await the decision of the NSF and the National Science Board on future funding. Certainly budget battles and blizzards in Washington have complicated the situation, but nonetheless we are hopeful that we will be allowed to continue and expand upon the enormous successes of the first five years.
<p>
	The next phase of the NHMFL will build upon the synergy of our three principal missions (1) activities in support of users' needs in broad areas of science and technology, (2) the development of an in-house science program that uses the existing facilities for excellent research and enhances those facilities on behalf of all users, and (3) activities in close partnership with the private sector that advance magnet technology and magnet materials engineering. This issue is packed with features on new magnet systems-the world record 33 T resistive magnet system; the 9.4 Electrospray FT-ICR Mass Spectrometer; and the 17.2 T high resolution spectrometer for EMR. In addition, the four remaining coils for the new 60 T quasi-continuous magnet have arrived at Los Alamos. All of these systems, along with the new instrumentation discussed in the <a href="atten_users.html">users' column</a>, provide members of the science and engineering communities with user friendly research facilities.
<p>
	The third mission noted above-establishing and developing close partnerships with industry-will be the focus of a great deal of attention during the next five years. Our NHMFL Industrial Affiliates Program already has resulted in many collaborations that will enhance the laboratory's capacity to address the needs of users, have leveraged the state-federal investment, and are leading to stronger competitive positions for our affiliate industries. For example, several collaborations are ongoing with Intermagnetics General Corp. of Latham, NY. Activities on the 45 T hybrid magnet, specifically those related to the production of extremely long cable-in-conduit conductors, have resulted in unique and new manufacturing capabilities for the United States. IGC also is contributing $1 million toward the 1.1 GHz high resolution NMR magnet-Phase I, which is the design, fabrication, and installation of the wide bore 900 MHz NMR magnet. As the 900 MHz, 60 T quasi-continuous, and the 45 T hybrid magnets near completion, the laboratory will be focusing on the next projects that address the needs of the user community.
<p>
	The needs list developed by the Executive Committee in consultation with the NHMFL Users' Committee and the External Advisory Committee includes many new challenges. To meet them, the laboratory will be exploring new affiliations with the private sector that will need to be structured around cost effective programs directed at meeting the needs of the laboratory and driving instrument development in the private sector. The laboratory will need to direct more of its efforts to identifying alternate resources to leverage the NSF and State support. The laboratory will pursue building broader inter-agency support for the programs in the laboratory and will pursue separate grant activity in partnership with the private sector, e.g., small business initiatives. In addition, the laboratory will pursue international collaborations that advance facilities and scientific exchange. The collaboration with the National Research Institute for Metals in Japan described in the cover story on the 33 T resistive magnet is an excellent example of the impact of a cooperative program and the potential for mutually beneficial partnerships.

<b>Shubnikov-de Haas Effect in the Organic Superconductor k-(BEDT-TTF)<sub>2</sub>Cu(NCS)<sub>2</sub> in a DC Magnetic Field Up to 36 T</b><p>

<i>J. S. Brooks, S. Hill, S. Uji, S. Valfells, P. Sandhu and T. Szabo, NHMFL</i>
<p>
	We have measured the Shubnikov-de Haas (SdH) effect in the organic superconductor k-(BEDT-TTF)<sub>2</sub>Cu(NCS)<sub>2</sub> in a DC field of 36 tesla (T). The measurements were made in the 33 T resistive magnet at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory (NHMFL) in Tallahassee, Florida. This constitutes the highest field achieved by a resistive magnet, surpassing the previous record set by the 30 T magnet also at the NHMFL. The field supplied by the magnet was enhanced by an additional 3 T using Dysprosium (Dy) pole pieces to concentrate the flux. Large SdH oscillations were seen with the 17th Landau level being reached at the highest field. In previous measurements performed by our group on the same material up to 30 T, only the 21st Landau level could be accessed. The additional SdH oscillations in the high-field regime provide valuable information about the behavior of magnetic breakdown in this material, which is sharply enhanced by high fields (Figure 1).
<p>

<img src="w963.gif">
<p>
<i>Figure 1</i><p><p>
<img src="w964.gif">
<p>
<i>Figure 2</i><p><p></center>

The field seen by the sample was calibrated by comparing the positions of the SdH peaks in the 36 T data with the 30 T data (Figure 2a). The field positions of all the SdH peaks in the 30 T data could be determined and a Landau level index assigned to each peak (Figure 2b). The value of the field for the corresponding peaks in the 36 T data was thus known because a given peak must always occur at the same value of B. The value of B for each peak was then plotted against the applied voltage V, across the magnet for that peak (Figure 3a).
<p>
	The points showed an excellent fit to a straight line B = 3.134 + 3.498*V in the range B = 10-30 T for which the data could be obtained. The y intercept of the line B<sub>o</sub>= 3.134 T represents the field supplied by the Dy. By 10 T the magnetization of the Dy has essentially saturated to its maximum value. Any dependence of B on the applied voltage above 10 T is therefore only due to the current in the resistive magnet and is expected to be linear in voltage. The maximum voltage applied was 9.4493 V giving a peak field of B<sub>max </sub> = 36.2 T, i.e. 33.1 T due to the magnet and 3.1 T due to the Dy. There is an error of approximately 2% in each of these values corresponding to the uncertainty in the fitting. The field calibration was confirmed by finally plotting the 36 T data as a function of field. The SdH peaks were found to be uniformly spaced in 1/B as expected. A FFT of the data (Figure 3b) revealed a fundamental frequency F = 602 T with peaks at higher frequencies owing to the occurrence of magnetic breakdown.

<p>
	The NHMFL opened the new year with a very special gathering on January 9: the Research Science Mentorship Program Presentations. Twenty-three gifted middle school students presented the results of their semester-long research projects to a packed auditorium. See pages 14-15 for highlights.
<p>
	Throughout the winter months, meeting and seminar rooms around the NHMFL in Tallahassee are nearly booked. Magnet Science and Technology continues the Monday Afternoon Seminars series, which promotes exchanges of information and resources among the laboratorys various programs, groups, and projects. The Condensed Matter/Theory Group held three seminars in January, five in February, and plans four in March. These seminars feature visitors from other universities and industry, and occasionally "one of their own." All of these regular lab-wide activities, and numerous others, have proven to be an enormously fruitful way to build new multi-disciplinary relationships that advance research, strengthen the intellectual unity of the laboratory, and enhance the scientific community at large. Other upcoming meetings, conferences, and activities are as follows.
<p><p>
<b>High Magnetic Fields: Industry, Materials, and Technology</b><br>

		<i>February 28March 1, 1996<br> 
		Tallahassee, Florida</I>
<p>
	This international workshop is the second in an ongoing series of reoccurring conferences on magnet science and technology cosponsored by the NHMFL and the National Research Institute of Metals (NRIM), in Tsukuba, Japan. The goals of the workshop are to evaluate and expand the links between magnetic fields and their present and future technical applications in industry.
<p>
	Talks given by leading experts will assess a range of topics, including technologies with impact on present and future industrial applications, magnet materials for technological needs, and magnet and cryomagnetic technologies. Invited speakers include Harry Jones, University of Oxford; Wolfgang Nick, Siemens; John Stekly, Intermagnetics General; Tsukasa Kiyshi, NRIM; and James Brooks, NHMFL/FSU.
<p><p>
<b>High Magnetic Field Users' Group Meeting</B><br>

		<i>March 17, 1996, 6:00-8:00 PM<br>
		St. Louis, Missouri, Convention Center<br>
		The America's Center, Room 263<br></i>
<p>
	The NHMFL Users' Group will meet on the Sunday before the American Physical Society March Meeting in St. Louis to learn of the latest developments at the NHMFL, to discuss plans for new user facilities at the laboratory, and to nominate three new members of the Users' Committee. Discussions of the plans and any other issues that attendees wish to raise will be lively. This gathering is also a time when NHMFL staff and scientists greet good friends, meet new ones, and enjoy the refreshments that Oxford Instruments generously provides.
<p>
	The Users' Group consists of all people who are interested in high magnetic field research and who therefore take an interest in the NHMFL. The Users' Committee has twelve members who review the lab's programs and future plans twice a year from the users' point of view; they advise the lab staff as needed. Nine members are from the various disciplines of condensed matter physics and engineering. The three members who cover magnetic resonance are nominated by the magnetic resonance users at the rate of one per year.
<p><p>
<b>NSF Chautauqua Program</B><br>

		<i>June 1315, 1996<br>
		Tallahassee, Florida</i><br>
<p>
	The NHMFL will offer a course, Magnetic Fields in Science and Technology, for college science teachers as part of NSF's 1996 National Chautauqua Short Course Program. The three-day, on-site class will be taught by NHMFL faculty and staff and will include a review of materials development and an introduction to applied superconductivity. The course will explore science and technology areas where magnetic fields play a critical role, such as transportation, energy storage, magnetic resonance imaging, and the development of new materials such as semiconductors, superconductors, and polymers.
<p>
	One session will address specific ways to bring magnetism and its impact on new science and technology to the undergraduate classroom. Teachers of undergraduate students are encouraged to participate.

	Imagine this:  You are twelve years old. You are standing at the front of the Main Seminar Room of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory. The room seems to be exceeding its capacity. Coffee, juice, and muffins are being served. Your science teacher is here; your mentor is here; your parents are here. Senior researchers from around the world are here; the NHMFL Director is here. The newspaper and TV<i> people</i> are here! All this, and you are the center of attention!
<p>
	Did you get a bit nervous just reading this vignette?
<p>
	Then you have an appreciation for the excitement in the air on Tuesday, January 9,1996, at 10:00 AM, when middle school students in the Research Science Mentorship Program brought their fall semester's research at the magnet lab to an appropriate conclusion-with oral presentations and posters.
<p>
	Twenty-three gifted students participated in this cooperative program designed to expose young people to the real world of science and to encourage them to continue their studies, particularly in math and science. These students spent one morning a week at the lab teamed with in-house scientists and engineers working on research projects related to the laboratory's science and technology activities. This partnership with the Leon County (Florida) Schools Academic Resource Center proved to be so successful that it will be repeated in Fall 1996.
<p>
	In the words of Director Crow, "these students have successfully completed some very impressive research projects." In fact, eleven projects have been selected for the 1996 Capital Regional Science and Engineering Fair to be held at Florida State University. Rather than put words in the mouths of our young people, we are pleased to let them speak for themselves! What follows are several abstracts written by the students, and while space prohibits printing all of them, these examples demonstrate the breadth and quality of their experiences and their accomplishments. 


<p><HR><b><H3>A FEW ABSTRACTS:</H3></B><HR>
<b>Students:	Jonathan Armstrong<br>
Mentor:	Bill Walker, Facilities and Operations<br>
Title:	Experimental Civilization on Water</b><br>
<p>
I started my project by brainstorming ideas that concerned both science and architecture. Designing an underwater city incorporates science into an area which I am interested in.
<p>
I researched my project by reading about cities that had been designed in unconventional environments, designing cities in general, and drawing architectural plans.
<p>
After I had completed my research, I determined which elements needed to be included in a city fit for human life. It was at this point that I decided that it would have to be located on top of the water, because of the immense water pressure on the ocean floor. I listed the ten elements which would have to be included in my city, and I made an abstract model showing how they relate.
<p>
I then drew a rough draft of the city on DataCAD, edited it, and then plotted an aerial 3D view of it. I drew a site section of the city on graph paper, and added scalees (people and trees to help show scale) to both.
<p>
I wrote a concept paper, the dimensions, population, and so forth of the city, and the hypothesis and conclusion. I put these on my backboard along with my aerial and site section.

<b>Students:	Lee Ziffer and Ryan Webster<br>
Mentor:	John Panek, Magnet Science & Technology<br>
Title:	Pulsed Electromagnet Reciprocating Generator (PERG)<br></b>
<p>
	Our project is called PERG (Pulsed Electromagnet Reciprocating Generator). We are investigating how energy moves and dissipates throughout our generator.
<p>
	It consists of an electromagnet pulsing on and off, pulling a connecting rod attached to a flywheel. As the flywheel turns, it powers the bike light generator. We pulse the magnet with a relay switch regulated by two bare wires touching against two conducting parts of the flywheel.
<p>
	On the flywheel, there are two conducting spaces. One is placed so that they are conducting when the rod is between 0 & 20 degrees (0 degrees straight up) so it will pull the magnetic connecting rod down. The other is placed between 180 & 200 degrees so it will pull the connecting rod back up.
<p>
	An important part of our project is the relay. The purpose of the relay is to turn on the magnet safely without 120 VAC wiring exposed. It acts like a switch except instead of pushing a mechanical contact it uses an electronically activated circuit. The 9 VDC battery turns on the 120 VAC current to the magnet through the relay. The bike generator turns mechanic energy into electromagnetic energy (light) and thermal energy (heat). By measuring these different types of energy we can see how they move and how they change into different forms.

<b>Students:	Lucas Watkins and Charles Wright<br>
Mentor:	Gang Cao, Science Program<br>
Title:		What is the Difference Between High and Low Temperature Superconductors?<br></b>
<p>
	The purpose of this project is to find what the fundamental differences between the high and low temperature superconductors are. The hypothesis of this project is that the differences between the high and low temperature superconductors are caused by the copper-oxide planes and the crystal structure of YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>, the high temperature superconductor that will be used in this project. Another difference might be the fact that the low-temperature superconductors that will be tested consist solely of metals, Lead (Pb) and Niobium Titanium (Nb<sub>0.6</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub>).
<p>
	The procedure to this project is as follows: (1) a sample of a superconductor was made using the elements Yttrium, Barium, Copper, and Oxygen. (2) The elements were mixed and compressed into a pellet. (3) An extra Oxygen atom was added by cooking the sample in an Oxygen furnace. (4) Then the elements were ground and compressed again. (5) A probe, used for the measuring of the compound, was made. (6) The compound and a thermometer were mounted on the probe. (7) The wires in the probe were hooked onto the voltmeter and current source. (8) The probe was dipped into a dewar filled with liquid Helium and the temperature was lowered. (9) The data were transmitted to the computer and plotted. This process was repeated for the Lead and Nb0.6Ti0.4 except steps 1-4.
<p>
	The YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub>  had a transition temperature of 92 K. The Lead (Pb) had a transition temperature of 6.6 K. The Niobium Titanium (Nb<sub>0.6</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub>) had a transition temperature of 9.4 K. It can be seen that the transition temperatures for the Nb<sub>0.6</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub> and Pb are much lower than those for theYBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> . (see charts) As stated in the Results section, the Transition temperature for the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> is much higher than that of the Pb and the Nb<sub>0.6</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub>. The question that we must address now is: What caused the transition temperature for the YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> to be so much higher than that of the Pb and the Nb<sub>0.6</sub>Ti<sub>0.4</sub>?
<p>
	This question is still unresolved in science, but the solution that is thought to be the closest to the correct solution is that the copper-oxide planes in YBa<sub>2</sub>Cu<sub>3</sub>O<sub>7</sub> cause the transition temperature to be higher.

<b>Students:	David R. Godwin and Michael G. Hovan<br>
Mentor:	Eric Palm, Instrumentation and Operations<br>
Title:		Pop! Goes the Op-Amp<br></b>
<p>
	The reason for this project is to find out if a commercially produced operational amplifier will function normally at low temperatures. If that is true, scientists could incorporate the operational amplifiers in their experiments performed at low temperatures.
<p>
	The hypothesis was that the operational amplifier would function normally at low temperatures.
<p>
	First, we soldered a voltage follower circuit, which included a 10K resistor and a DIP socket. The commercially produced CMOS ICL7611 operational amplifier was then plugged into the DIP socket. We tested the circuit at 300K (room temperature) as a control. We observed and recorded the wave form and the voltage. The wave form was observed on an oscilloscope and the voltage on a volt meter. We then tested the circuit at 77K by lowering it into a small thermos containing liquid nitrogen and observed and recorded the wave form and voltage. Next, we tested the circuit at 4.2K by taping it to a steel pole, inserting it into the mouth of a Dewar and slowly lowering it into liquid helium. Again, we observed and recorded the wave form and voltage. All of the results were recorded in our log and were later analyzed. Two circuits were made and the above procedure was followed for each.
<p>
	Circuit 1 functioned well when dunked in liquid nitrogen. The only place it acted strange was when it was tested at two MHz. At two MHz, a phase shift occured, circuit 1 also responded well to the liquid helium, although it did act funny from 2 KHz to 50 KHz. This strange reaction was characterized by jumpy, steeper waves that still had the same general pattern.
<p>
	Circuit 2 did not show abnormal behavior when it was dunked in liquid nitrogen; however, it did act strange when it was dunked in liquid helium. At 350 Hz, circuit two had intermittent behavior. As we increased the power, the problem went away. The Op-Amp burned out when the positive voltage was turned up to 14.5 V, and when the negative voltage was turned up to 13.5 V.
<p>
	In conclusion, the Op-Amp functioned normally at room temperatures and at 77K. At 4.2K, the Op-Amp worked well at low frequencies up to 1KHz; however, the power had to be increased as the signal frequency increased, in order for the Op-Amp to [work] effectively.
<p>
	Over all this Op-Amp would work well at low temperatures, down to 77K, and at low frequencies at 4.2K.

<B><h1>Visiting Users Achieve Record Field for Permanent Magnets</h1></B>
<P>
<P>     A visiting user group headed by Roy Weinstein, Director of the Institute for Beam Particle Dynamics at the University
 of Houston, attained a world record field for permanent magnets10.1 tesla at ~ 42 Kduring their visit to the
 NHMFL DC Field Facility in Tallahassee on June 12-15, 1995. The group included Yanru Ren, Jianxiong Liu, and
 Drew Parks, all of the University of Houston, and other collaborators were Charles Foster of the University of Indiana,
 and Victor Obot of Texas Southern University. The research was conducted in Cell 3 of the laboratory and the team
 used the laboratory's 20 T, 50 mm bore magnet and a temperature-controlled sample holder.
<P>
<P>     Weinstein described the benchmark achievement in a letter of confirmation to Bruce Brandt, Director of DC
 Users' Programs, dated July 5:
<P>
<P><I>     In a small mini-magnet fabrication, 2 cm diameter by 3.2 cm long, containing four quasi-crystals of high
 temperature superconductor, we have trapped a field of 10.1 tesla at ~42 K. 
Ten tesla has been our goal for several years and, like the sound barrier, it was hard to break. Several prior levels of understanding were first
 required. A finding previously reported to NHMFL showed that a small amount of cooling after activation reduces
 loss of field by creep practically to zero. Also, our group has studied cracking under magnetic pressure both
 experimentally and theoretically. We found it necessary to extend the theory of cracking, now in the literature, to
 include the activation process. The resulting extended theory guided us in avoiding the cracking region.
<P>
<P>     The magnet was produced at the University of Houston, activated at the National High Magnetic Field Lab,
 and contained pinning centers created by 200 MeV protons at the Indiana University Cyclotron Facility,
 Bloomington. The field achieved represents a world record for a permanent magnet ingot made of any material,
 and operated at any temperature.
<P>
<P>     It is an interesting vignette that an award (copy attached) was presented to our group, by the ISTEC/MRS
 program committee, at the 1995 International Workshop on Superconductivity, on June 21 of this year. This was
 for materials/devices which trapped 8.3 tesla at 54 K. This award was granted coincident with the achievement of
 10.1 tesla at ~42 K in our measurement at NHMFL.
<P>
<P>     Higher temperature trapped fields were also advanced by our group in the same time period. We have used
 processing developed by our group, based upon Y123 treated with short isotropic columnar pinning centers. These
 are designed to raise the irreversibility line to higher fields. As a result we are also happy to inform you that we
 have trapped a field of 3.1 tesla at 77 K. This field represents a record at liquid nitrogen temperatures.
<P>
<P>     Thus we are now able to produce very high field permanent magnets which are essentially stable.</I>
<P>
<P>     The award given to Weinstein states the &quot;The Program Committee of the 1995 International Workshop on
 Superconductivity, jointly sponsored by the International Superconductivity Technology Center and the Materials
 Research Society, presents R. Weinstein with <I>The Workshop Material/Device Performance Award</I>
 in recognition of superior performance in the category of Trapped Field Magnets.  June 21, 1995, Maui, Hawaii.&quot; We are pleased he
 chose the facilities of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory for his research.

<hr size=5><p>






<P>     As the laboratory moves into its next five years, the excitement driven by the potential of this unique state-federal
 partnership can only be matched by  August 17, 1990, when the National Science Foundation announced its intentions
 to place the new national magnet laboratory in Florida and at its associated sites. Reflecting back on the last five
 years, it is fair to say that we have gone further than we anticipated and that the NHMFL has truly emerged as one of
 the pre-eminent world centers for magnet-related research and technology. What has been created during this first
 five years is a unique combination of infrastructure and human resources poised to capitalize on an endless array of
 opportunities driven by science and technology.
<P>
<P>     Those contributing to the early success of the laboratory have been many. On behalf of the faculty and staff of the
 NHMFL, I would like first to express my appreciation to the State of Florida, its Governor, Legislature, and the
 Florida State University System, for providing the essential resources that have allowed us to exceed even our vision
 of five years ago. Secondly, I would like to thank the members of the NHMFL extended family, which includes the
 NHMFL staff and faculty who have toiled to make this vision a reality, and the members of the NHMFL Users' and
 External Advisory Committees, who have provided guidance and helped us hone our vision.
<P>
<P>     The importance of these two committees cannot be overstated. The official reports and the counsel of committee
 members help us channel our efforts and respond as best we can to the very broad needs of a user community that is
 both multi-disciplinary and multi-institutional. Look no further than Larry Campbell's column on the next page to see
 evidence of our willingness to listen and to respond. In addition, we also are pleased to announce that another user
 concernthe timely delivery of the 900 MHz NMR magnetis being actively addressed. We have commitments
 from the private sector to support magnet and instrumentation development of this unique system. The NHMFL is the
 only facility in the United States pursuing cooperation with the private sector to drive advanced magnetic resonance
 systems, and I personally see this area as having the most potential for user growth. These large high field NMR
 magnets are becoming an integral part of the planning process for other magnet laboratory facilities. There are recent
 indications that the Japanese want to build a 1 GHz magnet system, and in discussions with Grenoble and Nijmegen,
 they are using the possibility of a 900 MHz and other facilities to attract chemists and biologists to their magnet
 laboratories.
<P>     With the help of so many, the NHMFL has witnessed enormous progress. The initial construction phase of the
 first five years has giving way to &quot;phase two,&quot; which will be driven by the opportunities presented by science and
 technology. At this critical juncture, we are facing a new challengeone rivaled in its complexity only by the challenge
 of five years ago. How do we respond to the often competing demands and pressures for new and/or improved
 facilities, instrumentation, support, and services at a time when funding and other resources are limited? The answer,
 of course, lies in setting the rightor at least acceptablepriorities. For these decisions, we will continue to rely on
 the NHMFL Users' Committee, the External Advisory Committee, and other overseeing groups for guidance.
<P>
<P>     Many of these prioritization and funding issues will be addressed during the upcoming months as our Renewal
 Proposal undergoes evaluation. A National Science Foundation Site Visit Committee will conduct a three-day review
 of the Renewal Proposal in Tallahassee during mid-September. The recommendations from this review will help to
 determine the funding of the NHMFL during the next five years. Our vision for the future is conservative to reflect the
 present political climate and efforts to constrain the federal budget. We have been careful, however, to maintain the
 integrity of the primary charges given the laboratory by the National Science Foundation.
<P>
<P>     To this point in the NHMFL's short history, we have had three major thrust areas. As we evolve, they will
 continue to be central to our planning: (1) activities in <I>
support of the users' needs</I> in response to science and technology
 opportunities in broad areas of science and engineering, (2) activities in <I>
close partnership with the private sector</I> in support of advancing magnet technology and magnet materials engineering, and (3) the development of an <I>
in-house science program that is fully-integrated into the external users program</I>
 and that will advance the capacity of the laboratory to respond and drive new opportunities. The in-house and external user science efforts will be the
 underpinning of the laboratory's future successes and provide the matrixes used to measure the return on investment.
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 5 -->

<P>
<P>     All of these activities must be interwoven with our obligation and responsibility to address the educational goals
 of the United States...an important element of which is increasing the participation of women and under-represented
 groups in science and engineering. We are addressing these issues as you will read about on pages 8 and 9 of this issue
 of <I>NHMFL Reports</I>; nonetheless, we are always looking for new opportunities to share the enormous resources of the
 laboratoryour facilities and our peoplewith the next generation. Regardless of your affiliationprivate industry,
 government, or academiacome join us as we shape the face of the future.

<B><I><h1>Attention Users!</h1></I>
<P>Larry Campbell 
<P>Director for Pulsed Fields</B><p>
<hr size=5><p>
<P>
<P>At the last Users' Committee Meeting in May the Chairman, Horst St&ouml;rmer, summarized comments he had requested
 from users. Prominent among the things you, the users, wanted was more support at the Pulsed Field Facility (Los
 Alamos). Addressing this deficiency, which has resulted from the unanticipated growth in early user activity, has been
 a key aspect of our planning for the next five years. In the new contract period an additional instrument scientist (in
 optics) and an additional technician (in cryogenics) are budgeted. This is also the time, however, when there will be
 many more users because our &quot;big gun,&quot; the 60 T quasi-continuous (q-c) magnet, will be operating. Therefore, we will
 still be challenged to provide adequate service with available staffsomething we, nevertheless, will strive mightily to
 do. For August and September, we have temporarily engaged an additional technician to help with the load. In October,
 we expect to consummate closer organizational ties with Joe Thompson's Condensed Matter and Thermal Physics
 Group, which is a rich source of potential support.
<P>
<P>We also discussed at the May meeting how users could maximize the benefits of their pulsed magnet visits. Horst
 asked that these suggestions be publicized:
<P>
<P>&#183;     Prior preparation is the single most important factor. Precious days can be lost doing sample mounting or
 characterization that could have been done at the user's home institution.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Before you come, &quot;walk through&quot; the experiment (by phone) with your designated Los Alamos contact to
 be sure you both understand what is needed and how the experiment will be done.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Obtain a mutual understanding with your contact of what instruments and equipment are needed and the
 time required.
<P>
<P>&#183;     If in doubt, bring it. That is, bring any specialized software needed for data acquisition, analysis or transfer
 (e.g., to home institution), disk drives, sample prep devices, jigs, signal filters, special solvents or glues, etc.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Decide with your contact who will do what, especially in the case of experiments involving a team of
 outside people.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Have an auxiliary plan in case your delicate first plan fails. Or, try a test experiment first, to verify assumptions
 about the set-up of your main experiment.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Pre-mount your samples to the extent possible.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Understand that pulsed field experiments are different from DC experiments. For example, the dB/dt of the
 capacitor magnets produces about 10 mV/mm2 in areas normal to the field. Eddy current heating also can
 occur. The first visit is typically the least productive, so plan for it. A short, preliminary visit to learn about
 the facility and procedures can save time later. (The 60 T q-c magnet obviously will be much closer to
 continuous fields, but that is almost a year away.)
<P>
<P>&#183;     Although we &quot;strive mightily,&quot; 18-hour days and Sundays are still not routine for most of the NHMFL staff.
 We cannot let you run the pulsed fields alone.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Shop work done by a professional machinist is possible to address emergency needs but not routine, and
 may not be possible the hour you want it. We will continue to work with users to address unanticipated needs
 and alteratives in probes. Users can work in the shop, if certified. The fastest route is prior preparation. 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 8 -->

<P>
<P>On the NHMFL side the user should expect to be provided the advertised fields, temperatures, pressures, volumes,
 data acquisition, etc., as well as professional advice and assistance as needed. Collaborations with NHMFL or other
 Los Alamos staff are useful in allowing measurements to continue in the user's absence. Proposal forms via e-mail are
 available from <I>ljc@viking.lanl.gov</I>. (Follow-up experiments do not require a new proposal.)
<P>
<P>What (1) has happened recently, (2) is happening, and (3) will happen soon?
<P> 
<P>1.     Stan Tozer's diamond anvil cells were successfully used in 50 T pulsed field experiments in June (see <I>
Focus on Science</I>,<B> </B>page 11). These experiments, together with those by Alex Lacerda using the dilution refrigerator (25 mK
 at 50 T), demonstrate our capability in new regions of P-T-B space.
<P>
<P>     The U.S. DOE has given start-up funds for the 100 T nondestructive magnet. These funds were used to order a 2.4
 MJ capacitor bank in July. We are optimistic that DOE will provide funds to proceed with design and construction
 in 1996.
<P>
<P>2.     The nine coils for the 60 T quasi-continuous magnet fabricated by Everson Electric, Inc., Bethlehem, Pa, are now
 arrivingby September they should all be at Los Alamos.
<P>
<P>     Our 1.1 MJ capacitor bank will be upgraded to 1.5 MJ in September. This is in preparation for the 42 T long-decay
 magnet, which Paul Pernambuco-Wise (NHMFL, Tallahassee) promises in November. Before then Paul will test
 a new 60 T, 24 mm bore magnet, which we hope will become the standard user magnet (replacing the 50 T
 version). It should be pointed out that we, being a user facility, down-rate our magnets about 10 T for safety and
 reliability, so our 60 T magnet is what other people might call a 70 T magnet.
<P>
<P>     Please note what Bruce Brandt stated in the last issue of <I>
NHMFL Reports</I>: &quot;The NHMFL also has made the way
 easier for new users by making some travel support available. The idea is to ease the way for a couple of one week
 visits; this would allow some initial data to be taken to strengthen an application to the usual agencies for continuing
 support for a user's high field research.&quot; This is especially relevant to potential users of pulsed fields because such
 facilities are new to the United States.
<P>
<P>3.     The transformers in the power modules for the 60 T q-c had to be redesigned by the vender. As a result, the
 modules may not be delivered until May or June 1996. This is the critical path for the 60 T q-c. Sample pulse
 shapes for this magnet have been calculated and are available from <I>
ljc@viking.lanl.gov</I>. As a reminder, the 60 T q-c will be the first of its type in the United States and the most powerful of its class in the world (50% higher field,
 with more than twice the volume).
<P>
<P>Finally, I think I speak for everyone at NHMFL in saying we are extremely pleased to have brought a pulsed field
 user facility to the United States, and we enthusiastically accept the serious responsibility in the next five years to
 provide and to lead in the development of world-class experimental capability in pulsed fields.

<P>
<hr size=5>
<P> Once again this issue, we are pleased to announce awards and honors bestowed on
 members of the NHMFL faculty and staff and to introduce new people who will be continuing
 their research at the laboratory.
<P>
<P>&#183;   A multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional research team led by the University of Florida
 has been awarded a University Research Initiative grant by the Department of Defense
 in the area of &quot;Nanoscale Devices and Novel Engineered Materials.&quot; NHMFL appointees
 at UF,<I> Steve Pearton </I> and <I>Jeffrey Childress </I>
spearheaded this effort. Co-investigators included other NHMFL faculty: <I>
Selman Hershfield </I>and <I>Fred Sharifi </I> at UF and <I>
Steve Von Molnar</I> at FSU. The grant is for approximately $6 million over five years, and substantial
 matching funds from UF, NHMFL, and various industrial collaborators will amount to an
 additional $3 million.
<P>
<P>          The proposed research will develop new magnetic sensors and electronic devices on
 size scales smaller than present state-of-the-art limits. Such research will benefit the
 areas of magnetic detection and magnetic storage/retrieval directly and will have far
 reaching impacts in the field of micro-electronics.
<P>
<P>          While the main thrust of the research will occur at the Department of Materials
 Science and Engineering and the Department of Physics at UF, extensive collaborations
 will be ongoing with other members of the co-investigative team. These researchers
 represent other institutions and/or disciplines and greatly expand the potential
 significance of this effort. They include P.H. Holloway, R.E. Hummel, and E.P. Goldberg,
 UF; R.C. Dynes, F. Hellman, and I.K. Schuller, University of California San Diego; R.J.
 Colton, S.M. Hues, and L.J. Whitman, U.S. Naval Research Laboratory, and G.E. McGuire,

<P><h1><B><I>Newest Department at NHMFL:
<P>Isotope Geochemistry</h1></B></I>
<P>     In the last issue of <I>NHMFL Reports</I>, we introduced  Alan Zindler, chair of Florida State University's Geology
 Department and director of NHMFL's newest departmentIsotope Geochemistry. Zindler, Scholar-Scientist Vincent
 Salters, and Assistant in Research Afi Sachi-Kocher<B>
 </B>came to the NHMFL from the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory
 at Columbia University.  The department is joined by Leroy Odom, a professor at FSU and, beginning December, Yang
 Wang, currently a researcher at UC-Berkeley. The group, which also includes an engineer, six graduate students, and
 support staff, will focus their research in two areas: the chemical evolution of the earth in the most general sense and
 the behavior of trace elements in our present environment, i.e., soil, water, atmosphere, and ocean.
<P>
<P>     The group employs similar approach and analytical techniques for both research areas. They use mostly trace
 elements and isotopes to determine processes and timing. The decay of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes (parents)
 continuously change the isotopic composition of the element containing the decay product (daughter isotope).
 Consequently, the isotopic composition of a substance (rock, soil, water, etc.) reflects the time-integrated parent-daughter
 ratio. Since parent and daughter are different chemical elements, chemical processes that occur in the earth and on the
 earth's surface result in differences in parent-daughter ratios. To conduct their investigations and to determine the
 makeup of elements like strontium, neodymium, hafnium, osmium, lead, and thorium, the group uses isotope-ratioing
 mass spectrometry.
<P>

<img align=left vspace=10 hspace=20 src="SALTERS.GIF">

<P>     At present the department has one mass spectrometer in operation. This instrument has the capability of operating
 in both thermal and secondary ionization modes. As a secondary ionization mass spectrometer, it is the first to employ
 a multicollection system. A second, thermal-ionization mass spectrometer  is to be delivered in September, and the
 purchase of a third instrument is being planned. Each mass spectrometer has a different specialty that allows researchers
 to determine a subgroup of the above mentioned elements. Several of the current research projects are as follows.
<P>
<P>     &#183;     To further constrain the melting that takes place beneath the mid-ocean ridges with the aim of putting limits on
 the depth and extent of melting as well as velocities with which melts move beneath a mid-ocean ridge.
<P>
<P>     &#183;     To determine the Hf-isotopic composition of seawater and sediments with the aim of investigating whether the
 Hf-isotopic composition in sediments can be used as a measure of the activity of the mid-ocean ridge system through
 time. Better understanding of the ridge activity as a function of time will allow the group to assess whether the mid
-ocean ridge system has an influence on the climate.
<P>
<P>      &#183;  To develop a technique to make high precision isotopic analysis of mercury. Elevated concentrations of mercury
 in fish is a global phenomenon that has developed since the industrial revolution.  The mass fractionation of the eight
 natural mercury isotopes that occurs during industrial, geochemical, and biochemical processes could provide natural tracers   of   the   sources   and pathways   of   mercury  in  the environment.
<P>
<P> &#183;    To study the role of climate in determining the rate of carbon cycling in soil organic matter using a combination of carbon and nitrogen isotopic techniques, CO2 fluxes from soils, and measurements of soil organic carbon and nitrogen inventories.

<B><h1>Improved Homogeneity Resistive Magnet for Magnetic Resonance</h1></B>
<P>
<P>Timothy A. Cross, NHMFL Acting Director for New Initiatives and Professor of Chemistry
<P>William G. Moulton, Professor of Physics
<P>
<P>     The NHMFL Resistive Magnet Group successfully tested a new resistive magnet design on July 27 that improves
 Bz homogeneity by more than an order of magnitude. A magnetic resonance line width of 2.8 kHz (7.2 ppm) was
 observed from a small sample in this magnet, which has a maximum field of 22.4 T and a 32 mm bore. The field plot
 indicated a residual Z1 gradient (23 gauss/cm over 3 cm on the Z axis). This has been addressed by realigning the
 magnet coils. New measurements of the gradient and homogeneity will be performed in late August. We expect to see
 improvement of the Bz homogeneity by another factor of 5. Further improvement in homogeneity may be obtained
 through either additional coil adjustment or the addition of shim coils in the bore.
<P>
<P>     For more than a year a condensed matter NMR group has been carrying out NMR experiments in the previous
 resistive magnets in fields of up to 30 T and from 1.5 K to 300 K. Instrumentation and techniques have been developed
 to the point that such experiments are now routine. These experiments have been limited by the inhomogeneity of the
 magnets (100-200 ppm over 2 mm) to very broad lines or T
1 measurements. Considerable new and interesting data
 have been acquired in this new magnetic field regime on field dependence of T
1, optical pumping efficiency, and field induced spin density waves. Examples of systems currently being studied, in collaboration with other NHMFL and
 external scientists,  include 7Li and 139La in La2
Cu1-x LixO4 for x=0.01 to x=0.10, spin density wave states in quasi 1
 and 2 dimensional organic conductors, optically pumped (NMR detected) 
69Ga in GaAs and 139In in InP (see <I>NMMFL Reports</I>
, Spring 1995), and 17O in Y1Ba2Cu3O7-d. 
<P>
<P>     The advent of the higher homogeneity magnet, even at its present homogeneity, opens many new opportunities for
 the use of NMR in high field studies of condensed matter systems. Substantial improvements, however, are both
 possible and necessary for additional applications in chemistry, biochemistry, and biology. In signal averaging over a
 period of time the temporal instability of the power supply presently adds 4 gauss (equivalent to 16 ppm) to the
 resonance line width. A flux stabilizer is being assembled to correct for the power supply ripple. An additional challenge
 involves the ramping of magnets in neighboring cells to full field. Ramping the nearest neighbor magnet from zero to
 full current caused an offset of 40 ppm. Extensive signal averaging will therefore require an NMR lock to achieve
 optimal field stability. Once such magnet and power supply challenges have been met, both static inhomogeneity and
 temporal instabilities should be reduced to a few ppm in this magnet.
<P>
<P>     With such capabilities the application window expands for solid state NMR spectra of powder and oriented samples
 in inorganic, organic, polymer and biochemical samples. The observation of nuclei with very low gyromagnetic ratios,
 such as 89Y and 57Fe will be greatly enhanced. Observation of oddhalves spin quadrupolar nuclei such as 
27Al, 23Na and 17O will benefit from the field strength, due to the increased dominance of the Zeeman interaction over the quadrupolar
 interaction and the reduced second order effects in the observed spectra. 
2H NMR spectra will benefit from shorter acoustic ringdown times and the much greater observation frequency in this resistive magnet. Field strength dependence
 of relaxation properties is important in a very diverse range of samples. This magnet will allow observation over a
 greater range of frequencies than has been available before for such studies. This magnet is a stepping stone to higher
 homogeneity with resistive magnets that will allow magnetic resonance techniques not only in NMR but also in electron
 magnetic resonance (see related article, page 5) and in ion cyclotron resonance to move to much greater field strengths
 than those available in superconducting magnets for the foreseeable future.

<h1><b><i>Our Dedication </b></i>



<P><I><b>1994's Feature Event</I></b></h1>


<hr size=5>

<img align=RIGHT vspace=11 hspace=21 src="gore.GIF">

<P>     On October 1, 1994, Vice President Al Gore joined over 1,000 dignitaries, visiting scientists, and citizens to
 dedicate the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. He referred to the &quot;Mag Lab&quot; as &quot;<I>
a mecca</I> for scientists and engineers at the frontiers of science&quot; and called it &quot;<I>
a new vision</I> for science in this century [linking] science education to national goals and the future of America.&quot;


<P>    <I>It was a day to celebrate extraordinary partnerships: </I>
<P>&#183;     The National Science Foundation and the State of Florida
<P>&#183;     Florida State University, the University of Florida, and Los Alamos National Laboratory
<P>&#183;     Science, education, government, and industry.
<P>     <I>It was a day to recognize the people </I>
who made this new laboratory possible: NSF Director, Dr. Neal Lane; former
 NSF Director, Erich Bloch; Florida Governor Lawton Chiles; Senator Bob Graham; Florida State University System
 Chancellor Charles B. Reed; University of Florida President John Lombardi and Florida State University President
 Talbot D'Alemberte; NHMFL Director Jack Crow; Co-principal Investigators Dr. Don Parkin (LANL) and Dr. Neil
 Sullivan (UF); Nobel Laureate Dr. J. Robert Schrieffer; and others.
<P>     <I>It was a day to stand in awe of the sparkling new &quot;hub&quot; of the NHMFL</I>
 and the facilities designed and built specifically to accommodate high magnetic field equipment and research. They include:
<P>&#183;     200,700 sq. ft. of space dedicated to magnet development, general research, cryogenics, user support, in
-house science, and administrative offices
<P>&#183;     73,000 sq. ft. of new space housing 16 resistive and hybrid magnet test cells, the 40 MW power supplies and
 cooling equipment, and machine shops
<P>&#183;     3,800 sq. ft. of new space designed for millikelvin research and housing three magnet stations
<P>&#183;     24,500 sq. ft. of new space designed for high resolution magnetic resonance research and housing five magnet
 areas, user equipment, and other facilities.
<P><I>     It was a day to speculate on the future</I>
. In Dr. Schrieffer words, &quot;From computer chips to drugs and from solar
 panels to fiber optics, the development of new and better materials comes about largely through basic research...The
 backbone of U.S. competitiveness is anchored in strong basic research exploring the fundamental properties of new
 and advanced materials. The products of basic research feed new technologies and economic growth which, in turn,
 feed the future of science.&quot;
<P>     The research conducted in Tallahassee, in Gainesville, and in Los Alamos, will cross scientific and engineering
 disciplines and will lead inevitably to breakthroughs in medical imaging technology, electrical power generation,
 computers, production of new high tech materials, and areas too numerous to mention.
<P>     Through <I>NHMFL Reports, </I>we intend to keep you apprised of our people, our science, and our evolution. The
 dedication on October 1, 1994 was the beginning. As time goes on, we expect to offer broader, ever better facilities and
 support for your science and research. Come join us.

<h1><b><i>NHMFL Produces 30 Tesla and Sets New World Record!</h1></b></i>

<hr size=5>
<img align=LEFT vspace=11 hspace=21 src="30T.GIF">
The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee set a second world record for the highest continuous
 magnetic field produced by a resistive magnet when it attained 30 tesla (T) in 32 millimeter diameter bore on March
 18, 1995. The announcement came at the Users' Group meeting held in conjunction with the 1995 American Physical
 Society March Meeting in San Jose, CA.
<P>     This new resistive magnet system surpasses the world record magnetic field strength of 27 T set by NHMFL in
 June 1994. It is a water-cooled copper-alloy magnet that incorporates several entirely new features, including a new
 concept of cooling to cope with the extremely high power density (12 W per mm
3) and the stresses due to the Lorentz force (800 MPa). Other unique features are its compact construction, easy access, user friendliness, and its extremely
 low vibration and noise levels.
<P>     During the test, fourteen hundred gallons of water per minute entered the top of the magnet at 47&#176; F and 300 psi,
 flowed through the magnet extracting 15 MW of heat, and left the bottom at 118&#176; F. The magnet weighs approximately
 3.5 tons: about 1 ton of copper and 2.5 tons of stainless steel.
<P>     This 30 T magnet is the sixth in a series of resistive magnets being built at the NHMFL. At the present time, there
 are two magnets that provide 20 T (which were built in cooperation with the High Magnetic Field Laboratory in
 Grenoble), three that provide 27 T, and the new 30 T. Construction is underway on another 30 T magnet and a 33 T that
 will be finished in the fourth quarter of 1995. These magnets will then replace, step by step, the 27 T magnets. A new
 series of high performance magnets will be developed in the next five years.
<P>     The 27 T magnet has turned out to be a very reliable magnet. It has more than 1,500 hours of service without any
 change in resistance being registered.
<P>     To date, more than 43 user groups from 21 institutions have conducted research in NHMFL's resistive magnets.
 Their experiments have spanned a wide spectrum of science and engineering, including, hysteresis of magnetization,
 resonant tunneling, NMR, angular dependent magnetization, magneto-luminescence, critical fields, de Haas-van Alphen,
 Shulbnikov-de Haas, superconductivity, magnetoresistance, hall voltage, pressure induced effects on conducting
 polymers, electron cyclotron resonance, quantum well structures, critical current versus field, and field dependence of
 far infrared spectra.
<P><I>30T UPDATE! </I>A second 30 T resistive magnet was installed and operated at full field on April 27th.

<hr size=5><p>


     The year 1994 will be remembered as a pivotal year in the history of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.
 As features throughout this issue of <I>NHMFL Reports</I>
 attest...we have been <I>very</I> busy! Vice President Gore visited
 for the official dedication, and the magnet development program in Tallahassee successfully produced and tested
 four resistive magnets, including two of the world record 27 tesla (T) variety. Researchers tested two coils for the 60
 T magnet being designed and produced at Los Alamos, and the ultra-high B/T facility is being designed and constructed
 at the University of Florida. Thus far in 1995, we have installed not one but two 30 T resistive magnets.
<P>     Facilities and programs set forth in the initial five-year National Science Foundation grant have been completed
 on or ahead of schedule and other new missions are well underway. Throughout this entire process, our focus has
 stayed on the requirements of the user community. From the building design concept, which features open bays
 suitable for coordination and cross-disciplinary research, to the broad-based staff and associated faculty, the &quot;Mag
 Lab&quot; stands on the verge of extraordinary breakthroughs in science and technology.
<P>     This is not to say that during 1994 research and science took a back seat. Quite the contrary. The number of
 research reports in our Annual Report to NSF increased by 125 percent over the 1993 Annual Report. A few highlights
 are included here to demonstrate the breadth of the activity:
<P>&#183;     E.G. Haanappel and A. Lacerda of NHMFL&#173;LANL, along with researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory
 and Iowa State University, measured the de Haas-van Alphen effect, magneto-resistivity, and magnetization of
 the icosahedral quasicrystal Al71Pd20.5Mn8.5 in high magnetic fields. The measurements were done in a 50 T
 pulsed magnet and a 20 T superconducting magnet.
<P>&#183;     R. Bowers at NHMFL&#173;UF observed dynamic polarization of quantum confined GaAlAs for the first time in
 very high magnetic fields. While these experiments are still in the early stages, he reports that conventional 
31P NMR signals have been obtained from an InP single crystal at 18 T and 2 K using the 20 T Bitter magnet. (See
 May 1995 update, page 11.)
<P>&#183;     A. Petrou and three graduate students from the State University of New York at Buffalo used the NHMFL
 visible magneto optics instruments to study spin superlattice formation in ZnSe/Zn
0.96Fe0.04Se quantum wells and G-C band resonance in GaAs/AlAs quantum wells.
<P>&#183;     D. Awschalom and a graduate student from the University of California at Santa Barbara studied the magnetization
 state of ferritin in magnetic fields to 27 T. Ferritin is a naturally occurring molecule that has many features in
 common with reduced dimensional structures grown in semiconductors.
<P>&#183;     A group of scientists and researchers from AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories conducted studies toward the Aharonov
-Bohm effect of composite fermions at half-filling. They observed geometrical resonances associated with
 semiclassical orbits commensurate with the width of the ring. A clear signature of Aharonov-Bohm effect of
 composite fermions remains inconclusive.
<P>&#183;     H. W. Jiang of the University of California at Los Angeles, along with several graduate students, performed a
 sequence of transport experiments on a low-density, strongly disordered two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG)
 in a gated GaAs/AlxGa1-xAs heterojunction. In addition, they studied the scaling properties of the disorder
 tuned phase transitions between quantum Hall liquid and the Hall insulator.
<P>     In sum, 1994 and the early years of the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory have been jam-packed with
 activity. Unfortunately, for a while we have been too busy to publish <I>
NHMFL Reports.</I> We are pleased, however, to be back on track. We expect to use this quarterly newsletter to communicate news of the scientists and engineers
 using the lab, reports of their research, and details on the ever-expanding facilities and services. We are confident
 that when your work brings you to Tallahassee, to Los Alamos, or to Gainesville, you will be met by the finest
 magnetic research facilities and staff in the world.

<h1><b><i>

From the Chief Scientist's Chair 
</h1></b></i><p>

<hr size=5><p>


     The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is completing the first phase of its commitment to the National
 Science Foundation and the State of Florida, and to you, the users. The facilities and the programs have taken shape,
 and we are now beginning the all-important second phase that focuses on science, research, and inevitably discovery.
 To that end, the NHMFL In-House Science Program and a Science Program Committee have been established.
<P>     The purpose of the Program is threefold:
<P>&#183;     To utilize NHMFL facilities for high quality science
<P>&#183;     To develop the facilities for enhanced research capabilities
<P>&#183;     To couple with and support outside users in research activities.
<P>     As you review the list of committee members, I would ask you to note the range of their scientific disciplines and
 their affiliations. The varied make-up of the committee is intentional. It addresses the overriding theme of the Science
 Program: To promote cross-disciplinary research that capitalizes on the widest variety of instrumentation, facilities,
 and expertise in the world...the resources available at NHMFL's three sites. The distinguished members of the committee
 are as follows:
<P>&#183;     Kevin Bedell, Theorist, Los Alamos National Laboratory
<P>&#183;     Geoffrey Bodenhausen, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance, Florida State University
<P>&#183;     Jim Brooks, Condensed Matter, Florida State University
<P>&#183;     Zachary Fisk, Condensed Matter, Florida State University
<P>&#183;     Lev Gor'kov, Theorist, Florida State University
<P>&#183;     John Graybeal, Condensed Matter, University of Florida
<P>&#183;     Chris Hammel, Condensed Matter, Los Alamos National Laboratory
<P>&#183;     Kevin Ingersent, Theorist, University of Florida
<P>&#183;     Tom Mareci, Magnetic Resonance Imaging, University of Florida
<P>&#183;     Alan Marshall, Ion Cyclotron Resonance, Florida State University
<P>&#183;     Joe Thompson, Condensed Matter, Los Alamos National Laboratory
<P>&#183;     Stan Tozer, Condensed Matter, Florida State University
<P>&#183;     Stephan von Molnar, Condensed Matter, Florida State University
<P>     Ex-officio members include Bruce Brandt, Larry Campbell, and Hans Schneider-Muntau, along with co-principal
 investigators, Jack Crow, Don Parkin, and Neil Sullivan.
<P>     In future issues of <I>NHMFL Reports</I>, I will share with you some of the new directions we envision for
 thermodynamic technology, magnetic resonance, spectroscopies, and materials synthesis. We are confident that the
 magnet-related research discoveries of the 21st Century will occur at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory.
 And maybe sooner than then!

<h1><b><i>Attention Users!</h1></b></i>
<hr size=5>

<I>     This issue's column comes from Bruce Brandt, NHMFL's Director of Instrumentation and Operations and discusses
 the DC high field facilities. Upcoming issues will feature other user facilities offered in Tallahassee, Gainesville, and
 Los Alamos. See the chart on page 5 for contact information.</I>
<P>     There are just three things that users need to know right now. They are (1) the newest NHMFL DC magnets are
 extremely quiet, (2) the instrumentation needed for research has been in place and producing results for some time,
 and (3) limited travel support is available to new users. What else does anyone need to know?
<P>     People who have been frustrated in the past by the difficulty of making measurements in high DC magnetic fields
 should set aside their reservations and come see what the NHMFL has to offer. Sensitive measurements that could not
 be made before because of power supply ripple and/or magnet vibration (or required considerable effort to work
 around the problems) can be done now very easily in Tallahassee. The DC magnet power supplies are stable and quiet
 enough to permit nuclear magnetic resonance experiments in all of the resistive magnets. All of the magnets also
 benefit from the low vibration cooling system, but the newest magnets are even an order of magnitude quieter.
 Acoustic noise and vibration are so low that they are almost silent. In fact, the safety committee is <I>
insisting</I> that we install a visible indicator of the magnetic field so people will know when the magnet is in use!  Magnetic fields of such
 quality challenge experimenters to think of new experiments to exploit them. They also challenge the providers of
 instrumentation to match the field, noise, and vibration quality.
<P>     Fortunately, the instrumentation is in place. Measurements of magnetic moment can be done with a sensitive
 cantilever beam force magnetometer. Low to medium homogeneity nuclear magnetic resonance is a useful probe of
 solid samples. Magneto optical instruments cover the entire spectrum from the near ultra violet to the far infrared.
 Transport experiments can be done at temperatures from 20 mK to 300 K, pressure to 8 GPa, and with full rotation
 about a single axis perpendicular to the field. Optical and transport measurements often can be combined on a single
 sample. These instruments have been developed and are supported by Operations Group staff.
<P>     All of this instrumentation has been described before. The difference now is the amount of use it has had. We are
 very proud of the number and quality of presentations by NHMFL staff and visitors at the recent American Physical
 Society March Meeting. These researchers have helped to develop the facilities and have made the way easier for
 those who follow.
<P>     The NHMFL also has made the way easier for new users by making some travel support available. The idea is to
 ease the way for a couple of one week visits; this would allow some initial data to be taken to strengthen an application
 to the usual agencies for continuing support for a user's high field research. Scientists new to high magnetic field
 research and old hands who have not yet worked in Tallahassee can come test for themselves our quiet, high quality
 magnetic fields, state of the art instrumentation, and first class support.

<H1><b><i>In Search of Magnetic Indicator</h1></i></b>


<P>     A <B>contest</B> is hereby announced! Our magnets are <I>
so</I> quiet that we need a way for users and tourists to know that
 they are on. That is, we need a readily visible indication of the magnetic field. It should be imaginative and visually
 interesting if possiblea piece of kinetic sculpture. It must be inexpensive (less than $500 each for 10 to 16 pieces)
 and very durable. It must do its work without emitting any electrical or other noise that interferes with the experi
ment or experimenters. A 0 to 10 volt, 0 to 5 mA signal proportional to the magnet current is available. The unit may
 be wall or floor mounted. It must be easy to move if it stands on the floor.
<P>
<P>     The <B>prizes </B> are the opportunity to make a speech on any subject at the party honoring the installation of the first
 one and your choice of any one item from the Friends of the NHMFL Boutique (necktie, t-shirt, and so forth).
<P>
<P>     Entries will be judged by members of the Instrumentation and Operations group and the Users' Committee.
 Decisions of the judges will be final. The judges have the right to reject all proposals and try again some other time.
<P>
<P>     This contest is open to anyone who learns about it. Contestants may apply to Bruce Brandt
 (brandt@magnet.fsu.edu, (904) 644-3056) for access to a magnet cell for inspiration or to learn details necessary

<h1><b><i>60 T Magnet: One Step Closer to Reality</h1></b></i>

<hr size=5>
<P>     
<img align=right vspace=11 hspace=21 src="60T.GIF">
In December 1994, researchers at NHMFL&#173;Los Alamos successfully tested two of nine coils designed for the 60
 tesla (T) magnet that will be completed there later this year. This magnet will be the most powerful one of its kind in
 the worldone and a half times stronger than the magnet's forerunner at the University of Amsterdam.
<P>     The magnet system has several unique features that will make it an extraordinarily powerful research tool. The
 bore is 32 mm, which gives space for large samples, dilution refrigerator inserts, pressure cells, etc. The magnet
 system is &quot;power-controlled,&quot; i.e., pulse shapes of almost any kind can be generated. Flat top for 100 ms, stepwise
 increase or decrease, slopes, exponential decayall these and many other pulses are possible.
<P>     Recent tests validate the design and manufacturing procedures for the magnet coils and demonstrate that the coil
 material will reliably and safely withstand the electrical and mechanical stresses of the 60 T magnet. The copper
-alloy coils, designed by Los Alamos scientists, evolved from previous magnets but incorporated solutions to problems
 of reinforcement, insulation, and heat dissipation never before used in high-field, pulsed-magnet construction. The
 designers say the present approach has enough growth potential to generate 100 T in a nondestructive magnet.
<P>     The new multi-ton magnet consists of nine nested coils that are mechanically independent. The coils are combined
 electrically into three groups that are pulsed sequentiallya technique that reduces heating and enables quick cooling
 and turnaround time. This design allows researchers to reuse the magnet in less than an hour after a pulse. Researchers
 also can customize and optimize the field behavior to fit the experiment.
<P>     The long, high-field pulse and relatively large sample chamber require high energy and large amounts of power
 that would drain a commercial power grid and that a capacitor bank could not provide. The 1.4 GW electrical
 generator that Los Alamos recycled from a canceled Tennessee nuclear power station (see <I>
NHMFL Reports, Vol. 1, Issue 2</I>) will provide the electricity to power the magnet.

<h1><b><i>Ultra-High B/T Facility</b></h1></i>
<hr size=5>
<P>
<P>     A special annex facility for studies of materials at ultra-high values of the ratio of magnetic field to temperature (B/T) is being developed as a collaborative effort between the NHMFL and the Microkelvin Research Laboratory at the University of Florida in Gainesville. The B/T ratio of 40 kT/K will be the highest available anywhere for users who need both high magnetic fields and ultra low temperatures simultaneously.


<P>     A specially designed dilution refrigerator from Oxford with cooling power 700 &#181;W at 10 mK and base temperature 4.2 mK has been installed and is scheduled to be tested in the summer of 1995. A slide tube allows the dilution refrigerator to be withdrawn from the dewar, leaving the magnet at helium temperature, for rapid change of samples
 when used in the bottom-loaded mode. Cooling the DR back to 10 mK requires only 12 hours. The system also is being designed for top loading of samples.

<img align=left vspace=11 hspace=11 src="ultra_fig1.GIF">

<P>     A nuclear demagnetization stage consisting of 5 moles of PrNi
5 and the equivalent volume of copper, is under construction. The dilution refrigerator will precool the bundle to 10 mK in 8 T. The temperature will be below 500 &#181;K
 after demagnetization and will stay below 1 mK for several weeks with a heat load of a few nanowatts.

<h1><b><i>Dr. Marshall Directs New Ion Cyclotron Resonance Center</h1></b></i><p>
<hr size=5>


<P>     In September 1994just prior to NHMFL's official dedication in Octoberthe National Science Foundation
 approved a $5 million, five-year grant to establish the Ion Cyclotron Resonance (ICR) National Center at the
 laboratory in Tallahassee. Dr. Alan G. Marshall, along with co-principal investigators Dr. John Eyler, University
 of Florida, and Dr. Shenheng Guan, NHMFL, will direct the program that promises to advance the field of ICR
 mass spectrometry far beyond present technologies.
<P>     The highest field ICR system currently available in the world is a 7 tesla (T). The NHMFL will install  a
 9.4 T, 200 mm warm bore ICR magnet system that will be the world's most powerful superconducting magnet
 designed for ICR use.
<P>     Dr. Marshall transferred to Florida State University and NHMFL from Ohio State University  in 1993 in
 the hope that the proposal would be funded. He reasoned that since the federal government had selected
 Tallahassee to be the central site of the nation's magnet development program, the site for ICR researcha
 relatively young fieldneeded to be close by. In Marshall's words, &quot;This is going to be the best ICR lab, and
 very soon. The grant will allow us to build a state-of-the-art facility right away and to maintain that level
 continuously.&quot;
<P>     Dr. Marshall is a co-winner of the 1995 American Chemical Society Field/Franklin Award in Mass
 Spectrometry, sponsored by Extrel FTMS Waters Corporation. The award recognized the invention of Fourier
 transform ICR (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry. Marshall shares the award with co-inventor, Melvin B. Comisarow
 of the University of British Columbia, Canada. 
<P>     The Fourier transform digital analysis techniques revolutionized ICR by allowing many different ions to
 be analyzed at once instead of one at a time. As an example, co-P.I. Dr. Guan used FT-ICR mass spectrometry
 while working on a pollution-control project for Amoco. For the first time ever, he separated and identified
 dozens of sulfur-containing compounds out of thousands of chemicals in a sample of crude oil.
<P>     During 1994, the ICR program designed and constructed  three  new  spectrometers  built  around 3 T, 60
 T, and 7 T magnets. Another spectrometer has been designed and built, and it awaits arrival of the 9.4 T magnet,
 200 mm diameter horizontal warm bore Oxford magnet. As new techniques and experiments are developed on
 the instruments, they will be implemented on external-user instruments in the facility.

<h1><b><i>Focus on Science</h1></b></i>
<P>
<P>
<h2><b><i>NMR of Quantum Confined Systems from 0 to 30+ Tesla</h2></b></i>
<P>C. Russell Bowers, NHMFL, UF Assistant Professor of Chemistry
<P>     Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) techniques can provide information not available by any other form of
 molecular spectroscopy. Two notable features of the method include its isotopic selectivity and its ability to elucidate
 local electronic structure on the atomic length scale in solids, liquids, and gases. Unfortunately, NMR also suffers from
 a notorious lack of sensitivity compared to many other analytical methods. Consequently, conventional NMR demands
 macroscopic sample volumes containing on the order of 10
18 of the spins to be detected. This sensitivity limitation
 severely restricts the range of problems that can be studied by NMR. 
<P>     Since the initial discovery of NMR in 1945, great efforts have been made to generate magnet fields of the highest
 possible intensity and spatial homogeneity. Among the primary driving forces behind this substantial effort has been
 the quest to improve the nuclear spin Boltzmann factor,
<P>
<P>


<center><img src="nmr_form0.GIF"></center>
<P>
<P>     
<P>where <I>B</I> o is the applied magnetic field, g<I>
n </I>is the nuclear gyromagnetic ratio, and <I>n</I>
a, <I>n</I>b are the populations of the a and b spin states.  The NMR signal amplitude is directly proportional to the nuclear spin polarization, <I>
na -n b</I>. Yet, in spite of the impressive developments in magnet technology, a doubling of the magnetic field in the Curie law limit yields an
 increase in  <I>na -n b</I>  by merely a factor of 2. Of course there are other significant reasons why NMR can be improved
 at higher magnetic fields. For example, the detection efficiency is somewhat improved at the higher frequencies that
 accompany higher fields, the chemical shift dispersion is proportional to the applied field and the second order quadrupolar
 broadening of the central transition in half integer quadrupolar nuclei varies inversely with the magnetic field, factors
 promising higher resolution in liquids and solids, respectively. Given the limits of the currently available materials for
 fabricating resistive and superconducting magnets, however, it is unlikely that the Curie Law nuclear spin magnetization
 will be increased by more than a factor of 2 via higher magnetic fields. On the other hand, the brute force approach of
 lowering the temperature to below a few millikelvin can induce nearly complete nuclear spin ordering. Unfortunately,
 the prohibitively long spin relaxation times at low temperatures keep this method from being applicable to the systems
 of interest here.
<P>     A different solution to the problem of inducing nuclear spin order was pioneered by Lampel
1 nearly 30 years ago. He demonstrated that Overhauser cross relaxation between nuclei and optically-oriented conduction electrons trapped
 at point defects could produce nuclear spin polarizations enhanced by 4 to 5 orders of magnitude over the Curie law
 polarization present under ordinary conditions of temperature and magnetic field. Thus, the threshold number of nuclei
 detectable by his experiment was reduced by the same factor. 
At temperatures in the range of a few Kelvin the nuclear
 spin lattice relaxation in a semiconductor can be dominated by hyperfine relaxation if the charge carrier density is high
 enough. Such cross-relaxation can yield dynamic nuclear polarization when the populations of the electron spin states
 are defined by optical pumping.  The measurement of electron nuclear cross-relaxation rate and its field dependence in
 semiconductors may provide unique information about the electronic states and their dynamics.
<P>      Since its initial discovery, solid state optical dynamic nuclear polarization (ODNP) effect has been studied extensively
 only in the context of optically detected NMR, a technique restricted to fields lower than about 0.2 tesla (T). Outside
 this regime, the local nuclear field cannot compete against the external field to induce electron spin depolarization.
 Thus, if the magnetic-field-dependent-physics of interest occurs at much higher field, optically-detected NMR cannot
 be used to explore it. Alternatively, one can employ ODNP to orient the nuclear spins and
 subsequently observe the enhanced nuclear magnetization with an ordinary Faraday-Law
 detector (i.e. tuned inductor).  This approach,  originally developed by Lampel, has recently
 been employed to demonstrate ODNP at the relatively high magnetic field of 7.05T.

<P>     
<P>     Recently our group has  measured the magnetic field dependence of ODNP in  semi
-insulating GaAs and undoped InP substrates.  The 69 Ga spectra were recorded  using the experimental timing sequence wherein the  detection field of 5T was kept fixed while the
 ODNP field was varied from 0 to 20 T as shown in Figure 1.  The field dependence, presented
 in Figure 2, exhibit at least three notable features:  (1)  as expected, the ODNP signal
 vanishes at zero magnetic field when unpolarized light is used (2) optical pumping with
 unpolarized light yields an emmisive signal of enhanced magntiude (Figure 2a) as long as
 a magnetic field of more than a few tesla is applied,  (3)  the magnitude of the optical
 dynamic nuclear polarization effect  reaches a maximum at a few tesla and then
 declines with increasing field. The first and second of these features can be explained by including the effect of thermal equilibration across the hyperfine coupled conduction band spin states at high field where the thermal electron spin polarization term can be substantial
 under conditions of high B/T.  The third effect can be explained by a decrease in the cross
-relaxation rate across the hyperfine coupled states, presumably due to the increased
 mismatch in the electron-nuclear spin flip energy at higher fields.  The details of the
 relaxation mechanism are currently under investigation.

<i><b>Figure 1.</b> The "pulse sequence" used to obtain the field dependence of the ODNP effect. The sequence begins with saturation of the initial NMR signal to reduce it to zero. The fiel is then rapidly ramped to another value at which the sample is irradiated to induce ODNP. After the typical irradiation period of 60s the field is then ramped back to the initial value in a time short compared to the relaxationtime for the detection of the NMR signal. By repeating with different values of the "pumped field," the filed dependence can be obtained without disturbing the probe tuning. This sequence was employed tooobtain the data in Figure 2b.</i>
</i>


<P>     The ability to dynamically polarize the nuclei at high magnetic fields has permitted the NMR observation of spins within quantum wells.2 In principle, this technique can be extended to quantum dots, and to heterostructures formed from semiconductor layers. These mesoscopic systems exhibit quantum confinement in one or more dimensions, wherein the continuum of conduction electron energy states is reduced to discrete bands. In such systems, the manifestations of additional quantization of the cyclotron motion may become apparent at sufficiently high magnetic fields. Indeed, nearly all observable properties of the system are altered as a result of the quantization indued by the field and by quantum confinement. For example, in the quantum Hall effect, the resistivity across a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure is found to oscillate between that of a metal and an insulator with a periodicity proportional to 1.<br><br><Br>

<P>     A heterostructure device is formed at the interface between semiconductor layers of different composition, creating a potential energy well that localizes electrons to within ~100&Aring; of the interface. This layer of electrons is referred to as a 2-dimensional electron gas (2DEG). Recently, it has been shown using dynamic nuclear polarization and ESR that the spin lattice relaxation time of nuclei in the vicinity of the 2DEG can be expressed by a relation similar to the Korringa law describing nuclei in a metal:3

is the density of a and b electron spin states at the Fermi level, and<img align=center vspace=11 hspace=11 src="nmr_form2.GIF">


<p><p><p><p><p><p>

The term <I>Eex</I> is due to the electron spin exchange interaction. At the range of fields studied, it was found to
 exhibit approximately the same oscillatory dependence on magnetic field as the magnetoresistivity. 
<P>
<P>     At NHMFL, ODNP-NMR will be employed to investigate the quantum Hall states at fields between 0 and 30
 T. Unlike standard techniques such as resistivity or magnetic susceptibility which rely on the measurement of macroscopic
 properties that are averaged over the entire sample, NMR uniquely provides a probe that is sensitive to the atomic scale
 variations in these states. The isotopic selectivity of NMR also provides the key advantage of allowing one to &quot;tune-in&quot;
 to a specific location or site within the material where a specified nucleus may exclusively reside.  However, the
 question of whether or not NMR has the potential to provide unique information about the electyronic states still needs
 to be addressed, and hence this is a major objective of our work.
<P>     In conclusion, optical dynamic nuclear polarization with direct radio wave detection of NMR is a technique being
 developed to study quantum confined systems subjected to very high magnetic fields. Since the nuclear spin-lattice
 relaxation time is inversely proportional to the density of states at the Fermi level, NMR can be used to study impurity
 scattering and spin effects in the Landau level spectrum. On route to this objective, the field dependence of the ODNP
 mechanism has been studied. Finally, it should be noted that the operating conditions at NHMFL are excellent for the
 experiments outlined herein, not only because the highest magnetic fields are available, but also because the fields can
 be varied smoothly and quickly and are stable enough to yield optimal signal-to-noise and narrow line widths.

<B>Chapter Overview</B><P> 

	The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory's programs and facilities are distributed over three sites and many disciplines. Everyone-distant and local researchers, magnet designers, and instrumentation specialists-profits from the intellectual cross-fertilization that occurs when so many activities are grouped together.
<P>
	The General Purpose DC Field Facility in Tallahassee retired its first 27 T, 32 mm bore magnet and replaced it with two 30 T, 32 mm bore magnets in new housings that showed greatly reduced vibrations from the magnet cooling water. The 27 T magnet had run over 1000 hours without showing any signs of functional decay in any of the three coils. The plates from a middle and inner coil from a 27 T magnet were rearranged, and the three coils carefully aligned to produce a 24.5 T, 32 mm bore, higher homogeneity magnet that quickly generated excitement among users interested in using NMR to study high Tc superconductors, quantum wells, and other condensed matter systems.
<P> 
	Multiple units of high demand instrumentation were purchased or built for users of the DC Field Facility, thereby increasing the effectiveness of their use of the magnets and power supplies and increasing the number of samples that could be studied per magnet hour. NHMFL staff responded to user requests for new sample holders to support interesting new techniques. Experience with operating major equipment led to improvements that increased reliability, user friendliness, and/or performance. The User Instrumentation and Electron Magnetic Resonance groups cooperated in the purchase of expensive instruments that could be used for EMR and other measurements of interest to other users.
<P> 
	The Pulsed Field Facility in Los Alamos enlarged its user facilities markedly by establishing, through a sabbatical by Prof. Clive Perry, a spectroscopic capability for photoluminescence and related magneto-optical studies in both pulsed and DC fields. The 50 T  and 60 T pulsed magnets based on a design of Prof. Fritz Herlach's group at Leuven continue to provide the working fields, although other designs are being tested. The new instrumentation for these magnets includes magnetization coils from the University of Amsterdam and a sample rotator and 3He cryostat from Clark University. The use of diamond anvil cells in pulsed fields continues to be developed. The single most significant new instrument for the 50 T pulsed fields is the dilution refrigerator commissioned by Oxford Instruments in February. It has a base temperature of 25 mK. 
<P> 
	The Ultra-High B/T Facility in Gainesville put its dilution refrigerator into operation during 1995 and tested it down to 4 mK. The PrNi5 demagnetization stage should be in operation by the time this report is available, with the high field magnet installed soon thereafter. The Ultra-High B/T Facility will open to users in early 1996.
<P> 
	Each of the groups that make up the Center for Interdisciplinary Magnetic Resonance (CIMAR) brought new magnet-based instruments on-line in 1995.
<P> <ul>
<LI>The EMR group succeeded in producing high-frequency (440 GHz) EPR spectra with a newly installed 17 T superconducting spectrometer, and also achieved EPR measurements on a 20 T resistive magnet.
</ul><P><ul>
<LI>Wide-line NMR was observed at 25 T on a resistive magnet. Preliminary wide-line NMR spectra were observed at >19 T with a superconducting solenoid.
</ul><P><ul>
<LI>The world's first wide-bore 600 MHz (14 T) NMR spectrometer was installed and is now operating with both magnetic resonance micro-imaging and solid-sample magic-angle spinning probes. A unique-design 720 MHz pumped high-resolution NMR magnet was installed and is now in routine operation.
</ul><P><ul>
<LI>A new 3 T, 80 cm bore, whole-body system for MRI and MRS was installed in the fall. Already 		it is giving exquisite head images and angiograms of unrivaled resolution. It was opened by Senator 		Bob Graham in November and is the first such instrument in the Southeast.
</ul><P><ul> 
<LI>The world's highest-field FT-ICR magnet (9.4 T superconductive) was installed and preliminary electrospray data have been obtained. A new FT-ICR data system has been developed.
</ul><P> 
The CIMAR faculty grew with the hiring of several CIMAR-associated postdoctoral fellows. An accelerating R+D effort aims at continued expansion of the CIMAR national user base.
<P> 
	The Isotope Geochemistry Program will get underway in earnest in 1996. An ultra-clean chemistry laboratory was completed in 1995 and new experiments were made possible by the addition of instrumentation and staff.

<b>New Instrumentation</b>
<p>
	The news that is probably of greatest interest to users-that we now offer 33.1 T-is described fully elsewhere in this newsletter. That is not all the news, however. During the last couple of months, several very useful new instruments have become available, so I will take this opportunity to discuss them.
<p>
	Murali Chaparala has developed a single horizontal axis sample rotator for use in the 50 mm bore resistive magnets. It can be used for magnetic moment and torque measurements using the silicon cantilever force sensors, and also for the usual transport measurements. The outer diameter is small enough to fit into the standard helium three and single wall vacuum cans, so it can, in principle, be used at temperatures from 0.5 to 300 K. The rotator is presently driven over a span of plus or minus 100 degrees by a steppermotor-encoder combination using a serial port interface that gives a repeatable resolution of 0.005 degrees. Murali and the rest of us are now searching for a stepping motor or similar drive system that uses the GPIB interface for command and readout. Any leads from readers of this newsletter will be greatly appreciated.
<p>
	A reflectance probe for infrared spectroscopy has been built and tested recently at NHMFL/FSU by Hon Kie Ng, Yongjie Wang, and Bradley Love. It is a very useful addition to the infrared instrumentation available to users of the 20 T superconducting magnet. The spectral range it covers is 20 to 3,000 wave numbers. The sample carrousel can hold 4 samples (or 3 samples and 1 reference) at the same time, so the sample can be changed without changing the field or temperature. The sample temperature can be varied from 2.2 K to 50 K.
<p>
	Four different kinds of samples (a high temperature superconductor, a heavy fermion system, a spin Peierls system, and heavily doped semiconductors) have been studied during the first few weeks of the probe's use. A noise level better than 1% of the signal can be reached easily in the low frequency range (below 200 wave numbers).
<p>
	Finally, for those not satisfied with 33 T, we can offer 36 (as long as your sample is small enough) at temperatures from 0.5 to 4.2 K. The extra three tesla are provided by dysprosium flux concentrators, of which we have two sets, one for helium three and variable temperature work and one for pumped helium four. The sample space is 1 mm high and 7.4 mm diameter in the smaller set and 2 mm by 12 mm diameter for the larger set. James Brooks' group were the first users of the flux concentrator AND the 33.1 T magnet, and Pavi Sandhu obtained some nice data on Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations in an organic conductor and calibrated the flux concentrator therewith in a single set of measurements. Very efficient!
<p>
	As usual, I would like to remind everyone that usage of the NHMFL's facilities is almost free of charge, we have experienced researchers to assist users, collaboration with local scientists is possible but not required, and financial support for the initial visit or two is available.

<b>60 Tesla Coils Arrive at Los Alamos</b>
<p>
	The four remaining coils for the 60 T, 32 mm liquid nitrogen bore, quasi-continuous magnet arrived at Los Alamos from Everson Electric Co. before Christmas, but it was not until after the New Year and one snowstorm that the boxes could be opened. The largest of these coils has an inside diameter of over 750 mm and easily accommodates both Jim Sims, the design engineer, and Don Parkin for the photographic record.
<center><p><img src="w966.gif"><p></center>
<i><center>Figure 1. Complete set of nine coils for the 60 T quasi-continouous magnet are ready for assembly. From left to right the inspectors are Jim Sims, Don Parkin, Larry Campbell, and Dwight Rickel.</i></center><p><p>

	Altogether there are nine nested coils to this magnet. They are individually reinforced by steel shells and separated by gaps of about 4 mm. The innermost bore diameter is 32 mm and the outermost diameter of the coil set is 862 mm. The total weight of the coils exceeds four tons, all of which will be cooled to liquid nitrogen temperature before the magnet is energized. When the coils produce 60 T, they store over 90 MJ of energy in the magnetic field. Following a 100 ms flat-top pulse, most of this energy will be recovered reversibly and transferred back to the motor-generator, whose spinning rotor is the energy source for the pulse. The length of the pulse is restricted not by the energy required but by the heating of the coils due to resistive losses. Following a pulse the coils are flooded with liquid nitrogen and should cool to 77 K in less than an hour, thanks to the inter-coil gaps that make the magnet structure relatively porous. Between pulses, the user may analyze data, make changes to the sample or its environment, etc.
<p>
	This is the first quasi-continuous magnet to employ so many mechanically independent coils. In addition to faster cooling, the advantages of many free-standing coils include (1) greater freedom to specify wire size and reinforcement thickness to solve stress and heating problems in different parts of the magnet, (2) wider options to tailor sets of coils to match power supplies (this magnet consists of three independent electrical circuits), (3) increased safety by restricting faults to a subsection of the total magnet, and (4) the easier fabrication associated with smaller units (also, smaller replacement costs and less wastage in case of manufacturing problems). It is believed that these advantages will strongly outweigh the disadvantages of a more complicated assembly and less electrical efficiency .
<p>
	An additional advantage of the independent, multi-coil approach is the increased flexibility for making upgrades. Preliminary calculations show that by replacing the inner five coils with coils made from a better conductor like CuAg it would be possible to achieve 70 T. Likewise, if the inner five coils were replaced by a capacitor-driven magnet, it should be possible to reach 80 T in a 24 mm bore. In both cases the outer four coils, the largest and most expensive, remain the same, producing 35 T in a 330 mm bore.
<p>
	The 60 T quasi-continuous magnet represents a significant step forward in magnet science and technology. The design and early test data from this magnet will help the NHMFL as it moves ahead with the design of the non-destructive 100 T pulsed magnet, which has been funded by the Department of Energy and NSF.

<title>9.4 T Electrospray FT-ICR Mass 
Spectrometer Comes On Line</title>

Spectrometer Comes On Line</B></h3></center>
<p>
<p>
	
	The advent of two ionization techniques, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) and electrospray ionization (ESI), has revolutionized mass spectrometry by generating thousands of ions from tiny amounts (10<sup>-15</sup> moles) of large biomolecules (proteins, DNA, oligosaccharides), often without breaking the original molecule apart. Moreover, the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer provides an unrivaled combination of mass accuracy, mass resolving power, and sensitivity, and its trapped-ion operation makes it possible to observe both the original "parent" ion and "daughter" ions produced by breaking the original ions apart (e.g., by collisions with an inert gas or by laser irradiation). The combination of MALDI (for singly-charged ions) or ESI (for multiply-charged ions) with FT-ICR provides a complete "micro-laboratory" for identifying and determining the primary structure (i.e., like the sequence of beads on a string) and even higher-order structure (i.e., how the strings are twisted and tangled) of proteins in the gas phase (i.e., with water removed).
<p>
	In February, 1996, we are pleased to announce the successful design, construction, and preliminary testing of a 9.4 T ESI FT-ICR mass spectrometer at NHMFL's Tallahassee site. The centerpiece of the instrument is a 9.4 T superconducting Oxford magnet (worlds highest-field for ICR, and equivalent in field to a 400 MHz NMR) with an 8" horizontal room temperature bore and part-per-million field homogeneity. The magnet is passively shielded with 12 tons of iron to reduce the stray field to less than 5 gauss at distances greater than 12" from the shield. Shielding is a great advantage because many critical components (pumps, pulsed valves, vacuum gauges, display monitor, etc.) must be close to the magnet and will not operate in the large stray field of an unshielded magnet of this field strength and bore.
<p>
<Center><img src= icr.gif></center>
<P><P>
	The 9.4 T magnet is higher in field (B) and greater in bore diameter than prior state-of-the-art ICR systems (7.0 T, 6" bore). The advantages for ICR are that mass resolving power and mass accuracy increase linearly with B, but upper mass limit, maximum number of trapped ions, maximum ion energy (for breaking ions apart), and maximum trapping period (for conducting many experiments on the same ions) increase even more strongly as the <i>square </i>of B. Moreover, the larger bore allows for a larger ion trap and thus a larger number of ions, larger signal-to-noise ratio, and/or increased mass resolving power.
<p>
	Preliminary results on the system bear out these predicted improvements. For example, the instrument tolerates much larger ion populations than lower field systems for simplified analysis of complex mixtures, such as peptide digests. For example (see Figure), we have routinely doubled Cornell's previous world record of 160,000 mass resolving power for serum albumin (67,000 Dalton) from their 6 T ESI FT-ICR system. Future projects already slated for this instrument over the next few months include:  identification and analysis of neuropeptides, structures of various gas-phase protein ions, and determination of cross-linking patterns in oligosaccharides (basis of certain immune responses).
<p>

	Murali Chaparala has developed a single horizontal axis sample rotator for use in the 50 mm bore resistive magnets. It can be used for magnetic moment and torque measurements using the silicon cantilever force sensors, and also for the usual transport measurements. The outer diameter is small enough to fit into the standard helium three and single wall vacuum cans, so it can, in principle, be used at temperatures from 0.5 to 300 K. The rotator is presently driven over a span of plus or minus 100 degrees by a steppermotor-encoder combination using a serial port interface that gives a repeatable resolution of 0.005 degrees. Murali and the rest of us are now searching for a stepping motor or similar drive system that uses the GPIB interface for command and readout. Any leads from readers of this newsletter will be greatly appreciated.
<p>
	This project was brought to completion by the integrated accomplishments of:  Michael Senko, Chris Hendrickson, Ljiljana Pasa-Tolic, Jarrod Marto, Forest White, Shenheng Guan, and Alan Marshall from the ICR group, and Dan Macintosh from NHMFLs Machine Shop, assisted by Jo Ann Palmer, Yulondia Wilson, and numerous other members of the NHMFL family, with support from NIH, NSF, and the State of Florida.  Also, the ICR program in general and this project in particular are examples of where the NHMFL responded to new emerging opportunities not envisioned in the early studies on science opportunities at high magnetic fields.

<p>
<hr size=5><p>


<P>       At its fifth birthday, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is passing through a phase transition that
 will influence its future for many years to come. While the first five years were largely devoted to constructing superb
 physical facilities, staffing the laboratory, and creating the world's most powerful magnets, the coming five-year period
 will be devoted to building an equally outstanding in-house and users science program to utilize and enhance these
 facilities. Much of the groundwork has already been laid for mounting a world-class science activity at all three magnet
 lab sites, with the appointment of key faculty and scholar-scientists in a broad range of disciplines. In future articles we
 will highlight research activities in areas such as strongly correlated electrons, molecular conductors, quantum transport
 in high magnetic fields, novel magnetic materials, magnetic resonance, and &quot;exotica&quot; science in exotic magnetic field
 configurations.
<P>
<P>     A year ago, the Science Program Committee (SPC) was formed to structure and carry out science policy in the
 laboratory, and the members were listed in the last issue of <I>
NHMFL Reports</I>. The SPC's responsibilities include oversight
 of new science-related appointments in the lab, review of proposals by users of our facilities, awarding of resources for
 joint in-house and users research participation projects, coordination of science input to the magnet development and
 technology program to aid in establishing priorities and design goals for new magnet systems, etc. The SPC also has
 responsibility for maintaining a high-level intellectual atmosphere with strong coupling between research areas, scientists
 at the three sites, and particularly with the user community. The SPC must also interact effectively with the operations
 program of the laboratory to ensure effective use of the facilities.
<P>
<P>     During the past six months, the SPC has focused its efforts on developing a consensus on the scientific activities
 that the in-house program will emphasize in the coming five years. The results of these extensive discussions are
 summarized (all too briefly because of a rigid page limitation) in the 5-year NSF renewal proposal. The rigors of
 writing this concise document aided greatly in bringing the various groups into close contact. We believe the excitement
 will increase as the in-house and users programs continue to build, with many research projects being jointly pursued.
<P>
<P>     An important and highly successful activity has been the weekly research seminars that have been held in Tallahassee
 since fall 1994. Representatives of each of the major research areas present overview talks to introduce concepts,
 research goals, and current results in their areas of study. Plans are to extend these seminars to include speakers from
 other NHMFL sites and active users to strengthen the intellectual unity of the laboratory.
<P>
<P>     The many other seminars, workshops, and conferences held by the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory
notably the Physical Phenomena in High Magnetic Fields-II Conference held in May 1995 have been very successful
 both in advancing science and in acquainting new potential users with our unique facilities and capabilities. A lively
 visitors program has brought a large member of leading researches to our three sites both for seminars and for longer
 periods of stay. With new resources for the science program, we intend to further strengthen this activity
.
<P>
<P>     As you are no doubt aware a major restructuring of the laboratory management has taken place, as laid out in the
 5-year NSF renewal proposal. Three major program activities are defined, user/operations, magnet science and technology, and science. Each of these programs is led by a director; co-directors in the case of operations. Zach Fisk has
 been appointed Acting Director of Science, to serve while a search is underway for a permanent director. We believe
 that this new management structure will serve us well in the next phase of the life of the National High Magnetic Field
 Laboratory.
<P>
<P>     In summary, thanks to the rapid and high quality build-up of physical and scientific facilities, and the appointment
 of excellent personnel, the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory is poised to make a very strong contribution to
 science and technology, hopefully in a synergistic manner. We greatly look forward to this challenge.

<title>NHMFL Offers New and Unique 
Spectrometer for EMR</title>

<center><H3><b>NHMFL Offers New and Unique 
Spectrometer for EMR</B></h3></center>
<p>
<p>
	
	When the Oxford superconducting magnet arrived at the NHMFL on November 21, 1995, the sources, sample probe, and detectors were ready and waiting. Also waiting were members of the Electron Magnetic Resonance (EMR) Group, who moved quickly to build the worlds highest magnetic field (17.15 tesla (T)), high resolution 10<sup>-6</sup> in a 1 cm sphere, spectrometer. On November 27, group members recorded their first spectra, and during the following three days, hosted their first collaborative users. This quite extraordinary accomplishment occurred under the direction of Louis-Claude Brunel, who presents the following discussion on the new spectrometer and its significance for continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance.
<p>
	<b>High Homogeneity - High Field Continuous Wave Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (CW EPR)</b>
<p>
	During the last decade we have seen new developments in high frequency/high magnetic field CW EPR spectroscopy. The activity in the field has been recently reviewed and the need to perform measurements above the "conventional" frequency of 9 or 35 GHz are now well understood by the scientific community.<sup>1,2</sup> Spectrometers are commercially available at 95 GHz (W-band - 3 T) for CW and pulsed operation<sup>3</sup> and up to 250 GHz (8 T) for CW operation only.<sup>4</sup> Even if the great majority of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments are now performed in the pulsed mode, there will always be a need for CW EPR experiments because the time scale of relaxation mechanisms may lead to broad lines. The signal-to-noise ratio in Fourier transform spectroscopy degrades exponentially with linewidth while it changes linearly in CW methods. Although essential, the development of pulsed EPR toward high frequencies is also restrained by technological difficulties, and our effort at the NHMFL is currently on CW techniques.
<p>
	<i>Definitions.</i> There is no widely accepted definition of "high frequency/high magnetic field EPR."  The claims that "high field" is above what is achievable with iron core magnets or what is commercially available are rather subjective. To determine a criterion, one should consider a parameter of scientific relevance; and the spin polarization of a system, which is sample independent, appears to be appropriate. Liquid helium temperature is a convenient reference to avoid thermal effects, as an EPR experiment will be performed under high frequency conditions when exp(hv/kT) > 10. With such a convention, EPR spectroscopy can be termed "high frequency" when v/2p = 80 GHz, for a g-Lande factor = 2 this corresponds to 2.8 T. Then high frequency EPR spectroscopy starts at or above W-band frequency (95 GHz - 3 T).
<p>
	<i>Motivations.</i> The motivations to develop new instrumentations and methodologies may lie in the frequency dependence or in the magnetic field dependence of the EPR spectrum. It also may lie in the spectrum dependence upon the combination of high frequencies and high magnetic fields.
<p>
<ul><li><i>Frequency dependence of the EPR spectrum:</i> There is a need to measure the EPR spectrum at high frequency when the system is spectroscopically silent with conventional instrument. This is the case when strong zero-field interactions (spin-orbit, exchange, dipolar) lead to large zero field splittings.

<li><i>Magnetic field dependence of the spectrum:</i> Very high magnetic fields of 10 T or more are useful to study magnetic field induced phase transitions like those seen in one-dimensional antiferromagnets<sup>5,6</sup> or in magnetic field induced states as seen in low dimensional electron gas systems (quantum Hall regime).

<li><i>Frequency and magnetic field dependence:</i> The struggle to develop CW EPR instrumentations for g=2 systems is driven by the need to increase the resolution and the sensitivity. For EPR lines with H increasing linearly with the frequency, as in "g strained" systems, the situation varies from sample to sample, and each system should be examined individually. In an ideal system where the linewidth H is independent of the frequency the resolution will increase with frequency; this is true when H originates from hyperfine interactions or zero field splittings. In real systems there are many contributions to the spectral linewidth, and the conclusion is that there is no such a thing as an universal best frequency. A sound analysis requires a multifrequency investigation.
</ul> 
<p>
	<b>The High Homogeneity/High Field NHMFL EPR Spectrometer</b>
<p>

	Up to 140 GHz spectrometers are built with conventional microwave technology, i.e. single mode waveguides and cavities and solid state sources.<sup>7</sup> Above 140 GHz, waveguide losses increase drastically and single mode cavities become too small; consequently, one can no longer use microwave technology and one needs to use "far infrared" techniques.<sup>8,9,10</sup> Such instruments have been described in details in References 8 and 10 with different options concerning the sources, the magnets and the detectors.
<p>
	The spectrometer that we built at the NHMFL is made of four main components: the sources, the magnet, the detector, and the sample probe.
<p>
	<i>Sources</i>. The development of high frequency EPR has been hindered by the difficulty of operating sources above, say, 100 GHz., at which point the "missing frequency regime" begins. Klystrons, for instance, become excessively costly to operate above 100 GHz and gyrotrons are not exactly a component of a system but rather a system by themselves.
<p>
	Above W-band frequency (95 GHz) Gunn diodes or optically pumped far infrared laser<sup>8,10</sup> are used. Because of decreased quantum efficiency, optically pumped far infrared lasers cannot operate readily below 250 GHz. The NHMFL high resolution spectrometer has two sources. The first one is a Gunn diode that operates at 110, 220, 330, and 440 GHz.That source is controlled by a Network Analyzer from Abmm that also can be used as a stand-alone equipment to develop cavities or to test materials. It should be emphasized that this Network Analyzer allows us to work at frequencies as low as 8 GHz. The second source is an optically pumped far infrared laser (Edinburgh FIRL100) that can be used, and has already been tested, up to 2.7 THz. That may be of interest for systems with large zero field splittings like some metalloproteins.
<p>
	<i>Magnet.</i> For high resolution EPR one expects a resolution of about 0.1 gauss, which means that the homogeneity should be in the 10<sup>-6</sup> range. Superconducting magnets above 17 T are now available for NMR, so the issue with EPR is the need to sweep the field, and a compromise must be found between sweepability at high field and acceptable homogeneity. High field implies high inductance, and sweepability requires not too high an inductance. Our magnet (Oxford Instruments) operates up to 15 T (at 4.2 K) and up to 17 T (at 2.2 K) with a homogeneity of 2x10<sup>-6</sup> over 1 cm diametrical spherical volume. This is currently the highest magnetic field worldwide with such a high homogeneity.
<p>
	<i>Detectors.</i> We use an InSb fast electron bolometer from QMC. The detector is optimized to work from 40 GHz up to 1 THz.
<p>
	<i>Sample probe.</i> We use the transmission technique developed by L.C. Brunel in Grenoble.<sup>10</sup> We can measure liquids, powder or single crystals. The sample probe is in a continuous flow cryostat, and the temperature of the sample is monitored from 1.6 up to 300 K. We are actively developing Fabry-Perot cavities to increase the sensitivity.
<p>
<b>Results</b>
<p>
	The magnet was delivered on November 21, 1995. The sources, sample probe, and the detector were already in the lab. Our first spectrum at 12 T was obtained on November 27, and on November 28 we recorded the first spectrum at 16 T. To better  illustrate the potential of the machine, Figure 1 displays the spectrum of BDPA that is a standard  molecule for EPR spectroscopists in physical chemistry or biosciences. Figure 2 shows the spectrum of phosphorus doped silicon, the "pet"  sample of physicists. From these data we know that the sensitivity of the spectrometer is better than 10<sup>11</sup> spin per gauss at liquid helium temperature, and we are in an early stage of development.

</i></center><P><P>

Between November 27 and November 30, we had our first two collaborative users: B.J Gaffney and N. Dalal. B.J. Gaffney from Johns Hopkins University is interested in very high frequency EPR of metalloproteins, and three proteins containing high-spin, ferric iron were examined at 5 K and at frequencies up to 330 GHz. Spectra of lipoxygenase were measured with the spectrometer operating from 44 to 330 GHz. N. Dalal, then at West Virginia University, is interested in high field EPR of linear chain Heisenberg anti-ferro magnets, and spectra obtained at 330 GHz reveal details not obtainable at lower frequencies. In order to test meshes for Fabry-Perot cavities, our third collaborative user, K. Earle, from the group of J. Freed at Cornell, used the Network Analyzer on February 9 through 11. You will notice that our machine is already working seven days a week.
<P>
<b>Conclusion</b>
<P>
	The successful accomplishment of this project is due to the integrated work of the EMR team and of the NHMFL family. NHMFL Facilities, Operations, and Magnet Development  were instrumental in this effort. The EMR team comprises A. Hassan, J. Krzystek, G. Martins, L. Pardi, H. Whitaker, A. McCarty, W. Moulton, and L.C. Brunel. We should also mention the participation of S. Hill during the tests of the laser. The EMR Program is well on its way thanks to the NHMFL,which is developing the only very high magnetic field interdisciplinary facility worldwide.

<B><I><h1>The Cryogenic System for the NHMFL Hybrid Magnet</h1></B></I>
<P>   Steven W. Van Sciver, Professor, NHMFL/ FSU
<P>
<P>     The National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in collaboration with the Francis Bitter National Magnet Laboratory is
 developing a new hybrid magnet system that is to provide the world's highest steady magnetic fields to the physics and
 materials research community. This magnet system consists of two separate concentric magnets: a 14 tesla (T)
 superconducting outsert magnet with a room temperature bore of 616 mm diameter and a 31 T, 32 mm bore resistive
 insert, which together can generate a total field of 45 T. It is planned and well within the technical potential of the magnet
 laboratory to push this limit to 50 T with more advanced inserts. The superconducting outsert magnet is supported by a
 unique cryogenic system operating at 1.8 K with pressurized He II. Recently, the NHMFL hybrid magnet development
 team achieved a major milestone represented by the delivery, installation, and preliminary testing of this cryogenic system.
<P>
<P>     The cryogenic system for the Hybrid Magnet must provide the environment for safe and reliable operation of the
 superconducting magnet. This goal establishes a set of general requirements:
<P>
<P>     &#183; Cooldown time should not exceed seven days
<P>     &#183; Ramp time to full field in one hour
<P>     &#183; Steady operation with available refrigeration
<P>     &#183; Fast recovery from major disturbance such as insert              trip or quench
<P>     &#183; Thermally insulating, structural support for mechanical              loading of outsert.
<P>
<P>     The success of the Hybrid Magnet system will depend on its ability to provide reliable and user friendly magnetic
 field for the researchers. Reliable operation means that the outsert magnet should be at field during laboratory operations
 and in standby mode (at 1.8 K or 4.2 K) during other times with shut down and warm up only for annual maintenance. It
 is highly desirable for the users to be able to access the bore of the magnet safely at any time. Thus, a physical separation
 of the operations from the user should be a goal of the cryogenic system design.
<P>
<P>     The design of the cryogenic system for the Hybrid Magnet has been carried out with the above requirements in mind.
 This goal is accomplished with a unique concept for the system. From the magnet user point of view, the important feature
 is that the magnet is housed in a separate cryostat allowing completely free access to the bore. The supply cryostat
 contains all of the operations' interfaces: refrigeration supply, current leads, instrumentation and control. This approach
 minimizes the interference between the magnet operator and the researcher.
<P>
<P>     The cryostat for the Hybrid superconducting outsert magnet was fabricated by CVI and delivered to the NHMFL in
 March 1995. A photo of the system on delivery at the NHMFL is shown in Figure 1. This system consists of two major
 components: magnet cryostat and supply cryostat. The magnet cryostat has the sole purpose of supporting and insulating
 the superconducting magnet. In addition, since the cryogenic system is installed at the NHMFL before completion of the
 superconducting magnet, three features in the magnet cryostat design are required. First, the magnet cryostat must be
 easily opened for installation of the superconducting outsert magnet. Second, the bottom of the cryostat must be located
 four meters above the floor to allow installation of the resistive insert magnet. Finally, in the interim, the cryostat must be
 equipped with an instrumented temporary vessel or dummy load to allow testing of the system before the magnet arrives.
<P>
<P>     The supply cryostat contains all the interfaces for operation of the magnet. It contains an upper and a lower helium
 reservoir, which are maintained at 4.5 K and 1.8 K respectively during normal operation. It also supports a number of
 demountable components necessary for the trouble-free operation of the system. These include: two JT refrigerators (only
 one shown in the figure), two current leads (one shown), a cooldown JT valve and three-way valve, a fill JT valve,
 instrumentation probe, and quench relief.
<P>
<P>     The magnet vessel is connected to the supply cryostat by the services duct that is a five-meter-long double conduit.
 The larger conduit connects to the bottom of the magnet vessel and contains the conductor bus and half of the voltage tap
 cables. The smaller conduit contains the other half of the cable and is connected to the top of the magnet vessel.

<P>
<P>     First cooldown of the Hybrid Magnet cryostat took place in June and July 1995. A major milestone was achieved
 when the system reached the 1.8 K operating point, thus demonstrating the performance necessary for magnet operation.
 In addition, during these preliminary tests, the system heat leak, JT refrigerator performance, 10 kA current bus
 performance and system recovery from a major disturbance were studied. Overall, the cryostat performed as expected,
 although the 1.8 K heat leak exceeded specification possibly because of insufficient cooling of one of the 20 K shields.
 The results of these preliminary tests are currently under study.
<P><p>

<img align=left vspace=10 hspace=20 src="cryo.GIF">

<p> Further operational improvements and testing of the Hybrid Magnet cryostat with the dummy load are scheduled
 to occur throughout 1995 and until the superconducting magnet is delivered to the NHMFL. At that time, the magnet
 cryostat will be opened and the superconducting magnet installed. First testing of the entire system is scheduled for the
 end of 1996.

<i><h1>Focus on Science</h1></i>
<B>Hanging Out at the Extremes: High Pressure, High Mag
netic Fields, and Low Temperatures</B>
<P>
<P>Stanley W. Tozer, NHMFL Scientist in High Pressure Studies
<P>
<P>     <I>Pressure</I>we make use of this physical property hundreds of times during our daily lives. Pressure is just the
 force that is exerted on a surface and thus the units with which we are most familiarpounds per square inch (p.s.i.):
 the smaller the area, the higher the pressure for a given force. Pressure also is used throughout industry to stamp auto
 parts, extrude aluminum cans, synthesize chemicals and plastics, and blast ore. Many of these operations require several tons of force per square inch. We are standing on the most fascinating pressure vessel that most of us will know
 during our lifetime. The earth is thought to generate temperatures and pressures in excess of 10,000&#176; F and 60 million p.s.i. at its center. The chemistry going on beneath the mantle is not fully understood, but we benefit from the vast
 variety of materials that have been brought to the surface over the millennia. One of these is diamond.

<img align=left vspace=10 hspace=20 src="hanging.GIF">


 Diamond, the<I>hardest bulk material known</I>, is produced at relatively shallow depths within the earth, perhaps 100 miles down. The
 search for a synthetic route to diamond drove much of high pressure research in the 40's and 50's. Devices utilizing
 diamonds have been used over the past 30 years as pressures close to 40 million p.s.i. are sought in the search for
 metallic hydrogen.
<P>
<P>     We have similar devices at NHMFL, no larger than a golf ball, that use diamonds and easily attain pressures of two
 million p.s.i.. With very little effort we can double or triple that pressure. These devices are called diamond-anvil cells
 [DACs] and, in the simplest terms, they do nothing more glorious than squish materials. DACs are no more complex
 than the vise found on a workbench. In the DAC, two brilliant cut stones are the &quot;jaws&quot; of this vise (Figure 1). We use
 diamond for the anvils of this device because it is extremely hard. Surprisingly, no one thought of using diamonds in
 this manner until the 1950's and relied instead on presses larger than the 45 T hybrid to generate a fraction of the
 pressure obtainable in a DAC. The first high pressure device to use diamond had a small diameter hole drilled through
 an eight carat stone (confiscated from a smuggler by Uncle Sam). The two ends were plugged with piano wire rams.
 The volume captured between these two wires contained the sample. 49,000 p.s.i. of pressure was generated before the
 diamond inevitably failed. Two groups were quick to make small changes, which resulted in the present day design.
<P>
<P><I>     </I>Depending on the experiment that one wishes to carryout, the stones range from less than 1/8 carat to more than 4 carats. The stones are of a higher quality than that found in most engagement rings, because they need to withstand huge stresses and thus need to be defect-free. The two brilliant cut stones (anvils) are held in the high pressure device
 so that the tips face one another and the table (the large flat that faces up in an engagement ring) is supported by a hard material such as tungsten carbide, sintered diamond, or beryllium copper. The tips are polished to render small flats (culets) no more than one millimeter across. Diamond is wonderful in compression, but cleaves very easily so the tips of the two opposed stones must be parallel and directly over one another; otherwise, the edge of one stone will initiate a fracture in the other bringing one's high pressure experiment to an abrupt end. For this reason, much of the DAC's &quot;innards&quot; is given to the alignment of these tips. The rest of the device provides a means to drive the one diamond tip into the other. Of course, the sample of interest goes between these two tips and can be subjected to massive pressures. These pressures are equivalent to what you would experience if you could balance the top of an inverted Eiffel Tower upon the palm of your hand. For many of the measurements that we do, we would prefer not to mash the sample. To accomplish this, a thin metal foil [gasket] with a hole drilled through it is placed between the diamond tips. The flat stone tips seal off this hole, which by this time contains the sample, a small ruby chip for pressure calibration, and a fluid that has very low shear strength. Now when the diamond anvils are driven together the fluid is compressed evenly against all sides of the sample. Much of the applied load in these devices is taken up in friction or by the gasket and is not actually transmitted to the sample; thus, the need for an accurate method to measure the pressure via shift in the fluorescence of the small ruby chip. The diamonds can support about one ton of force. The trick to obtaining extremely high pressures is to use very small tips. The area of these tips is approximately 1/10th to 1/1000th that of the table. This leads to a big increase in the pressure experienced by the sample, but at the expense of available sample volume.
 Diamond is also a beautiful material for an anvil, because it is transparent to a wide spectrum of light and it is electrically insulating. These two attributes make it possible to excite the sample with light that is focused through the diamond and onto the sample or to attach leads to the sample. These optical and electrical measurements may be done simultaneously or combined to do an experiment such as photoconductivity. 


<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 17 -->

<P>     We perform these measurements in magnetic fields and at very low temperatures. This requires that the cell be made of a nonmagnetic material and that it be physically small. For work in pulsed fields, we would prefer to use a DAC made from electrically-insulating materials such as ceramic so that the rapidly changing fields would not induce
 eddy current heating. We have several different high pressure vessels (Table 1) that allow us to perform optical, electrical, and magnetization measurements in both pulsed and DC fields and to temperatures of 20 mK (Figure 2). The cells are all made entirely from beryllium copper, a very hard, strong, and relatively nonmagnetic material. We are still not able
 to use ceramics in these cells because of this material's low tensile strength. There are also probes available for orienting the pressurized sample with respect to the field and then rotating it along one of its axes.


<P>
<P>     Most experiments that can be performed at ambient pressures can also be performed in high pressure devices. The main limitation is the sample volume defined by the hole drilled through the metal foil and sealed by the tips of the stones. Higher pressures require the use of stones with smaller tips. Hydrostatic pressures (i.e. pressures that are constant
 across the sample) require the use of pressure transmitting fluids that do not have a lot of shear strength. These fluids, the rare gases, are very compressible and thus the pressurized volume must shrink many fold before any substantial pressure is generated. To reach hydrostatic pressures of two million p.s.i. (150,000 p.s.i. = 1 GPa = 10 kilobar) requires
 the use of a liquid helium or xenon pressure fluid (helium supports very little shear stress even at low temperatures and high pressures) and stones with tips less than 0.8 mm across. With the correct pressure medium and 0.5 mm tips, our two larger DACs can theoretically reach 30-40 GPa. The diameter of the gasket hole is typically limited to 1/3 to 1/2 of
 the culet tip. In the process of increasing the pressure by driving the stones together, the hole in the gasket collapses both in height and diameter. When stones with 0.8 mm flats are used, an initial gasket hole 0.4 mm in diameter and 0.1 mm high ends up not more than 0.3 mm in diameter and 0.04 mm thick. For many experiments, this is not a limitation.
 With fiber optics, optical experiments are very easy to perform and are limited only by the one ton load that the DAC can support and the optical window material, diamond. Type II diamond anvils, a very pure form of diamond, are available for infrared studies and a sapphire-ball cell can be used for UV studies where a slightly larger volume might
 be needed. We have just successfully initiated a magneto-optical study of a quantum well with Eric Jones (Sandia National Laboratories) and Clive Perry (Northeastern University) at Los Alamos where we took the sample to 50 T in the pulsed magnet while at 4 K. We were limited in pressure to 3 GPa but will extend that to pressures in excess of 7 GPa this fall. Even though the DAC is metallic, there was full penetration of the field.

 Electrical measurements are more time consuming to set up. They require insulating the metal gasket and attaching extremely thin, flexible metal ribbons to the samples (Figure 3). Two to six electrical leads can be attached to single crystal platelets only 120 mm on an edge and as thick as 40 mm. An alcohol mixture or glycerol is currently used for the
 pressure medium in the electrical transport measurements. This limits the hydrostaticity to pressures below 10 GPa, but this range will soon be improved as we switch over to a xenon pressure medium.

  Unlike a study that uses a chemical alloy series to understand the properties of a material, pressure permits the investigation of the intrinsic mechanism by altering the interatomic distances within that one specimen. Problems inherent to chemical alloy studies such as batch-to-batch variation and the introduction of impurities and associated scattering are thus avoided. A recent measurement in collaboration with Dr. James Brooks successfully monitored the changes in the Shubnikov-deHaas oscillations of an organic conductor, (BEDT-TTF)2TlHg(SCN)4, to pressures of 5.0 GPa at a base temperature below 20 mK (Figure 4). We also have worked with Professor M. Aronson of the University of Michigan to study the metal-insulator transition in a heavy fermion system. Pressures of 14 GPa were obtained
 before the leads shorted through to the metal portion of the gasket. One of the most attractive properties of pressure is that it allows the experimenter to continuously tune the electrical and optical properties of a material as the atoms are pushed closer together. This is something that is impossible to do with chemical alloy studies.


<P>
<P> 

    In addition to our current collaborations listed above, we will use high pressure at NHMFL to explore the conduction mechanism in the quasi-one- and two-dimensional molecular conductors. These conductors permit theorists to move to the next step in their understanding of interactions now that several particle interactions have been studied extensively.
 Synthetic chemistry has yielded a vast array of molecular conductors with a wide range of physical phenomena including superconductivity, metallic and semiconductor behavior, phase instabilities such as spin and charge density waves, and the observation of quantum hall effect. Being highly anisotropic and compressible, these materials are also very
 susceptible to pressure-induced modifications of the band structure and thus the Fermi surface. We intend to use

<P>

pressure to modify the inter- and intra-chain interactions and probe these changes by monitoring the electrical, thermodynamic, and optical properties of these materials in magnetic fields. Our ability to measure the angular dependence of these properties while at pressure and low temperature and in field (both pulsed and DC) will greatly help in our
 understanding of these low-dimensional conductors considered by many to be close relatives of the high temperature superconductors.
<P>

<P> 
    Pressure will also be used to explore what has become the holy grail of modern high pressure physics; the metallization of hydrogen at pressures in excess of 150 GPa. Theorists speculate that this material should be superconducting at room temperature. In a collaboration with magnetic resonance group at FSU and UF, we hope to carry out high pressure NMR studies to monitor this phase transition.

2TlHg(SCN)4, an organic conductor in an ongoing collaboration with a group from NHMFL/FSU headed  by Professor Brooks. The plot on the top shows the Shubnikov-deHaas
 oscillations at various pressures. The fundamental SdH frequency vs. pressure is plotted on the bottom and shows a dramatic change in the frequency above 3 GPa, suggestive of a pressure-induced change in the band structure or a structural transition.</I>

<p>
<i><b>The Downs and Ups of Funding</b></i>
<p>
	While the funding of science has had its ups and downs over the past half century, the down turn over the past several years has become critical. The current budget impasse has aggravated the situation with, for example, the NSF's budget threatened to be reduced by 25% for fiscal year 1996 as a result of a "continuing resolution" by Congress if no agreement is reached. The shutdown of "nonessential" elements of the government over the New Years season led to severe backlogs in processing proposals to the science funding agencies. New awards are currently frozen with increasingly dire consequences to science and technology as this impasse continues. Specifically, the renewal of the NHMFL-NSF grant is subject to this situation. In addition, corporate-sponsored scientific research has been shrinking in even the largest, most high tech companies, including AT&T and IBM. The rationale for this corporate disaffection with basic research is a renewed focus on short term profitability with the hope that others will pay for the science base on which industrial innovation inevitably depends.
<p>
	Finally, the political mode of operation in our country has shifted to being largely one of special interests aggressively lobbying for their specific agendas. This shift, coupled with the tradition of political non involvement of scientists, has led to science and engineering being "low man on the totem pole." This is particularly harmful in view of the fact that the NSF budget, for example, is minuscule compared to that of other agencies, such as HUD and VA, which are overseen by the same Congressional committees. Thus, special interest groups are very active in advancing the case for competing funding allocations. 
<p>
	To begin to address these very serious problems, a group of professional societies, including the physical, chemical, mathematical, materials, and biological societies, have issued an alert requesting members to contact their congressmen. A truly remarkable outpouring of support occurred at the end of January when many thousands of contacts were made in a one-week period. Representative Vern Ehlers, a fellow of the American Physical Society, circulated a letter in Congress recommending fully funding the NSF for the rest of FY '96. This letter, cosigned by eighty-eight representatives, was addressed to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Bob Livingston (R-LA) and VA/HUD Appropriations Chairman Jerry Lewis (R-CA). Many of the signatories are members of these important committees. Informal discussions suggest that there exists strong support in Congress and in the White House to establish full funding for NSF as was done for NIH. I would like to express my personal thanks to all of you who made the effort to express your support for this worthy cause. Only if we act wisely, vigorously, and in a timely fashion can we expect to maintain our place in the sun (no pun intended!).

<h1>Educational Programs a High Priority for NHMFL</h1><p>

<hr size=5>

<h2><B>NHMFL&#173;Los Alamos Collaborates with NC A&amp;T</B></h2>
<P>
<P>     For the second consecutive summer, students from North Carolina Agricultural and Technical (NC A&amp;T) State
 University in Greensboro are spending the summer in New Mexico gaining valuable research experiences that may
 shape their career choices. They are working alongside three principal investigatorsDr. Alex Lacerda (NHMFL),
 Professor Abebe Kebede (NC A&amp;T), and Dr. James L. Smith (LANL)thanks to a grant from the Department of
 Energy and the Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) Outreach Program. The project is entitled &quot;Physics
 of Materials Research Initiative at NC A&amp;T, NHMFL-Los Alamos, and STC-LANL.&quot; The three students this year are
 Marcel Bunford, Lee Phillips, and Tiffany McLendon.
<P>
<P>     The goals of this initiative are to promote competitive studies in the physics of new materials research, to assist
 faculty members in the Physics Department at NC A&amp;T to attract external funding, and to promote students for graduate
 studies in physics. To accomplish these goals, they are setting up satellite projects that are tied to the efforts at the
 NHMFL and LANL and are establishing an extended faculty visitor program. The satellite projects are Materials
 Growth and Characterization, Magnetic-Impurity Studies of High-T
c Superconductors, and High Magnetic Field Measurements in Highly Correlated Electron Systems.
<P>     The end of summer marks the beginning of the academic year for most schools and universities across the United
 States. It is, therefore, an appropriate time to focus on NHMFL's broad-based educational programs. These programs
 span the entire range of educational opportunities: kindergarten through 12th grade, technical, graduate, and postdoctoral.
 We are even involved in teaching those who teach! The following sampling of our educational programs suggests just
 how seriously we take our responsibility to share the outstanding resources of the laboratoryour facilities and our
 peopleand to improve the quality of science, mathematics, and technical education in America.
<P>
<P>&#183;     All three consortium sitesTallahassee, Los Alamos, and Gainesvillehosted undergraduate students this summer
 as part of the <I>NHMFL Summer Minority Internship Program.</I>
 The goal of this program is to provide women and members of underrepresented ethnic groups with hands&#173;on laboratory experiences that will encourage them to continue
 their education in science and to pursue careers in science, engineering, and research. 
<P>
<P>     The laboratory sponsored ten students this year. One was Noel Florez who is majoring in Electronics Technology
 at New Mexico State University&#173;Carlsbad. Noel participated in the Los Alamos critical current experiment for the
 LANL 50 T pulse and 20 T superconducting magnets. He also participated in a data acquisition project with Jordan
 Alexander who is a graduate student at the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology&#173;Socorro. Another intern,
 Ton Cao, is a chemical engineering student at the University of Florida. Ton worked with the NHMFL Project Group in
 Gainesville on the development of high performance resins for potting superconducting and pulse magnets. The main
 thrust of the group is to study the interactions between the resin formulations and cure cycles as they influence the
 mechanical and physical properties of the resins. Similar experiences were had by the five students who worked in
 Tallahassee this summer. As the program draws to a close for this year, everyone acknowledged its success and pledged
 to expand the program next year.
<P>
<P>&#183;     In the K-12 arena, the NHMFL offers several programs, including a comprehensive program of laboratory tours.
 The <I>NHMFL has toured over 5,000 K-12 students</I>
 through the laboratory's facilities, exposing young minds to the
 exciting possibilities of careers in science and research. The laboratory also takes its &quot;show&quot; on the road: The <I>
NHMFL has worked with the Tampa Museum of Science and Industry to design a traveling exhibit on magnetism. </I>
To the best of our knowledge, this is the only such exhibit of its kind in the United States. A third effort is our involvement with the
 Leon County (Florida) Schools Academic Resource Center. Through this program, about <I>
twenty gifted middle school students will attend weekly seminars and mentorship activities in the laboratory.</I>
 They will conclude the semester's work with a poster session for parents, teachers, administrators, and the media.
<P>
<P>&#183;     <I>NHMFL's cooperative program with Taylor Technical Institute</I>
 in nearby Perry, Florida, is entering its third year.
 Each quarter, two or three students from the Electrical and Instrumentation Technology Program work in the laboratory
 gaining excellent practical experience. At the same time the students make significant contributions to NHMFL computer
 support and operations efforts. We plan to expand this very successful program to other vocational schools in the
 region.
<P>
<P>&#183;     At the graduate level, we have established <I>
a graduate engineering program in Magnet and Magnet Materials
 Technology at FAMU/FSU College of Engineering. </I>
This is the only graduate program of its kind in the country, and we
 
<!-- Generation of story text from PM publication page 15 -->

<P>will be sponsoring annual fellowships. At the postdoctoral level, the NHMFL will conduct a national competition to
 award outstanding scientists and engineers two-year grants to conduct research at any of the three NHMFL sites.
<P>
<P>&#183;     Plans are underway for NHMFL faculty and staff to participate in <I>
NSF's National Chautauqua Short Course Program for college science teachers. </I>
Our course will include a review of materials science areas critical to advanced
 magnet technology, including an introduction to applied superconductivity, and it will explore science and technology
 areas in which magnetic fields play a critical role.
<P>
<P>
<hr size=5>
<P><h2><B>NSF-Sponsored Students Tour the Laboratory</B></h2>
<P>
<P>     On August 4, the NHFML hosted 22 undergraduate students participating in the National Science Foundation's
 <I>Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) </I>
 program at the University of Florida. The students hailed from
 colleges and universities from across the United States, and while most of these sophomores and juniors were chemistry
 majors, there were also aspiring teachers and mathematicians in the group.
<P>
<P>     After the morning drive from Gainesville, the group was welcomed by Dr. Tim Cross, FSU Professor of Chemistry,
 and Dr. Louis-Claude Brunel, Director of the NHMFL EMR Program. Following lunch, they toured the laboratory and
 discussed research issues with NHFML faculty and staff. Three students, Matt Garrett (FSU), Dustin Reed (Baldwin
-Wallace), and Matt Thornberry (James Madison), then had the valuable experience of presenting papers to an assembly
 of peers and NHMFL researchers.
<P>
<P>     The Chemistry Department at UF recently had this NSF REU program renewed through the summer of 1997. The
 goal of the program is to provide research opportunities to undergraduates at a critical point in their careers. It runs for
 10 weeks in the summer, during which time the selected students join a research group and participate fully in the
 research environment. The program also includes industry-sponsored seminar series, departmental tours, and social
 events. The NHMFL was pleased to support this important initiative.
<P>
<P>
<P>&#183;     A new partnership with the Florida Department of Education will establish and fund <I>
a two-month summer internship program for high school science teachers </I>
from seven regions of the state. Teachers will work closely with NHMFL
 researchers on ongoing projects; in turn, the teachers will develop teaching materials that will become part of the
 academic programs of their high schools and available statewide.

<H3>Our History</H3>
<HR WIDTH=280>
</CENTER>
<P>Upon the repeal of prohibition in 1933 and the return of the legal sale of alcoholic beverages to California, taxation and regulation of the manufacture, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages were given to the State Board of Equalization.  In 1955, an <A HREF = "http://www.abc.ca.gov/ABC/Article_XX.html">amendment to the State Constitution</A> became effective removing the duty of regulating the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages from the State Board of Equalization and placing it in the new Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control.</P>

<CENTER><H3>Department Programs</H3></CENTER><HR WIDTH=280>

<P>The Department's workload is divided into three elements: administration, licensing, and compliance. The Department's Headquarters in Sacramento consists of the Director's office and other offices performing licensing, fiscal management, legal, business practices, training, and personnel/labor relations and other administrative support functions for the Department.</P>

<P>For Administrative purposes, the Department is divided into two divisions within the State, a Southern and Northern with an Assistant Director in charge of each. The Department is further divided into 24 field offices. A District Administrator or District Supervisor is in charge of each district, which is staffed by Investigators, Licensing Representatives and clerical/technical support personnel.</P>

<P>Investigators investigate applications for licenses to sell alcoholic beverages and report on the moral character and fitness of applicants and the suitability of premises where sales are to be conducted. Less complex license applications are reviewed and processed by non-sworn Licensing Representatives. These reports are reviewed at the District Office and are forwarded to Headquarters in Sacramento for further review and processing. If the license is denied, or if its issuance is protested, the applicant is entitled to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge. After hearing the evidence, the Administrative Law Judge makes a proposed decision which is reviewed by the Legal Section of the Department and acted upon by the Director.</P>

<P>ABC Investigators are peace officers under Section 830.2 of the California Penal Code and are empowered to investigate and make arrests for violations of the Business and Professions Code that occur on or about licensed premises. Investigators are further empowered to enforce any penal provisions of the law any place in the State. Licensees who violate State laws or local ordinances are subject to disciplinary action and may have their licenses suspended or revoked. These licensees are entitled to a hearing before an Administrative Law Judge and an appellate process to the State Supreme Court.</P>

The California Supreme Court has held that the Decoy Program is legal and not entrapment.  The Decoy Program allows local law enforcement agencies to use persons under age 20 as decoys to buy alcoholic beverages from licensed premises.  The decision to use the Decoy Program is up to each law enforcement agency.<BR><BR>Law enforcement agencies that choose to use the Decoy Program must follow these rules:  (1) The decoy must be under 20 years old; (2) The decoy must appear under 21 years old; (3) The decoy must carry his or her own I.D. showing the decoy's correct date of birth or carry no I.D.  A decoy who carries I.D. shall present it upon request to any seller of alcoholic beverages; (4) The decoy must answer truthfully any questions about his or her age; and (5) After the sale, the decoy must identify the seller, face to face.

DEPOLLUTION DIESEL : RH&Ocirc;NE-POULENC ET NAVISTAR ONT MIS AU POINT UNE NOUVELLE TECHNOLOGIE QUI PERMET DE REDUIRE LES EMISSIONS D'OXYDE D'AZOTE ET DE PARTICULES AU-DELA DES NORMES AMERICAINES POUR 2004 EN UTILISANT UN CARBURANT DIESEL STANDARD
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>
PARIS, CRANBURY et CHICAGO ---
</B>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc S.A., 7&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, et Navistar International Corporation, leader mondial dans la production et la conception de moteurs diesel pour v&eacute;hicules utilitaires, ont mis au point une nouvelle technologie pour moteur diesel qui permet de r&eacute;duire les &eacute;missions polluantes au-del&agrave; des normes propos&eacute;es par le gouvernement am&eacute;ricain pour 2004, en utilisant un carburant diesel standard aux Etats-Unis. Cette technologie r&eacute;duit simultan&eacute;ment et fortement les &eacute;missions d'oxyde d'azote et de particules des moteurs diesel utilitaires.
<P>
<P>
D&egrave;s juillet 1996, Navistar avait &eacute;t&eacute; le premier constructeur de moteurs diesel &agrave; d&eacute;montrer sa capacit&eacute; &agrave; r&eacute;duire les &eacute;missions d'oxyde d'azote selon les normes propos&eacute;es par le gouvernement am&eacute;ricain pour 2004. Navistar avait r&eacute;alis&eacute; cette performance en utilisant un carburant diesel &quot;reformul&eacute;&quot; et une technologie avanc&eacute;e de moteur.
<BR>
<P>
La nouvelle technologie mise au point conjointement par Navistar et Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc permet de r&eacute;aliser d'importants progr&egrave;s dans deux domaines :
<P>
elle r&eacute;duit non seulement les &eacute;missions d'oxyde d'azote, mais &eacute;limine &eacute;galement plus de 90% des particules &eacute;mises.
<P>
elle utilise un carburant standard actuel.
<P>
&nbsp;
<P>
Elle offre la possibilit&eacute; pour les moteurs diesel utilitaires (camionnettes, bus, poids lourds...) d'atteindre les normes propos&eacute;s pour 2004 pour les &eacute;missions d'oxydes d'azote (NOx) et d'hydrocarbures imbr&ucirc;l&eacute;s non-m&eacute;thaniques (HCNM) et de diviser par dix les &eacute;missions de particules par rapport &agrave; ces m&ecirc;mes normes. Les futures normes ont &eacute;t&eacute; fix&eacute;es par un accord sign&eacute; aux Etats-Unis entre l'Agence pour la Protection de l'Environnement (EPA), le CARB (California Air Resources Board) et les producteurs de moteurs diesel utilitaires.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a apport&eacute; la technologie EOLYS&#153;, constitu&eacute;e d'un additif catalytique &agrave; base de c&eacute;rium. Ajout&eacute; en tr&egrave;s faible quantit&eacute; au carburant, cet additif favorise la combustion des particules accumul&eacute;es dans un filtre situ&eacute; dans la ligne d'&eacute;chappement. Il abaisse, en effet, de fa&ccedil;on significative la temp&eacute;rature de combustion des particules &agrave; un niveau r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement atteint par les gaz d'&eacute;chappement du moteur. Les particules accumul&eacute;es br&ucirc;lent au fur et &agrave; mesure, permettant la r&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;ration permanente du filtre. Ce syst&egrave;me permet d'accro&icirc;tre la performance et la dur&eacute;e de vie du filtre. L'additif EOLYS&#153; peut &ecirc;tre directement m&eacute;lang&eacute; dans le carburant ou introduit dans le r&eacute;servoir du v&eacute;hicule gr&acirc;ce &agrave; un syst&egrave;me automatique d'additivation. Les performances et la durabilit&eacute; du moteur ne sont pas modifi&eacute;es par cette technologie.
<BR>
<P>
Les tests ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;alis&eacute;s dans un laboratoire ind&eacute;pendant, l'Institut de Recherche du Sud-Ouest (Southwest Research Institute) &agrave; San Antonio, au Texas (E.U.). La technologie EOLYS&#153;, avec l'additif catalytique m&eacute;lang&eacute; au carburant, a &eacute;t&eacute; install&eacute;e sur un moteur diesel International&reg; T 444E. Le moteur de Navistar est &eacute;quip&eacute; du contr&ocirc;le &eacute;lectronique du moteur, d'un syst&egrave;me d'injection de carburant (&eacute;l&eacute;ctro-hydrolique HEUI), ainsi que d'un syst&egrave;me de recirculation des gaz d'&eacute;chappement.
<P>
<P>
Les niveaux d'&eacute;missions atteints au cours des tests sont d'environ 2,0 g/bhp par heure pour les oxydes d'azote et de 0,01 g/bhp par heure pour les particules (g/bhp : grams per brake horsepower - puissance du moteur). Le niveau de r&eacute;duction d&eacute;passe ainsi largement les objectifs propos&eacute;s pour 2004, qui fixent les &eacute;missions des moteurs diesel &agrave; un maximum de 2,5 g/bhp/h pour les oxydes d'azote (NOx) et les d'hydrocarbures imbr&ucirc;l&eacute;s non-m&eacute;thaniques (HCNM), et &agrave; 0,1 g/bhp/h pour les particules.
<BR>
<P>
Pour Daniel C. Ustian, Vice-Pr&eacute;sident et Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Navistar, Division Moteur et Fonderie (Engine and Foundry Division), &quot;cette d&eacute;monstration r&eacute;ussie avec Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc illustre bien notre volont&eacute; de mettre au point un moteur diesel fiable et comp&eacute;titif, capable d'atteindre &agrave; la fois des hauts niveaux de performance et de d&eacute;pollution&quot;.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Nous nous engageons &agrave; proposer aux industriels des produits innovants et performants, tel qu'EOLYS&#153;, qui apportent une solution pour le respect de l'environnement et qui accompagnent nos clients dans la r&eacute;ussite de leurs propres objectifs.&quot; commente Jerry Summers, Directeur de la technologie EOLYS&#153; en Am&eacute;rique du Nord. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc travaille en collaboration &eacute;troite avec Navistar sur ce projet depuis pr&egrave;s de deux ans.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
<I>
Navistar est le leader en Am&eacute;rique du Nord pour les ventes de v&eacute;hicules utilitaires moyens (camionnettes, bus, poids lourds) et un des principaux producteurs mondiaux de moteurs diesel de 160-300 chevaux. Navistar a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffre d'affaires de 6,3 milliards USD en 1995. Depuis 1989, Navistar d&eacute;veloppe des technologies capables d'atteindre les normes d'&eacute;mission fix&eacute;es par l'EPA. Cette m&ecirc;me ann&eacute;e, il avait &eacute;t&eacute; le premier fabricant de moteurs diesel utilitaires &agrave; avoir mis au point une technologie &quot;diesel sans fum&eacute;e&quot; respectant les niveaux d'&eacute;missions de 1994.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, gr&acirc;ce aux progr&egrave;s r&eacute;alis&eacute;s par les technologies &agrave; base de terres rares, est un acteur majeur dans le domaine de la d&eacute;pollution automobile, avec des solutions pour les moteurs diesel (EOLYS&#153;) et essence (ACTALYS&#153;). Pr&eacute;sent dans 160 pays, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc est le 7&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, avec un chiffre d'affaires de 84,8 milliards de francs (17,3 milliards USD) en 1995 et un effectif de 80 000 personnes.

New Technology Dramatically Lowers NOx and Harmful Particulate Emissions
</B>
</CENTER>
<P>
<B>
CHICAGO, CRANBURY, N.J. (USA) AND Paris (FRANCE) --
</B>
Two global industry leaders jointly have demonstrated a truck diesel engine technology that exceeds stringent, government-proposed emissions standards for the year 2004 using current grade U.S. diesel fuel. Chicago-based Navistar International Corporation (NYSE: NAV), a world leader in the production and design of mid-range diesel engines, and Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc S.A. (NYSE: RP), the global pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, have announced a technology that simultaneously reduces diesel engine nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particulate emissions.
<P>
In July, 1996, Navistar became the first diesel engine manufacturer to demonstrate its capability to meet reduced government-proposed NOx levels for the year 2004. Navistar accomplished this using a potential reformulated diesel fuel and advanced engine technologies. The Navistar/Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc demonstration builds on this earlier achievement in two respects:
<UL>
It reduces not only smog-producing NOx, but eliminates more than 90 percent of particulate emissions as well.
<P>
It uses currently available diesel fuel.
</UL>
Emission levels achieved with the two companies' demonstration technology meet the proposed 2004 heavy-duty engine NOx and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) standards while at the same time achieving a tenfold reduction in particulate emissions. The standard was set forth last year in a statement of principles signed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, the California Air Resources Board and heavy-duty diesel engine manufacturers.
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's EOLYS&#153; technology involves the use of a cerium-based fuel additive which, when added to diesel fuel in trace quantities, promotes the combustion of particulates collected by a passive, self-regenerating trap. The additive can be premixed in the fuel or added into the vehicle tank via an automatic on-board dosing system. Engine performance and durability are not affected in the process.
<P>
<BR>
<P>
EOLYS&#153; technology improves the performance of conventional particulate traps in diesel exhaust systems. EOLYS&#153;'s cerium-based catalyst significantly reduces the temperature of particulate combustion, making possible a continuous regeneration of the collected soot on the trap. This feature extends the life of the trap.
<P>
In independent tests performed at Southwest Research Institute (San Antonio, Texas), the EOLYS&#153; fuel-borne catalyst technology was applied to an International&reg; T 444E engine. This engine features Navistar electronic engine controls and a HEUI (electro-hydraulic) fuel injection system. It is equipped with exhaust gas recirculation.
<BR>
<P>
The tests resulted in NOx and particulate emissions of approximately 2.0 g/bhp-hr and 0.01 g/bhp-hr, respectively. These levels are well ahead of the target set in the proposed 2004 standard, which states that diesel engine emissions must be effectively limited to a maximum of 2.5 g/bhp-hr NOx and NMHC, and 0.1 g/bhp-hr particulates.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Our successful demonstration with Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc is part of an agressive effort to manufacture a reliable diesel engine product that meets performance and emission goals cost effectively,&quot; said Daniel C. Ustian, group vice president and general manager for Navistar's Engine and Foundry Division.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;We are committed to providing innovative and beneficial products like EOLYS&#153; to the industry, both to aid in the protection of the environment and to help our customers achieve their own goals,&quot; said Jerry Summers, Director of EOLYS&#153; technology in North America. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has been working on this project with Navistar's Engine Division for nearly two years.
<BR>
<P>
<I>
Navistar is the North American market share leader in combined bus and medium- and heavy-duty truck sales, and is a leading worldwide producer of diesel engines in the 160-300 hp range. The company reported total revenues of $6.3 billion in 1995. Since 1989, Navistar has led the industry in complying with EPA emission standards. That same year, it was the first diesel engine manufacturer to demonstrate the feasibility of meeting the 1994 federal heavy-duty diesel engine emission standards using &quot;smokeless diesel&quot; technology.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>
With 1995 sales of $17.3 billion, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc S.A. is the world's seventh largest pharmaceuticals and chemicals company, operating in 160 countries and employing 80,000 people. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc is a major contributor to the global clean air effort, with continued advancement of catalytic performance through rare-earth based technology in the field of diesel engines with its EOLYS&#153; system, and gasoline engines with its ACTALYS&#153; products.

(Paris, October 25, 1996) ---- For the third quarter of 1996, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc recorded net income of FRF 756 million, an increase of 13 percent compared with the third quarter of 1995 (+10.5 percent for the first nine months). The impact of the voluntary recall in October of Centeon's albumin products on the Group's net income amounted, for the third quarter, to FRF 81 million. Excluding this charge, net income would have progressed by 25.1 percent.
<BR>
<P>
This progress is a consequence of an improvement in results in the pharmaceutical, animal health and agro businesses.
<BR>
<P>
Results linked to operations (operating income + equity in net earnings of affiliated companies**) relating to human pharmaceuticals (Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer and Pasteur M&eacute;rieux Connaught) and animal health (Rh&ocirc;ne-M&eacute;rieux and Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Animal Nutrition) progressed by 26.7 percent* - despite the impact of the recall of albumin by Centeon - due to increased sales of new products (Taxotere, Lovenox, Granocyte, vaccines for Hepatitis A and B, Frontline etc.) and synergies resulting from the integration of Fisons.
<BR>
<P>
The agro sector, which benefited from a good economic climate in the world market and the successful commercialisation of its new products, notably Fipronil, recorded an increase in sales of 14.7 percent*, and an increase of 54.9 percent* of its results linked to operations.
<BR>
<P>
Despite the increase in volumes of Chemicals and Fibres and Polymers (+5.9 percent and +13 percent respectively), these two sectors continued to suffer from a drop in prices (-6 percent and -16 percent respectively).
<BR>
<P>
The divestiture of non-strategic assets achieved by September 30 amounted to FRF 6 billion. The ratio of net debt to equity has been brought down to 0.63 compared to 0.72 at the end of 1995.
<P>
<P>
Net sales in the third quarter of 1996 amounted to FRF 20.468 billion, an increase of 4.7 percent* compared to 1995 (+1.9 percent* for the first nine months).
<BR>
<P>
Results linked to operations amounted to FRF 2.189 billion for the quarter, an increase of +18.5 percent* compared to 1995 (+9.6 percent* for the first nine months).
<BR>
<P>
Earnings per share in the third quarter amounted to FRF 2.33, an increase of +9.9 percent compared with the third quarter of 1995 (+8.1 percent for the first nine months), the number of shares having increased by 2.6 percent.
<BR>
<P>
* On a comparable basis
<BR>
<P>
** Corresponding to Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's share of the net earnings of affiliated companies in which the Group owns an interest of between 20 and 50 percent.

</I>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc S.A. et Merck &amp; Co Inc. envisagent de regrouper leurs activit&eacute;s de sant&eacute; animale et de g&eacute;n&eacute;tique avicole pour cr&eacute;er une nouvelle soci&eacute;t&eacute; qui deviendrait le leader mondial de la sant&eacute; animale et de la g&eacute;n&eacute;tique avicole. Cette nouvelle entreprise, appel&eacute;e MERIAL, serait une soci&eacute;t&eacute; commune d&eacute;tenue &agrave; 50 % par chacun des deux groupes. Son chiffre d'affaires, lors de sa cr&eacute;ation, serait de l'ordre de 8,5 milliards de francs (1,7 milliard de dollars).
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc et Merck sont tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;sents sur les march&eacute;s de la sant&eacute; animale et de la g&eacute;n&eacute;tique avicole, o&ugrave; ils ont r&eacute;alis&eacute; d'excellentes performances &agrave; travers, respectivement, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux et Merck AgVet. Le regroupement de ces deux activit&eacute;s au sein de MERIAL offrirait le meilleur tremplin possible &agrave; leur croissance future et renforcerait leur potentiel d'innovation sur ces deux march&eacute;s.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<I>
<B>
SANTE ANIMALE
<BR>
</B>
</I>
<P>
En 1995, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux et l'activit&eacute; sant&eacute; animale de Merck occupaient respectivement le 4&egrave;me et le 2&egrave;me rang mondial sur le march&eacute; de la sant&eacute; animale. Le chiffre d'affaires global r&eacute;alis&eacute; par les deux soci&eacute;t&eacute;s en sant&eacute; animale sera de l'ordre de 7 milliards de francs (1,4 milliard de dollars) en 1996, sur un march&eacute; d'environ 53 milliards de francs (10,7 milliards de dollars). Globalement, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux et Merck auront investi plus de 600 millions de francs (120 millions de dollars) en recherche et d&eacute;veloppement, en 1996 : MERIAL disposerait ainsi du budget de recherche et d&eacute;veloppement le plus important de l'industrie de la sant&eacute; animale.
<BR>
<P>
<I>
&quot;MERIAL aura de nombreux avantages strat&eacute;giques d&eacute;terminants pour r&eacute;ussir sur un march&eacute; de plus en plus comp&eacute;titif et concentr&eacute;&quot;,
</I>
a d&eacute;clar&eacute; Raymond V. Gilmartin, Pr&eacute;sident-Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral (Chairman and CEO) de Merck. &quot;
<I>
Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux et Merck AgVet sont totalement compl&eacute;mentaires aussi bien en termes de gammes de produits existants, de produits en d&eacute;veloppement et d'esp&egrave;ces animales, que d'implantations g&eacute;ographiques&quot;.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Igor Landau, Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a ajout&eacute; : &quot;
<I>
MERIAL aura des moyens humains et financiers exceptionnels pour remplir une de ses missions essentielles : la d&eacute;couverte et le d&eacute;veloppement de produits v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires innovants. L'innovation, en effet, est la meilleure strat&eacute;gie pour servir &agrave; la fois les int&eacute;r&ecirc;ts des clients et des salari&eacute;s de MERIAL et ceux des actionnaires de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc et de Merck&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
Le regroupement de Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux et de l'activit&eacute; sant&eacute; animale de Merck permettrait d'offrir la gamme de produits et de services la plus compl&egrave;te du march&eacute; pour pr&eacute;venir et traiter les maladies des animaux d'&eacute;levage (bovins, ovins, porcs, volaille) et des animaux de compagnie et de sport (chats, chiens, chevaux...).
<BR>
<P>
Merck est consid&eacute;r&eacute;e comme la soci&eacute;t&eacute; de r&eacute;f&eacute;rence pour ses innovations dans le domaine des antiparasitaires, l'Ivermectine &eacute;tant le m&eacute;dicament v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaire le plus vendu au monde.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux est le leader mondial des vaccins pour une grande diversit&eacute; d'esp&egrave;ces animales. Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux dispose &eacute;galement d'une gamme de produits pharmaceutiques v&eacute;t&eacute;rinaires et vient de mettre sur le march&eacute; mondial le Frontline&reg;, qui repr&eacute;sente une avanc&eacute;e majeure dans le traitement des parasites externes, en particulier des puces et des tiques chez les chiens et les chats.
<BR>
<P>
G&eacute;ographiquement, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux est bien implant&eacute; en Europe et en Asie ; Merck est, pour sa part, tr&egrave;s pr&eacute;sent aux Etats-Unis. Le chiffre d'affaires de MERIAL se r&eacute;partirait, &agrave; parts presque &eacute;gales, entre l'Europe, l'Am&eacute;rique du Nord et le reste du monde, en ligne avec la r&eacute;partition du march&eacute; global.
<BR>
<P>
La compl&eacute;mentarit&eacute; des implantations g&eacute;ographiques et des gammes de produits des deux entreprises, alli&eacute;e au potentiel de d&eacute;veloppement de produits associ&eacute;s, devrait g&eacute;n&eacute;rer d'importantes synergies.
<BR>
<P>
Pour constituer la soci&eacute;t&eacute; MERIAL, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc apporterait l'ensemble des activit&eacute;s de recherche et d&eacute;veloppement, production et commercialisation ainsi que les produits de Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux, la division sant&eacute; animale de Merck apportant ses activit&eacute;s de d&eacute;veloppement et de commercialisation ainsi que ses produits.
<BR>
<P>
Par ailleurs, des contrats de production et de recherche seraient conclus entre MERIAL et les deux soci&eacute;t&eacute;s m&egrave;res pour lui permettre d'avoir acc&egrave;s aux nouvelles mol&eacute;cules et technologies susceptibles d'&ecirc;tre exploit&eacute;es en sant&eacute; animale.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<I>
<B>
GENETIQUE AVICOLE
<BR>
</B>
</I>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux et Merck apporteraient &agrave; MERIAL leur filiale de g&eacute;n&eacute;tique avicole, respectivement ISA et Hubbard.
<BR>
<P>
Avec un chiffre d'affaires d'environ 1,5 milliard de francs (300 millions de dollars) en 1996, MERIAL deviendrait le leader mondial du d&eacute;veloppement et de la production g&eacute;n&eacute;tique avicole, sp&eacute;cialis&eacute;e sur le march&eacute; des poulets de chair, des poules de ponte et des dindes.
<BR>

<P>
Le Conseil d'Administration de MERIAL serait compos&eacute; de trois membres de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc et de trois membres de Merck.
<BR>
<P>
Le Docteur John Preston, Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Merck AgVet, serait, pour les deux premi&egrave;res ann&eacute;es, le Pr&eacute;sident de MERIAL. Louis Champel, actuel Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux, deviendrait le Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de la nouvelle soci&eacute;t&eacute;. Guy Malher, actuel Pr&eacute;sident de Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux, deviendrait un des membres du Conseil d'Administration de MERIAL.
<BR>
<P>
Une lettre d'intention a &eacute;t&eacute; sign&eacute;e ce jour. Le projet est soumis pour consultation aux instances du personnel, selon le processus d'information et de consultation pr&eacute;vu par la l&eacute;gislation fran&ccedil;aise du travail. Il est &eacute;galement soumis aux autorit&eacute;s administratives europ&eacute;ennes, fran&ccedil;aises et am&eacute;ricaines.
<BR>
<P>
MERIAL devrait &ecirc;tre op&eacute;rationnelle au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre 1997, sous r&eacute;serve des diff&eacute;rentes autorisations n&eacute;cessaires.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<I>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc S.A. est le 7&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, dont le d&eacute;veloppement est fond&eacute; sur la d&eacute;couverte, la production et la commercialisation de produits innovants. Il a r&eacute;alis&eacute;, en 1995, un chiffre d'affaires de 85 milliards de francs et un r&eacute;sultat net de 2,1 milliards de francs, dont plus de 80 % dans les sciences de la vie.
<BR>
</I>
<P>
<I>
Merck &amp; Co Inc. est une des premi&egrave;res soci&eacute;t&eacute;s mondiales de produits pharmaceutiques et de services dont le d&eacute;veloppement est fond&eacute; sur la recherche. Merck d&eacute;couvre, d&eacute;veloppe, produit et commercialise une large gamme de produits innovants destin&eacute;s &agrave; am&eacute;liorer la sant&eacute; des hommes et des animaux.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc porte &agrave; 28,4 % sa participation dans le capital de la Compagnie Fran&ccedil;aise de Produits Industriels (CFPI) devenant ainsi le premier actionnaire individuel de cette soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<BR>
<P>
Suite aux premiers mouvements annonc&eacute;s dans son communiqu&eacute; du 7 novembre, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc poursuit sa mont&eacute;e dans le capital de CFPI en concluant le rachat des 10,1 % des actions d&eacute;tenues par la compagnie financi&egrave;re PARIBAS.
<BR>
<P>
Le Groupe Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc qui agit de fa&ccedil;on ind&eacute;pendante se r&eacute;serve toute possibilit&eacute; d'augmenter sa participation dans le capital de CFPI sans exclure totalement d'en prendre le contr&ocirc;le.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc pr&eacute;cise que son int&eacute;r&ecirc;t dans CFPI est essentiellement li&eacute; &agrave; l'activit&eacute; agrochimique de cette soci&eacute;t&eacute; et que cette prise de participation s'inscrit dans la logique de renforcement de ses positions sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux des herbicides et r&eacute;gulateurs de croissance. Elle poursuit ainsi son objectif de collaboration avec CFPI dans la production et la distribution des herbicides Oxynils et du r&eacute;gulateur de croissance des plantes Eth&eacute;phon, produits &eacute;galement fabriqu&eacute;s par cette soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<BR>
<P>
Septi&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, Rh&ocirc;ne Poulenc a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffre d'affaires de 84 milliards de francs en 1995 et se classe parmi les premiers dans chacun de ses m&eacute;tiers strat&eacute;giques. Avec un chiffre d'affaires de 10,3 milliards de francs en 1995, l'activit&eacute; Agro de Rh&ocirc;ne Poulenc d&eacute;tient 7,7% du march&eacute; mondial de l'agrochimie.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a pris une participation dans la Compagnie Fran&ccedil;aise de Produits Industriels (CFPI).
<BR>
<P>
Cette prise de participation intervient pour assurer le prolongement d'une collaboration de plus de 10 ann&eacute;es avec la CFPI pour la fourniture et la commercialisation de mati&egrave;res actives de sp&eacute;cialit&eacute;s entrant dans la fabrication de produits herbicides et r&eacute;gulateurs de croissance.
<BR>
<P>
Ces mati&egrave;res actives sont &eacute;galement compl&eacute;mentaires de nouvelles mol&eacute;cules que Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc d&eacute;veloppe sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux.
<BR>
<P>
Cette initiative correspond au souhait de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc en tant qu'actionnaire de jouer un plus grand r&ocirc;le dans la strat&eacute;gie industrielle et l'avenir de CFPI.
<BR>
<P>
Septi&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffre d'affaires de 84 milliards de francs et se classe parmi les premiers dans chacun de ses m&eacute;tiers strat&eacute;giques. Avec un chiffre d'affaires de 10,3 milliards de francs en 1995, le Secteur Agro de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc d&eacute;tient 7,7&nbsp;% du march&eacute; mondial de l'agrochimie.

Vienne, Autriche, le 5 novembre 1996

Taxotere
<FONT SIZE=1>
&reg;
</FONT>
(docetaxel), nouvel agent anticanc&eacute;reux, a obtenu un taux de r&eacute;ponse de 26,7% chez des patients atteints de cancer du poumon non-&agrave;-petites cellules (CPNPC), avanc&eacute; ou m&eacute;tastatique, r&eacute;sistant au traitement classique de premi&egrave;re intention, selon des travaux pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s aujourd'hui au 21&egrave;me Congr&egrave;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne d'Oncologie M&eacute;dicale (ESMO).
<P>
Le Dr Gilles Robinet, docteur en m&eacute;decine, du Groupe Fran&ccedil;ais de Pneumologie Canc&eacute;rologique, a pr&eacute;sent&eacute; les r&eacute;sultats encourageants d'une &eacute;tude de phase II, r&eacute;alis&eacute;e sur 27 patients atteints de CPNPC avanc&eacute; ou m&eacute;tastatique, pr&eacute;alablement trait&eacute;s par une polychimioth&eacute;rapie &agrave; base de cisplatine. Parmi ces patients, 26,7% ont obtenu une r&eacute;ponse partielle et 20% ont vu leur maladie se stabiliser (arr&ecirc;t de la croissance tumorale). La dur&eacute;e de r&eacute;ponse m&eacute;diane a &eacute;t&eacute; de 5,6 mois.
<P>
&quot;Nos r&eacute;sultats confirment l'efficacit&eacute; antitumorale significative de Taxotere,&quot; a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr Robinet. &quot;Ces r&eacute;sultats sont importants car, avant l'arriv&eacute;e de Taxotere, aucune alternative th&eacute;rapeutique n'&eacute;tait offerte aux patients atteints de CPNPC avanc&eacute; ou m&eacute;tastatique, quand la tumeur commen&ccedil;ait &agrave; grandir malgr&eacute; un traitement par cisplatine.&quot;
<P>
Les patients ont re&ccedil;u 100 mg/m
<FONT SIZE=1>
&#178;
</FONT>
de Taxotere en perfusion intraveineuse d'une heure, toutes les trois semaines, administr&eacute; en ambulatoire. 57% des patients avaient un cancer m&eacute;tastas&eacute; &agrave; trois organes au moins. Tous avaient re&ccedil;u auparavant une polychimioth&eacute;rapie &agrave; base de cisplatine. Un tiers d'entre eux avait b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute; d'une intervention chirurgicale et environ la moiti&eacute; d'une radioth&eacute;rapie.
<P>
A ce jour, Taxotere a obtenu une autorisation de mise sur le march&eacute; pour le traitement du cancer du poumon non-&agrave;-petites cellules dans 16 pays.
<P>
Les effets secondaires observ&eacute;s &eacute;taient pr&eacute;visibles et contr&ocirc;lables et incluaient: alop&eacute;cie, neutrop&eacute;nie, r&eacute;tention hydrique, naus&eacute;es et vomissements, et rash. Les patients avaient re&ccedil;u une pr&eacute;m&eacute;dication orale par corticost&eacute;ro&iuml;des afin de r&eacute;duire ou pr&eacute;venir les sympt&ocirc;mes de r&eacute;tention hydrique et les r&eacute;actions d'hypersensibilit&eacute;.
<P>
Le cancer du poumon est la premi&egrave;re cause de d&eacute;c&egrave;s par cancer &agrave; travers le monde, chez l'homme et la femme. Le cancer du poumon non-&agrave;-petites cellules en est la forme la plus fr&eacute;quente et repr&eacute;sente 75% des cas de cancer du poumon.
<P>
Taxotere est un nouvel agent anticanc&eacute;reux qui inhibe la division des cellules canc&eacute;reuses en &quot;figeant&quot; le squelette cellulaire interne, compos&eacute; d'un assemblage d'&eacute;l&eacute;ments appel&eacute;s microtubules. Les microtubles s'assemblent et se d&eacute;sassemblent au cours du cycle cellulaire. Taxotere facilite l'assemblage et bloque le d&eacute;sassemblage, emp&ecirc;chant ainsi la division cellulaire. Ce mode d'action original permet d'entra&icirc;ner la mort de la cellule canc&eacute;reuse.

<P>
Une &eacute;tude associant Taxotere
<FONT SIZE=1>
&reg;
</FONT>
(docetaxel) au cisplatine a montr&eacute; un taux de r&eacute;ponse de 55% chez des patients atteints de carcinome de la t&ecirc;te et du cou (O.R.L.). Les r&eacute;sultats de cette &eacute;tude de phase II, men&eacute;e par
<I>
l'Early Clinical Studies Group
</I>
(groupe d'&eacute;tudes cliniques initales) de l'Organisation Europ&eacute;enne de Recherche et de Traitement du Cancer (EORTC), ont &eacute;t&eacute; pr&eacute;sent&eacute;s aujourd'hui, &agrave; Vienne, par le Dr Patrick Sch&ouml;ffski, de la Medizinische Hochschule d'Hanovre (Allemagne), lors du 21&egrave;me Congr&egrave;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne d'Oncologie M&eacute;dicale (ESMO).
<P>
43 patients &eacute;ligibles pr&eacute;sentant des m&eacute;tastases ou une r&eacute;cidive locale ont &eacute;t&eacute; inclus dans l'&eacute;tude. Le sch&eacute;ma th&eacute;rapeutique consistait, toutes les trois semaines, en une perfusion intraveineuse de 100 mg/m
<FONT SIZE=1>
2
</FONT>
de Taxotere pendant une heure, suivie d'une perfusion de 75 mg/m
<FONT SIZE=1>
2
</FONT>
de cisplatine pendant trois heures. Le taux de r&eacute;ponse global a &eacute;t&eacute; de 55% (24 patients sur 43). Quatre patients ont obtenu une r&eacute;ponse compl&egrave;te (disparition de l'ensemble des signes cliniques et radiologiques de cancer). 20 ont eu une r&eacute;ponse partielle (d&eacute;finie par une r&eacute;duction d'au moins 50% de la taille de la tumeur mesurable). Il faut remarquer que, sur ces 43 patients, 10 n'&eacute;taient pas &eacute;valuables.
<P>
Il faut en outre noter qu'au sein des patients &eacute;valuables pr&eacute;sentant une tumeur localement avanc&eacute;e et n'ayant jamais &eacute;t&eacute; trait&eacute;s par chimioth&eacute;rapie ou radioth&eacute;rapie, 19 sur 20 ont obtenu une r&eacute;ponse objective au traitement.
<P>
&quot;Le cisplatine est un candidat tr&egrave;s prometteur pour une utilisation en association avec le docetaxel, du fait de son profil de tol&eacute;rance&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr Patrick Sch&ouml;ffski. &quot;L'association docetaxel et cisplatine a montr&eacute; une excellente efficacit&eacute; anti-tumorale chez les patients atteints de cancer avanc&eacute; ou m&eacute;tastique de la t&ecirc;te et du cou.&quot;
<P>
Les effets secondaires rapport&eacute;s &eacute;taient pr&eacute;visibles et contr&ocirc;lables. Les effets secondaires non-h&eacute;matologiques de grade 3-4 ont &eacute;t&eacute; r&eacute;versibles: asth&eacute;nie, diarrh&eacute;es, troubles de l'audition et neutrop&eacute;nie f&eacute;brile. La toxicit&eacute; h&eacute;matologique a &eacute;t&eacute; fr&eacute;quente, mais transitoire et rarement associ&eacute;e &agrave; des complications. La r&eacute;tention hydrique a &eacute;t&eacute; peu fr&eacute;quente, en raison d'une pr&eacute;m&eacute;dication orale par corticost&eacute;ro&iuml;des.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Sur la base des r&eacute;sultats de cette &eacute;tude, l'association prometteuse Taxotere et cisplatine sera bient&ocirc;t compar&eacute;e au traitement classique de chimioth&eacute;rapie dans une &eacute;tude de phase III de grande envergure, chez des patients atteints de cancer localement avanc&eacute;. Elle sera men&eacute;e par le Groupe d'Etude O.R.L. de l'EORTC&quot;, a pr&eacute;cis&eacute; le Dr Sch&ouml;ffski.

Le nouvel agent anticanc&eacute;reux Campto
<FONT SIZE=1>
&reg;
</FONT>
(irinotecan/CPT-11) a permis de contr&ocirc;ler la progression du cancer colorectal chez environ 50% des patients r&eacute;sistants au 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), inclus dans une &eacute;tude pr&eacute;sent&eacute;e aujourd'hui au 21&egrave;me Congr&egrave;s de la Soci&eacute;t&eacute; Europ&eacute;enne d'Oncologie M&eacute;dicale (ESMO). Ce traitement est la premi&egrave;re innovation dans le cancer colo-rectal depuis 40 ans.
<P>
&quot;Nos travaux confirment l'efficacit&eacute; de Campto chez les patients dont la maladie &eacute;tait &eacute;volutive malgr&eacute; un traitement par 5-FU&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Professeur Eric Van Cutsem de l'H&ocirc;pital Universitaire de Louvain (Belgique). &quot;Ceci est particuli&egrave;rement encourageant car, jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, peu d'alternatives th&eacute;rapeutiques s'offraient aux patients.&quot;
<P>
L'&eacute;tude incluait 107 patients ayant un cancer colorectal m&eacute;tastatique mesurable. Les patients ont re&ccedil;u 350 mg/m
<FONT SIZE=1>
&#178;
</FONT>
de Campto (dose maximale de 700 mg), en perfusion de 90 minutes une fois toutes les trois semaines. Le nombre m&eacute;dian de cycles de traitement &eacute;tudi&eacute;s a &eacute;t&eacute; de six (extr&ecirc;mes: 1 &agrave; 12).
<P>
A la fin de l'&eacute;tude, 95 patients &eacute;taient &eacute;valuables. 14% (13 sur 95) ont obtenu une r&eacute;ponse partielle (d&eacute;finie par une diminution d'au moins 50% de la taille d'une tumeur mesurable). 44% des patients (42 sur 95) ont &eacute;t&eacute; stabilis&eacute;s; la maladie a continu&eacute; d'&eacute;voluer chez 36% d'entre eux (34 sur 95) et 6% (6 sur 95) n'&eacute;taient pas &eacute;valuables. Toute stabilisation ou r&eacute;ponse &eacute;taient de longue dur&eacute;e. La dur&eacute;e m&eacute;diane de la r&eacute;ponse tumorale a &eacute;t&eacute; de huit mois, et la dur&eacute;e m&eacute;diane de stabilisation de cinq mois. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; cette activit&eacute; de longue dur&eacute;e, 50% des patients pouvaient constater un arr&ecirc;t de l'&eacute;volution apr&egrave;s quatre mois de traitement.
<P>
Le cancer colorectal est le deuxi&egrave;me type de cancer le plus fr&eacute;quent dans le monde occidental, et son incidence ne fait que cro&icirc;tre. Le pronostic, pour les 50% de patients dont la maladie progresse, n'a connu aucune am&eacute;lioration depuis plusieurs d&eacute;cennies. Chaque ann&eacute;e, plus de 160 000 cas sont diagnostiqu&eacute;s en Europe, et 95 000 d&eacute;c&egrave;s sont constat&eacute;s.
<P>
La cause exacte de la maladie reste inconnue, mais un r&eacute;gime pauvre en fibres, hypercalorique, riche en graisses animales ainsi que la consommation d'alcool sont des facteurs de risque connus. La maladie atteint l'homme et la femme de fa&ccedil;on indiff&eacute;renci&eacute;e et survient surtout chez les sujets &acirc;g&eacute;s de 50 &agrave; 70 ans.
<P>
Depuis son introduction il y a 40 ans, le 5-FU a &eacute;t&eacute; le traitement le plus efficace du cancer colorectal, avec un taux de r&eacute;duction tumorale de 20 &agrave; 25% lorsque le traitement est administr&eacute; en premi&egrave;re intention et est modul&eacute; par l'acide folique. Cependant la maladie progresse dans la plupart des cas, malgr&eacute; le traitement par 5-FU. Par ailleurs, l'apparition d'une r&eacute;sistance au 5-FU est fr&eacute;quente.
<P>
Campto est le premier traitement cytotoxique innovant commercialis&eacute; dans le traitement du cancer colorectal avanc&eacute; depuis l'introduction du 5-FU. Il n'existait auparavant aucune autre alternative th&eacute;rapeutique.
<P>
Campto est le premier agent d'une nouvelle classe d'inhibiteurs de la topoisom&eacute;rase I, enzyme essentielle de la division cellulaire. L'inhibition de cette enzyme tue les cellules canc&eacute;reuses. Comme la plupart des chimioth&eacute;rapies, Campto induit des effets secondaires tels que neutrop&eacute;nie (diminution du taux de globules blancs) et diarrh&eacute;e mod&eacute;r&eacute;e &agrave; s&eacute;v&egrave;re. Ces effets sont r&eacute;versibles et non cumulatifs. Ils peuvent &ecirc;tre contr&ocirc;l&eacute;s gr&acirc;ce &agrave; un traitement appropri&eacute; tel que le lop&eacute;ramide et l'antibioth&eacute;rapie.
<P>
Campto est commercialis&eacute; par Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer sous licence de la soci&eacute;t&eacute; japonaise Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer d&eacute;tient une licence pour Campto dans plus de 100 pays.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc d&eacute;veloppe des solutions pour la d&eacute;pollution automobile
</TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<! --- CORPS DU DOCUMENT --->
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a engag&eacute; des recherches depuis plusieurs ann&eacute;es dans la d&eacute;pollution automobile et participe avec les diff&eacute;rents acteurs du march&eacute; &agrave; la mise au point de solutions performantes et comp&eacute;titives pour am&eacute;liorer la qualit&eacute; de l'air.
<P>
Le Groupe s'appuie sur son expertise de chimiste et de sp&eacute;cialiste des terres rares pour d&eacute;velopper de nouveaux produits capables de r&eacute;pondre aux enjeux techniques, &eacute;conomiques et r&eacute;glementaires de d&eacute;pollution automobile.
<P>
Pour la d&eacute;pollution essence, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a mis au point des nouveaux compos&eacute;s de terres rares ACTALYS&#153;, qui permettent d'am&eacute;liorer la performance des pots catalytiques trois voies et d'augmenter leur dur&eacute;e de vie. Dans la configuration du pot pr&egrave;s du moteur, les produits ACTALYS&#153; permettent de r&eacute;duire les &eacute;missions polluantes d&egrave;s la mise en marche du v&eacute;hicule et offrent ainsi une solution au probl&egrave;me des &eacute;missions lorsque le moteur est encore froid. D&eacute;j&agrave; pr&egrave;s de six millions de v&eacute;hicules essence dans le monde sont &eacute;quip&eacute;s d'un syst&egrave;me de d&eacute;pollution &agrave; base d'ACTALYS&#153;.
<BR>
<P>
Le syst&egrave;me EOLYS&#153; a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;velopp&eacute; par Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc en 1989. Il permet de r&eacute;duire pr&egrave;s de 90% des &eacute;missions de particules Diesel. La technologie, qui combine l'action d'un filtre et de l'additif catalytique EOLYS&#153; permet de pi&eacute;ger les particules dans la ligne d'&eacute;chappement et d'assurer leur auto-destruction par combustion.
<BR>
<P>
Diff&eacute;rents programmes d'essais pour l'&eacute;quipement de bus et de flottes urbaines ont &eacute;t&eacute; lanc&eacute;s dans plusieurs grandes villes du monde (Ath&egrave;nes, Paris, Berlin, S&eacute;oul, Mexico...).
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a &eacute;galement engag&eacute; des programmes de coop&eacute;ration technique avec plusieurs constructeurs, tels que Navistar International Corporation aux Etats-Unis, leader mondial des moteur diesel, et Renault, un des principaux constructeurs automobiles europ&eacute;ens. Au Japon, le Groupe a sign&eacute; avec Sumitomo Metal Mining un accord de promotion de la technologie EOLYS&#153;.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc S.A. and Merck &amp; Co. Inc. announced today plans to combine their animal health and poultry-genetics businesses to form a new company that will be the largest in the animal health and poultry-genetics industries. The new, global company, to be called MERIAL, will be a stand-alone, 50-50 joint venture with a revenue base of $1.7 billion (approximate combined 1996 sales).
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc and Merck have been strongly committed to the animal health and poultry-genetics markets, and both companies have achieved considerable success through Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux and Merck AgVet. MERIAL will provide the best possible platform for future growth, and offer the greatest potential for important advances in animal health and poultry genetics.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>
ANIMAL HEALTH
<BR>
</B>
<P>
In 1995, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux's and Merck's animal health businesses held fourth-and second-place market rankings respectively. Their combined 1996 sales will be approximately $1.4 billion in a market totaling $10.7 billion. In 1996, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux and Merck will have invested a total of more than $120 million in animal health R&amp;D. MERIAL will thus have the animal health industry's largest R&amp;D budget.
<BR>
<P>
Merck Chairman and CEO Raymond V. Gilmartin said : &quot;
<I>
MERIAL will have many of the strategic advantages critical for success in a market characterized by increasing competition and consolidation. Merck and Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's animal health businesses are fully complementary, forming an excellent fit in terms of product line, pipeline and species and geographic representation
</I>
&quot;.
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc President Igor Landau, said :
<I>
&quot;MERIAL will benefit from quite exceptional human and financial resources to accomplish one of its key missions&nbsp;: the discovery of innovative veterinary products. Innovation is indeed the best strategy to serve the interests of MERIAL'S customers, employees and the shareholders of Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc and Merck&quot;.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</I>
<P>
The combination of Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux and Merck's animal health business will provide the animal health industry's broadest line of products and services for the prevention and treatment of diseases in production livestock (cattle, pigs and sheep), poultry and companion animals (cats, dogs and horses).
<BR>
<P>
Merck has long been recognized as the innovator in the field of animal health parasiticides and its ivermectin is the world's largest-selling animal health compound.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux is the worldwide leader in vaccines covering a broad range of animal species; in addition, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux markets a line of animal pharmaceuticals and has recently introduced Frontline&reg;, a significant advance in the control of external parasites, most notably fleas and ticks on dogs and cats.
<BR>
<P>
Geographically, Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux has a particularly strong presence in Europe and the Far East and Merck has a particularly strong presence in the U.S. MERIAL'S sales will be almost evenly split among Europe, North America and the rest of the world, much in line with the overall industry.
<BR>
<P>
Significant synergies are expected as a result of the broader product offering of pharmaceuticals and vaccines, the complementary capabilities in several key markets around the world and the potential for combination products.
<BR>
<P>
To create the new company, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc will contribute all the research and development, production, sales and marketing activities and products of Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux. Merck's animal health business will contribute its developmental research, sales and marketing activities and products.
<BR>
<P>
In addition, production and research contracts will be signed between MERIAL and the two parent companies allowing the new company access to new compounds and technologies which could be used in animal health.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<B>
POULTRY GENETICS
<BR>
<BR>
</B>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux and Merck plan to contribute their respective poultry-genetics businesses, ISA and Hubbard, to MERIAL.
<BR>
<P>
With a revenue base of approximately $300 million in 1996, MERIAL will be the new leader in the development and production of poultry-breeding stock, and will be a full-service provider to the chicken, turkey and egg segments.
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<P>
<CENTER>

<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
The Board of Directors of MERIAL will be composed of three senior executives from Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc and three from Merck.
<BR>
<P>
Dr John Preston, President of Merck AgVet, will be the Chairman of MERIAL for the first two years, and Louis Champel, President of Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux, will be CEO. Guy Malher, currently Chairman of Rh&ocirc;ne M&eacute;rieux, will be a member of the Board of MERIAL.
<BR>
<P>
A letter of intent was signed today. The project is being submitted for consultation under the French Legal Labour Information and Consultation Process. It is also subject to approval by the European, French and US authorities. Dependant upon such approvals, Merial is expected to be fully operational in the second quarter of 1997. In the meantime, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc and Merck will collaborate to prepare for a successful start up.
<BR>
<BR>
<P>

- From 21st to 25th November 1996, Annecy hosted a conference of 48 scientists of under 40 years old from 27 European countries**, brought together at the invitation of the French Academy of Sciences and the Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Foundation/Institut de France*.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">
The aim of this pilot was to enable young scientists from three disciplines - biology, chemistry and physics - and from widely varying backgrounds, to enrich their reflection on their work and to stimulate interdisciplinary collaboration between the scientific communities of different countries.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">
During the plenary meetings, such leading scientists as Claude H&eacute;l&egrave;ne, Jean-Marie Lehn, Guy Ourisson, Yves Qu&eacute;r&eacute;, etc., discussed past and future interaction between the three disciplines. A genuine &quot;market for ideas&quot;, this event enabled each of the young scientists to present their work in detail and to engage in in-depth discussions with the other participants.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">
Further to strict selection by the Academies of Sciences and research organizations in every country, more than 250 applications were submitted. According to Professor Guy Ourisson, member of the French Academy of Sciences and the driving force behind this initiative, the final selection conceals future Nobel laureates...
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Arial">
Given its success, the Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Foundation has decided to organize the Scientia Europaea conference on an annual basis.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc porte &agrave; 28,4 % sa participation dans le capital de la Compagnie Fran&ccedil;aise de Produits Industriels (CFPI) devenant ainsi le premier actionnaire individuel de cette soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<BR>
<P>
Suite aux premiers mouvements annonc&eacute;s dans son communiqu&eacute; du 7 novembre, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc poursuit sa mont&eacute;e dans le capital de CFPI en concluant le rachat des 10,1 % des actions d&eacute;tenues par la compagnie financi&egrave;re PARIBAS.
<BR>
<P>
Le Groupe Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc qui agit de fa&ccedil;on ind&eacute;pendante se r&eacute;serve toute possibilit&eacute; d'augmenter sa participation dans le capital de CFPI sans exclure totalement d'en prendre le contr&ocirc;le.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc pr&eacute;cise que son int&eacute;r&ecirc;t dans CFPI est essentiellement li&eacute; &agrave; l'activit&eacute; agrochimique de cette soci&eacute;t&eacute; et que cette prise de participation s'inscrit dans la logique de renforcement de ses positions sur les march&eacute;s mondiaux des herbicides et r&eacute;gulateurs de croissance. Elle poursuit ainsi son objectif de collaboration avec CFPI dans la production et la distribution des herbicides Oxynils et du r&eacute;gulateur de croissance des plantes Eth&eacute;phon, produits &eacute;galement fabriqu&eacute;s par cette soci&eacute;t&eacute;.
<BR>
<P>
Septi&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, Rh&ocirc;ne Poulenc a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffre d'affaires de 84 milliards de francs en 1995 et se classe parmi les premiers dans chacun de ses m&eacute;tiers strat&eacute;giques. Avec un chiffre d'affaires de 10,3 milliards de francs en 1995, l'activit&eacute; Agro de Rh&ocirc;ne Poulenc d&eacute;tient 7,7% du march&eacute; mondial de l'agrochimie.

(Paris, November 7, 1996)
</I>
--- Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has acquired a shareholding in Companie Francaise de Produits Industriels (CFPI).
<BR>
<P>
This shareholding has been acquired to ensure the continuation of the collaboration of more than ten years with CFPI to supply specialty active ingredients for the manufacture of herbicides and growth regulators.
<BR>
<P>
These active ingredients are also complementary with new molecules that Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc is developing for the world markets.
<BR>
<P>
This move corresponds to Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's wish, as a shareholder, to play a bigger role in the industrial strategy and future of CFPI.
<BR>
<P>
The seventh largest pharmaceutical and chemical group worldwide, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc had net sales of FF84 billion in 1995 and is amongst the leaders in each of its strategic businesses. With sales of FF10.3 billion in 1995, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's Agro Sector has a 7.7% share in the world agrochemicals market.

<P>
Vienna, Austria, November 5, 1996 -- Taxotere
<FONT SIZE=1>
&reg;
</FONT>
(docetaxel), a new anticancer agent, demonstrated a 26.7 percent response rate in patients with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) who did not respond to traditional first-line treatment, according to research presented today at the 21st Congress of the European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO).
<P>
Gilles Robinet, M. D., from the Groupe Fran&ccedil;ais de Pneumologie Cancerologique, presented encouraging new results from a phase II study including 27 treated patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC previously treated with a cisplatinum-based combination chemotherapy. Among those patients, 26.7 percent (4 out of 15 evaluable patients) showed a partial response and 20 percent (3 out of 15 evaluable patients) had disease stabilization (the tumor stopped growing). The median duration of response was 5.6 months.
<P>
&quot;Our results confirm Taxotere's significant antitumor activity,&quot; reported Dr. Robinet. &quot;The results are important because, prior to the availability of Taxotere, patients with advanced or metastatic NSCLC had no additional treatment options when the tumor started growing despite a previous treatment with cisplatin.&quot;
<P>
Patients were treated with 100mg/m
<FONT SIZE=1>
2
</FONT>
of Taxotere given intravenously for one hour every three weeks on an out patient basis. Fifty-seven percent of the patients had cancer that spread to three or more sites in their body. All had received previous cisplatinum-based chemotherapy combinations. One-third had undergone surgery and nearly half of them had received radiotherapy.
<P>
Taxotere is currently approved in 16 countries for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer.
<P>
The side effects were predictable and manageable and included alopecia (hair loss), neutropenia (reduced white blood cell count), fluid retention, nausea and vomiting, and skin rash. Patients were pre-treated with oral corticosteroids to reduce the severity of fluid retention and hypersensitivity reactions.
<P>
Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in men and women in the world. Non-small cell lung cancer is the most common form of lung cancer accounting for 75 percent of all lung cancer cases.
<BR>
<P>
Taxotere is a new anticancer agent that inhibits cancer cell division by essentially &quot;freezing&quot; the cell's internal skeleton, which is made up of elements called microtubules. Microtubules assemble and disassemble during the cell cycle, but Taxotere promotes the assembly and blocks the disassembly, thus preventing cancer cells from dividing. This action can lead to cancer cell death.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer is a global pharmaceutical company dedicated to improving human health. The company has a well established commitment to oncology that includes its gene therapy division, RPR Gencell, and its innovative anticancer agents Taxotere

Granocyte is licensed from Chugai Pharmaceutical Company, based in Tokyo, Japan, through a joint venture, Chugai-RP.

Vienna, Austria, November 4, 1996 -- A study combining Taxotere
<FONT SIZE=1>
&reg;
</FONT>
(docetaxel) and cisplatin showed that the combination treatment regimen demonstrated a 55 percent response rate in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Results of this cooperative phase II trial of the Early Clinical Studies Group of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) were presented today by Dr. Patrick Sch&ouml;ffski, Medizinische Hochschule, Hanover, Germany at the 21st European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress in Vienna.
<P>
Forty-three eligible patients with metastatic disease or recurrent disease were enrolled in the study. The treatment schedule was 100 mg/m2 of Taxotere administered as a one-hour i.v. infusion followed by a 75 mg/m2 dose of cisplatin as a three-hour infusion every three weeks. The overall response rate in the intent-to-treat population was 55 percent (24 of 43 patients). Four patients showed a complete response (disappearance of all clinical and radiological signs of cancer) and 20 demonstrated a partial response (defined as a 50 percent or greater reduction in measurable tumor size). It is to be noted that out of those 43 patients, 10 were not evaluable.
<P>
Importantly, in evaluable patients with locally advanced disease who were not previously treated with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, 19 out of 20 had an objective response to the treatment.
<P>
&quot;Cisplatin is a very promising candidate for combination with docetaxel due to its safety profile,&quot; said Dr. Sch&ouml;fski. &quot;The combination of docetaxel and cisplatin has excellent antitumor activity in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck both in locally advanced and metastatic disease.&quot;
<P>
The side effects were predictable and manageable. The most common reversible non-hematological grade 3-4 side effects were asthenia, diarrhea, hearing loss and neutropenic fever. Hematological toxicity was frequent but transient and rarely associated with complications. Fluid retention was very infrequent due to oral premedication with corticosteroids.
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Based on the findings of this study, this promising combination therapy of Taxotere with cisplatin will soon be compared with standard chemotherapy in a large scale phase III trial, in patients with locally advanced disease, conducted by the EORTC Head and Neck Study Group,&quot; said Dr. Sch&ouml;ffski.
<P>
Taxotere is a new anticancer agent that inhibits cancer cell division by essentially &quot;freezing&quot; the cell's internal skeleton, which is made up of elements called microtubules. Microtubules assemble and disassemble during the cell cycle, but Taxotere promotes the assembly and blocks the disassembly, thus preventing cancer cells from dividing. This action can lead to cancer cell death.

First New Treatment in Nearly 40 Years

Vienna, Austria, November 4, 1996 -- The new anticancer agent Campto
<FONT SIZE=1>
&reg;
</FONT>
(irinotecan / CPT-11) was found to control the progression of colorectal cancer in about 50 percent of the 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) - resistant patients studied, according to research presented today at the 21st European Society of Medical Oncology (ESMO) Congress. The drug represents the first therapeutic innovation in colorectal cancer in 40 years.
<P>
&quot;Our research confirmed that Campto is efficacious in patients whose disease had worsened, despite prior therapy with 5-FU,&quot; said lead researcher Professor Eric Van Cutsem, University Hospital, Leuven, Belgium. &quot;This is particularly encouraging because until now patients had few additional treatment options.&quot;
<P>
The study involved 107 patients with measurable metastatic colorectal cancer. Patients were given Campto 350 mg/m
<FONT SIZE=1>
2
</FONT>
(maximum 700 mg) as a 90-minute infusion once every three weeks. The median number of drug treatment cycles administered was six (range 1 - 12).
<P>
At the completion of the study, 95 patients were eligible for response evaluation. Fourteen percent (13 of 95) had a partial response (defined as a 50 percent or greater reduction in measurable tumor size), 44 percent (42 of 95) had a stabilization of their disease, 36 percent (34 of 95) had disease progression and six percent (6 of 95) were not evaluable. Median duration of the tumor response was eight months, and median duration of disease stabilization was five months. Fifty percent of the patients were likely to be free from disease progression after four months of therapy.
<P>
Colorectal cancer is the second most prevalent cancer in the western world and the incidence is rising. Unfortunately, the outlook for the estimated 50 percent of patients who develop advanced disease has not improved over the last several decades. In Europe, about 160,000 people are diagnosed with the disease and 95,000 will die each year.
<P>
The exact cause of the disease is not known, but a diet low in fiber and high in animal fat, excess calories and alcohol are well-known risk factors. It affects men and women equally and occurs most frequently in people between the ages of 50 and 70.
<BR>
<P>
Since its introduction 40 years ago, 5-FU has been the most effective treatment of colorectal cancer, with a tumor shrinkage response rate of 20 to 25 percent when given as first-line treatment modulated by folinic acid. In most cases however, the disease progresses, despite 5-FU therapy. In addition, many patients develop resistance to 5-FU.
<P>
Campto is the first innovative therapeutic approach to be marketed for the treatment of advanced colorectal cancer since 5-FU was introduced. Prior to the use of Campto, no effective treatment alternative was available.
<P>
Campto is the first agent of a new class of inhibitors of topoisomerase I, an enzyme essential for cell division. Inhibition of this enzyme's activity kills cancer cells. As is often seen with cancer chemotherapy agents, side effects such as neutropenia (a decrease in white blood cells) and moderate to severe diarrhea occur with Campto. These effects are reversible and not cumulative, and can be controlled through an appropriate use of medications such as loperamide and antibiotics.
<P>
Campto is licensed by Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer (RPR) from Yakult Honsha Co., Ltd. of Japan. RPR has the rights to Campto in more than 100 countries.

Collegeville, PA and Paris, France, October 23, 1996 - Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer Inc. (NYSE:RPR) reported good growth in earnings during the third quarter with earnings per share of $.72 increasing 18% compared to pro forma earnings per share of $ .61 during the third quarter of 1995. Third quarter earnings per share were reduced by $.17 due to the estimated impact of a voluntary recall of Albuminar

<FONT FACE="Palatino">
by Centeon L.L.C., a joint venture of which RPR owns 50%. Adjusting for the impact of this recall, earnings per share would have been $.89, representing a gain of 46% over pro forma earnings per share during the comparable period in 1995. The company's fourth quarter results will be impacted by lost sales of Centeon products, as Albuminar and Plasma Plex shipments are not expected to resume prior to January 1997.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">
In mid-1996, RPR licensed to Medeva plc, rights to certain non-strategic products acquired with Fisons and sold its UK generics business. Sales from these products are not reflected in the third quarter 1996 results, and consequently, reported third quarter sales of $1,278 million declined by 1% from 1995 pro forma sales. Excluding the impact of divested products (-3%) and the negative impact of currency fluctuation (-2%), sales would have risen 4%, mainly due to volume growth.

&quot;We will continue to focus on innovation as our top strategic priority,&quot; said Michel de Rosen, Chairman &amp; CEO. &quot;Successful commercialization of 3 products will be key to our growth between now and the year 2000 -- Taxotere's successful launch in the United States and Europe, and its pending approval in Japan, adds to the global scope of this important anti-cancer product. While Lovenox has already gained the leading position in the low molecular weight heparin market, reporting of the ESSENCE trial results at the American Heart Association meeting in November, will provide a perspective on its potential utility in arterial indications such as unstable angina.

(1) Pro forma results have been prepared as if the acquisitions of Fisons plc and Applied Immune Sciences, Inc. and the formation of the Centeon joint venture had occurred on January 1, 1995 and include adjustments for financing charges and amortization related to the acquisition transactions.

(2) Third quarter 1996 income from equity affiliates, including the Company's interest in the Centeon joint venture, was substantially reduced by charges of $33.8 million ($.17 per share) associated with the estimated impact of Centeon's voluntary recall of certain albumin products sold under the trade names Albuminar&reg; and Plasma Plex&reg;. Income from equity affiliates on a year-to-date basis totaled $77.5 million in 1996. Other (income) - net for the first nine months of 1996 also reflects increased provisions for certain matters of litigation and gains on sales of nonstrategic investments recorded in the second quarter; the net impact of these items was not material.

(3) Other (income) - net for the three and nine months ended September 30, 1995 includes income from equity affiliates totaling $45.0 million and $127.2 million, respectively, on a pro forma basis. Other (income) - net for nine-month pro forma 1995 also includes pretax income of $24.1 million ($.10 per share) from gains on asset sales, net of the reassessment of certain asset carrying values.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Develops Solutions for Reducing Engine Emissions
</TH>
</TR>
</TABLE>
<P>
<! --- CORPS DU DOCUMENT --->
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has been researching emission reduction for more than 20 years, and has worked with various companies to develop high-performance solutions and competitive products for improving air quality. Through its expertise in rare earth chemistry, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has been able to develop new products that reduce emissions in trucks and automobiles and meet demanding technical, regulatory and cost challenges.
<BR>
<P>
For gasoline automobile applications, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has developed the ACTALYS&#153; rare earth compounds for reducing fuel emissions. These compounds improve the performance and durability of three-way catalysts. ACTALYS&#153; products are ideal for close-coupled applications and begin reducing emissions as soon as the engine is started, thus eliminating the problem of cold-start emissions. Six million vehicles in the world are already equipped with ACTALYS&#153; based systems.
<BR>
<P>
The EOLYS&#153; system was developed by Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc in 1989 and reduces close to 90% of diesel particulate emissions. The technology, which combines the use of a trap with the action of the EOLYS&#153; catalytic additive, ensures that particulates are destroyed during combustion.
<BR>
<P>
Studies have been launched in several major cities around the world (such as Athens, Paris, Berlin, and Seoul) to test the EOLYS&#153; system on various fleets of urban vehicles, including buses, trucks, and taxis. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has also entered into a technical cooperation with several diesel engine manufacturers. These include the U.S.-based Navistar International Corporation, a world leader in the production and design of mid-range diesel engines, and Renault, one of Europe's major automobile manufacturers. In Japan, the company recently signed an agreement with Sumitomo Metal Mining to promote the EOLYS&#153; technology.

UNE VRAIE D&Eacute;CENTRALISATION DANS UN VRAI GROUPE
<P>
La vocation de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc est d'apporter, par ses innovations dans le domaine des sciences de la vie et de la chimie, des produits et des services destin&eacute;s &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration du bien-&ecirc;tre des hommes.
</B>
<P>
Le groupe Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc est organis&eacute; en filiales ou Entreprises d&eacute;centralis&eacute;es, coh&eacute;rentes en termes de march&eacute;, de m&eacute;tier industriel, de concurrence et de strat&eacute;gie.
<br>
Ces activit&eacute;s sont responsables de leur gestion et de leur d&eacute;veloppement au niveau mondial. Elles disposent de leurs moyens de recherche-d&eacute;veloppement, de production, de marketing, etc.
<br>
Adapt&eacute;e &agrave; leurs priorit&eacute;s strat&eacute;giques, &agrave; leurs facteurs-cl&eacute;s de succ&egrave;s et &agrave; leur implantation g&eacute;ographique, leur organisation favorise l'initiative, la responsabilit&eacute; et l'esprit d'entreprendre, &agrave; tous les niveaux.
<br>
Filiales et Entreprises sont regroup&eacute;es en quatre Secteurs : Sant&eacute;, Agro, Chimie, Fibres et Polym&egrave;res.
<P>
Parall&egrave;lement, l'appartenance &agrave; un groupe puissant permet &agrave; chaque activit&eacute; de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier de ressources communes (finances, sciences et technologies, r&eacute;seau commercial mondial, ressources humaines, communication&#133;).
<br>
Cette puissance commune autorise des sauts strat&eacute;giques (innovations, acquisitions, accords, investissements, implantations&#133;), qui seraient hors de port&eacute;e d'une entit&eacute; isol&eacute;e. La valeur &eacute;conomique de l'ensemble est sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle de la somme des parties.

<P>
L'augmentation des effectifs du secteur Sant&eacute;, pour la p&eacute;riode 1993 &agrave; 1995, est essentiellement li&eacute;e &agrave; l'acquisition des soci&eacute;t&eacute;s Cooper et Fisons plc. La baisse des effectifs du secteur Fibres et Polym&egrave;res pour la p&eacute;riode 1993 &agrave; 1995 est principalement li&eacute;e &agrave; la d&eacute;consolidation de certaines activit&eacute;s.
<P>
Internationaliser les &eacute;quipes, respecter les cultures de chaque pays, d&eacute;centraliser les responsabilit&eacute;s, favoriser le d&eacute;veloppement des personnes et des comp&eacute;tences, cr&eacute;er un climat de confiance qui stimule les initiatives et l'innovation, privil&eacute;gier la concertation avec les partenaires sociaux, tels sont les axes de la politique Ressources Humaines de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc.
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc est aujourd'hui un groupe industriel mondial d&eacute;centralis&eacute;, qui vise &agrave; faire b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier chacune de ses activit&eacute;s d'une large autonomie, dans le respect des Principes pour l'Action, ainsi que dans le partage et le d&eacute;veloppement d'un patrimoine commun.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc encourage la mobilit&eacute; professionnelle et g&eacute;ographique, &eacute;l&eacute;ments favorisant le d&eacute;veloppement des carri&egrave;res et l'internationalisation des &eacute;quipes.
<P>
En 1995, 450 cadres du Groupe de diff&eacute;rentes nationalit&eacute;s sont expatri&eacute;s dans plus de cinquante pays et participent ainsi &agrave; son d&eacute;veloppement international. Ce nombre devrait s'accro&icirc;tre dans les ann&eacute;es &agrave; venir.

Pour accompagner ses objectifs d'excellence dans le travail quotidien, d'anticipation et d'&eacute;coute des besoins des clients et des march&eacute;s, ainsi que le n&eacute;cessaire d&eacute;veloppement des comp&eacute;tences, le Groupe met en oeuvre, dans le monde entier, des programmes de formation. Ces efforts ont repr&eacute;sent&eacute;, en 1995, un investissement de pr&egrave;s de 5 % de la masse salariale.

En 1995, les effectifs du Groupe se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; 82 556 personnes dans le monde, dont 35 547 en France.
<P>
En France, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a recrut&eacute; 1 370 personnes en contrat &agrave; dur&eacute;e ind&eacute;termin&eacute;e, dont 500 jeunes de moins de 26 ans, gr&acirc;ce, notamment, au d&eacute;veloppement du dispositif de pr&eacute;retraite progressive. Le Groupe a &eacute;galement engag&eacute; plusieurs actions en faveur de la formation et de l'insertion des jeunes. Dans ce cadre, 450 jeunes sont actuellement form&eacute;s en apprentissage. L'aide au d&eacute;veloppement local de petites et moyennes entreprises a &eacute;t&eacute; accentu&eacute;e.

<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc souhaite proc&eacute;der r&eacute;guli&egrave;rement &agrave; des augmentations de capital r&eacute;serv&eacute;es &agrave; l'ensemble de ses salari&eacute;s dans le monde, afin de les associer plus &eacute;troitement &agrave; la vie et aux r&eacute;sultats du Groupe. Compte tenu des actions souscrites lors de la privatisation, du plan d'int&eacute;ressement, et des augmentations de capital r&eacute;alis&eacute;es depuis 1994, l'ensemble des salari&eacute;s d&eacute;tient 4,31 % du capital social. Des contrats d'int&eacute;ressement et de participation ont &eacute;t&eacute; conclus dans les principales soci&eacute;t&eacute;s fran&ccedil;aises du Groupe.

Concertation

<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc privil&eacute;gie la concertation et la n&eacute;gociation avec les repr&eacute;sentants des salari&eacute;s. En France, elles s'effectuent de fa&ccedil;on de plus en plus d&eacute;centralis&eacute;e, afin de r&eacute;pondre aux sp&eacute;cificit&eacute;s et aux situations particuli&egrave;res. De nombreux accords ont ainsi &eacute;t&eacute; sign&eacute;s dans les domaines de l'emploi, des r&eacute;mun&eacute;rations et de la protection sociale.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc consid&egrave;re que le r&ocirc;le d'une entreprise ne se limite pas &agrave; sa finalit&eacute; &eacute;conomique, mais &eacute;galement &agrave; se reconna&icirc;tre des responsabilit&eacute;s citoyennes &agrave; l'&eacute;gard de la communaut&eacute; dans laquelle elle s'ins&egrave;re.

Cette Cit&eacute;, construite essentiellement en bois, a non seulement souffert des guerres successives, mais &eacute;galement des conditions climatiques propres &agrave; la r&eacute;gion qui favorisent le d&eacute;veloppement exceptionnel de la v&eacute;g&eacute;tation, de lichens, d'insectes et tout particuli&egrave;rement des termites. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, en collaboration avec l'UNESCO et les autorit&eacute;s vietnamiennes, a accept&eacute; de restaurer certains b&acirc;timents de la Cit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale, en apportant son expertise pour prot&eacute;ger les bois neufs des attaques des termites, arr&ecirc;ter la destruction des bois anciens, et &eacute;liminer les termiti&egrave;res dans le sol.

THE BENEFITS OF DECENTRALIZATION BACKED BY THE STRENGTHS OF A MAJOR GROUP
</B>
<P>
The Group is built around decentralized subsidiaries or Enterprises, each of which is sharply focused on a single market, a single core industrial competency, a single group of competitors and a single strategy. These businesses are responsible for their management and growth at the global level. They have their own research and development, production, marketing and other resources. Their organization is shaped by each one's specific strategic vision, critical success factors, and geographical reach, and is designed to encourage employee initiative, empowerment and an entrepreneurial attitude toward all aspects of corporate life. The subsidiaries and Enterprises are combined into four Sectors: Health, Agro, Chemical, and Fibers and Polymers.
<B>
&nbsp;
</B>
<P>
At the same time, as members of a powerful Group, the businesses can tap into common resources in the areas of finance, science and technology, global sales networks, human resources, communication, and more. By leveraging this combined strength, the units can make strategic leaps concerning innovations, acquisitions, agreements, investments, or foreign facilities that would be impossible for a small business on its own. The economic value of the whole is greater than that of the separate parts combined.

Country Executives
</B>
<p>
Country Executives represent Group interests in their local markets and their countries' interests within the Group. Chosen from among local operating company line managers, Country Executives translate Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's global corporate identity and values (&#147;Guide-lines for Action&#148;). They participate in the development of Sector operations by encouraging cross-fertilization and cross-functional synergy and by contributing their skills and knowledge of the local environment.

Sector Boards
</B>
<P>
Each Sector is managed by a Sector Board, which is chaired by a member of the Group Executive Committee. The Sector Board examines the Sector's strategic and operating plans, capital plans and budgets, major action plans, and financial results. It also ensures that the Sector's Enterprises consistently operate in harmony with Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's strategic vision, objectives, values, and management principles.Country Executives Sector Boa

The Executive Committee is the Group's principal management body. It establishes Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's global orientations and makes key decisions with respect to strategy, human resources, finance, international development, environment and safety, and corporate communications. The Executive Commit-tee delegates the supervision of each Sector, each Group function, and each strategic country or geographic zone to one of its members.

<P>
The significant increase in employees in the Health segment from 1993 to 1995 results principally from the acquisitions completed by Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer during this period. The significant decrease in employees in the Fibers and Polymers segment during the same period is primarily due to the deconsolidation of several businesses into joint ventures.

Organization
</B>
</I>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's human resources policies are designed to internationalize employee teams, respect local cultures, decentralize empowerment, promote personal growth, enhance skills and expertise, create a climate of trust that fosters entrepreneurship and innovation, and establish cooperative relations with employee representatives. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc is a decentralized global corporation that endows each of its businesses with extensive managerial autonomy.
<P>

<B>
Internationalization
</B>
</I>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc encourages professional and geographic mobility, as a means of developing careers and internationalizing employee teams. In 1995, 450 expatriate executives of various nationalities participated in our international expansion in more than fifty countries worldwide. This number is expected to increase in the years to come.

Training
</B>
</I>
<P>
Training programs are in place worldwide to foster excellence in daily work, to enhance skills and expertise, and to build a proactive, close-to-the-customer culture throughout the Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc community. In 1995, the equivalent of nearly five percent of the global payroll was committed to training.

Employee share ownership
</B>
</I>
<P>
To enhance employee involvement in the Group's business and financial results, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc has offered in the past, and expects it will continue to offer in the future, new shares of common stock for purchase by employees worldwide. All together, it is estimated that the employees own approximately 4.31% of Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's common stock.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc's vocation is to bring us products and services destined to improve our well-being, through its innovations in the fields of the life and chemical sciences.
<BR>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc believes that a company's role is not limited to its economic objectives, but that companies must also recognise their responsibilities as citizens towards the community into which they integrate themselves. This is why the Group, for several years now, has put great effort into its policy of sponsorship and partnership.

The Fondation Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc participates in the UNESCO Youth Education Project to preserve and promote cultural and natural world heritage. The project is comprised of three parts :
<ul>
<IMG SRC=../img/blueball.gif >
an international experimental project to bring into focus teaching modules on world heritage. 25 countries participated in this experimental project in 1995; and 9 of these received funding from the Fondation Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc;
<br>
<IMG SRC=../img/blueball.gif >
a youth forum on world heritage held in&nbsp;
<A HREF="http://www.ovpm.org/ovpm/sites/bergen.html">
Bergen
</A>
, Norway, from 26 th to 28 th June 1995.
<A HREF="gopher://gopher.unesco.org:70/00/doc/ch-ext/heritage/forum">
This forum
</A>
&nbsp;was a debating ground for young people from 30 countries representing different regions of the world, and for these young people and the mayors representing the &#147;Organisation of World Heritage Cities&#148;. The forum was also an opportunity to exhibit models made by schools participating in the pilot project ;
<br>
<IMG SRC=../img/blueball.gif >
the preparation, production and distribution of educational material, written documents and video films, to enable teachers to develop educational, multidisciplinary and innovative activities within the world heritage theme.

Preservation of cultural and natural heritage world wide
</B>
<br>
Two projects were carried out in 1995 : the restoration of the fa&ccedil;ade of the Senatorio Palace in the Capitoline square in Rome, and the preparation of the restoration of certain buildings of the Imperial city in Hu&eacute;, Vietnam, in liaison with UNESCO and the Vietnamese government.

The Imperial city of Hu&eacute;
</A>
</B>
</U>
<br>
The majority of buildings which make up the Imperial city of Hu&eacute; date from the beginning of the 19 th century. This city, constructed mainly of wood, has been victim not only of successive wars, but also of the climatic conditions of the area, which encourage the inordinate development of vegetation, lichens and insects, especially termites. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, in collaboration with UNESCO and the Vietnamese authorities, has undertaken to restore certain buildings in the Imperial city, bringing its expertise to protect the new wood from being attacked by termites, preventing the destruction of the old wood, and eliminating termite nests in the ground.

Projects 1996
</B>
<br>
In 1996, the Fondation Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc will pursue its activities in the areas of heritage preservation, education, research and scientific partnerships.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer a annonc&eacute; aujourd'hui que Centeon, sa soci&eacute;t&eacute; commune avec Hoechst, a d&eacute;cid&eacute; de proc&eacute;der &agrave; un retrait volontaire au niveau mondial de l'ensemble de ses lots d'albumine plasmatique. Centeon a pris cette mesure &agrave; titre de pr&eacute;caution contre le risque d'une contamination bact&eacute;riologique li&eacute;e &agrave; l'endommagement de certains flacons pendant le transport. Aucun autre produit de Centeon n'est concern&eacute; par ce retrait volontaire.

Conform&eacute;ment &agrave; l'accord qui avait &eacute;t&eacute; annonc&eacute; le 24 juillet 1996, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; CLAUSE SA, filiale rattach&eacute;e au Secteur Agro de RH&Ocirc;NE-POULENC, a conclu &agrave; date du 1/10/96

<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Cette op&eacute;ration la qui a pris effet au 1er octobre s'inscrit dans le programme de recentrage sur les activit&eacute;s strat&eacute;giques du Groupe Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, contribuant ainsi &agrave; son d&eacute;sendettement. Elle permet au Secteur Agro du Groupe, dans le cadre de sa strat&eacute;gie de partenariat avec l'un des leaders mondiaux dans le domaine des semences, de renforcer ses liens et sa collaboration avec le Groupe Limagrain

Apr&egrave;s avoir demand&eacute; la suspension la cotation du titre Clause SA le 18/09/96, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc confirme son intention de lancer une offre publique de retrait sur la totalit&eacute; des titres d&eacute;tenus par les actionnaires minoritaires de Clause SA avant la fin de cette ann&eacute;e.

Septi&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffre d'affaires de 84 milliards de de francs, et se classe parmi les premiers dans chacun de ses m&eacute;tiers strat&eacute;giques. Avec un chiffre d'affaires de 10,3 milliards de francs en 1995, le Secteur Agro de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc d&eacute;tient 7,5 % du march&eacute; de l'agrochimie.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rhodic, filiale &agrave; 100 % de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Agro S.A., lance, en France et en Allemagne, GOLIATH&reg; Gel, un insecticide qui va r&eacute;volutionner le march&eacute; professionnel de la lutte anti-blattes.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
D&eacute;riv&eacute; de la mol&eacute;cule fipronil, GOLIATH&reg; Gel est inodore, utilisable &agrave; tout moment de la journ&eacute;e, applicable partout, y compris &agrave; proximit&eacute; des appareils &eacute;lectriques, sans contraintes pour les occupants des locaux trait&eacute;s. Gr&acirc;ce &agrave; ces atouts, GOLIATH&reg; Gel remplacera avantageusement les traitements par pulv&eacute;risation.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
GOLIATH&reg; Gel est efficace du jour au lendemain et &agrave; des doses infimes gr&acirc;ce aux propri&eacute;t&eacute;s du fipronil, insecticide de la famille des ph&eacute;nyl-pyrazoles, issu de la Recherche de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Agro. Les blattes, attir&eacute;es par cet app&acirc;t, l'ing&egrave;rent, et meurent dans les heures qui suivent, apr&egrave;s que le gel ait attaqu&eacute; leur syst&egrave;me nerveux. GOLIATH&reg; Gel permet une mortalit&eacute; de 80 % en 24 h, 100 % en 72 h et une persistance d'activit&eacute; de 3 mois minimum. N'agissant que sur les invert&eacute;br&eacute;s, cet insecticide ne pr&eacute;sente aucun risque pour l'homme et les animaux domestiques.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
GOLIATH&reg; Gel est distribu&eacute; en France par Aurouze S.A. et Edialux, et en Allemagne par GSG mbH et Killgerm GmbH.wazzu
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT SIZE=2>
Cr&eacute;&eacute;e &agrave; la suite de la d&eacute;couverte de l'insecticide fipronil par la Recherche de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Agro, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rhodic a pour vocation de d&eacute;velopper et de commercialiser sur les march&eacute;s europ&eacute;ens des produits destin&eacute;s &agrave; la lutte contre les insectes nuisibles en milieu urbain (blattes, termites, fourmis, gu&ecirc;pes, mouches, puces...). Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rhodic est bas&eacute;e &agrave; Lyon.

(Paris, le 26 juillet 1996) ---- Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a r&eacute;alis&eacute; au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre 1996 un r&eacute;sultat net de 777 millions de francs, en hausse de 39 % par rapport au deuxi&egrave;me trimestre 1995
</B>
</I>
<B>
.
<I>
<B>
Apr&egrave;s un premier trimestre en retrait sur celui de l'ann&eacute;e pr&eacute;c&eacute;dente, cette progression permet d'enregistrer, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; ce qui avait &eacute;t&eacute; annonc&eacute;, une croissance du r&eacute;sultat net sur l'ensemble des six premiers mois de l'ann&eacute;e de 9,2 % (1 410 millions de francs ).
<BR>
</B>
</I>
</B>
<P>
<I>
<B>
Cette progression du r&eacute;sultat net du deuxi&egrave;me trimestre traduit l'am&eacute;lioration des r&eacute;sultats li&eacute;s &agrave; l'exploitation qui se sont &eacute;lev&eacute;s &agrave; 2 098 millions de francs, dont 1&nbsp;421 millions pour les seules activit&eacute;s Pharmacie et Sant&eacute; Animale.
<BR>

La Pharmacie et la Sant&eacute; Animale d'une part, l'Agro d'autre part, ont enregistr&eacute; une croissance de leurs chiffres d'affaires (+7,3 % et +6,7 %) &agrave; laquelle ont commenc&eacute; &agrave; contribuer les nouveaux produits lanc&eacute;s sur le march&eacute; (Lovenox aux Etats-Unis, Taxot&egrave;re, Granocyte, Rilutek, Fipronil et Frontline...). Les r&eacute;sultats de ces activit&eacute;s sont en progression notable, et en particulier la Pharmacie qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficie, sur ce deuxi&egrave;me trimestre, des premiers effets des synergies li&eacute;es &agrave; l'acquisition de Fisons.

</I>
<P>

<B>
En Chimie, la l&eacute;g&egrave;re croissance des volumes n'a pas suffi &agrave; compenser la baisse des prix. N&eacute;anmoins, conform&eacute;ment aux objectifs de son plan de redressement, la Chimie a continu&eacute; &agrave; am&eacute;liorer ses r&eacute;sultats au cours de ce deuxi&egrave;me trimestre. Enfin, l'activit&eacute; et les r&eacute;sultats du secteur Fibres &amp; Polym&egrave;res ont &eacute;t&eacute; s&eacute;rieusement p&eacute;nalis&eacute;s par la conjoncture tr&egrave;s d&eacute;favorable dans le Polyester, particuli&egrave;rement au Br&eacute;sil.
<BR>

Par ailleurs, le Groupe a r&eacute;alis&eacute;, au cours du semestre &eacute;coul&eacute;, plus de 5 milliards de francs de cessions d'activit&eacute;s non strat&eacute;giques, dont plus de 2 milliards ne seront comptabilis&eacute;s que sur le troisi&egrave;me trimestre.

Ces accords qui prendront effet au 1er octobre 1996 permettront de conforter le devenir de ces quatre soci&eacute;t&eacute;s.

La premi&egrave;re &eacute;tude &eacute;tait randomis&eacute;e, en double-aveugle et r&eacute;alis&eacute;e sur 560&nbsp;patients vietnamiens adultes, atteints de paludisme grave &agrave;
<I>
Plasmodium falciparum

. L'analyse d&eacute;taill&eacute;e des r&eacute;sultats de cette &eacute;tude montre que l'art&eacute;m&eacute;ther est au moins aussi efficace que la quinine dans le traitement du paludisme s&eacute;v&egrave;re r&eacute;sistant &agrave; la chloroquine. Le taux de mortalit&eacute; observ&eacute; avec les deux m&eacute;dicaments &eacute;tait de 13% sous art&eacute;m&eacute;ther (36&nbsp;d&eacute;c&egrave;s sur 284&nbsp;patients) et de 17% sous quinine (47&nbsp;d&eacute;c&egrave;s sur 276&nbsp;patients).

La seconde &eacute;tait une &eacute;tude randomis&eacute;e, ouverte, comparant l'art&eacute;m&eacute;ther et la quinine, tous deux administr&eacute;s par voie intramusculaire. Elle a inclus 576&nbsp;enfants gambiens atteints de neuropaludisme et a montr&eacute; que l'art&eacute;m&eacute;ther &eacute;tait aussi efficace que la quinine en intramusculaire. Le taux de mortalit&eacute; des enfants trait&eacute;s par art&eacute;m&eacute;ther &eacute;tait de 20,5% (59&nbsp;d&eacute;c&egrave;s sur 288&nbsp;patients) et de 21,5% dans le groupe sous quinine (62&nbsp;d&eacute;c&egrave;s sur 288&nbsp;patients).

Selon les auteurs, les d&eacute;riv&eacute;s de l'art&eacute;misinine, tel l'art&eacute;m&eacute;ther, induisent une clairance parasitaire plus rapide qu'avec la quinine. Ces &eacute;tudes mettent en &eacute;vidence l'importance croissante de ces d&eacute;riv&eacute;s face au risque de toxicit&eacute; de la quinine et &agrave; la menace grandissante d'un paludisme r&eacute;sistant &agrave; la quinine dans les pays end&eacute;miques. Les auteurs soulignent &eacute;galement que l'art&eacute;m&eacute;ther est une alternative pratique &agrave; la quinine.

On estime que plus de deux millions de personnes dans le monde, dont de nombreux enfants, meurent chaque ann&eacute;e de paludisme. Le paludisme est une maladie parasitaire end&eacute;mique dans certaines r&eacute;gions d'Afrique, d'Asie et d'Am&eacute;rique Latine. Il est caus&eacute; par un protozoaire intracellulaire appel&eacute;

, dispositif transdermique d'oestrog&egrave;nes (17-beta estradiol), a re&ccedil;u une autorisation de mise sur le march&eacute; en Italie, au Portugal, &agrave; Singapour, en Suisse et en Uruguay, pour le traitement des sympt&ocirc;mes associ&eacute;s &agrave; la m&eacute;nopause et pour la pr&eacute;vention de l'ost&eacute;oporose. Menorest est aujourd'hui enregistr&eacute; dans 23 pays.

Le patch Menorest a &eacute;t&eacute; con&ccedil;u pour &ecirc;tre confortable, pratique et esth&eacute;tique. Il se pr&eacute;sente sous forme d'une matrice adh&eacute;sive servant &agrave; la fois de support au m&eacute;dicament et de fixation sur la peau du patient. Le r&eacute;sultat est un petit patch fin, souple et translucide.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">
Menorest est disponible sous diff&eacute;rents dosages afin de r&eacute;pondre aux besoins en oestrog&egrave;nes de chaque femme. Il diffuse le 17-beta estradiol &agrave; travers la peau et dans le sang de fa&ccedil;on continue, durant trois &agrave; quatre jours. Cette technologie permet d'obtenir des taux d'oestrog&egrave;nes plasmatiques proches de ceux de la femme avant m&eacute;nopause. Toutes ces qualit&eacute;s devraient permettre une meilleure observance de ce type de traitement hormonal de substitution.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="Palatino">
La m&eacute;nopause appara&icirc;t en g&eacute;n&eacute;ral chez la femme vers l'&acirc;ge de 50 ans quand le taux d'oestrog&egrave;nes dans le sang diminue, provoquant ainsi des sympt&ocirc;mes d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ables tels que des bouff&eacute;es de chaleur, des sudations nocturnes et une s&eacute;cheresse vaginale. En Italie, par exemple, le nombre de femmes en &acirc;ge d'&ecirc;tre m&eacute;nopaus&eacute;es (45-65 ans) est estim&eacute; &agrave; 9 millions.

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc&nbsp;Rorer a annonc&eacute; avoir re&ccedil;u aujourd'hui, de la Communaut&eacute; europ&eacute;enne, l'autorisation de mise sur le march&eacute; de Rilutek

(riluzole) dans le traitement de la SLA. La SLA est une maladie neurod&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rative &agrave; l'issue fatale, &eacute;galement appel&eacute;e maladie du neurone moteur ou maladie de Charcot en Europe et maladie de Lou&nbsp;Gehrig aux Etats-Unis. Cette autorisation de mise sur le march&eacute; est valable pour les quinze pays de l'Union Europ&eacute;enne.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
Cette autorisation fait suite &agrave; l'avis favorable accord&eacute; par le CPMP (Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products), comit&eacute; scientifique de l'Agence europ&eacute;enne d'&eacute;valuation du m&eacute;dicament. Elle intervient moins d'un an apr&egrave;s le d&eacute;p&ocirc;t du dossier d'enregistrement dans le cadre de la proc&eacute;dure centralis&eacute;e d'enregistrement. Au cours des prochains mois, Rilutek sera mis &agrave; la disposition du corps m&eacute;dical par les filiales de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc&nbsp;Rorer dans les diff&eacute;rents pays europ&eacute;ens.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
Rilutek est le premier traitement qui a prouv&eacute; son efficacit&eacute; dans le traitement de la SLA, depuis sa premi&egrave;re description faite par le neurologue fran&ccedil;ais, Jean&#173;Martin&nbsp;Charcot.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
&quot;&nbsp;Rilutek change le visage de la SLA, car, pour la premi&egrave;re fois, nous avons un m&eacute;dicament efficace &agrave; offrir &agrave; nos patients&nbsp;&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Professeur Vincent&nbsp;Meininger (la Piti&eacute; Salp&ecirc;tri&egrave;re, Paris), l'un des principaux investigateurs ayant conduit les &eacute;tudes cliniques Rilutek. &quot;&nbsp;Pour ces patients qui ont une esp&eacute;rance de vie courte, un m&eacute;dicament capable d'accro&icirc;tre leur survie repr&eacute;sente une avanc&eacute;e th&eacute;rapeutique significative.&nbsp;&quot;
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
A l'issue de l'essai clinique le plus important jamais r&eacute;alis&eacute; dans la SLA, Rilutek a confirm&eacute; qu'il prolongeait la dur&eacute;e de vie des patients et/ou retardait le recours &agrave; la respiration assist&eacute;e. &quot;&nbsp;Apr&egrave;s un an de traitement, les patients ayant re&ccedil;u Rilutek &agrave; la dose de 100&nbsp;mg par jour ont une probabilit&eacute; de survie significativement sup&eacute;rieure &agrave; celle des patients ayant re&ccedil;u un placebo&nbsp;&quot;, ajoute le Professeur&nbsp;Meininger. &quot;&nbsp;Presque tous les patients atteints de cette maladie peuvent b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier de Rilutek et je crois qu'il est important d'y recourir d&egrave;s le d&eacute;but de la maladie.&nbsp;&quot;
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
Cependant, Rilutek n'a pas montr&eacute; d'effet b&eacute;n&eacute;fique au stade avanc&eacute; de la maladie.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
959&nbsp;patients ont particip&eacute; &agrave; cet essai de phase&nbsp;III, randomis&eacute;, en double aveugle versus placebo, dans 31&nbsp;centres en Europe et en Am&eacute;rique du Nord. La survie (sans trach&eacute;otomie ni ventilation assist&eacute;e) &eacute;tait le crit&egrave;re d'&eacute;valuation principal. Ces r&eacute;sultats publi&eacute;s dans le num&eacute;ro du 25 mai 1996 de
<I>
The Lancet
</I>
ont confirm&eacute; les conclusions d'un pr&eacute;c&eacute;dent essai clinique effectu&eacute; sur 155&nbsp;patients, dont les r&eacute;sultats ont &eacute;t&eacute; publi&eacute;s dans le num&eacute;ro du 4&nbsp;mars 1994 de
<I>
New England Journal of Medecine
</I>
.
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
Dans cet essai, aucune action th&eacute;rapeutique sur la force musculaire ou sur la fonction respiratoire n'a &eacute;t&eacute; mise en &eacute;vidence.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
D'autre part la tol&eacute;rance de Rilutek est satisfaisante. Les &eacute;v&eacute;nements ind&eacute;sirables les plus fr&eacute;quemment rencontr&eacute;s sont fatigue, naus&eacute;es, vertiges et &eacute;l&eacute;vation du taux des enzymes h&eacute;patiques.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
&quot;&nbsp;L'Alliance internationale des Associations contre la SLA accueille favorablement cet enregistrement de Rilutek par l'Union Europ&eacute;enne&nbsp;&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; Mavis&nbsp;Galienne, Pr&eacute;sidente de l'Alliance. &quot;&nbsp;En tant que premier m&eacute;dicament ayant d&eacute;montr&eacute; une efficacit&eacute; dans le traitement de cette maladie, il repr&eacute;sente un v&eacute;ritable espoir pour plus de 70&nbsp;000&nbsp;personnes dans le monde.&nbsp;&quot; L'Alliance repr&eacute;sente plus de 50&nbsp;associations nationales de soutien aux patients atteints de cette maladie, dans le monde.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
La SLA affecte les neurones moteurs du cerveau et de la moelle &eacute;pini&egrave;re. Les neurones sensitifs ne sont pas touch&eacute;s et les fonctions intellectuelles demeurent intactes. Les patients sont donc pleinement conscients de la progression inexorable de la maladie et de la d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration de leurs capacit&eacute;s fonctionnelles. En g&eacute;n&eacute;ral, la mort survient dans les trois &agrave; cinq ans qui suivent le diagnostic, souvent par d&eacute;tresse respiratoire.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
On estime que 70&nbsp;000&nbsp;personnes dans le monde sont atteintes de SLA et que l'&acirc;ge moyen d'apparition de la maladie est de 55&nbsp;ans. Les premiers signes sont des fasciculations, des faiblesses et crampes musculaires, des difficult&eacute;s de d&eacute;glutition/d'&eacute;locution et des alt&eacute;rations de la voix.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
Bien que la cause de la SLA reste &agrave; ce jour inconnue, des &eacute;tudes pr&eacute;-cliniques ont mis en &eacute;vidence plusieurs m&eacute;canismes qui pourraient &ecirc;tre responsables de la d&eacute;g&eacute;n&eacute;rescence du neurone moteur et du faisceau corticospinal qui surviennent au cours de la maladie. Il serait possible que des anomalies du m&eacute;tabolisme du glutamate, l'un des principaux neurotransmetteurs c&eacute;r&eacute;braux, soient impliqu&eacute;s dans la SLA. A des concentrations anormalement &eacute;lev&eacute;es, le glutamate peut d&eacute;t&eacute;riorer les neurones et ainsi contribuer au d&eacute;veloppement et &agrave; la progression de la maladie.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
Des &eacute;tudes pr&eacute;-cliniques montrent que Rilutek a des propri&eacute;t&eacute;s neuroprotectrices, en antagonisant &agrave; plusieurs niveaux les effets neurotoxiques du glutamate.
<BR>
</FONT>
<P>
<FONT FACE="palatino">
&quot;&nbsp;Rilutek est le premier m&eacute;dicament &agrave; &ecirc;tre efficace dans le traitement de la SLA. Il repr&eacute;sente une premi&egrave;re &eacute;tape dans le d&eacute;veloppement ult&eacute;rieur de strat&eacute;gies th&eacute;rapeutiques pour cette maladie d&eacute;vastatrice&nbsp;&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; le Dr&nbsp;Gary&nbsp;T.&nbsp;Shearman, vice-pr&eacute;sident du d&eacute;veloppement pharmaceutique de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc&nbsp;Rorer. &quot;&nbsp;Notre engagement envers la communaut&eacute; des malades de la SLA va au-del&agrave; du d&eacute;veloppement de Rilutek, &agrave; travers notre soutien permanent du premier et plus important programme d'acc&egrave;s anticip&eacute;. Ce programme, sponsoris&eacute; par Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc&nbsp;Rorer, a permis &agrave; plus de 6&nbsp;000&nbsp;patients, dont 3&nbsp;500 en Europe, de b&eacute;n&eacute;ficier de Rilutek gratuitement avant l'obtention de l'autorisation de mise sur le march&eacute;.&nbsp;&quot;

Rilutek a &eacute;t&eacute; d&eacute;couvert, d&eacute;velopp&eacute; et mis &agrave; disposition par Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer, entreprise pharmaceutique mondiale d&eacute;di&eacute;e &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration de la sant&eacute; humaine. En 1995, la soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffre d'affaires de 5, 316 milliards de dollars (pro forma) et a investi plus de 826 millions de dollars (pro forma) en recherche et d&eacute;veloppement.

(Hu&eacute;, le 11 juin 1996)
</I>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, l'UNESCO et le Minist&egrave;re de la Culture et de l'Information vietnamien ont annonc&eacute; au cours d'une conf&eacute;rence de presse &agrave; Hu&eacute;, au Vietnam, le d&eacute;marrage des travaux de restauration de la Cit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale de Hu&eacute;, conform&eacute;ment &agrave; l'accord de partenariat sign&eacute; en janvier 1995, au si&egrave;ge de l'UNESCO &agrave; Paris.
<BR>
<P>
La Cit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale de Hu&eacute; a &eacute;t&eacute; inscrite en 1993 sur la liste du patrimoine mondial &eacute;tablie par l'UNESCO. Jusqu'&agrave; pr&eacute;sent, les efforts du Centre de Conservation des Monuments de Hu&eacute; &eacute;taient rest&eacute;s vains face aux ravages caus&eacute;s par les termites, principal facteur de d&eacute;t&eacute;rioration de la Cit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale de Hu&eacute;.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc a mis au point diff&eacute;rentes formulations sp&eacute;cifiquement adapt&eacute;es d'un produit destin&eacute; &agrave; la protection du bois dans les pays &agrave; climat humide, tel le Vietnam, favorisant le d&eacute;veloppement des champignons et des termites. Ce produit, &agrave; base de Fipronil, le TERMIDOR&reg;25 EC est efficace &agrave; tr&egrave;s faible dose et extr&ecirc;mement s&eacute;lectif. Il sera utilis&eacute; pour prot&eacute;ger les bois neufs, arr&ecirc;ter la destruction des bois anciens et d&eacute;truire les termiti&egrave;res dans les sols.
<BR>
<P>
La restauration a d&eacute;marr&eacute; par le temple Hiem-Lam-Cac, pavillon de lecture &agrave; deux &eacute;tages, au coeur de la Cit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale. Elle se poursuivra par la r&eacute;habilitation du temple Hoa Kiem, dans le tombeau du roi Tu Duc, l'un des plus magnifiques tombeaux imp&eacute;riaux construit par l'empereur lui-m&ecirc;me.
<BR>
<P>
La restauration de la Cit&eacute; Imp&eacute;riale de Hu&eacute; est l'une des premi&egrave;res op&eacute;rations men&eacute;es par la Fondation Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc. Cr&eacute;&eacute;e en juin 1995, celle-ci, qui a pour vocation de regrouper et d&eacute;velopper les actions de m&eacute;c&eacute;nat de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, apporte chaque ann&eacute;e son soutien financier, scientifique et technique &agrave; un programme d'actions concernant notamment la protection du patrimoine culturel, artistique et naturel, la recherche et le partenariat scientifiques ou encore l'&eacute;ducation.
<BR>
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, septi&egrave;me groupe pharmaceutique et chimique mondial, est pr&eacute;sent dans 160 pays. Il est implant&eacute; au Vietnam depuis 1938 et poss&egrave;de aujourd'hui trois bureaux de repr&eacute;sentation &agrave; Ho Chi Minh Ville, Hanoi et Cantho. Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc est &eacute;galement partenaire de deux co-entreprises vietnamiennes : Vinaspecia (produits pharmaceutiques) et Thang Long Nylon (fibres et polym&egrave;res).

Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer et Novo Nordisk annoncent aujourd'hui qu'ils ont sign&eacute; un accord strat&eacute;gique &agrave; l'&eacute;chelle mondiale, le premier de ce genre, qui permettra de r&eacute;pondre aux besoins des femmes m&eacute;nopaus&eacute;es en traitements hormonaux de substitution (THS). Selon les termes de cet accord, la promotion des produits de THS des deux laboratoires sera assur&eacute;e par le r&eacute;seau de vente de chacun des laboratoires dans le monde entier, &agrave; l'exception du Japon.

&quot;Ensemble, nous allons accro&icirc;tre notre implantation g&eacute;ographique, atteindre largement le corps m&eacute;dical (m&eacute;decins sp&eacute;cialistes et g&eacute;n&eacute;ralistes) et enfin, cr&eacute;er un portefeuille de produits diversifi&eacute; comprenant des traitements administr&eacute;s par voie orale ou transdermique, de diff&eacute;rents dosages&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; Timothy Rothwell, Executive Vice-President et Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral des Op&eacute;rations Pharmaceutiques de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer. &quot;Le fait que cet accord soit conclu maintenant est important &eacute;galement, car la pr&eacute;valence mondiale de la m&eacute;nopause continue de cro&icirc;tre, et ce, principalement en raison du vieillissement de la population.&quot;

La m&eacute;nopause survient normalement chez la femme autour de 50&nbsp;ans lorsque s'abaisse le taux d'oestrog&egrave;nes dans le sang, et s'accompagne souvent de sympt&ocirc;mes d&eacute;sagr&eacute;ables, tels que bouff&eacute;es de chaleur, sudation nocturne et s&eacute;cheresse vaginale. Le THS a d&eacute;montr&eacute; son efficacit&eacute; dans la r&eacute;duction de ces sympt&ocirc;mes, ainsi que dans la r&eacute;duction du risque de maladies cardiovasculaires et d'ost&eacute;oporose.

&quot;&nbsp;1995 a marqu&eacute; le d&eacute;but d'un cycle de croissance acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute; pour Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer&nbsp;&quot;, a d&eacute;clar&eacute; Michel de Rosen s'adressant pour la premi&egrave;re fois &agrave; l'assembl&eacute;e g&eacute;n&eacute;rale des actionnaires en qualit&eacute; de Pr&eacute;sident Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral, aujourd'hui &agrave; Collegeville.

&quot;&nbsp;Depuis la cr&eacute;ation de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer en 1990, la progression du chiffre d'affaires a atteint 12% en moyenne, mais, plus important, nous avons d&eacute;velopp&eacute; les conditions n&eacute;cessaires &agrave; une croissance acc&eacute;l&eacute;r&eacute;e de nos b&eacute;n&eacute;fices&nbsp;&quot;. Affirmant sa confiance dans les perspectives de croissance de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer, le Conseil d'Administration a d&eacute;cid&eacute; d'augmenter le dividende de 7%, &agrave; 32 cents pour les actionnaires au 13 mai 1996.

<FONT FACE="palatino">
&quot;&nbsp;Les produits innovants &agrave; forte marge, ainsi qu'une am&eacute;lioration de la structure des co&ucirc;ts constituent des &eacute;l&eacute;ments d&eacute;terminants qui permettront une croissance future pour nos actionnaires&nbsp;&quot;, poursuit Michel de Rosen.

&quot;&nbsp;La plupart des entreprises performantes sont leaders dans des domaines th&eacute;rapeutiques s&eacute;lectionn&eacute;s&nbsp;&quot;, explique Michel de Rosen. &quot;&nbsp;Alors que nous avons d&eacute;j&agrave; d&eacute;velopp&eacute; une position de leader mondial dans les domaines des prot&eacute;ines plasmatiques, des maladies respiratoires et de la thrombose, nous avons pour objectif de renforcer notre pr&eacute;sence dans le domaine de l'oncologie, gr&acirc;ce au succ&egrave;s de nos produits tels que Taxotere&reg; et Campto&reg;, et dans le domaine des anti-infectieux avec Synercid&reg; par exemple.&nbsp;&quot;
<BR>

<FONT FACE="palatino">
Michel de Rosen ajoute : &quot;&nbsp;La r&eacute;duction de notre dette reste l'une des priorit&eacute;s pour 1996 et nous y parviendrons gr&acirc;ce &agrave; notre cash flow op&eacute;rationnel et au produit des cessions. Nous avons d&eacute;j&agrave; c&eacute;d&eacute; la branche Instruments Scientifiques. Le produit total des cessions devrait atteindre 750 millions de dollars d'ici la mi-1997.&nbsp;&quot;

<FONT FACE="palatino">
En conclusion, Michel de Rosen remarque : &quot;&nbsp;Les initiatives prises en 1995, et tout particuli&egrave;rement l'acquisition de Fisons et la cr&eacute;ation de Centeon dans le domaine des prot&eacute;ines plasmatiques, sont autant d'&eacute;tapes contribuant au succ&egrave;s de la mise en oeuvre de notre strat&eacute;gie. Alors que nos actionnaires ont, en 1995, r&eacute;alis&eacute; un gain de 46% sur leurs titres, nous pensons que le succ&egrave;s de la commercialisation de nos nouveaux produits va contribuer &agrave; renforcer le potentiel de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer&quot;.

(Paris, le 29 avril 1996)--- Comme le Groupe l'avait annonc&eacute; en janvier 1996, le r&eacute;sultat net du premier trimestre est en recul de 13,5 % par rapport &agrave; celui du premier trimestre 1995.
<P>
Cette baisse est due, pour l'essentiel, &agrave; l'augmentation des frais financiers et &agrave; l'amortissement du goodwill cons&eacute;cutifs &agrave; l'acquisition de Fisons fin octobre 1995 et non encore compens&eacute;s par les synergies li&eacute;es &agrave; cette op&eacute;ration. Celles-ci appara&icirc;tront progressivement au cours de l'exercice et auront un impact significatif sur les r&eacute;sultats du second semestre.
<P>
De ce fait, et contrairement &agrave; l'ann&eacute;e 1995 qui avait d&eacute;marr&eacute; par un excellent premier trimestre puis s'&eacute;tait d&eacute;grad&eacute;e par la suite, Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc pr&eacute;voit en 1996 une progression r&eacute;guli&egrave;re de ses r&eacute;sultats, qui b&eacute;n&eacute;ficieront en outre de l'am&eacute;lioration de l'exploitation de l'ensemble de toutes ses activit&eacute;s.
<P>
Au total, le Groupe confirme donc sa pr&eacute;vision de progression de r&eacute;sultats pour l'ann&eacute;e 1996.

Le chiffre d'affaires consolid&eacute;
</U>
</B>
du Groupe s'&eacute;l&egrave;ve &agrave; 21 129 millions de francs (-1,8 % &agrave; p&eacute;rim&egrave;tre comparable). La progression des ventes de la Sant&eacute; et de l'Agro se confirme, celles de la Chimie et surtout de Fibres et Polym&egrave;res souffrent de la conjoncture, en particulier au Br&eacute;sil dans le domaine du polyester.

</U>
</B>
, baissent de 3,5 % &agrave; structure comparable, du fait de la chute des r&eacute;sultats du Secteur Fibres et Polym&egrave;res.
<BR>
La progression de la Chimie et celle, moindre, de la Sant&eacute; et de l'Agro, ne suffisent pas &agrave; compenser cette baisse.

<P>
Collegeville, PA et Paris, France, le 24 avril 1996. Rh&ocirc;ne-PoulencRorer annonce, pour le premier trimestre 1996, un chiffre d'affairesde 1,3 milliard de dollars, en hausse de 8% par rapport au chiffred'affaires pro forma pour la m&ecirc;me p&eacute;riode de 1995.Hors effet des fluctuations de change, la croissance du chiffred'affaires ressort &agrave; 7%, gr&acirc;ce &agrave; une fortehausse des volumes.
<P>
Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice net progresse de 4% &agrave; 74 millionsde dollars, contre 71 millions de dollars pro forma pour la m&ecirc;mep&eacute;riode de 1995. Le b&eacute;n&eacute;fice par action atteint0,55 dollar, en hausse de 6% par rapport au chiffre pro formade 1995, 0,52 dollar par action. En excluant 0,10 dollar de plus-valuesde cessions d'actifs, nettes de l'impact de la r&eacute;visionde leur valeur comptable, inclus dans le r&eacute;sultat pro formade 1995,
<B>
la croissance du b&eacute;n&eacute;fice par actionressort &agrave; 31% au premier trimestre 1996.
</B>
<P>
Les comptes 1995 ont &eacute;t&eacute; retrait&eacute;s dans lastructure 1996 pour int&eacute;grer l'impact des acquisitionsde Fisons et d'Applied Immune Sciences et de la constitution dela soci&eacute;t&eacute; commune Centeon: en effet les activit&eacute;sd'Armour dans le domaine des prot&eacute;ines plasmatiques sontd&eacute;sormais int&eacute;gr&eacute;es dans la soci&eacute;t&eacute;Centeon. Ces ventes ne sont donc plus consolid&eacute;es, et laquote-part de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer dans le b&eacute;n&eacute;ficemis en &eacute;quivalence est comptabilis&eacute;e dans la ligne autres revenus/charges du compte de r&eacute;sultat.
<P>
La croissance du chiffre d'affaires au premier trimestre a b&eacute;n&eacute;fici&eacute;notamment de l'augmentation des ventes des produits cardiovasculaireset respiratoires. Clexane/Lovenox a enregistr&eacute; une bonneprogression aux Etats-Unis et en Europe.
<P>
Dans le domaine des produits respiratoires, la croissance a &eacute;t&eacute;tir&eacute;e par Azmacort et Nasacort. Bien que les ventes d'Intalet de Tilade soient en retrait par rapport &agrave; l'ann&eacute;epr&eacute;c&eacute;dente aux Etats-Unis, o&ugrave; Intal danssa pr&eacute;sentation n&eacute;buliseur affronte la concurrencedes g&eacute;n&eacute;riques, les ventes de ces deux produitset d'autres produits ex-Fisons ont progress&eacute; sur les autresmarch&eacute;s au cours du premier trimestre.
<P>
Enfin, les produits innovants lanc&eacute;s r&eacute;cemment,tels que Rilutek, Taxotere, Granocyte et Menorest, ont contribu&eacute;&agrave; l'augmentation des ventes, mais pas encore de mani&egrave;resignificative.
<P>
&quot;En 1995, nous avons r&eacute;alis&eacute; plusieurs transactionsstrat&eacute;giques destin&eacute;es &agrave; renforcer notreposition dans l'industrie pharmaceutique&quot;, d&eacute;clareMichel de Rosen, Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral. &quot; L'int&eacute;grationde Fisons se d&eacute;roule comme pr&eacute;vu, de m&ecirc;meque le programme de cessions de certaines de nos activit&eacute;snon strat&eacute;giques : nous avons ainsi vendu la DivisionInstruments Scientifiques au cours du premier trimestre. En 1996nous concentrons une part importante de nos efforts sur la r&eacute;ussitedu lancement de nos nouveaux produits. Tout ceci nous confortedans notre objectif d'acc&eacute;l&eacute;ration de la croissancede nos b&eacute;n&eacute;fices. &quot;
<P>
Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer est une entreprise pharmaceutique mondialed&eacute;di&eacute;e &agrave; l'am&eacute;lioration de la sant&eacute;humaine. La soci&eacute;t&eacute; a r&eacute;alis&eacute; un chiffred'affaires de 5,316 milliards de dollars en 1995 (pro forma) eta investi plus de 826 millions de dollars (pro forma) en rechercheet d&eacute;veloppement.

Ce changement est conforme au plan de succession pr&eacute;vu chez Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer. &quot;Depuis que Michel de Rosen a rejoint Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer en 1993, j'esp&eacute;rais lui transmettre ces responsabilit&eacute;s le moment venu.&quot;, d&eacute;clare M. Cawthorn. &quot;Il a d&eacute;montr&eacute; de fortes qualit&eacute;s de management et un sens aigu des affaires qui lui permettront de conduire Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer vers le 21&egrave;me si&egrave;cle. Je suis heureux que notre Conseil d'Administration ait reconnu ses qualit&eacute;s en lui confiant les responsabilit&eacute;s de Pr&eacute;sident Directeur G&eacute;n&eacute;ral de notre entreprise.&quot;

Commentant sa nouvelle nomination, M. de Rosen a d&eacute;clar&eacute; : &quot;Robert Cawthorn a jou&eacute; un r&ocirc;le capital dans le succ&egrave;s de Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer. Durant l'exercice de ses fonctions au sein de notre soci&eacute;t&eacute;, le chiffre d'affaires et les b&eacute;n&eacute;fices ont &eacute;t&eacute; plus que d&eacute;cupl&eacute;s et Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer est aujourd'hui une entreprise internationale, innovante et bas&eacute;e sur la R&amp;D. Chez Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc Rorer, nous sommes tous focalis&eacute;s sur le d&eacute;veloppement de notre entreprise, en construisant sur les fondations que Robert Cawthorn a solidement &eacute;tablies.&quot;
