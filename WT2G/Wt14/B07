						The frenetic pace of corporate mergers and acquisitions—the result of companies searching for new ways to grow in a slowing economy—has helped power the market to new highs. By mid-November, announced deals worldwide had already edged past 1995's record volume of $949 billion, according to Securities Data. Share prices for acquiring companies have soared, further fueling the frenzy.<p>
WINNER: Elizabeth Bramwell  <a name="FUND:BRGRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BRGRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bramwell Growth Fund</b></a>
Growth investor Bramwell was rewarded for her patience when J. C. Penney announced its $3.3 billion purchase of <a name="NYSE:ECK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16231"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eckerd</b></a>. The drug retailer has been her $135 million fund's largest holding for a year, and on November 4, her 225,000-share stake got a $1 million boost. "I'm happy when buying things at a discount to their growth rate really works," she says.<p>
WINNER: Henry Kravis  Kohlberg Kravis Roberts
In September, buyout king Kravis cut one of his greatest deals, agreeing to sell <a name="NYSE:DUR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Duracell</b></a> to <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a> for $7.3 billion. His firm, which bought the battery maker from Kraft for $350 million in 1988, had already sold part of its stake for more than $1 billion in previous public offerings. If the merger goes through, KKR's 6.8 percent piece of Gillette could be worth $2 billion.<p>
WINNER: Lawrence Lasser  Putnam Investments
Putnam CEO Lasser had to be smiling after <a name="NYSE:BTY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41763"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>British Telecom</b></a> announced its $21 billion acquisition of <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>. Last summer, his mutual-fund firm bought 14 million shares of the number-two U.S. long-distance company, making it the largest institutional investor. Putnam's stake jumped $113 million in value on November 1, when CNBC broke the merger story.<p>
WINNER: Roberto Mendoza  J. P. Morgan  
Vice chairman Mendoza helped his bank win the choice assignment of co-advising <a name="NYSE:NSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11084"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Norfolk Southern</b></a> in its hostile $10 billion bid for <a name="NYSE:CRR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10395"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Conrail</b></a>. Although his client may lose the deal to rival <a name="NYSE:CSX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10274"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CSX</b></a>, J. P. Morgan is assured of divvying up $22.8 million in fees with <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> and cementing its place among the elite of investment banks.
R. Michael Shanahan  Capital Research and Management   <p>
LOSER: R. Michael Shanahan  Capital Research and Management
This adviser to the American Funds Group, of which Shanahan is chairman, bought 1.7 million shares of <a name="NYSE:MRV"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10665"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Marvel</b></a> last spring when the troubled comic-book company was trading around $10 a share, says research group CDA/Spectrum. In November, Marvel fell to $2.75 after majority owner Ron Perelman offered to pay off bondholders with 410 million new shares.<p>
LOSER: Phillip Frost  Ivax
Investors were aghast when chairman Frost accepted a merger offer from drug wholesaler <a name="NYSE:BBC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11761"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bergen Brunswig</b></a> in November for $2 a share below <a name="AMEX:IVX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12043"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ivax</b></a>Ivax's then market price of $15.875. Both stocks dropped, with Ivax falling as low as $11. Frost, who couldn't comment on a deal in SEC registration, has lost more than $70 million on his 15 million shares.<p>

The number of banks offering Internet services will swell in 1997. A recent study conducted by Datapro Information Services Group found that, while only 7 percent of all banks currently offer Internet services, 36 percent have plans to offer them by the end of 1997. <p>
Is a financial adviser under obligation to disclose all investment opportunities to all clients? Not necessarily, according to a U.S. district court judge in Philadelphia, who dismissed a lawsuit against Glenmede Trust. A family had sued Glenmede, asserting that a trust and other family interests were worth $80 million less than they otherwise would have been had Glenmede included them in an investment offer made to other clients.<p>
The Securities and Exchange Commission is examining "soft dollar" practices between investment advisers and the brokerage houses with which they do business. Soft-dollar arrangements are a portion of the commission that investment advisers may receive from brokers to pay for research, goods, and services. Investors are only rarely aware of these arrangements. Though the arrangements are entirely legal, SEC chairman Arthur Levitt has spoken out against soft-dollar transactions that do not benefit shareholders and other customers. <p>
The regulatory arm of the National Association of Securities Dealers, NASD Regulation, has proposed limiting punitive damages in arbitration claims against brokers and their firms to $750,000 or twice compensatory damages, whichever is less, to pay for lost interest income or principal. The proposal must be reviewed by both the NASD board of governors and the Securities and Exchange Commission. A final decision is not expected until summer. <p>
British investment-management group Invesco and mutual-fund family AIM Management Group intend to merge in February 1997. While each company will continue to operate under its current name, the listed holding company will be called AMVESCO and will have approximately $150 billion in assets.<p>
Airlines, hoping to enhance the appeal of frequent-flier miles, have begun allowing customers to use accumulated miles as currency for bidding at special auctions. Offerings at these auctions include "fantasy" trips, such as a ride on a space-shuttle simulator, and admission to holiday festivities with the First Family. One United Airlines customer, for instance, used his frequent-flier miles to place the top bid for a walk-on role on the sitcom Seinfeld. <p>
Fifteen discount-brokerage firms have joined together to form a new trade group: the Discount Brokerage Association. The new trade group will focus on efforts to "promote public confidence in discount brokers and to educate consumers on how to use the services of discount firms." The use of discount brokers has increased from 28 percent ten years ago to 36 percent today, according to a survey by the American Association of Individual Investors.<p>
The Securities Industry Association reported that 76 percent of the 1,500 investors it polled felt that the industry does not do enough to educate the public about investing. The survey found that 19 percent of the respondents who have brokerage accounts have an "unfavorable" opinion of the industry because of such concerns as dishonesty, greed, and excessive compensation.<p>
Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig announced the adoption of a rule that would allow banks to offer financial products, such as securities and insurance, through subsidiaries rather than holding companies. The new rule, which will take effect on January 1, has already met with opposition from other financial-services companies and lawmakers.<p>

						The rising stock market is sowing the seeds of its own undoing<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
Even as the Dow Jones Industrial average bursts through the 6400 mark, the character of this market is shifting. "The stock market is behaving like it should if it is heading into a tougher year," observes Hugh Johnson, the chief investment officer at First Albany. "It is becoming more defensive."<p>
Tougher year? Defensive? Those words hardly seem to fit a market that recently has been taking the steps three at a time. Yet a closer look at how individual stock prices are being reordered with this rally suggests that the market may be sowing the seeds of its own undoing even as it gains 100 points a week.<p>
By way of example, let's examine the Dow's 51-point, or 0.8 percent, rise on November 19. The gain in the Dow was mirrored that day by the Nasdaq composite index, which increased a little more than eight points -- or 0.6 percent.<p>
At the same time, however, more stocks lost ground (2,075) on the Nasdaq than gained in price (1,894). And while 161 Nasdaq stocks hit new 12-month highs, 129 issues recorded lows. <p>
What's going on? In a healthy market, gains in one stock typically spread to similar issues. <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> goes up because investors who see growing demand for devices that store huge amounts of computer data buy shares. This enthusiasm spills over to shares of other data-storage companies, such as <a name="NYSE:EMC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10491"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>EMC</b></a>.<p>
But the current market seems driven, in part, by bad news. A Wall Street favorite, such as <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>, will report disappointing earnings. This, in turn, casts a cloud over not just other home-improvement stocks, such as <a name="NYSE:LOW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10920"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lowe</b></a>'s, but the entire retail sector. <p>
As investors sell retail stocks or other sagging issues, what do they do with their money? Put it into apparently rock-solid stocks like <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a>, which because of its huge backlog of orders seems certain not to disappoint, or <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, which still seems secure in its dominance of a growing industry. Therefore, Boeing, though it already trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 31, continues to climb. And because it is 1 of the 30 Dow Jones Industrial Average stocks, it takes the Dow up with it. Microsoft takes the Nasdaq index higher, too. The rich get richer, while the rest tread water or slip beneath the surface. The averages investors watch so carefully don't tell the full story. <p>
We are still in the very early stages of this trend. Stock-market analysts (and Worth in the "Market Radar" feature of "Need to Know") use a measure called the advance/decline line -- which charts the change in the ratio of advancing to declining issues over time -- to take the temperature of a market. Right now, the advance/decline line for the stocks on the New York Stock Exchange looks relatively healthy. On an up day, such as November 19, more issues gain (1,442) than lose (1,046), which seems to confirm that the large-company stocks that dominate the NYSE index and the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index still have legs.<p>
The advance/decline line for the small-company-dominated Nasdaq market has looked less healthy. The divergence between the two markets isn't reassuring -- a decline in the Nasdaq ratio often precedes a similar deterioration in the large-company market by six to eight months.<p>
In the shorter term, the market will favor stocks and sectors that fit the growing defensive mood. Utilities, consumer products such as drugs, and financials are likely to be the best performers, says First Albany's Johnson. <p>
Small-company stocks will not find much favor. "Investors know that the economy is slowing, and they're buying big names," says Claudia Mott, director of small-company research at Prudential Securities. When investors become nervous, they look for liquid big-company stocks, which are easy to unload when the going gets tough.<p>
But for long-term investors, this will create opportunities in good small-company stocks selling cheap. Invest 10 percent of a portfolio in small-company stocks picked for the long haul, and put them away, suggests Mott. All the data show that small-company stocks outperform their large-company brethren in the long term, she notes. "But none of those long-term results are based on calling the tops and bottoms of the market."<p>

						Money markets soak up the cash...<p>
Disappointing third-quarter corporate earnings dampen enthusiasm for equity funds in October. The bulk of new money flows into money-market funds as investors seek short-term safe havens until the dust settles from the elections in November.<p>
...and managers add to their reserves<p>
The Dow Jones Industrials' push into the uncharted territory beyond 6000 causes cash levels in fund portfolios to edge up in October, according to our index. As stocks get more expensive, some managers wait for a pullback before putting new money to work.<p>
OUR FAVORITE EQUITY FUNDS<p>
This table tracks the progress of 20 stock mutual funds selected by Worth's editors. Each fund listed below has been a consistent top performer, achieving superior returns with relatively low risk. The first five categories in the table are those used in the Worth asset-allocation model. By choosing one fund from each, investors can create an efficient and balanced long-term investment portfolio (see the November 1996 issue). The sixth category -- "Miscellaneous" -- lists three funds in market sectors with especially strong long-range prospects.<p>

						The bond market has given investors an early Christmas present. The 30-year Treasury bond appreciated by 2.7 percent in the first three weeks of November, as the yield fell below 6.5 percent. With continued tame inflation, that yield could fall to 6 percent by early 1997. But investors shouldn't forget about the risks of bonds with long maturities. Grant's Interest Rate Observer notes that corporations are selling 100-year bonds again. That should have investors concerned because previous instances in which Wall Street sold these ultra-long bonds have marked temporary lows in interest rates. The buys below represent our best picks for (1) the investor who needs cash, (2) the investor who wants near-term yield, and (3) the investor who seeks long-term returns -- without excessive risk. <p>
As Safe and Liquid as Cash 
Our picks with an emphasis on safety and yield<p>
We had to shop hard to get any extra yield in our picks for the investor who needs cash soon. While long-term interest rates have fallen over three-quarters of 1 percent since mid-July, short-term rates have barely budged. Yet it still pays to compare returns: The highest-yielding taxable money funds (typically those that waive all or a portion of their fees) offer rates almost one percentage point higher than the 4.86 percent average. Our choices are the highest-yielding instruments that lock up money for three months, tops. Bank money-market accounts and CDs are federally insured, and in 20 years, only one non-bank money-market fund has lost principal.

To Save for a Goal Two to Three Years Away<br>
<br>
Our picks with an emphasis on safety and yield<br>
<br>
This category remains the place to be for investors who don't want to try to predict the direction of interest rates. Investors in bonds that mature in one to three years have earned a total return of 4.2 percent for 1996 (through mid-November). That's far better than the almost 2 percent loss suffered by holders of long-term bonds. Our list is for investors who want high returns but who need protection from losses, since they anticipate needing their money in two to three years for tuition, a down payment, or the like. It combines safety (no loss of more than 3 percent over any three-month period since 1990), 12-month yield, and three-year total return. <p>

Investing for a Goal at Least Five Years Away<br>
<br>
Our picks with an emphasis on total return<br>
<br>
Junk-bond funds continue to dominate our taxable picks for the investor willing to trade some risk for higher total returns. Through mid-November the group showed an average total return of 10.8 percent. On the tax-free front, long-term municipal funds have finally started to show some life. Their average yield of 4.8 percent is equal to a taxable yield of 7.95 percent for an investor in the 39.6 percent federal tax bracket. In the picks at right -- suitable for a long-term investor able to stomach sizable dips -- we equally emphasize 12-month yield, relative safety (the smallest three-month loss since 1990), and total return over a five-year period.

						10 to Avoid<p>
Cedd Moses of Los Angeles–based Portfolio Advisory Services is an aggressive trader of stocks who uses both fundamental data and technical analysis. His methods have earned a 14.8 percent annualized return at the Calvert Strategic Growth Fund since its May 1994 inception, but they have really shone in his Aggressive Enhancement Strategy hedge-fund portfolios, which have much more freedom to short potential losers than do mutual funds. Those portfolios -- now $40 million -- are up an average of 29 percent annually since March 1990. Moses scours 9,000 issues a week in search of those likely to fall over the next six months. His favorite signals of financial stress include big jumps in inventories or accounts receivable and "lawyer's language" in quarterly reports that is aimed at protecting management from lawsuits if earnings disappoint. Moses sees danger ahead for Lone Star Steakhouse & Saloon, where restaurants older than one year show flat sales. Insider selling at Sun Microsystems confirms his belief that the company is vulnerable to Microsoft's Windows NT and Intel's Pentium Pro chips, which help cheaper PCs perform like Sun's workstations. At McDonald's, same-store sales abroad are falling -- a bad omen, since the company is relying on expansion abroad to make up for flagging sales at home. <p>

10 to Consider<p>
Richard Weiss co-manages with Marina Carlson the $1.7 billion Strong Opportunity Fund, which received a top $$$$$ rating in Worth's November fund rankings. The duo looks for misunderstood companies selling at big discounts to their private market value, paying special attention to hidden assets in a company's business mix. Though the two follow a value approach in a growth-driven market and hedge their bets with a heavy cash stake, their fund was up 27 percent in 1995 and 15.7 percent through mid-November 1996. Weiss continues to look for neglected stocks with strong fundamental value that could appreciate in the next 12 to 18 months. Comcast, one stock he likes in the depressed cable industry, plans to roll out digital technology and more channels in 1997, while its stakes in Sprint PCS wireless services and QVC home shopping make the stock "even cheaper than it looks." Newly public Pfeiffer Vacuum is the leader in the industrial-vacuum technology used in semiconductor and electronic-component manufacturing and has a healthy balance sheet. Chip maker Cypress Semiconductor has worked through its inventory glut and is now shifting its product mix toward higher-profit-margin programmable chips; although Weiss doesn't look for a strong first half, he expects 1997 earnings to reach one dollar a share.<p>

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which he considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after September 20, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these managers are meant to illustrate a range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy stock, Worth recommends they conduct their own due diligence.<p>
**Preston Athey--T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value**<p>
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.
<a name="NYSE:CRC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15596"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chromcraft Revington</b></a> (NYSE: CRC) Up to $27
Chromcraft Revington (Delphi, Indiana) manufactures furniture for commercial and residential use under the brand names Chromcraft and Peters-Revington. In an industry characterized by wildly cyclical earnings and subpar return on assets, Chromcraft Revington stands out. The company has one of the highest returns on equity (19 percent) in the furniture-manufacturing group and is debt free. Despite consistent earnings growth for the past six years, the stock sells for only 11 times my 1996 earnings estimates of $2.25 a share. With its shareholder-oriented management team, Chromcraft Revington should be a superior long-term investment. <p>
**James P. Craig -- Janus Fund**<p>
Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.
<a name="NYSE:CYT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41906"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cytec Industries</b></a> (NYSE: CYT) Up to $36
Spun out of American Cyanamid at the end of 1993, Cytec (West Paterson, New Jersey) manufactures specialty chemicals and materials used in the paper, mining, water-treatment, and aerospace industries, among others. The company has made serious efforts to trim down its operations -- it has disposed of some business lines, for example. With the proceeds from these sales and strong cash flows, Cytec has bought back a significant amount of its own stock: 1.7 million shares, or 10 percent of all the shares in existence. I'm looking for the company to earn $1.95 a share in 1996 and $2.40 a share in 1997. My 12-month target for the stock is $45.<p>
**Shelby M.C. Davis--New York Venture Fund**<p>
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.
<a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eastman Kodak</b></a> (NYSE: EK) Up to $75
Kodak (Rochester, New York) is a world-class franchise that is rapidly turning around from a down decade. Under CEO and chairman George Fisher, management has successfully reduced debt while buying back the company's stock. Fisher wisely sold Kodak's chemical and drug divisions and a large portion of its copier business. With the release of its new photo system, Advantix, and with photography booming in emerging nations, Kodak should see a boost in sales as we approach the holiday season. Kodak's technology and strong balance sheet should generate earnings of more than $5 a share in 1997. Buy at up to $75 with a 24-month target of $90.<p>
**Daniel B. Leonard--Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology**<p>
Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.
<a name="NASD:BXMNF"></a><b>Bre-X Minerals</b> (NASD: BXMNF) Up to $22.50
Investments in Bre-X Minerals (Alberta, Canada) may be as good as gold, literally. This 350-employee company, recently listed on the Nasdaq, explores and develops gold mines in Indonesia. Not long ago, Bre-X discovered a huge gold property that will likely become the largest gold mine in the world. By year's end, the company should be able to confirm that this mine has reserves of 50 million to 60 million ounces of gold. It takes a few years to completely open up a mine, but hopes are that even more gold -- perhaps as much as another 50 million ounces -- will be discovered in the process. With virtually no competition in the region, Bre-X is a pure asset play. <p>
**William J. Nasgovitz--Heartland Value Fund**<p>
Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be undervalued.
<a name="NASD:GIBG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13571"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gibson Greetings</b></a> (NASD: GIBG) Up to $14
Gibson Greetings (Cincinnati) is the third-largest producer of greeting cards, behind Hallmark and American Greetings. In addition, Gibson owns the Paper Factory, a chain of party-goods stores operating across the U.S. Last year, the stock hit a low of $8 a share, primarily because of mismanagement. Under new CEO Frank O'Connell, however, I believe things should start to look up. O'Con-nell is a successful turnaround artist who brought SkyBox back from the depths and sold it for a profit. Trading currently at a dollar less than its book value of $14 a share, Gibson is a cheap buy with a potential for tremendous growth. I believe the stock could go as high as $20.<p>
**Eric E. Rayback--Lindner Dividend Fund**<p>
Seeks current income first, capital appreciation second.
<a name="NYSE:HDL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10700"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Handleman</b></a> (NYSE: HDL) Up to $7.50
Handleman (Troy, Michigan) is a music, software, book, and video distributor that is coming off some very tough times. Kmart, one of its largest customers, came close to filing for bankruptcy. And Handleman was pulled out of the S&P 500. At the end of fiscal year 1996, in April, the company's earnings, including restructuring charges, came to negative 67 cents per share. Come fiscal year 1997, however, the company will be profitable again. It should get a boost when the digital video disc makes it to the market in the next few years, just as the company profited when music went from eight-track to cassette and from cassette to CD. My target price for the stock is $12. <p>
**Ralph Wanger and Chuck McQuaid--Acorn Fund**<p>
Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.
<a name="NYSE:WAK.B"></a><b>Wackenhut Class-B Shares</b> (NYSE: WAK.B) Up to $16
Wackenhut (Palm Beach Gardens, Florida) provides trained security guards to protect businesses and government facilities. But these class-B shares come with an extra pop because Wackenhut owns 55 percent of Wackenhut Corrections, the second-largest private prison-management company in the world. Privately managed prison cells currently hold 4 percent of all U.S. prisoners; private corrections companies operate 10 percent to 20 percent more cheaply than bureaucratic government correctional agencies. With the industry set to grow at least 20 percent a year well into the next decade, this is an opportunity to buy into two strong sectors on the cheap.<p>
**Donald A. Yacktman--Yacktman Fund**<p>
Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion.
<a name="NYSE:FNQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FRANKLIN QUEST</b></a> (NYSE: FNQ) Up to $20
Franklin Quest (Salt Lake City) provides time-management products and seminars for corporations, government agencies, and the general public. The company markets its services primarily by selling its trademark product, the Franklin Day Planner. Franklin suffered a relatively flat 1995 because of heavy write-offs. However, management has made some potentially profitable purchases lately, including competitor Productivity Plus. Since I recommended Franklin Quest in May, the stock has come down from $22 to $17. So much the better. With a clean balance sheet and earnings of more than $2 a share projected for 1997, it’s an attractive buy.<p>

Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.
<a name="NASD:FTSP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15311"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First Team Sports</b></a> (NASD: FTSP) Up to $10.40
First Team Sports (Anoka, Minnesota) makes and distributes in-line roller skates, street-hockey equipment, ice skates, and skating accessories. The company watched its share price skid more than 20 percent in August after it forecast disappointing earnings in the second quarter. This was because of the general retail slowdown and First Team's excess inventories. Nonetheless, in-line skating remains one of the fastest-growing participation sports, and First Team is expanding worldwide -- it now sells products in over 50 countries. Third-quarter bookings have improved. With a price-to-earnings ratio of seven, we think First Team is an inexpensive buy.<p>

Amylin Pharmaceuticals (San Diego) develops treatments for diabetes and other metabolic disorders. The company is in two phase-three trials for its drug Pramlintide, a synthetic analog of a hormone that works in conjunction with insulin to manage blood-glucose levels. An interim look at the trial data in August was positive and triggered a $22 million payment to Amylin by the company's partner, Johnson & Johnson. Pramlintide is a potential blockbuster; it should help cut health-care costs by reducing the many complications associated with diabetes, such as kidney disease, blindness, and leg amputation. My 18-month target for the stock is $20.<p>
**Michael Murphy--California Technology Stock Letter**<p>
Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.
<a name="NASD:AMAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12647"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Applied Materials</b></a> (NASD: AMAT) Up to $30
Applied Materials (Santa Clara, California) is the world's largest manufacturer of chip-fabrication systems used in the semiconductor industry. The stock was up around $60 in August 1995 before it started to fall, primarily because of "push-outs" -- customers placing orders but putting off deliveries while they waited to see if the PC business would pick up. An increase in PC demand, however, may turn these push-outs into "pull-ins" by next March. R&D at Applied Materials is currently 11 percent of sales, and sales should grow around 40 percent a year. This is a good, well-financed core holding. My 12-month target for the stock is $55.<p>
**Louis Navellier--MPT Review**<p>

DSP Communications (Cupertino, California) designs software and integrated-chip sets for mobile cellular phones and voice-recognition applications. DSP stands to benefit greatly from an increased demand for mobile cellular service in emerging countries, which generally don't have the wiring and hardware in place for conventional communications systems. In addition, DSP's products are highly adaptable: They work in a variety of formats and are designed to minimize power consumption. The stock is currently trading in the low $50s. I'm projecting earnings of $1 a share this year and $1.31 a share in 1997. My 12-month target for the stock is $75.<p>

The Internal Revenue Service experienced the worst year-to-year decline in "customer satisfaction" among all the companies and institutions measured in a recent survey conducted by the National Quality Research Center at the University of Michigan Business School. <p>
**SEC investigates mutual-fund companies**<p>
The Securities and Exchange Commission has begun looking into practices at various mutual-fund companies to determine if there is an attempt to boost the performance of individual funds by giving them a disproportionate number of shares of hot initial-public-stock offerings, according to The Wall Street Journal. Although no specific rule prohibits a company from doing this, the SEC said it could bring an enforcement action if it found that this practice led to unfair or unequal treatment of investors.<p>
**New SEC regulations on Nasdaq trading**<p>
The SEC has also approved new rules governing trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The measures, which follow the agency’s landmark disciplinary case against Nasdaq dealers, are intended to narrow the spreads on trades by individual investors. Among other things, the rules require dealers to notify investors of the best available price at which they will execute a trade and to display to the market all investor limit orders of at least 100 shares. A limit order is a request that a stock be traded at a specific price. <p>
**Clinton signs bill to repeal excise tax**<p>
President Clinton has signed a bill that temporarily repeals (until the year 2000) the 15 percent excise tax on annual distributions above $155,000 from pensions, 401(k)s, and other retirement programs. Individuals who take advantage of the new law, however, may find themselves giving up future tax-deferred growth. Consult a financial adviser or tax planner first.<p>
**Tudor Investment settles charges of violating trading rules**<p>
Tudor Investment, the company run by commodities trader Paul Tudor Jones, has agreed to pay $800,000 in fines to settle charges that it violated trading rules while implementing a complicated trading strategy that caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to plunge 16.45 points in a four-minute span on March 16, 1994. The firm didn’t admit or deny wrongdoing in settling the civil case, which was brought by the SEC.<p>
**Congress passes health-insurance proposal**<p>
Congress has passed a proposal that requires insurance companies, HMOs, and employers to offer parity, in both lifetime and annual limits, for the treatment of health and mental illness. The bill also requires insurers to pay for two-day hospital stays for women who have just given birth. (Currently, some insurers cover only a single day.) Supporters of both issues see the move as a positive step toward improving the current health-care system; opponents object to the government’s intervention into areas where it lacks expertise. <p>
**Duracell profits frozen by the SEC**<p>
The SEC has filed civil complaints in federal court against "certain purchasers" of <a name="NYSE:DUR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Duracell International</b></a> options contracts and has frozen profits of $950,000 on the trades -- made just prior to a public announcement that Duracell would be purchased by <a name="NYSE:G"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10655"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gillette</b></a>Gillette. The SEC also asked the court to force the parties making the trades to identify themselves. The trades were carried out by two overseas institutions: a Swiss bank and a Bahamian holding company.<p>

						Stop worrying about interest rates and start fretting about growth.<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
This market is obsessively focused on the short term: How much will the Federal Reserve raise interest rates? Will corporate profits tumble? Will <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> beat earnings forecasts? One day the market falls 10 points; the next day -- with no new information -- it climbs 21. Do these gyrations matter?<p>
Well, yes. For the long-term investor who can avoid getting caught up in the daily soap opera, today's market shows how a growth crisis could unfold in 1997.<p>
**For the short-term, the outlook is good for the economy.**<p>
In the short term, the September market rally is likely to roll on into November and perhaps a month or two longer -- basically because the monsters the market fears are toothless. Federal Reserve rate hikes? The market has already discounted a 50-basis-point interest-rate increase; anything less than 50 points by year-end is therefore good news.<p>
Terrible earnings? The market got most of the ugly surprises out of its system in July. Current earnings bellwethers Microsoft and <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> -- which led the market upward in September -- are unlikely to disappoint when they report in October. Also, executives at many companies have aggressively talked Wall Street analysts into lowering expectations for the quarter that ended on September 30. With expectations so low, this market could move up on lackluster earnings reports.<p>
**Long-term indicators play a different tune.**<p>
In a longer time frame, however, the issues that dominate today's market play out very differently. A 50-basis-point interest-rate increase by the end of 1996 would demonstrate the Fed's determination to fight inflation, but its size would raise fears of an economic slowdown. Anything smaller would tell investors the Fed was too worried about growth. Either course will change the focus of investors' concern. For 1997, the question will be: Where is growth going to come from?<p>
Investors asking that question at year-end could have lots of reason to worry. Preliminary reports showed August retail sales growing at a weak 0.2 percent, continuing a pattern that began in June. Weak Christmas retail sales would lend credibility to fears that consumers are tapped out.<p>
Softness in the housing sector -- a key indicator of economic activity -- would add to worries about slow growth. The number of new building permits fell nearly 2 percent in June, July, and August. If the decline continues, it could translate into a drop in construction.<p>
**While conditions may not be bad enough for a recession, there are other worries.**<p>
All these changes wouldn't add up to a shrinking economy -- a recession -- but they would be enough to get Wall Street's attention. Markets rest on fundamentals and emotion. In 1996, the market has climbed to levels far higher than the fundamentals alone justify. A perceived growth crisis could be enough to damage the emotional pillar that supports the market at this level.<p>
For example, against this background, investors would feel differently about corporate earnings. They would focus on the growing leadership vacuum that clearly emerged in September 1996. Instead of gleefully noting Intel's positive announcement about future earnings, for instance, investors would remember that <a name="NYSE:CCE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10360"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a> warned analysts that sales growth would probably be one percentage point lower than expected.<p>
**The market will continue its series of wild rides.**<p>
As 1997 dawns, investors won't know with any certainty what's going to happen to growth. But there will be just enough worry to send the market on the kinds of wild rides that have characterized 1996. Instead of bobbing and weaving in response to the latest reading of the tea leaves on Fed policy, however, the market will swing from mania to depression with each economic indicator.<p>
Of course, any highflier that falters will be sent to the woodshed in 1997. But investors in the so-called quality stocks may be shocked to find out that they are just as vulnerable.<p>
Historically, investors worried about the economy seek out never-fail companies -- those with predictable, sustainable earnings. Which drives up the price of those stocks until they trade at valuations usually attached to the riskiest growth stocks. Investors are now doing exactly this to Intel. At nearly $100 a share, the stock is trading at about 25 times 1995 earnings, a mite heady for a stock that's traded at 10 to 15 times earnings the past nine years. On September 19, a prominent analyst raised his earnings estimate from $4.55 a share to $5. Guess what happens if Intel misses by ten cents?<p>
Styles of stocks rotate in and out of fashion. At the top of a style's popularity, it sells for inflated prices. Right now, the guaranteed earners (another misnomer) are selling for a premium. Expect this to continue as investors pay more and more for the best growth stocks even as that category claims fewer and fewer members.<p>
**To succeed, look to out-of-favor sectors and good stocks at bargain prices.**<p>
It's foolish for a long-term investor to chase any style or individual stock at the peak of its popularity. Instead, wait for the market to punish a stock you've always wanted to own for an insignificant transgression. Study out-of-favor sectors. Small-cap stocks are always oversold in this kind of environment by investors worried about liquidity. Long-term investors can pick up small companies with big futures at reasonable prices. Look for industry leaders -- such as steelmaker <a name="NYSE:NUE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11098"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nucor</b></a> or nickel producer <a name="NYSE:N"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41792"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Inco</b></a> -- that are well positioned to pick up market share in a troubled industry.<p>
And, just in case the economy does go sour in 1997, pay as much attention to the financial soundness of a company as to its earnings. Make sure any company you buy has the financial strength to weather a recession -- or better yet to come out stronger than it went in.<p>

						By Todd G. Buccholz<p>
Because of the size of the U.S. economy, most of us tend not to get too worked up about the dollar. Sure, when traveling abroad we might bellyache about $20 cantaloupes in Tokyo, but for the most part Americans can pass through life without registering the dollar's value against other currencies. Not so for the folks in other countries. In Tokyo, for example, bank signs hanging over the streets display the dollar-yen exchange rate with the time and temperature; in the U.S., exchange rates are on tiny tote boards inside a bank's lobby -- if the bank even bothers to post them.<p>
**What does a strong currency mean for an economy?**<p>
Whether we pay attention or not, however, the exchange rate matters. But does that mean it's good to have a strong currency? Depends on who's asking. Exporters like a cheaper currency. When the U.S. dollar soared against other currencies in the early 1980s, exporters' manufactured goods were priced too high for the world's markets; the U.S. lost market share, and the Midwest started to rust. When the yen rose against the dollar from 1993 to the spring of 1995, you could hear Japanese exporters scream in pain as Toyotas and Nissans became more expensive than their American counterparts. To combat the squeeze, Japanese exporters moved factories to cheaper production spots in Asia. Commentators began referring to Japan's hollowed-out "doughnut economy."<p>
So who benefits from a strong currency? Consumers often do because imported products are cheaper; this, in turn, forces domestic companies to hold down prices. Nervous businesspeople call the phenomenon "price destruction." Importers benefit when the products or materials they purchase fall in price. Tourists obviously enjoy a strong currency.<p>
**A rising franc has squeezed the Swiss economy in the last few years.**<p>
Now that the dollar and the yen have settled into a fairly stable trading range, look to Switzerland for an overvalued currency. The Swiss franc has risen over 17 percent against the U.S. dollar since late 1993. Admittedly, 17 percent doesn't sound like much, but consider the recessionary climate in which Switzerland has stagnated during this period -- while the U.S. economy has been fairly strong. Also, the Swiss inflation rate has hovered between 0.8 and 1.8 percent since 1994, far below the U.S. rate of roughly 2.9 percent, making the Swiss franc even more expensive in real terms. According to the International Monetary Fund, the currency has appreciated over 50 percent since 1981. Ouch. The Swiss are feeling the pinch everywhere from the ski-lift lines, where high prices scare off foreign tourists, to the chocolate factories. In imitation of the Japanese doughnut, Switzerland is hollowing out its chocolate base, building factories in Greece and Spain to take advantage of cheap currencies, cheap labor, and generous European Union trade laws (Switzerland, where neutrality is practically a religion, does not belong to the EU).<p>
The Swiss franc is overvalued because many European investors are worried about the forthcoming European Monetary Union, when Germans will exchange their cherished D-marks for Euros. Because the Swiss aren't participating, many Europeans have switched their savings into Swiss francs as a safe haven. An aggravating factor has been the Swiss insistence on keeping monetary policy tight, even in recession. Now the Swiss have few alternatives but to cut interest rates again and talk down their currency. Doing nothing means fewer tourists and less chocolate. Hardly a sweet forecast.<p>

						96/11-Fixed Income<p>
By Chip Norton<p>
In September, the fixed-income markets fought a tug-of-war that sent rates higher and then lower as bond investors reacted to on-again, off-again reports of economic strength. At one point in early September, investors expecting an interest-rate hike at the September 24 meeting of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee sent the yield on the long Treasury bond soaring close to 7.2 percent. Then reports of subdued economic activity in mid-month left investors convinced that the Fed would postpone increasing rates after all. Rates fell back below 7 percent.<p>
A cynical assessment of the political realities supported those optimists who believed the Fed wouldn't hike rates in September. September's meeting was the last committee meeting until after the November 5 election. The betting was that Alan Greenspan was unlikely to turn on President Clinton by hiking rates in the final weeks of the campaign. Cynics, of course, have been wrong.
All of this volatility has investors questioning whether this is the right time to dive back into the bond market. Recent data from the Investment Company Institute, the mutual-fund industry's trade group, show that money actually flowed out of bond funds over the summer.<p>

						Paul Wick considers himself a patient investor. In his seven years running Seligman Communications and Information Fund, he has pursued a strategy of "growth at a reasonable price, with some momentum and value investing mixed in." In the long term, that recipe has worked: The fund's five-year 27 percent annualized return is a full three percentage points higher than the return for Morningstar's universe of specialty technology funds for the same period. This year, however, the fund was down 4 percent as of September 13, while Morningstar's tech funds were up an average of 9.1 percent. "Frankly, we've been hurt because the market has been so momentum oriented," says Wick, who typically avoids highfliers with little or no revenue. Instead, he prefers underappreciated companies like Lexmark International, IBM's former printer operation, whose earnings should grow as its cartridge business expands. Sales at Compaq Computer should take off, too, he says, as businesses upgrade to Windows NT. Not afraid to bottom-fish, Wick sees some gems in the battered semiconductor industry among specialty-chip makers ESS Technology and Xilinx. He also likes the huge cash flow generated by hard-drive maker Seagate Technology.<p>

**10 Stocks to Avoid**<br><p>
Howard Schilit, adjunct professor of accounting at American University, pores over financial reports and SEC corporate filings to spot companies he believes may be headed for trouble. The results end up in CFRA's Monthly Research Compendium, a research service for over 100 institutional subscribers put out by the Center for Financial Research and Analysis, based in Rockville, Maryland. Schilit's work focuses on uncovering inflated revenues involving questionable sales, accounts receivable, or other forms of aggressive accounting in company financial reports. His picks for Worth in October 1995 have fallen off 10.4 percent, while the stocks targeted by his service over the past three years have plunged an average of 30 percent. Medic Computer Systems currently worries Schilit: The company recently benefited from a sale to a related party, yet no cash actually changed hands. The warning signs at Genesis Health Ventures, an operator of care centers for the elderly, include a recent sale and purchase of health-care facilities that inflated the company's revenues and profit margins. At Orthodontic Centers of America, a specialty group medical practice, a negative cash flow does not jibe with reported revenue and earnings.<p>

In the same issue, the "<a HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9511N02.html">10 Stocks to Avoid</A> " selected by Edwin Vroom, founder of New York–based Roanoke Asset Management, underperformed the market, gaining 1.6 percent in the period.

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which he considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after August 22, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends they conduct their own due diligence.<p>
PRESTON ATHEY
<a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value</b></a>
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.
<a name="NASD:SRCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14679"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sealright</b></a> (NASDAQ: SRCO) Up to $15
Sealright (DeSoto, Kansas) makes packaging for food products and is the leading supplier of frozen-dessert packaging in the U.S. A growth company through the 1980s, Sealright saw its margins fall in 1995 because of competition and overexpansion. CEO Charles F. Marcy, who came on board in 1995, has reduced overhead, consolidated manufacturing, and revived R&D. New applications for McDonald's and growing success overseas should provide a kicker to Sealright's domestic turn-around. Despite an earnings estimate of just 21 cents a share in 1996, the stock is supported by a 4.2 percent yield. The company could easily earn $1.50 a share by 1998.<p>
JAMES P. CRAIG
Janus Fund
Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.
<a name="NYSE:BCS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41754"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Barclays</b></a> (NYSE: BCS) Up to $62
London-based Barclays is one of the largest financial-services companies in the U.K. While Barclays has been burdened in the past by losses from bad loans, it is taking strides to increase shareholder value: Management just bought back 3.5 percent of the company's stock and is dedicated to controlling costs. In addition, Barclays is the largest issuer of credit cards in the U.K., where the card business is still in its infancy. Last year, Barclays acquired Wells Fargo Nikko Investment Advisors in an effort to expand into asset management. Barclays should earn $6.90 a share in 1996 and $7.50 a share in 1997, and in six months the stock could trade at ten times the 1997 estimate. <p>
SHELBY M.C. DAVIS
New York Venture Fund
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.
<a name="NYSE:DWD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15970"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dean Witter, Discover</b></a> (NYSE: DWD) Up to $55
Dean Witter, Discover (New York) is an emerging-growth story. The company operates in two primary businesses: credit cards and securities. The two segments have different customer bases, but they're complementary: One offers credit, the other gathers assets. With 38 million accounts and 46 million customers, the credit-card division is the largest issuer of general-purpose credit cards in the U.S. (it issues Discover, Private Issue, and Bravo). The stock has been under pressure because of rising card delinquencies, but the company should still turn in record earnings of $5.20 a share in 1996 and at least $6.00 a share in 1997. The target price for the stock is $70.<p>
DANIEL B. LEONARD
Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology
Seeks growth in technology and related fields.
<a name="AMEX:KEA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13890"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Keane</b></a> (AMEX: KEA) Up to $45
Keane (Boston) designs custom computer software to help make existing systems at corporations and health-care facilities more cost efficient. On the health-care side, the company provides services for more than 400 hospitals and 600 long-term-care facilities. On the corporate side (which accounted for 93 percent of 1995 revenues), Keane works with such big names as <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDonald's</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:PG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11211"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Procter & Gamble</b></a>. Keane is growing rapidly and will soon open a development center in Nova Scotia. Earnings have grown steadily. I believe the company could earn $1.55 a share in 1996 and $1.95 in 1997. This stock, which has been trading in the high 30s, could go to $60 in 12 months. <p>
WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ
<a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value Fund</b></a>
Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be undervalued.
<a name="NASD:GISH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13575"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gish Biomedical</b></a> (NASDAQ: GISH) Up to $7.50
Gish Biomedical (Irvine, California) manufactures fluid-delivery and blood-management systems used during surgical procedures. Currently, Gish produces all the elements for these systems except the oxygenator. On January 1, 1997, however, Gish will introduce its own, better oxygenator. With this alone, Gish could earn $10 million dollars in sales and improve its margins greatly. Jack Brown, president and CEO at Gish, is a great sales-man and owns 14 percent of the company. The company has no long-term debt, trades at a reasonable ten times 1996 earnings, and is priced around its book value of $6 a share. I'd call that a relatively cheap buy.  <p>
Eric E. Rayback
Lindner Dividend Fund
Seeks current income first, capital appreciation second.
8El Paso Electric (AMEX: EE) Up to $8
Since emerging from bankruptcy earlier this year, El Paso Electric (El Paso, Texas) has significantly improved its operational and financial performances. Under new CEO and president James Haines, the utility has strengthened its management team and cleaned up its balance sheet by buying back high-coupon bonds. With the company looking to renew its contract to sell power to Mexico and with a ten-year rate freeze in Texas, El Paso has a tre-mendous advantage over current and future competition. The company is a potential buyout or merger candidate sometime in the future at a substantial premium to its current price. The target price is $15. <p>
RALPH WAGNER & CHUCK McQUAID
<a name="FUND:AUSAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AUSAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a>
Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.
<a name="NASD:ABII"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15513"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Business Info. </b></a>(NASDAQ: ABII) Up to $16
American Business Information Inc. (Omaha) compiles and sells data on 11 million businesses in the U.S. and Canada. More than 100,000 customers use the company's data (sold increasingly on CD-ROM) to create mailing labels, generate sales leads, and develop direct-marketing strategies. ABII has expanded its database to include geographic coordinates and credit information and has opened new sales offices. Growth of 15 percent to 20 percent should continue, and the company may be able to use the substantial amount of cash it's been generating to make acquisitions. At 15 times our 1995 earnings estimate of 90 cents a share, this stock is cheap.<p>
DONALD A. YACKTMAN
<a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund</b></a>
Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalizations of at least $1 billion.
<a name="NYSE:KWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10857"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>King World Productions </b></a>(NYSE: KWP) Up to $38
The answer: What is King World Productions? The question: The company Oprah, Merv, and I all think is a smart buy. Of course, it helps that King World (New York) distributes Oprah Winfrey's show and that Merv Griffin is executive producer of Wheel of Fortune and Jeopardy! These three shows plus Inside Edition generated 84 percent of King World's fiscal 1995 revenue, and increases in advertising during these signature programs should continue to bolster revenues. What's more, there's a good chance the company may be sold. With its stock currently selling at approximately ten times 1996 earnings, King World looks very attractive.

AL FRANK
The Prudent Speculator
Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation. 
<a name="NASD:BELF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12760"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bel Fuse</b></a> (NASDAQ: BELF) Up to $11.20
Bel Fuse (Jersey City) designs and manufactures delay lines and fuses used in computer networking, tele-communications, business equipment, and consumer electronics. The stock price plummeted more than 40 percent in July after Bel reported earnings six cents shy of estimates, but that doesn't worry us: We expect the company to rebound and earn $1.20 a share in 1996. Bel has a strong balance sheet -- it's free of long-term debt and has $3.82 a share in cash and marketable securities. The stock now trades for just nine times our 1996 earnings estimate and several dollars below its book value of  $11.84 a share. The three- to five-year target price is $22.<p>
JIM McCAMANT
Medical Technology Stock Letter
Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies. 
<a name="NASD:ICOS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ICOS</b></a> (NASDAQ: ICOS) Up to $10
Biopharmaceutical company ICOS (Bothell, Washington) develops anti-inflammatory therapeutic drugs for chronic diseases, such as asthma and multiple sclerosis. Chairman and CEO George B. Rathmann -- also the founder of Amgen -- has attracted excellent scientists, who in turn have brought in sophisticated investors. Making the firm even more appealing is Bill Gates, an active board member and the company's largest shareholder. ICOS has de-veloped attractive partnerships with <a name="NYSE:GLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41781"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Glaxo Wellcome</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:ABT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10030"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Abbott Laboratories</b></a>. Over the next year, we expect the investment community to get excited in response to clinical-trial results. The 18-month target price is $20. <p>
MICHAEL MURPHY 
California Technology Stock Letter
Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.
<a name="NASD:EUPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44511"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Euphonix</b></a> (NASDAQ: EUPH) Up to $7
Euphonix (Palo Alto, California) makes digital systems for audio mixers used in recording studios -- in particular, a feature called SnapShot Recall, which allows a recording engineer to switch from one mix to another in real time, something the company's competitors' systems can't do. A late-summer announcement that Euphonix was going to miss analysts' earnings estimates for the third and fourth quarters cut the stock price nearly in half. At this price, Euphonix is highly attractive. We expect the company to earn 20 to 25 cents a share this year and 40 to 45 cents in 1997. We give the stock a 12-month target price of $11; if things go as well as they should, it could go as high as $15.<p>
LOUIS NAVELLIER
MPT Review
Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks. 
<a name="NASD:HOLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13907"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hologic</b></a> (NASDAQ: HOLX) Up to $43
Hologic (Waltham, Massachusetts) makes and distributes X-ray equipment that helps doctors examine bone density and diagnose osteoporosis. Half the company's sales take place outside the U.S. In 1995, Hologic's stock price rose rapidly following FDA approval of an osteoporosis drug that has already increased demand for the company's products domestically. Hologic had a phenomenal third quarter, earning 32 cents a share -- 400 percent growth over the same quarter a year ago. I expect the company to earn 97 cents a share in 1996 and $1.24 a share in 1997. Having recently split its stock and with no long-term debt, Hologic is an attractive buy. <p>

						The market doesn't want to know that the economy is slowing<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
For most of this year, investors have rooted for slow growth. Every time the economy has revved up, bond yields have climbed and stock prices have fallen.The fear, of course, has been that good economic news would leadthe Federal Reserve to raise interest rates in order to head off inflation.<p>
Well, the market is now about todiscover that growth can be too slow.In August, a consensus forecast of 52 economists compiled by Blue Chip Economic Indicators predicted that the economy will grow by just 2.1 percent next year. Investors could be facing a classic earnings squeeze.<p>
On the surface, an economy growing at 2.1 percent doesn't seem like that big a problem for the stock market. After all, growth in 1995 was just 2 percent. But the pattern of changes in the growth rate is troubling. The economy has been gradually slowing since 1994, when it grew at 3.5 percent. After a brief pickup in the first half of 1996, the economy is projectedto resume its downward course, with growth dipping quarter by quarter: from 2.6 percent in the third quarter of 1996, to 2.1 percent, to 1.9 percent, and then to just 1.8 percent.<p>
What is 1997 likely to mean for corporate earnings? The Blue Chip consensus calls for profits to grow just 3.3 percent. The optimists are calling for an 8.4 percent increase and the pessimistsfor a 3.1 percent decline.<p>
Unfortunately, there is reason tobelieve that the gloomy view is closer to the mark. Besides the slowdown in overall economic activity, other fundamental trends are conspiring to depress earnings in 1997.<p>
First is the increasing strength of the dollar. The dollar's weakness over the past couple of years has given a boost to the earnings of multinationals, such as <a name="NYSE:KOF"></a><b>Coca-Cola</b> and <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>. A stronger buck will have the opposite effect.<p>
Second, inflation is so weak that companies will not be able to raise prices, and intense competition will even lead to price cuts on products from cereals to personal computers.<p>
Third, although general consumer inflation remains low, wages are creeping up. This kind of split is fairly typical in the late stages of an economic cycle, says James Stack, president of InvesTech Research. "Ask a CEO in the Midwest how tight the labor market is," he suggests. Labor costs rose at a 3.8 percent annual rate in the second quarter of 1996, according to the Department of Labor.<p>
But none of this would matter much to investors if stocks were cheap. But equities are actually more expensive than they were a year ago.<p>
The price that investors pay fora stock -as measured by its price-to-earnings ratio -rises and falls during an economic cycle. Generally, it peaks when the market sees rising earnings ahead. At the end of 1992, for example, when actual earnings for the previous 12 months had been relatively low, the p/e on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index stood at 22.8. As those earnings arrived over the next three years, the p/e gradually moved downward, bouncing around 16 for most of 1995.<p>
From this perspective, the climb in the p/e from 17 in late 1995 to 19 in August 1996 was perverse. Facing slowing earnings growth, stocks should have grown cheaper -not more expensive.<p>
How much cheaper would be reasonable? If the optimists among the Blue Chip economists are right -corporate profits increase 13 percent in 1996 and 8 percent in 1997, but the p/e falls to 17 to reflect the prospects for slow growth -then the S&P would finish 1997 at 704.48, a gain of 5.6 percent over the next 16 months. If the optimists are right this year, but the consensus is correct about 1997 -3 percent growth next year -then the S&P 500 would stand at 671.86 at the end of 1997, for a gain of 1 percent. If earnings fall in 1997, returns could be negative. A decline of 10 percent wouldn't be out of the question.<p>
Needless to say, a market in which the most reasonable scenario shows a 1 percent return over 16 months is a bad buy.<p>
Individual stocks won't track this market exactly. Investors who see growth slowing have already bid up companies that offer what they view as strong, predictable earnings. Investors are now willing to pay 40 times earnings for Coca-Cola, up from 32 in early 1996.<p>
The market will dump shares in any company that misses earnings estimates by even a hair. <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> received the treatment in July. Expect to see more of the same. That kind of rush for the exit is what passes for investor discipline in a market like this.<p>
But if economic growth is indeed slowing, investors would be wise to switch some attention from corporate income statements to corporate balance sheets. In a slow economy, some overextended companies will find themselves unable to pay their bills -instead of just missing earnings estimates, some may wind up in bankruptcy. And financially weak companies don't have to go broke to do investors harm. They'll be so busy just trying to hang on that they'll lose ground to better-run companies. Great companies draw on solid balance sheets to build market share in slow times. They invest in gaining customers and improving efficiency when their competitors are struggling just to make ends meet. Those financially sound companies are the stocks an investor will want to own when growth picks up again.

						LATE PAYMENT
Credit-card delinquency rates increased in the first quarter of this year with quarterly charge-offs of bad credit-card debt topping 1.07 percent ($2.23 billion) for the first time in three years, according to Veribanc of Wakefield, Massachusetts. That's likely to mean bad news for profits at some banks. (See "<A href="/articles/Z9608I02.html">Banking's Next Big Mistake?</A>
" July/August 1996.) Traditionally, a 1 percent charge-off rate is considered bad for bank profits. But with most banks showing healthy earnings, says Warren Heller, Veribanc's research director, the pain is likely to be confined to a few banks. A little more than 8 percent of the 6,085 banks that issue credit cards hold 30 percent of the bad credit-card debt. At the same time, the banks with the majority of bad debt account for only 16 percent of overall outstanding credit-card balances.<p>

						Northern Lights<p>
By Todd G. Buchholz<p>
The U.S. isn't the only country roiled by budget deficits and a government-debt time bomb that threatens to blow up the living standard of future generations. Some countries, however, are standing up to the challenge. Two that have come back from the brink of financial disaster, Canada and Sweden, are creating opportunities for investors as a result. In 1994, both were headed toward a creditors' strike and had ratios of debt to gross domestic product well over 75 percent (compared with 60 percent in the U.S.). By mid-1994, Canada had to offer interest rates 200 basis points higher than U.S. rates to attract bond buyers; Sweden had to pay 310 basis points more than the U.S. These higher rates drove up budget deficits, creating a spiral of debt. Then these nations stiffened, showing that left-wing governments can sometimes be as fiscally conservative as their counterparts on the right.<p>
In 1995, Canadian finance minister Paul Martin delivered a strikingly tough budget plan to bring the deficit down steadily from 5.3 percent of GDP in 1994 to 4 percent in 1995 and to an estimated 2.7 percent in 1996 and 1.2 percent in 1997. The markets were particularly impressed that Martin performed his fiscal magic with few tax increases, but rather by slicing and dicing programs. The reward for the government's fiscal courage has been a stronger and more stable Canadian dollar, giving equity investors confidence that their capital gains and dividends won't be chewed up by currency losses. After a losing year in 1994, the Toronto stock index has climbed about 27 percent since Martin's 1995 budget announcement, despite a sluggish economy. When the Canadian economy does get off its feet, the stock market won't be dragged down by extraordinarily high interest rates or a flimsy Canadian dollar.<p>
Of course, one risk will continue to dog the Canadian markets: Quebec separatism. After losing a razor-thin vote last year, the separatists will likely try to stage another referendum on separation in 1998. Still, the performance of Quebec leader Lucien Bouchard is impressive. Rather than fight for separatist ideas during this interim period, Bouchard, too, is tackling Quebec's provincial debt. If Bouchard can stanch the province's bleeding red ink, he can probably capture additional separatist votes. And while separatism is generally bad for Canadian markets, balanced budgets comfort investors.<p>
Sweden's path has resembled Canada's over the past year and a half. Finance Minister Erik Åsbrink plans to produce a 1997 budget that will reach a deficit-to-GDP ratio of 3 percent. This would qualify Sweden for the European Monetary Union should the Swedes opt for a single European currency.<p>
Because the government has tackled the deficit problem, the Swedish central bank has been able to cut interest rates without imperiling the Swedish krona. In fact, the krona jumped about 15 percent against the deutsche mark from August 1995 to August 1996, even as the central bank cut its deposit rate from 8 percent to 5.25 percent. Ordinarily such a rate cut weakens a currency; the krona's newfound strength demonstrates confidence in Sweden's finances. That has permitted the Swedish stock market to climb 12.3 percent this year (through August 8), compared with 7.6 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. When a recovery comes to the Swedish economy in 1997, it won't be short-circuited by the foolish, profligate spending policies of the past.<p>

						Falling Expectations<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
Now that the august 20 meeting of the  Federal Reserve has come and gone without a hike in interest rates, the bond market has started to focus on November. Although the Fed meets in September, most bond analysts don't believe the central bank will risk charges of political meddling by raising rates so close to the presidential election. A move in November, after the votes have been cast, is far more likely.<p>
But financial markets aren't expecting the Fed to take a big step upward on rates even then. As of mid-August, prices of futures contracts, which rise and fall with expectations of future interest rates, indicate that traders are expecting the Federal Funds Rate to inch up to about 5.7 percent in March 1997 from its current mark of 5.25 percent. A few weeks earlier, on July 25, futures prices were predicting a 6 percent Federal Funds Rate by March.<p>
That downward revision seems to reflect an increasingly pessimistic view of growth in the U.S. economy. A Merrill Lynch/Gallup poll of money managers conducted in early August showed that only 28 percent expect the U.S. economy to improve over the next 12 months. That's down from a peak of 63 percent in March 1996.

						LATE PAYMENT
Credit-card delinquency rates increased in the first quarter of this year with quarterly charge-offs of bad credit-card debt topping 1.07 percent ($2.23 billion) for the first time in three years, according to Veribanc of Wakefield, Massachusetts. That's likely to mean bad news for profits at some banks. (See "<A href="/articles/Z9608I02.html">Banking's Next Big Mistake?</A>
" July/August 1996.) Traditionally, a 1 percent charge-off rate is considered bad for bank profits. But with most banks showing healthy earnings, says Warren Heller, Veribanc's research director, the pain is likely to be confined to a few banks. A little more than 8 percent of the 6,085 banks that issue credit cards hold 30 percent of the bad credit-card debt. At the same time, the banks with the majority of bad debt account for only 16 percent of overall outstanding credit-card balances.<p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING  <p> The four top financial-newsletter writers below identify their favorite domestic stocks. The price listed is the maximum at which the author considers the recommended stock attractive.In some cases, the newsletter writer may hold the stock either in a personal account or in a fund he manages. He may also have changed his opinion after the February 26 publishing deadline for this issue.  <p> JIM McCAMANT <p>Medical Technology Stock Letter <p>Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.  <p> <a name="NASD:SHMN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15954"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SHAMAN PHARMACEUTICALS </b></a> (Nasdaq: SHMN) Up to $8. Shaman (South San Francisco), a biotech company, has  a singular approach todrug discovery, which includes analyzing active compounds inplants that have been used for medicinal purposes in indigenouscultures in  South America and Africa. The concept seems so obviousthat at first I was skeptical, but the company is proving thatthis process turns up real candidates: Virend, its herpes drug,is about to begin pivotal trials; Provir, its drug for travelers'diarrhea, is in phase-two trials; and another major program --focusing on type 2 diabetes -- is under way. The company hasplenty of cash from its 1993 initial public offering and a coupleof big-name partnerships.  <p>  <p>MICHAEL MURPHY <p>California Technology Stock Letter <p>Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.   <p> <a name="NASD:CRUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> CIRRUS LOGIC </b></a> (Nasdaq: CRUS) Up to $22. A semiconductor companywith a broad product line, Cirrus (Fremont, California) is thelogical choice to benefit from the Pentium-driven 20 percentgrowth I'm expecting to see in the personal-computer market thisyear. Changes in the company's manufacturing should mean a muchimproved bottom line. Cirrus has always depended on outside fabricationservices, but it is now spending roughly $1 billion to developco-manufacturing relationships, the first of which is with <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>. Cirrus is expecting a loss in the quarter ending in March asa result of PC-inventory problems; after that, results will improve.I think the stock will reach $45 a share by year-end.  <p>  <p>LOUIS NAVELLIER <p>MPT Review <p>Uses modern portfolio theory tooidentify high-return, low-volatilitystocks.   <p> <a name="NASD:JMED"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13873"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> JONES MEDICAL INDUSTRIES</b></a> (Nasdaq: JMED) Up to $52. Jones Medical Industries (St. Louis), a maker of pharmaceuticals and vitamins,looks quite attractive on a risk-reward basis. The stock, whichis up more than 600 percent from its 12-month low of $7.38 ashare, has an extremely high alpha (a positive technical sign,showing that its returns are uncorrelated with the market's)and  a very low standard deviation (a statistical measure ofrisk). Jones has over 400 different products and an aggressiveacquisition strategy, so it's no surprise that the company'sfundamentals are in great shape, too. Earnings last quarter camein well above most analysts' estimates, and the company has verystrong earnings momentum.   <p>  <p>DAN SULLIVAN <p>The Chartist <p>Uses technical analysis to identify long-term equity investments.  <p> <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BOEING</b></a> (NYSE: BA) Up to92. After struggling through five leanyears, the airline industry appears ready for takeoff. As a group,airlines lost roughly $13 billion from 1990 to 1994 before returningto profitability in 1995. As the recovery strengthens and airlinesreplace their aging planes with more fuel-efficient models, Boeing's(Seattle) orders will expand. In fact, TWA recently placed anorder to buy ten Boeing 757-200s and lease ten more. Rising orderscombined with more cost-efficient production should drive earningshigher through the end of the decade. The trip will not be turbulencefree, however, as Boeing's success rests, as always, in the handsof a fickle airline industry.  <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE BUYING NOW  <p> Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after February 26, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these eight managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends that they conduct their own due diligence.  <p> PRESTON ATHEY <p><a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value</b></a>  <p>Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.  <p> <a name="NASD:AMTL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16007"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AMTROL</b></a>  (Nasdaq: AMTL) Up to $18. Investors in Amtrol (West Warwick, Rhode Island), a water-tank maker, took a bath in 1995, but long-term prospects remain good. After peaking in 1994 at $1.61 a share, earnings fell last year to $1.51 (before 31 cents a share in write-offs). This outfit can earn $1.60 a share in 1996. Amtrol is debt free and well worth its current stock price on the fundamentals alone. If the company is acquired, investors could reap much more. How likely is a takeover? Very. Its founder recently died at age 79 and left no clear successor. Plus, most of the common shares are owned by restless institutions that have lost money in the stock and are squeezing directors to sell out.  <p>
JAMES P. CRAIG <p><a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a><p>Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea ofpreserving capital over the long term.   <p> <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS MACHINES</b></a>  (NYSE: IBM) Up to $130. Take-no-prisoners CEO Louis Gerstner has mended this computer giant's Achilles' heel -- the mainframe business -- by balancing aggressive pricecuts with strong growth in computing power. If IBM (Armonk, New York) can maintain this division's progress, its other lines of business could propel the stock to new heights. The stock looks cheap to me right now. With huge cash flow  ($7 billion in 1996, $8 billion in 1997), the company is able to buy back tons of stock (it repurchased $4.2 billion worth last year).I expect IBM to earn $14 a share in 1996 and $16 a share in 1997. If the mainframe business continues to improve, the stock could go to $170 a share by year-end.  <p>
SHELBY M.C. DAVIS <p><a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a> <p>Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.  <p> <a name="NYSE:DLJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44439"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DONALDSON, LUFKIN & JENRETTE </b></a> (NYSE: DLJ) Up to $31. Why chase high-priced new Internet issues when you can buy the firm that is underwriting a lot of these offerings? Spun off from Equitable last October at  $27 a share, DLJ (New York) stock is in a post-IPO consolidation stage, trading at around $30. DLJ is strong inmerchant banking, equity underwriting, and research. Return one quity in 1995 was 17 percent and should be even higher thisyear. Book value is $21 a share now and is increasing steadily. Earnings have been on a roll  and should be in the $3- to $4-a-share range in 1996. Essentially, then, this is an emerging growth company, trading at a low nine times 1996 earnings estimates. <p>
DANIEL B. LEONARD <p><a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology</b></a> <p>Seeks growth stocks in rechnology and related fields.  <p> <a name="NASD:CRRS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14479"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CROWN RESOURCES</b></a>(Nasdaq: CRRS) Up to $7.50. Crown Resources (Denver) doesn't think doing the dirty work is below its station. After identifying promising gold properties in the western United States and South America, Crown teams up with larger partners for the later-stage development. The company is very close to getting the final permit for the Crown Jewel project, its Washington State joint venture with Battle Mountain Gold. Crown has exploration projects in Peru and Argentina, as well as in Nevada, Utah, and Montana. Although most gold stocks have been doing well, Crown has remained relatively flat, so I think the stock could bounce to $10 or $12 a share by year-end.  <p>  <p>WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ <p><a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value Fund</b></a> <p>Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be undervalued.  <p> <a name="NASD:TRKA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TRAK AUTO</b></a>(Nasdaq: TRKA) Up to $16. Trak Auto (Landover, Maryland)is motoring ahead with its expansion plans. This retailer inthe $100 billion  do-it-yourself market for auto parts is repairing its bottom line. How? By emphasizing growth in its much-higher-margin superstores and warehouse stores, which now account for roughly two-thirds of sales. Trak currently has 282 stores and offersover 25,000 products. The stock is trading at book value andonly 11 times 12-month trailing earnings. This is a low valuationfor a company with no debt and more than $5 a share in cash flow, especially when compared with competitors such as Auto Zone (28 times trailing earnings), <a name="NYSE:PBY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pep Boys</b></a> (22), and <a name="NYSE:DAP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11567"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Discount Auto</b></a> (18). <p>

This satellite maker's stock price, which has been orbiting in the $21 range for over a year, should improve as global demand for data, TV transmission, direct satellite broadcast, and personal-communication capability explodes. After a weak 1995, Comsat (Bethesda, Maryland) has taken steps to highlight the value of its 30-year-old satellite-communications franchises, Inmarsat and Intelsat. That's why the company recently spun offits Ascent Entertainment Group. Planet 1, the world's first personal-satellite-communications system, should be available in July. This five-pound device is another step toward global personal-communication capability. <p>

Plus, cash-flow margins jumped to 31 percent from 24 percent in 1994. We expect these trends to continue. Concern about personal-communications-services competition has hurt the stock but is unfounded --  these vendors are not building in Vanguard's markets, where population density is low and hilly terrain would block signals. Vanguard will adopt low-cost digital technology later this year, boosting its competitive edge.  <p>  <p>DONALD A.

Barefoot (Worthington, Ohio) is starting to make a big imprint on the slowly consolidating lawn-care industry. The second-largest company of its kind, Barefoot has been buying mom-and-pop stores and now has 59 company locations and 44 franchise locations. It is also one of the cheapest stocks out there, selling at about ten times my 1996 earnings estimate of between $1 and $1.10 a share. The company generates a lot of excess cash flow, which it has been using to buy back stock. One caveat: Quarterly earnings are sensitive to weather. For example, fourth-quarter 1995 sales were $4 million less than expected because of the cold, snowy start to the winter.  <p><p>

						Fundamentals don't seem to count for much now -- so watch them carefully  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> On Tuesday, February 20, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspantold Congress to expect moderate economic growth of about 2 percentand low inflation for 1996. Oh, no! said the financial markets.The Fed doesn't need to cut interest rates to stimulate the economy! The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell almost 45 points, and the30-year Treasury bond tumbled.  <p> In his testimony the next day, Greenspan told Congress to expect moderate growth and low inflation. Yea! the stock market responded.The Fed's going to cut interest rates soon! The Dow climbed more than 57 points that day, tacked on another 92 points on Thursday,and finished the week with a 22-point gain as it hit another record high at 5630.  <p> But the bond market didn't share the stock market's euphoria that week. After rallying along with the equity market on Wednesday,the bond market resumed its two-month slide. Bond prices felland yields roseÐthe volatile 30-year Treasury bond finished the week yielding 6.42

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> KEEPING UP  <p> By John Fried  <p> Expect a cautious, inflation-loathing Federal Reserve Board for years to come now that President Clinton has nominated Alan Greenspan for a third term as chairman of the Fed. Greenspan's nomination is virtually assured of confirmation by the Republican-controlled Senate. Clinton has also chosen Alice Rivlin, the White House budget director, and Laurence Meyer, an economist, to fill twovacancies on the Fed board. Both Rivlin and Meyer are considered proponents of price stability and aren't likely to push for economic growth at the risk of triggering inflation.   <p> The capital-gains tax cut doesn't look like the sure thing it did just a few months ago. The longer the impasse on the federal budget continues, the more likely it becomes that the president and top GOP leaders will wait, in essence, to let voters settle the issue in the November elections.   <p> Warren Buffett has unveiled a plan that would allow investors to buy a stake in <a name="NYSE:BRK.A"></a><b>Berkshire Hathaway</b> on the cheap if $1,000 or so counts as cheap. Currently, a share of Buffett's investment company trades for more than $30,000. The plan would create anew class-B stock and designate existing shares as class A. Class-A holders will be able to convert a share into 30 class-B shares though conversions in the other direction won't be permitted.  <p> The Securities and Exchange Commission has chastised closed-end mutual funds for poor disclosure, saying fund literature is often unclear on how and when the funds will take action to prevent the discount on shares from becoming too great. In a letter to the Investment Company Institute, the SEC expressed concerns that investors were being misled by apparent promises in disclosure documents to eliminate these discounts by converting the closed-end funds into the more common open-end variety.   <p> Employers now have even more incentive to offer employees solid investment options in their 401(k) plans. A federal appeals court in Philadelphia ruled that employees of Unisys could sue the company after one of the options (a guaranteed investment contract) in their 401(k) plan turned out to be a poor choice. Meanwhile, employers who procrastinate when it comes to depositing employee contributions into 401(k) and other benefit plans may soon run afoul of the Labor Department. The federal agency has proposed new regulations that would require employers to make monthly deposits within a few days. Currently, deposits can be held byan employer for up to 90 days.  <p> Only 6 of 16 major brokerage houses beat the market with their stock recommendations in 1995, according to a study by Zacks Investment Research and The Wall Street Journal.   <p> VISA U.S.A. has said it will discontinue offering automatic purchase insurance for gold-card holders. The move, scheduled to become effective March 1, applies to insurance that covers the cost of merchandise that is broken or stolen after a customer uses a VISA gold card to buy it. MasterCard International and <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>said they plan to continue to offer automatic purchase protection. <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> GLOBAL MARKETS  <p> By Todd G. Buchholz  <p> The Campaign Market <p>Presidential candidates do what they need to do to woo voters, so it's time to ask what the presidential campaign will do to financial markets.  <p> First off, the U.S. bond market could be in trouble. The budget deal of 1993 raised taxes and cut spending part of then National Economic Council chairman Robert Rubin's strategy to please the bond market and let lower interest rates jump-start the economy. But no one will propose jacking up gas or income taxes this year. <p> With the drive toward a balanced budget stalled, traders no longer expect high bond prices or the 5.5 percent yields of two months ago. Even with a slowing economy, yields could surpass 6.25 percent. In sum: yields up, prices down.  <p> Changes in our bond market also have a global impact. For example, between January 19 and February 20 (with a Federal Reserve rate cut on January 31), U.S. bond prices plummeted, sending yields on the ten-year bond from 5.53 percent to 6.01 percent, largely on uncertainty over how much more the Fed might lower rates. This caused German bond yields to soar and Germany's DAX stock index to briefly lose its momentum. The rest of Europe felt a similar wallop.  <p> Trade policy is already being affected by the campaign, as Pat Buchanan has tempered every candidate's public enthusiasm forfree trade. China is the first test of the nation's commitment. The U.S. is rattling retaliatory sabers because of piracy of U.S. software, human-rights violations, nuclear proliferation, and a ballooning trade deficit (approaching $50 billion, in China's favor). There's also the threat of a Chinese invasion of Taiwan if the March 23 Taiwanese elections are won by the Democratic Progressive Party, which would represent a step toward independence and a turn toward democracy. The situation has some traders nervous enough to stay out of both China markets until April. The question is whether we will deny China most-favored-nation status. Republicans will pounce on any softness from Clinton on this issue, but I expect China to remain an MFN.  <p> Mexico may be in for some trouble, too. In February, Senators Dianne Feinstein of California and Alphonse D'Amato of New York proposed withholding U.S. aid unless Mexico does more to check drug traffcking and illegal immigration. Formal sanctions are unlikely, but the Mexican markets may suffer as Mexico bashing becomes an easy way for candidates to appeal to some voters. Also, opposition from California wine producers to competing against good, cheap Chilean wine will squash hopes of extending NAFTA to Chile.  <p> The election won't exempt the commodities markets, either. In February, U.S. trade representative Mickey Kantor announced anagreement with Canada to restrict its lumber exports here, and the deal has helped push lumber prices to their highest level in a year. Edgy traders also wonder if the president, to avoida foreign-policy crisis and romance the farm vote, will boost President Boris Yeltsin's reelection campaign (the Russian electionis June 2) by helping Russia purchase U.S. wheat.  <p> Election season is a time for caution, but keep in mind that U.S. stock markets have been buoyed by huge flows of cash from individuals into stock mutual funds. A bitter campaign might spur people to put even more aside for a rainy day.  <p> Todd G. Buchholz, a contributing editor, is an international economic consultant and lecturer and the author of From Here to Economy: A Shortcut to Economic Literacy.  <p><p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> FIXED INCOME  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> When the federal reserve cut the federal funds rate from 5.5 percent to 5.25 percent on January 31, the bond market barely twitched. "The cut just confirmed what the market expected," says John Burgess, managing director of Bankers Trust Global Investment Management.  <p> And when, on February 20 and 21, Alan Greenspan spooked the market -- sending bond prices down and yields on 30-year Treasurys up from 6 percent to 6.4 percent -- by merely suggesting that the economy was healthier than believed, many experts concluded that the market had already factored another 0.25 percent cut into bond prices. That means bonds won't rally significantly unless the Fed lowers rates by half a percentage point or more. <p> Yet the Fed may not lower rates. "They have to keep rates high enough to maintain the dollar's strength and attract foreign capital to fund the deficit," says James B. Stack, editor of Inves Tech Market Analyst in Whitefish, Montana. In short, the potential for gains in long-term bonds isn't nearly what it was17 months ago when 30-year Treasurys yielded 8 percent, and the risks are growing. Best advice: Mix short-term with intermediate-or long-term issues.   <p>

						April 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> 10 STOCKS TO CONSIDER, 10 STOCKS TO AVOID  <p> CLIFF HENRY, president of CWH Associates, a New York City investment firm, manages $25 million in two hedge funds, which returned 58 percent to investors in 1995 and have averaged 26 percent annually since 1990. His stocks to avoid are the also-rans insuch fast-growing industries as medical technology: companies too dependent on an outdated technology or too small to grab significant market share. For example, Henry believes that <a name="NYSE:SDG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16492"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sofamor Danek Group's</b></a> spinal implant device, which accounts for over 90 percent of sales, will be eclipsed by a superior product due out this year from Spine-Tech. <a name="NASD:CTSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16940"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cellular Technical Services'</b></a> technology protects against cellular-phone fraud, but the company could lose market share when phones with built-in security chips from telecom giants such as <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>Nokia</b> and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> become widespread. <a name="NASD:PNDA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43104"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Panda Project</b></a>makes a server with removable cards so users can upgrade easily.

Over five years, the fund has earned 28.73 percent annually. Morris looks for stocks that will appreciateby 30 percent within 9 to 18 months. A company must have original technology or products that have garnered high margins or market share, revenue and earnings growth of over 20 percent a year, a record of meeting annual earnings expectations, and new products that will result in growth not yet reflected in the stock price.

						By Jim Jubak<p>The market is flirting with the edge of the cliff. After falling 161 points on Monday, July 15, the Dow Jones Industrial Average began Tuesday by plunging another 167 points. But then, on the verge of full-fledged panic, the market rallied. The Dow finished that day up
9 points and then roared uphill by 87 points on Thursday. On Friday, the Dow gave back 37 points.<p>What is behind this extraordinary volatility? Earnings are the clear culprit. The previous week, blue-chip bellwether <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>  reported second-quarter earnings some 14 cents a share below analysts' estimates, and <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> signaled Wall Street that it would have trouble meeting expectations for its third quarter. When, on July 15, <a name="NASD:AMAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12647"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Applied Materials</b></a>, the biggest maker of manufacturing equipment for the semiconductor industry, announced that it expected earnings to fall short, too, the market had heard enough. Technology stocks went into free fall -- taking the broader indexes with them. Only surprisingly strong earnings from <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>  the next day -- the chip maker reported second-quarter earnings well above estimates -- stemmed the rout.<p>Why are a few bad numbers enough to send Wall Street into a panic? The announcements seemed to confirm a pattern. After seeing earnings growth of almost 15 percent in 1993, 40 percent in 1994, and 11 percent in 1995, analysts began 1996 hoping for growth of 10 to 15 percent for the year ahead. That prediction has been repeatedly revised downward. Now the optimists believe earnings on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index are likely to grow by just 9 percent on the year, says Ben Zacks of Zacks Investment Research. At the low end, Kurt Walters, vice president of research at Safian Investment Research, is calling for growth of merely 1 to 3 percent.<p>Even a drop to 9 percent is enough to rattle investors. The stocks in the S&P 500 recently traded at a price-to-earnings ratio slightly below 19. That's not out of line if earnings are growing at 15 percent a year, but if earnings for 1996 come in at 9 percent -- or worse yet, at just 1 percent above 1995's level -- this market is ripe for a fall.<p>How much will earnings growth slow in 1996? No one knows -- 
and the major reason is uncertainty about the economy. As a whole, it grew at a weak 2.25 percent annual rate in the first quarter of 1996, but industrial production came in at a robust 5.5 percent in the second quarter. Economic growth "could be positive by a big number; it could be negative by a lot," says Zacks. "No one knows. Alan Greenspan doesn't know. Wall Street analysts don't know."<p>With the macroeconomic data giving so little indication of the direction of the economy, investors are forced to glean clues from every earnings report. And right now, these terse statements don't make for comforting reading.<p>For example, analysts saw Applied Materials' announcement of weak earnings as a strong indication that capital spending (the money spent on the machines that are used to make everything from computer chips to lug nuts) was slowing. A few days later, chip maker <a name="NYSE:LSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13932"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LSI Logic</b></a> announced that it was expecting second-quarter revenues to decline from last year's level and was therefore delaying the start-up of a new manufacturing plant for at least six months. Voil! The decline in capital spending was anecdotally confirmed.<p>Investors are also watching the news companies report after they announce earnings. In the wake of its disappointing earnings, Motorola reported that it had cut 145 jobs at its semiconductor plant in Austin, Texas -- the first layoffs at Motorola in more than a decade. Clearly the company believes that the problems it faces require painful and dramatic action. Hewlett-Packard sent investors a message, too, when it announced that it would take a $150 
million charge to exit the disk-drive business. Companies tend to take write-offs when they've already decided the quarter will be a disaster. So HP, too, was signaling more than a temporary dip in business. Analysts reacted predictably.<p>Owning shares while Wall Street is ratcheting down its expectations is always painful. Just as the herd drove prices for many stocks -- and perhaps the market as a whole -- to unsustainable levels, now it may be about to send solid stocks tumbling down.<p>But this isn't a time to buy just anything on a dip -- a lot of junk stocks are trading 50 percent below their 52-week highs. Look for companies you'd like to own five years from now and calculate a target price.<p>Since earnings growth is slowing, first take a whack out of analysts' projections -- cut Hewlett-Packard's earnings by another 20 cents, for example, to $2.30 a share. Figure the lowest p/e that investors have paid for the company's earnings in the past five years by checking a publication such as Value Line Investment Survey. Take that low annual p/e (13.4 for HP) and multiply it by the discounted earnings to get a rough price of $31 a share. The stock could well go lower if the market panics, but it will bounce back. HP isn't there yet -- its recent low is $38.25 -- but some other quality stocks are. And in a volatile market, a hungry investor should know what price makes him salivate.<p><p><p>

Al Frank, The Prudent Spectator
Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.
<a name="AMEX:GNA"></a><b>Gainsco</b> (AMEX: GNA) Up to $10
I like financial stocks in general right now -- they have a low price-to-earnings ratio relative to their growth rate -- and this is one of my favorites. Gainsco (Fort Worth, Texas) is a property and casualty insurer specializing in what's called excess and surplus insurance, primarily for commercial vehicles and auto garages. The bulk of its business is in Texas, but the company is aggressively getting into California and Illinois. Gainsco has had a 20 percent return on equity for the past decade, and I think it can maintain that rate in the years ahead. At around $9.50 a share, the stock is trading at 12 times trailing earnings and only 11 times my estimated earnings for 1996.<p>
Jim McCamant, Medical Technology Stock Letter
Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.
<a name="NASD:CHIR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12972"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chiron</b></a> (Nasdaq: CHIR) Up to $120
Chiron (Emeryville, California) is our top pick among the larger biotech stocks. The company's excellent management team is using outstanding science to build a world-class pharmaceutical company (over half of Chiron's sales are generated overseas). Chiron has not only the best product pipeline in the biotech industry but also a number of exciting products nearing FDA approval. Over the longer term, the company's vaccine and gene-therapy programs have the potential to fundamentally change the pharmaceutical industry. With a number of new products expected to receive approval next year, Chiron should gain increasing momentum.<p>
Michael Murphy, California Technology Stock Letter
Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.
<a name="NASD:RZYM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51693"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ribozome Pharmaceuticals</b></a> (Nasdaq: RZYM) Up to $13
Ribozyme Pharmaceuticals (Boulder, Colorado) is one of the new generation of biotech companies working inside the cell. Ribozymes, the company's namesake products, are laboratory-altered forms of ribonucleic acid, or RNA, that have the ability to inhibit protein production by going through the cell wall and selectively destroying messenger RNA before it can create problems. The treatment has very few side effects. The company also has a big deal with Chiron to develop five drugs; the first product is HIV-related. After a big run-up in price earlier this year, the stock has fallen back to its IPO price, which, based on all the money invested in R&D, is cheap.<p>
Louis Navellier, MPT Review
Uses modern portfolio theory to identify theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks. 
<a name="NASD:ZTEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16255"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Zytec</b></a> (Nasdaq: ZTEC) Up to $18.50
Zytec (Eden Prairie, Minnesota), which manufactures and repairs electronic power supplies for computers and printers, has been highly charged all year. Analysts have been consistently making upward revisions of earnings over the past few months, and big institutions have been buying up the stock quickly. While the stock's high standard deviation indicates a broad range of volatility, we are encouraged by an extremely high alpha, which indicates a strong return for reasons uncorrelated to the market. Of the 7,200 stocks I follow, Zytec ranks at number 26. That, combined with a high risk/reward rating, makes Zytec highly attractive.<p><p><p><p><p>

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here--
the maximum at which he considers it attractive. The manager also 
may have sold the stock after July 18, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends they conduct their own due diligence.<p>
Preston Athey, <a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value</b></a>
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million. 
<a name="NASD:DGTL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14341"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Digital Systems International</b></a> (Nasdaq: DGTL) Up to $16
One of the great values created by the recent tech correction is Digital Systems (Redmond, Washington), a supplier of computerized telephone systems for customer-service centers. The stock has fallen 50 percent from its 12-month high of $24 a share. A 1994 shift away from proprietary hardware toward specialized software solutions that increase efficiency and save money has helped the company's sales and earnings rebound and should result in 20 percent annual growth over the next two years. Despite the fact that the company has no debt and has $3.50 a share in cash, the stock sells for less than 14 times its 1996 earnings estimate of $1 a share.<p>
James P. Craig, <a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>
Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term. 
<a name="NYSE:EDS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41915"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>EDS</b></a> (NYSE: EDS) Up to $57
Computer-systems giant EDS (Plano, Texas) has seen its stock held back by the <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> pension fund's liquidation of 20 million shares of EDS stock (EDS was formerly owned by GM). But like rival Computer Sci-ences, EDS will benefit from a much larger rise in 
outsourcing than people expect. EDS's contracts, which tend to be with large companies, are sometimes worth billions of dollars apiece (this kind of outsourcing can save a company 20 to 25 percent on its information systems). With more than $60 billion of business in backlog and a listing in the S&P 500 Stock Index expected in the near future, EDS could easily reach $70 a share in a year.<p>
Shelby M.C. Davis, <a name="NYVTX"></a><b>New York Venture Fund</b>
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.
<a name="NYSE:HAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10697"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Halliburton</b></a> (NYSE: HAL) Up to $56
Dick Cheney, still in his first year as CEO, is taking anything but a defensive approach at energy-services and construction concern Halliburton (Dallas). This truly global company (it operates in a hundred countries, and more than half its earnings are generated overseas) has cut costs and is focusing on production and fieldwork for the major oil companies; these outsourcing contracts increasingly include lucrative bonus incentives for Halliburton. Industry revenues are rising at a double-digit pace, and profit margins are expanding. The company is poised to earn $2.50 a share in 1996 and $3 a share in 1997. This could be a $75 stock in three years.<p>
Daniel B. Leonard, <a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology</b></a>
<a name="NYSE:NEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11050"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>National Education Corp.</b></a> (NYSE: NEC) Up to $18
I recommended National Education Corporation (Irvine, California) back in January, and it still gets straight A's in my book. NEC is the largest technical-training company in the U.S. and a leading publisher of educational software. The company had a few problems a couple of years ago with a narrow product base and a slow delivery system, but under new CEO Sam Yau, NEC has focused efforts on the growing market for computer-based training and educational systems. Earnings were down in 1994 and 1995, but I'm looking for them to reach 50 to 55 cents a share this year and 70 to 75 cents a share in 1997. My target for the stock is $25 within a year.<p>
William J. Nasgovitz, <a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value Fund</b></a>
Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be undervalued. 
<a name="AMEX:SST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12319"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Shelter Components</b></a> (AMEX: SST) Up to $33
Shelter Components (Elkhart, Indiana) sells a wide array of roducts--carpeting, wallboard, bathroom fixtures--to the manufactured-housing and recreational-vehicle industries. Manufactured housing has become a partic-ularly strong growth area and now accounts for a third of all new housing starts. Shelter, whose national distribution capabilities give it a competitive advantage in the field, has been increasing its market share right along with its revenue per manufactured home: In 1990 it made $766 per home; in 1995 it made $1,365. At nine times estimated 1996 earnings of $1.45 a share, Shelter is an excellent value, and insiders have been buying.<p>
Eric E. Rayback, <a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a>
Seeks current income first, capital appreciation second.
<a name="NYSE:JOS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10828"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Jostens</b></a> (NYSE: JOS) Up to $23
Jostens (Minneapolis) makes and sells yearbooks and class rings. The company's stock, which fell recently in reaction to investors' concerns that near-term earnings would be below expectations, yields 5.1 percent at its recent price of $17.25 a share. Jostens's management is very oriented toward shareholders, as evidenced by its repurchase of seven million shares at $24 a share in September 1995. I'm looking for the company to earn $1.25 a share in fiscal 1996 and $1.50 the following year. In addition, management has indicated it will take further steps to enhance shareholder value should the stock continue to languish.<p>
Ralph Wagner/Chuck McQuaid, <a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a>
Hold stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.
<a name="NASD:IVCR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13827"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invacare</b></a> (Nasdaq: IVCR) Up to $25
Invacare (Elyria, Ohio) manufactures home health-care and rehabilitation equipment, such as wheelchairs, nursing beds, and oxygen concentrators. The combination of an aging population and astronomical hospital costs has been a boon to home health care, and Invacare is poised to prosper. This low-cost producer has a leading market share (20 percent) in a $3 billion worldwide industry. Led by hard-charging CEO Mal Mixon, who owns better than 5 percent of the company's common stock, Invacare is also making acquisitions to complement its product line and is expanding distribution, particularly in Europe. The com-pany should earn $1.30 a share in 1996 and $1.55 in 1997.<p>
Donald A. Yacktman, <a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund</b></a>
Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion.
<a name="NASD:BARE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15449"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Barefoot</b></a> (Nasdaq: BARE) Up to $12
Lawn-care concern Barefoot (Worthington, Ohio) has not bloomed since I recommended it last April. Blame it on the weather. Nevertheless, the company's strategy of acquiring mom-and-pop stores (it now has 59 company outlets and 44 franchise operations) should compensate for a tough second quarter and carry Barefoot to a successful finish in 1996. Selling at about ten times my 1996 earnings estimate of 95 cents a share, the stock still looks incredibly cheap, though bad weather always remains a threat. The company generates a lot of excess cash flow, which it uses to buy back stock--
invariably good news for investors.<p><p>

						By John Fried<p>Twenty-four securities firms have settled a civil antitrust suit brought by the Justice Department regarding allegations of price-fixing on the Nasdaq stock market. The settlement, which still must be approved by a federal judge, follows a two-year government investigation into allegations that the firms conspired to cheat customers by creating artificially wide margins between the bid and asked price for Nasdaq stocks. Government officials said that this practice cost the investing public millions of dollars. The two dozen firms__including <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a>, Smith Barney, Dean Witter, Salomon Brothers, <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>, and Goldman, Sachs__did not admit any wrongdoing as part of the settlement. The settlement prohibits the firms from engaging in further collusion and provides for greater oversight, including requiring firms to monitor and tape-record communications with their Nasdaq traders and submit quarterly compliance reports to the Justice Department. Separately, The Wall Street Journal reported that Justice Department documents demonstrate that the National Association of Securities Dealers, the self-regulatory organization that oversees the Nasdaq market, knew about the anticompetitive practices associated with trading spreads as early as 1990.<p>A study by Prophet Market Research & Consulting of San Francisco has found that stockbrokers often dispense specific investment advice with little or no basic knowledge of a customer's individual needs. Prophet used 93 "mystery shoppers" who presented themselves as first-time investors to 21 brokerage firms. Prophet said that many of the brokers who dealt with its shoppers failed to inquire about even such basic matters as the income level or tax bracket of the customer. More than a quarter of the brokers provided investment advice without asking about a customer's investment history or willingness to tolerate risk, the study reports.<p>The Securities and Exchange Commission may require mutual-fund companies to provide customers with graphics that illustrate the risks associated with investing in specific funds. The SEC said that it is currently reviewing comments from fund companies about the concept and will disclose further details in the coming months.<p>Prudential Insurance Co. of America has reached an agreement with state insurance regulators under which it will pay a $35 million fine, create a program to provide as much as $1.2 billion in restitution to millions of policyholders, and further reform its own sales practices. The agreement results from a lengthy investigation by 30 states that followed widespread complaints that Prudential agents had misled customers about the cost of 
insurance policies.<p>The National Association of Securities Dealers has said that it is investigating a number of stockbrokers after uncovering evidence of pervasive cheating on licensing exams. Among other things, the NASD reported that it has learned that dozens of brokers may have used proxies (in one case for a $2,500 fee) to take the exams on their behalf.<p><p><p>

Money, Money, Money<p>By Todd G. Buchholz<p>"A specter is haunting Europe -- the specter of Communism." So Marx and Engels began The Communist Manifesto in 1848. Today a new specter looms before continental capitalists. Plans for a single European currency -- a major part of the European Monetary Union -- are moving forward, and the next few months may determine whether deutsche marks, francs, and lire disappear in favor of "Euros." <p>Those supporting union point to the time and money wasted on exchanging money and doing business in different currencies. If, for example, you visit Europe with $100 in cash, convert your currency, and cross, say, eight national borders, you'll exhaust half your $100 just on conversion commissions. Transcontinental companies incur additional costs from hedging against currency fluctuations.<p>Pro-unionists also argue that, by tying their monetary policies to a single European Central Bank dominated by the German Bundesbank, countries like Italy and Spain will no longer be able to unilaterally adopt inflationary measures, so investors will buy their bonds at lower interest rates. Yield spreads have already begun to narrow between Germany's bonds and those of its neighbors. From January 3 to June 20, the interest-rate differential between Spanish and German bonds narrowed from 3.57 percent to 2.4 percent; the squeeze in Italy was even more impressive, from 4.75 percent to 2.87. This suggests that the market is starting to take EMU seriously, though other factors were also at work, including the election of market-friendly prime ministers in Spain and Italy.<p>Still, most British and American economists think EMU is a mistake. A single currency managed by the ECB will make it almost impossible to deal with the varying economic and political pressures faced by each member country. For example, if bumper harvests depress farm incomes in southern Europe at the same time the ECB is running a tight monetary policy to control wage inflation in northern Europe, the result could be a depression in Club Med (Italy, Spain, and Greece). <p>Euro enthusiasts like to call EMU a "United States of Europe" and argue that if California doesn't have its own currency why should France? The difference is that U.S. workers are mobile, moving from region to region as job markets shift. Can you imagine Germans giving up their citizenship to go to Ireland? In fact, EMU could aid xenophobic (some would say fascist) politicians who oppose immigration.<p>All of this will come to a head this fall. The charter for EMU, called the Maastricht Treaty, requires that countries reduce their budget deficits to 3 percent of gross domestic product; so far only Denmark, Ireland, and Luxembourg pass this test. Most others fall somewhere between Germany (4.1 percent) and Italy (6.4 percent). France (at about 4.4 percent) must put on paper a program to cut the budget. Since its economy is stagnant and tax revenues are lagging government estimates, Prime Minister Alain Jupp may have a terrible time making ends meet if he still plans to hit the EMU target. <p>Will Germans surrender their monetary sovereignty if the French make only a halfhearted effort to meet the Maastricht Treaty? I doubt it. So Jupp's budget cuts may be severe. The French bond and stock markets will likely get hammered this fall. And if the French get hit, you can bet that the rest of non-German Europe will, too.

						By Jim Jubak<p>The bond market continues to put its faith in Alan Greenspan. With stronger than expected job growth raising fears of wage-driven inflation, interest rates inched upward from 6.91 percent on July 1 to 7.19 on July 8. But then the tide ebbed__rates fell back to 6.92 by July 18.<p>That day, in testimony to Congress, the Federal Reserve chairman stressed his pleasure at the current combination of moderate growth and quiescent inflation; at an annual rate of 2.8 percent for the first six months of the year, inflation was about a half point lower than in the first half of 1995. Greenspan seemed to indicate that the Fed would not raise rates before its August 20 meeting__and that any rise at that time was likely to be moderate. Or so the market concluded.<p>Which may be setting up an unpleasant surprise. The gap between the yields on three-month and two-year Treasury bills widens when inflation seems a danger, because investors demand to be compensated for the risk that inflation will erode their capital. But on July 18, the difference was a narrow 89 basis points. If investors even suspect that the Fed is relaxing in the fight against inflation, they'll demand a much bigger premium on the two-year bills. And that will send the price of those and longer bonds down.<p><p><p>

						DAVID DREMAN believes in value --  he won't have anything to do with an "Internet company trading primarily on dreams." That approach helped drive year-to-date returns at his $126 million Kemper Dreman Small Cap Fund to 13 percent through July 17 and allowed the fund to outpace the Russell 2000 small-cap index by 15.2 percentage points in 1995. His studies have shown that value small caps outperform concept stocks over time. Dreman concentrates on small-company stocks (market capitalizations below $1 billion) with low p/e's relative to the market, rising dividends, and a solid financial history. He looks to hold on to stocks for one to three years. For example, the tiny stock of <a name="NASD:PRXM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15960"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Proxima</b></a>, a manufacturer of desktop projectors for computers, should benefit from the introduction of a new product that beats the competition.

But thanks to the fund's recent success in picking stocks to short, 1996 has been very different -- through July 17, the fund had returned 31.4 percent versus the S&P's 3 percent. Buettner seeks stocks of companies with deteriorating balance sheets -- growing inventories, climbing accounts receivable, and high or increasing debt loads are three key indicators -- to short with a 9- to 12-month time horizon. When disappointing earnings further fuel short-term declines, he knows he's got a winner.

THE PRUDENT SPECULATOR
Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.
<a name="NASD:COHU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11828"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>COHU</b></a>  UP TO $28  Nasdaq: COHU
Cohu (San Diego) is one of the world's largest makers of equipment for semiconductor testing, and it also manufactures closed-circuit-television, metal-detection, and microwave equipment. Earnings have increased every year for the past five years, from 32 cents a share in 1991 to $2.46 a share in 1995. Trading at less than nine times 1996 estimated earnings of $3 a share, this value-priced growth stock has a 33 percent return on equity and no long-term debt. The stock came down with the semiconductor group earlier this year and then didn't participate in the April rally, though earnings have stayed strong. I expect the stock to hit $55 a share in three to five years.<p>JIM McCAMANT
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER
Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.
<a name="NASD:TCEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14866"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T CELL SCIENCES</b></a>  UP TO $5   Nasdaq: TCEL
T Cell Sciences (Needham, Massachusetts) is one of the few remaining biotech bargains. The company's lead therapeutic product, TP 10, prevents the complement system (part of the immune system) from triggering excessive inflammation in response to foreign material. Phase-two trials are underway for the use of TP 10 to treat adult-respiratory-distress syndrome and should begin soon for its use in treating cardiac reperfusion (a reaction that occurs when blood is reintroduced to the heart after the heart has been shut off). Announcements of trial results and a large corporate partnership later this year should help move the stock toward my target of $10 a share.<p>MICHAEL MURPHY
CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER
Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.
<a name="NASD:COCN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15964"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>COCENSYS</b></a>   UP TO $11   Nasdaq: COCN
Biopharmaceutical company CoCensys (Irvine, California) has recently patented two compounds for the treatment of neurological and psychiatric disorders of the central nervous system. The more promising of the two -- CCD 1042 -- is an anti-convulsant designed to prevent episodes of epilepsy. Phase-two trials in France, for children, have moved from the hospital to the home, a sign that they're going well. I anticipate that the full results, to be announced this fall, will be sufficiently positive to merit adult trials. Cash flow is good, and the company, which has already spent roughly $40 million in R&D, plans to devote at least $12 million annually in the future.<p>LOUIS NAVELLIER
MPT REVIEW
Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks.
<a name="NASD:OLGC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15951"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ORTHOLOGIC</b></a>   UP TO $30   Nasdaq: OLGC
OrthoLogic (Phoenix) makes a lot of sense. This is a great niche company -- it develops non-invasive devices that use magnetic-field technology to help bones heal faster than with traditional methods -- and has a relatively small market capitalization of $480 million. The company's earnings are phenomenal, and the stock is taking off. 
In the first quarter of 1996, both sales and earnings were 170 percent higher than in the same period a year earlier. Over the past three months, analysts have raised their earnings estimates by 33 percent. The stock has a high alpha (15.38) and a low beta (0.67), signaling that it is not closely correlated with the overall market.<p><p><p>

						By John Fried<p>>THE TREASURY DEPARTMENT plans to begin selling a new class of bonds that will offer returns indexed to inflation. These inflation-adjusted bonds, which could be sold as early as the end of this year, will offer holders lower up-front yields but also a guaranteed upward adjustment should inflation begin to rise over the life of the security. The Treasury said many details of the plan have yet to be resolved, including what measure of inflation to use. But the department said it expects that the new bonds will allow the government to raise money at a lower cost, while providing fixed-income investors protection against the biggest threat to their portfolios__the erosion associated with inflation.<p>><a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MERRILL LYNCH</b></a> has told the securities and Exchange Commission that it is reviewing its practice of paying hefty sign-on bonuses to brokers hired from rival firms. Regulators have raised questions about the bonuses, saying they could create conflicts for clients. Merrill Lynch told The Wall Street Journal that it doesn't agree with the SEC's concern but would nevertheless consider altering its policy to eliminate even the appearance of a conflict.<p>>SMITH BARNEY will soon allow its customers to take Smith Barney mutual funds with them when they switch to another brokerage. PaineWebber and Prudential Securities also plan to permit a form of portability__one that involves only these two firms. Currently, most full-service brokerages require customers to liquidate their mutual-fund accounts__often at a steep price__when they transfer their business to another firm.<p>>The American Medical Association has begun urging investors to sell shares of any mutual fund that invests in tobacco stocks. The group said it will publish an annual list of the funds that hold shares in tobacco companies. According to the AMA, 1,474 mutual funds currently hold the stocks or bonds of 13 tobacco companies. The AMA also said it would help draw public attention to funds that shed such stocks.<p>>A study prepared for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has found that banks often fail to tell their customers that mutual-fund investments aren't federally insured. The study reports that, when professional evaluators telephoned 1,200 banks asking for information about investing in mutual funds, only 45 percent of the callers were alerted about the lack of federal insurance__a warning required by government bank regulators. A separate survey, prepared by Prophet Market Research &Consulting of San Francisco, discovered that Union Bank of California was the best at complying with federal disclosure requirements, while Comerica was the worst.<p>>NASD Regulation, the new regulatory and enforcement unit of the National Association of Securities Dealers, has said that it will hire 131 employees this year, raising its total number of regulatory officials to approximately 1,600. The NASDR also said that it will be restructured into seven divisions, one of which will be a unit dedicated to national enforcement.<p><p><p>

						Will a new manager change Magellan, or will the fund change him?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Jeffrey Vinik's May 23 resignation from the helm of the <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Magellan Fund</b></a> gives rise to two questions: What's the outlook for Magellan, the world's largest mutual fund? And what's the outlook for mutual funds now that they've become such a mainstay for investors?<p>The answer to the first question is of obvious interest to the folks with $57 billion on the line at Magellan. The fund's new manager, Robert Stansky, comes aboard from the $8.5 billion <a name="FUND:FDGRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FDGRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Growth Company Fund</b></a>, where he built a solid track record__an annualized total return of 17.44 percent for the five years ended April 30, 1996, compared with 16.50 percent for Magellan. Stansky, 40, put in three years as a research associate at Magellan back when Peter Lynch ran the fund.<p>If Stansky's record is an accurate indicator of how he'll approach his new job, investors can expect a more cautious Magellan__one that behaves much more like a traditional large-cap growth fund. Stansky's former portfolio was full of traditional growth issues such as <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett- Packard</b></a>. Fidelity Growth Company has done well in years when growth investing has prospered: In 1995, for example, it beat the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index by 2.08 percentage points. It has lagged when the market has been hostile to growth stocks, such as in 1994, when the fund trailed the S&P by 3.54 percentage points.<p>It's also quite possible that investors will see a new, more freewheeling Bob Stansky at Magellan. Fidelity has always viewed its flagship as an aggressive fund, and there is no indication Fidelity has shifted its thinking even a bit.<p>Vinik's departure was his own idea. He was under no pressure from Fidelity to quit. Although there was concern within the company about the fund's recent performance, no one in a position of authority was calling for Vinik's scalp. "If there was any pressure on Jeff, it was either self-imposed or it came from places outside Fidelity, such as the media," says a top Fidelity executive.<p>To assume that Magellan will change now that Vinik has left is to ignore the fund's history__under Vinik and his predecessors. It is also to ignore the powerful incentive any new manager will feel to use the fund's market clout and its unique role at Fidelity to attempt to score hefty gains for investors.<p>Vinik's big bet on technology stocks in mid-1995 was widely misinterpreted as an admission that Magellan had grown too large to continue as a stock-picking fund. Vinik, the theory went, had decided the only way to make a big score was to take risky sector bets.
This view gained credence when Vinik reduced Magellan's technology holdings from about 44 percent of the portfolio to just 4 percent at the end of 1995 and put the cash he raised into bonds instead.<p>The problem with this line of reasoning is that Vinik hadn't really done anything new at all. Like other managers at Fidelity (including Lynch), he had always made big sector bets, relying in part on the strong research and analysis that Fidelity churns out for its portfolio bosses. That approach was in place from the day Vinik took over the fund from Morris Smith in July 1992. He immediately cut Magellan's exposure__radically__to the consumer-company stocks Lynch and Smith had emphasized. <p>Vinik's aggressive style frequently paid off. For example, he sold much of his position in <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> prior to the meltdown in tobacco stocks known as Marlboro Friday. He built his big position in technology stocks when they were out of favor. True, his latest move into bonds has been less successful. Then again, he hasn't been proved wrong, either.<p>It remains to be seen if Bob Stansky will stick with the style he has used at past funds or will run Magellan like it has always been run. There is pressure to become more conservative. In a world increasingly dominated by the administrators in charge of 401(k) plans, many of the big mutual-fund companies are moving away from a star system of managers, because they know that competing for 401(k) dollars means offering pre-dictable commodity funds__funds that fill a defined slot in a marketing plan and never deviate from their objective. <p>At the same time, a more cautious approach isn't likely to produce the sort of investment gains Magellan shareholders have come to expect over the years. In Magellan's case, predictability has always meant unpredictability__ at least in the short run. Magellan's zigs and zags (hardly the sign of the cumbersome portfolio some critics suggest the fund has become) have been the reason it has been able to beat the market.<p>A newly conservative Magellan might make the new forces dominating the fund industry more comfortable with the fund, but it wouldn't necessarily be the best thing for Magellan's shareholders. Magellan's character under its new manager will tell investors whether there's still room for strong individual managers with unique styles at the biggest fund families.<p><p><p>

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which he considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after May 24, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends they conduct their own due diligence.<p>PRESTON ATHEY
<a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. ROWE PRICE SMALL CAP VALUE</b></a>
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.
<a name="NASD:TBCC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14868"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TBC</b></a> UP TO $10 Nasdaq: TBCC
The wheels are turning at TBC (Memphis), the country's largest distributor of private-brand replacement tires for cars and light trucks. (The best-known name among the company's many brands is Cooper.) Since TBC's long string of sales and earnings increases ended in 1992, the stock has fallen from $18 a share to less than $7, despite the appointment of a new CEO and a company buyback of 20 percent of its stock. I expect a recently proposed acquisition and a rebound in tire demand to drive 1996 earnings up 15 percent, to 72 cents a share. TBC is poised for two years of above-average growth, and that makes the stock look cheap.<p>JAMES P. CRAIG
<a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>JANUS FUND</b></a>

<a name="NYSE:WFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>WELLS FARGO</b></a> UP TO $260 NYSE: WFC
Since I recommended it last month, banking giant Wells Fargo (San Francisco) has seen its stock come down on fears of higher interest rates. But higher rates can have a positive effect -- the profitability of Wells Fargo's basic business (lending) increases as the yield curve steepens. In addition, a strengthening economy makes credit delinquency less likely. Down roughly 10 percent from its 12-month high of $268 a share, the stock looks even cheaper now than before. The company has also begun its share-repurchase program, and everything else is in place for long-term growth. My target for the stock is still about $320, a gain from here of more than 30 percent.<p>SHELBY M. C. DAVIS
<a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NEW YORK VENTURE FUND</b></a>

<a name="NYSE:MCD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10974"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>McDONALD'S</b></a> UP TO $48 NYSE: MCD
McDonald's (Oak Brook, Illinois) stock is a value meal in itself. The company derives 54 percent of its earnings from overseas stores. As this trend increases, higher profit margins and return on equity abroad should drive up the stock's price-to-earnings multiple. At home, the company is opening satellite units in high-traffic areas like gas stations (Amoco and Chevron) and retail stores (<a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a>). The growth story is pretty simple: McDonald's currently has almost 19,000 stores and could easily have 30,000 by the year 2000. I expect the stock price to mirror the 15 to 20 percent annual earnings growth of the company.<p>DANIEL B. LEONARD

International Game Technology (Reno, Nevada) is a good bet. In addition to being the world's largest manufacturer of traditional slot machines and gaming software, IGT produces wide-area networks that allow slot players in several locations to compete for common jackpots (this setup is known as a progressive system). Though the U.S. gaming market is slowing, the rest of the world, especially South America and the former Soviet Union, will take up the slack and then some. Given IGT's projected annual earnings growth of 20 percent, the stock is a good value at about 15 times estimated fiscal 1997 earnings of $1.05 a share. My target for the stock is $22 a share within a year.<p>WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ

Clayton Williams (Midland, Texas) is a leader in horizontal drilling for oil and gas. After two difficult years, the company has restructured, and the founder has taken back the reins. The first quarter of 1996 was profitable (versus a loss a year ago), and I estimate earnings will be 40 cents a share this year. The stock sells at only 1.7 times 1996 estimated cash flow of $4 a share and slightly less than its replacement value (the value of the reserves in the ground) of $8 a share. A great kicker: The company owns a lot of acreage in a hot new field in East Texas called the Cotton Valley Pinnacle Reef Play, where a competitor has made a substantial discovery.<p>ERIC E. RYBACK

Nuveen (Chicago) is a large underwriter of closed-end municipal-bond funds and a manager of tax-free investments. It has more than $25 billion in closed-end funds (out of $32 billion under management), money that can't be withdrawn by redemption. In addition, roughly 80 percent of Nuveen's revenues come from investment-advisory fees. The company has a new CEO, who plans to broaden Nuveen's offerings to include equity and non-municipal bond funds, and to look for ways to enhance shareholder value, including stock buybacks. I believe the stock, which has lagged on the fear that tax reform will hurt muni bonds, is worth over $40 a share.<p>RALPH WANGER

Texas Regional Bancshares (McAllen, Texas) is the largest bank in the Rio Grande Valley, where the economy is benefiting from NAFTA trade, tourism, and immigration (the valley's population is expected to grow 16 percent by the year 2000). In the face of last year's peso plunge and Mexican recession, TRB's loans increased 20 percent while nonperforming assets fell to only 0.8 percent of loans. Acquisitions of neighboring banks in May 1996 doubled TRB's asset size and increased the company's estimated 1997 earnings by 50 percent. TRB, which is probably worth $30 a share to a buyer today, will likely be worth $50 a share after a few years of growth.<p>DONALD A. YACKTMAN

Torchmark (Birmingham, Alabama) is a holding company with mostly insurance-related subsidiaries. It has considered spinning off its three major areas of business -- direct life insurance, specialty insurance, and money management (it owns the mutual-fund company Waddell & Reed) -- but might not do so because of legal complications. At roughly ten times 1996 estimated earnings of $4.30 a share, Torchmark's stock is cheap and has a solid growth rate and an excellent long-term record. The stock is trading in the middle of its 12-month price range but is worth a lot more: Its private-market value is at least $65 a share.<p><p><p>

						By Clint Willis<p>The bond market continues to reflect professional traders' uncertainty over the direction of the economy and inflation. Individual investors should watch to see if events confirm one direction or another, but shouldn't make big bets now. In early May, inflation fears sparked by delays in balancing the budget and signs of renewed economic growth sent yields on the 30-year Treasury to over 7 percent. Then, in mid-May, reports suggested consumer spending was slackening, reviving hopes that inflation and interest rates would stay low. Long-term Treasury yields subsequently eased to 6.8 percent. The future isn't any more certain. "Consumers are in a lot better shape than people think," says William Dudley, director of U.S. economic research for Goldman, Sachs, who figures the Federal Reserve will raise rates in August. On the other hand, Zane Brown, director of fixed-income investing at Lord Abbett, remains optimistic: Signs of weakness (such as declines in home sales and strong overseas demand for Treasurys) should prop up bond prices. The bond market has already discounted a Clinton victory, he adds. "Any change in that outlook would likely cause yields to decline by reviving hopes for progress toward a modified balanced budget." <p><p>

in Baltimore, has done better than most short-sellers during this market rally. The shorts recommended in his five-year-old investment newsletter, Shortex, returned 26.5 percent in 1995. (The $50 million he manages in accounts that invest both long and short earned 56.54 percent in 1995.) To find stocks to short, Parnes looks for heavy selling on falling stock prices and such deteriorating fundamentals as declining earnings and revenues. The stock of oil refiner <a name="NYSE:ASH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10135"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ashland</b></a> rose 34 percent in the past six months, but Parnes believes the run-up in oil prices is temporary, and big investors have been selling. Declining orders and profit margins at integrated-circuit maker <a name="NASD:LLTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13973"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Linear Technology</b></a> will continue to drive the stock's price down. The stock price of tobacco giant <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> retreated 15 percent in one month on heavy selling; Parnes thinks the company faces substantial legal and regulatory threats. Perennial laggard <a name="NYSE:ZE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11660"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Zenith Electronics</b></a> moved higher when investors learned of its plan to make modems that would connect TVs to the Internet over cable systems. But, says Parnes, the company has never made money, and its new product will face stiff competition. <p>

						ED KEELY, manager of the $839 million large-cap <a name="FUND:FRGRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FRGRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Founders Growth Fund</b></a>, returned 45.6 percent for 1995 and 15.3 percent for 1996 as of May 17. He looks for companies that can consistently beat analysts' estimates and that can increase earnings by 20 percent in the next 12 months. Since valuations are high, he's scooping up firms that have temporarily stumbled. For instance, <a name="NYSE:CCK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Crown Cork & Seal</b></a>, the world's largest packager and can maker, took a hit from rising aluminum prices last year, but earnings should improve because of falling metal prices and the acquisition of European can company Carnaud MetalBox. <a name="NYSE:GIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15718"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Instrument</b></a>'s stock fell when the company missed deadlines for bringing digital TV-set-top boxes to market. But this fall, volume shipping of the devices, which will provide more channels and access to the Internet, should lead to 18 percent growth. The stock of <a name="NASD:NELL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14223"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nellcor Puritan Bennett</b></a>, a provider of equipment and therapy to treat respiratory illness, tumbled because a new in-house sales force wasn't yet up to speed, but Keely thinks earnings growth will rebound to 20 percent. Internet hub maker <a name="NYSE:CS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10276"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cabletron Systems</b></a> is entering the hot market for switches--earnings could increase by 30 percent in the next eight months.<p>Cabletron Systems

						Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after April 22, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these eight managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends that they conduct their own due diligence.<p>PRESTON ATHEY
<a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. ROWE PRICE SMALL CAP VALUE</b></a><p>Invests in value stocks 
with market capitalizations under $250 million.
HANCOCK FABRICS  UP TO $13  NYSE: HKF<p><a name="NYSE:HKF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10699"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hancock Fabrics</b></a> (Tupelo, Mississippi) sells fabric, notions, and craft supplies for the home-sewing and home-decoration markets through 500 stores in 33 states under the names Hancock Fabrics, Minnesota Fabrics, and Fabric Warehouse. The company has suffered through a five-year industry recession caused by overexpansion and heavy competition, but its recent results suggest that a turnaround is at hand. The stock sells at 20 times a depressed 1996 earnings estimate of 50 cents a share but at less than 8 times the $1.25 a share I think it can earn when margins recover to normal levels. Meanwhile, a 3 percent yield pays investors to wait.<p>JAMES P. CRAIG
<a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a><p>Invests primarily in large growth companies with 
the idea of preserving capital over the long term.
WELLS FARGO  UP TO $265  NYSE: WFC<p>Banking giant <a name="NYSE:WFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wells Fargo</b></a>(San Francisco) has been successful at boosting its revenues by aggressively going after small business loans. In addition, cost savings from the recent merger with Los Angelesbased First Interstate Bancorp are turning out to be greater than expected. Within the next year, Wells Fargo should also get back to its pre-merger level of return on equity (20 percent) and resume its high rate of share buybacks (10 percent a year). I think the stock will trade within the next 12 months at 11 times 1998 cash earnings (before accounting for goodwill) of $29 a share. At this valuation, the stock would reach $319 a share, a return of roughly 30 percent.<p>SHELBY M. C. DAVIS
<a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a><p>Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.
GENERAL RE  UP TO $148  NYSE: GRN
<a name="NYSE:GRN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10643"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Re</b></a> (Stamford, Connecticut), a world leader in reinsurance, has made a home-run cash acquisition of German-based Cologne Re. The deal increases its percentage of international premiums (a higher growth area than domestic premiums) to over 40 percent of total premiums. I also think American-style reinsurance products are about to gain favor in Europe. General Re, a AAA-rated company, is accounting for the deal conservatively. Now that the company is a true multinational, its price-to-earnings ratio should rise from 12 to 15, giving the stock an 18-month target price of about $180 a share on estimated 1997 earnings of $12 a share.<p>DANIEL B. LEONARD
<a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology</b></a><p>Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.
GLOBAL MARINE  up to $12.50  NYSE: GLM<p><a name="NYSE:GLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10662"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Global Marine</b></a> (Houston) is an offshore oil-and-gas drilling company whose operations are focused primarily in the Gulf of Mexico. This has been a good stock, but I think it can do even better in the future. Natural-gas prices, which have risen substantially and should stay at high levels for at least the next year, are leading to a big pickup in drilling. The resulting high utilization of rigs and higher oil and gas prices will benefit Global Marine greatly. I expect the company, which made 23 cents a share last year, to earn 40 cents a share in 1996 and 70 cents a share in 1997. The stock should hit $16 by the end of this year, a gain of roughly 45 percent from current levels.<p>WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ

CROWN BOOKS  up to $10  Nasdaq: CRWN<p><a name="NASD:CRWN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13140"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Crown Books</b></a> (Landover, Maryland) has 178 stores in Washington, D.C., Houston, Chicago, Seattle, and California, 84 of which are SuperCrown warehouse stores. I like the company because of the low price relative to its strong balance sheet: $9 a share in cash, a book value of $16 a share, and almost no long-term debt. Superstores (the most successful format) are increasing as a percentage of total stores, and the new management is impressive. A couple problems: The stock is thinly traded (the Dart Group owns 51 percent), and Barnes & Noble is a tough competitor. Patient investors can buy the stock at about eight times estimated 1996 earnings of $1 to $1.10 a share.<p>ERIC E. RYBACK

URANIUM RESOURCES  UP TO $17  Nasdaq: URIX<p><a name="NASD:URIX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17101"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Uranium Resources</b></a> (Dallas), the lowest-cost uranium producer in North America and my pick last November, recently announced the start-up of operations on its Kingsville Dome property. This should help the company produce a total of two million pounds of uranium (U-308) in 1996. Industry analysts expect the uranium spot price, which has risen from $11.75 a pound in June 1995 to a recent price of $15.90, to hit $20 by the end of 1996. Because of the current price of U-308, the company's uranium reserves, and the company's anticipated development of the Churchrock deposit in New Mexico, I think Uranium Resources is worth $25 a share.<p>RALPH WANGER

While broadening its product line to include high-end network versions as well as low-cost models for small businesses, Kronos is also enhancing its software: Its most advanced products now handle payroll data, employee scheduling, and legal compliance. Profit margins are rising. Sales (up 110 percent over the past three years) should hit $145 million in fiscal 1996.

The company faces very little competition within its focus markets. Sales are up tenfold over the past five years, though the stock is down from a high of $48 because of flat sales in the fourth quarter of 1995.

						Why last year's cheerleaders are now so eager to accentuate the negative<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Suddenly wall street is afraid of the future. To understand how spooked professional investors are, look no further than what happened to <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a> on April 17.<p>The company announced earnings of $2.48 a share (excluding one-time charges) for the first three months of 1996, surpassing analysts' forecasts of $2.41 a share. The stock began to move up, climbing $5 to nearly $120 in early trading. But even as the stock was climbing, IBM's chief financial officer, G. Richard Thoman, was meeting with analysts. A stronger dollar and tighter profit margins could affect IBM's earnings in the coming quarter, Thoman said. The stock stumbled, closing the day at $105.25.<p>After months of refusing to worry about anything, Wall Street now sees monsters under every bed and disaster in every quarterly report. <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, for example, reported first-quarter earnings of 57 cents a share, a penny less than analysts were expecting. The stock immediately fell two dollars -- it was time, apparently, to start worrying that the stronger dollar would cut profits at multinationals.<p>Even companies with great stories are doing their best to emphasize the negative. <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> reported earnings of 88 cents a share for the quarter ending March 31, an increase of 42 percent over the comparable quarter of 1995, but the company's chief financial officer felt compelled to pour cold water on the market. "My estimation is earnings next quarter will be down a bit," he said.<p>What's behind all this self-conscious negativity? Wall Street and company executives know that growth in corporate profits is slowing, but nobody is sure by how much. Worse yet, the modest growth rate in profits in the first quarter of 1996 is being compared with the explosive growth in the first quarter of 1995. No one wants to get caught being a Pollyanna when earnings fall short. So Wall Street is engaged in one of its least favorite activities: downsizing expectations.<p>Here are the brutal facts that have put analysts on the spot. According to Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities, analysts are projecting growth in operating profits of just 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 1996. That's down from 15.2 percent growth in the fourth quarter of 1995 and, worst of all, way below the 23.3 percent growth in the first quarter of 1995. At 7.8 percent, growth would be the slowest since the fourth quarter of 1991.<p>In March, reports Brown, analysts trimmed their estimates 
of annual earnings for the large-capitalization companies she follows by an average of about 1 percent. But that average conceals some abrupt changes in opinion. Last year, for example, profits in many of the so-called basic industries -- chemicals, steel, paper, and trucking -- grew by more than 100 percent. Analysts now expect this sector to show a first-quarter decline in earnings of 4.9 percent. Analysts have lowered their earnings estimates for the year by 5 percent or more for almost 18 percent of the companies in this sector.<p>The consumer-cyclical sector -- the automobile, home-building, tool, and appliance companies that use the materials produced by basic industry -- is facing an even tougher first quarter, 
according to analysts, with profits set to drop by almost 22 percent. Technology companies are expected to post a modest increase in first-quarter sales, but this sector shows a huge decline in 
expectations: Earnings projections for the year have been lowered by 5 percent or more on a full 15 percent of the 201 companies Brown tracks in this sector. Only in the case of energy companies have analysts raised their estimates more frequently than they've lowered them.<p>Earnings uncertainty creates its own logic. Investors need to understand that the same dynamics that lead analysts to excess on the upside also lead them to overreaction on the downside. Just as analysts wind up competing to see how fast they can raise projections when their clients want to buy, buy, buy, so too they compete to cut estimates when the mood sours. It's no fun to be accused of leaving a client exposed to losses because of estimates that are overly optimistic.<p>In this market, investors have to do more than calculate what they believe a company will earn; they must also track the winds of expectation that blow down Wall Street. There's a lesson in the recent case of Motorola.<p>In January, the company announced earnings of just 72 cents a share for the fourth quarter of 1995, far below both the 99 cents a share analysts had expected and the 86 cents a share the company had earned in the fourth quarter of 1994. Analysts felt burned, and they reacted by cutting their ratings on the stock and their estimates for first-quarter 1996 earnings. A company that had earned 61 cents in the first quarter of 1995 would earn just 50 cents a share in the first quarter of 1996, they said.<p>So when <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> reported 63 cents a share for the quarter, it was not a disappointing performance from a company with a five-year annual growth rate of 25.3 percent but, instead, surprisingly good news. The stock rallied to nearly $60 on April 19. Fear, it seems, can be just as easily overdone as enthusiasm.<p><p><p><p>

						By John Fried<p>President Clinton has presented Congress with a series of proposals aimed at overhauling retirement plans to make it easier for people to save for the future. The president's Retirement Savings and Security Act would, among other things, allow more middle-income families to deduct contributions to IRAs and would permit IRA holders to withdraw money without penalty during a period of extended unemployment or for first-home purchases, major medical expenses, or education. The plan would also create something called 
a National Employee Savings Trust, or NEST -- a type of 401(k) plan that would allow the employees of small businesses to shelter up to $5,000 a year in tax-free savings. Other measures would make it easier for workers to transfer their retirement plans from one employer to another and encourage employers to lift certain vesting requirements. The act reflects recommendations that have been coming from the private sector for some time. Critics have said the act benefits highly paid workers most, because it relaxes limits on how much such employees can set aside in their 401(k) plans and alters Section 415(e) restrictions on the total retirement benefits such people can receive each year. Some high earners could haul in as much as $100,000 a year extra in tax-free contributions and accruals under the Clinton plan.<p>A group of top mutual-fund executives has expressed concern about the risks associated with the torrent of money pouring into stock funds. The executives, speaking during a panel discussion in New York sponsored by the Mutual Fund Forum, said they are increasingly using bulletins and other forms of communication to warn shareholders against excessively high hopes about the market. Given the long run-up in the market, "we are starting from euphoria," Charles T. Bauer, chief executive of AIM Management Group, told the gathering. "So what happens in the future we have to be careful of." Bauer noted that AIM recently reopened and then closed an aggressive-growth fund because it attracted $1 billion in two days.<p>Morningstar is considering issuing its popular star ratings based on one-year performance figures, in addition to three-, five-, and ten-year numbers. The firm historically has opposed awarding stars for one-year figures, and Morningstar president Don Phillips says he's still against the idea on the grounds that such a short-term horizon is a misleading indicator of performance. If published, one-year ratings would not be factored into Morningstar's overall ratings. The National Association of Securities Dealers has been pressuring Morningstar to add the one-year ratings to make it easier for fund companies to comply with NASD marketing guidelines.<p>Citibank, <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a>, MasterCard, and Visa have announced 
a plan to test-market so-called smart cards -- plastic that can be loaded with electronic cash -- in New York City before the end of the year. Customers will be able to transfer up to $100 to their cards at ATMs. The 500 merchants participating in the test will use special electronic readers to deduct the electronic cash for the amount of each purchase. <p><p>

						By Clint Willis<p>The pros draw a bead on the direction of interest rates by checking the yield on Eurodollar futures contracts at the International Monetary Market in Chicago. These contracts are agreements to buy U.S. dollars held in European banks at a fixed price in the future. The 
yield (listed in The Wall Street Journal's "Money & Investing" section under "Futures Prices") on an EFC for a given month in the future reflects what the market thinks the three-month London Interbank Offered Rate will be at that time. (LIBOR is the interest rate banks pay on dollar deposits in London.) Right now the futures are predicting rising rates. For example, on April 19, the yield on the September contract was 5.65 percent, well above the current three-month LIBOR of 5.5 percent. (LIBOR rates appear in the Journal under "Money Rates.") The price on the March 1997 contract suggests a 6.15 percent LIBOR rate__bad news for home buyers but maybe not for bonds. Higher rates are now built into Wall Street's assumptions, so the bond market is likely to shrug off bad news. Good news could even trigger a rebound. "The market is a lot less dangerous now than it was in February, when everyone was counting on lower rates," says John Burgess of Bankers Trust Global Investment Management.<p><p><p><p>

						10 Stocks to Avoid<p>WILL LYONS, a former banker, edits Short on Value, one of only three investment newsletters to focus on picking stocks to sell short. Each issue, Lyons advises his few thousand subscribers to bet against about 30 stocks that he believes are headed for a fall within the next 6 to 12 months because of weak profit margins, heavy debt, or strong competition. For example, shares of broadcaster <a name="NYSE:CCU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11824"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Clear Channel Communications</b></a> have soared since a new law allowed broadcast companies to own more stations. But Clear Channel's "ugly balance sheet," Lyons says, will make it more difficult for the company to fund its strategy of expanding by acquisition. <a name="NASD:EPIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42275"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Epic Design Technology</b></a>, which sells chip-making software, is valued at 50 times earnings but faces slowing growth in the semiconductor industry. <a name="NASD:INTS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14808"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Integrated Systems</b></a> hopes to provide computer software for machines designed to cost $300 to $500 and provide cheap access to the Internet. Internet mania has propelled the price-to-earnings ratio to 100 -- a lot to pay for a company with unproven technology and an uncertain market. Likewise, Lyons thinks <a name="NASD:IVIP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16579"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IVI Publishing</b></a>, which produces medical CD-ROMs, faces an already overcrowded market.<p>Company          Exchange/Ticker Symbol      Fair Value

10 Stocks to Consider<p>JOHN BALLEN'S <a name="FUND:MEGBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MEGBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MFS Emerging Growth Fund B</b></a> has ranked in the top 25 percent of small-cap growth funds for five of the past six years, returning a five-year annual average of 24.81 percent. Ballen looks for growth companies that can be major players in their industries in three to five years and buys them when their valuations are below the average for their sectors. For example, Ballen likes <a name="NASD:ADSK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Autodesk</b></a>, the premier maker of design software for engineers and architects, which took a temporary hit when new products were delayed.

Ballen is also buying companies with a future in the fast-growing client-server market, such as <a name="NASD:BMCS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12708"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BMC Software</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:CA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10383"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Computer Associates</b></a>.

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> LEGGO MY LAPTOP. Business travelers, mobile Internet addicts,and anyone else who totes a portable computer, beware. According to computer insurance agency Safeware, PC theft leaped 39 percent last year. "Insurance rates could increase 25 percent in 1997,"says Safeware CEO David Johnston. His advice? "Love your portable."Or someone else will.  <p> OUT OF FASHION. Kurt Salmon Associates reports that 55 percent of shoppers call the latest clothing styles "boring," and 88 percent opt for comfortable wear.     <p> PRIME TIME TO SHOP. Pack up the La-Z-Boy and head to the mall. The Food Court Entertainment Network could be coming to an enclosed shopping center near you, with televisions stationed in food courts broadcasting various programming, including news from CNN, children's shows, sporting events, and, yes, advertisements.  <p> IT AIN'T DISNEYLAND. It seems folks would rather play craps than meet Goofy. According to a nationwide poll of travel agents by Carlson Wagonlit Travel, casinos topped the list of preferred destinations among weekend travelers last summer. That could spell jackpot for New Horizon Kids Quest, a Minneapolis-based company that operates day-care centers at a number of  gambling resorts.  <p> FISCAL INSOMNIA. If you've been tossing and turning over that savings account, you're not alone. One-third of adult Americans lose sleep over money worries, reports the Lutheran Brotherhood.Lack of retirement savings keeps most of us counting sheep, with long-term health-care expenses and insurance angst trailing behind. <p>  <hr>  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> TREE LAWYER  <p> By Mark Ehrman  <p> Randall Stamen knows a lot about trees. And while he's not sure whether one that falls in the woods makes a sound, he can probably tell you if it will make a good lawsuit.   <p> That's because this 29-year-old Riverside, California, attorney and certified arborist deals exclusively in tree litigation --a, er, branch <p>that he calls "green-industry law."  <p> "I wanted to find my own niche," says the aptly named Stamen,who graduated from the University of San Diego School of Lawin 1992. As the son of an arborist, Stamen found litigating cases involving trees, landscaping, and pesticides "the natural thing" to do.   <p> Stamen's garden-variety cases, as it were, involve neighbor disputes. "Usually, they're cutting their neighbor's trees down or cutting the tops off or poisoning a tree to improve their view," he says. In such instances, should malice be proved, California law allows for triple damages.   <p> Trees can be expensive (music mogul David Geffen received $700,000 after a neighbor chopped down some of his), but many of Stamen's clients see their monetary value as secondary. "I felt like I  lost a friend," recalls Jeanne Moore, a former client. She sued her tree trimmer after an 85-year-old eucalyptus died within six months of pruning. Stamen proved that excessive spring pruning made the tree vulnerable to the long-horned borer beetle, turning a real-estate asset into deadwood. The accused arborist settled for a five-figure sum.  <p> Stamen says his expertise fills a need. "First of all, I can recognize that there is a lawsuit," he says. "People can't get anybody to represent them because the first thing an attorney will say is 'You have no lawsuit because it was an act of God,'or 'Go to small-claims court.'"  <p> Thus, after a tree limb fell on a man who was driving through Beverly Hills, Stamen sued the city, arguing that a practice called topping had increased the odds that the tree would drop a branch. In 1995, a judgment was rendered against the city for $36,000.  <p> For Stamen, it was a tough case to argue. "You have the problem that people don't take the tree cases as seriously as they would something else," he says.  <p> Still, after less than two years on his own, Stamen has opened a second office, in the more verdant Sacramento area. "Business has exceeded all my expectations," he says.  <p> Knock on wood. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> OVERTIME TROUBLE  <p> By Louis Jacobson  <p> The first law passed by the 104th Congress, the Congressional Accountability Act, requires lawmakers to abide by their own legislation, including the 57-year-old Fair Labor Standards Act, mandating overtime pay for those who work more than 40 hours a week.   <p> Congress, alas, is a deliberative body, not an efficient one-- long, uncompensated hours are the rule. With 38 percent of  representatives' aides and 47 percent of senators' aides eligible for overtime, according to a survey by the Congressional Management Foundation, Congress could owe millions in extra pay. Says CMF's Richard H. Shapiro, "They have to comply, but they have no additional funds." Business lobbyists love it. Congress, learning how the fair-labor act has burdened business, may at last reform it, says Jay Krupin of the Washington-based law firm David, Hagner, Kuney & Krupin.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> NO MORE RUNNING TO CATCH A PLANE  <p> By Peter Aronson  <p> You can't miss Jo Ann Ussery's home -- just look for the first fuselage on the left. Ussery had wanted to purchase a mobile home until her brother-in-law, an air-traffic controller, gave her a hot tip on a used 727 (well insulated, lots of space, plenty of light).  <p> Ussery, a Mississippi hair dresser, bought her house from the Memphis Group, an aircraft salvage company, which sold it to her for 15 cents a pound -- $2,000. Trucking the 127-foot-long fuselage about 60 miles cost another $4,000, and Ussery projects total costs (including a hot tub in the cockpit) to reach $30,000.  <p> The Memphis Group has sold two other fuselages as real estate: one became an office and the other a hunting cabin, says manager Richard Cordle. But since January, when a report about Ussery's house aired on public radio's Marketplace, inqueries have flooded in from people wanting to turn jets into houses, restaurants, and offices. As for Ussery, neighbors now treat her like a celebrity."I just luuv it," she drawls. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> MAKE MINE MESQUITE  <p> Kansas City Barbecue Society spokeswoman Carolyn Wells says that barbecue is "an exploding phenomenon -- not literally, we hope." With Memorial Day upon us, here are some easy-to-digest barbecue numbers: Men are 50 percent more likely to work the grill, but whether and what to barbecue are usually a woman's province (women also do the dishes 83 percent of the time). Over three-quarters of U.S. households own grills, which were fired up 2.6 billion times in 1995. Over half of backyard barbecues include music. Most popular tunes? Country and western. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> LICENSED TO DEAL  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> In 1983, the Arizona legislature, determined to do something about the state's drug trade, passed a drug tax law requiring a license for "sale of cannabis and controlled substances."  <p> No one actually expected drug dealers to purchase a license; the idea was that those convicted for selling illegal drugs could also be pursued for tax evasion.   <p> Then Peter Wilson, chairman of the Arizona chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML), went to the Arizona Department of Revenue and put down $100 for a one-year marijuana dealer's license, plus $17.50 for a sheet of 50 one-gram cannabis tax stamps (similar to the stamps on cigarette packs). <p> Next, the 38-year-old robotics engineer began selling marijuana, and on every bag, he slapped one of his duly purchased tax stamps. After Phoenix narcotics agents busted him on a felony possession charge, Wilson argued in court that the state itself had licensed his activities, which, on that account, could hardly be deemed criminal. The judge agreed and dismissed the charges against him.   <p> "Fair is fair," says Wilson. "I paid $100 for a license to sell pot. What else would I do with it? People know I'm still in business," he adds. Prosecutors, meanwhile, have filed an appeal with the state superior court.  <p> "I'm optimistic that the decision will remain," says Wilson's attorney, Michael Walz, who specializes in marijuana cases. <p>That would be good news to a lot of people, says Allen St. Pierre, NORML's deputy national director, "So many people, from lawyers to pimple-faced teenagers, called to ask, 'Should I be moving to Arizona tonight?'"  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> BIKING BANKER  <p> By Ken Kurson  <p> In 1990, Linda Jackson, a vice president at Alex. Brown & Sons, a San Francisco financial firm, injured her leg while skiing and turned to bicycling during her rehabilitation. She discovered that she was remarkably good at the sport, so remarkable that bike racing is now her full-time pursuit. Come July, Jackson will almost certainly be the only investment banker competing at the Atlanta games. <p>At 37, Jackson, a Canadian citizen, is old for a world-class athlete, but last year she won the Canadian nationals. She still sounds like an MBA, however. "Next year will be my last," she says. "I gave up a six-figure income, so the opportunity costs are pretty high." Jackson misses the perks of her old job: "I'd go to Paris [and] stay at the Ritz." Today, she says, it's modest rooms "with toilets down the hall."  <p>

Neuprex, the company's newest product, is in four different phase-two trials, and I think investors will get very excited when they see the results later this year. One of the trials,which is testing the drug's use with conventional antibiotics in attacking antibiotic-resistant bacteria, has particular promise. Xoma also has a partnership with Pfizer on a drug called E5, which treats sepsis and may get approval in Japan this year.Meanwhile, the company has enough cash to last it a couple ofyears.  <p> MICHAEL MURPHY <p>CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER <p>Looks for high-growth high-tech companies. <p><a name="NASD:MTSN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42197"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MATTSON TECHNOLOGY </b></a>(Nasdaq: MTSN) Up to $15: Mattson (Fremont,California) has seen its stock come down sharply with those of the computer-chip makers, even though the economics of Mattson's business are different. Mattson makes the high-speed equipment that companies such as Motorola use to produce semiconductors. In the next three years, roughly 90 new manufacturing facilities worldwide will need this kind of advanced equipment. Mattson's sales grew 183 percent last year, and earnings grew 248 percent. I don't expect to see those kinds of numbers again in 1996, but I am looking for sales growth of 84 percent and earnings growth of 71 percent. My 12-month target for the stock is $25 a share. <p> LOUIS NAVELLIER <p>MPT REVIEW <p>Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks. <p><a name="NASD:ASTF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42224"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ACCUSTAFF</b></a> (Nasdaq: ASTF) Up to $26: The stock of AccuStaff (Jacksonville,Florida), a  temporary-staffing company, is working overtime. Institutional money managers have been aggressively buying the stock, which has great earnings momentum. If the labor market tightens, as recent statistics suggest it might, temporary help will benefit greatly. AccuStaff operates in 26 states and has 20 regional and 123 branch offices. The fundamentals are phenomenal: high sales growth, expanding margins, and explosive earnings growth. The stock has a very high alpha and a negative beta, meaning it is uncorrelated with the market. The stock was scheduled to split three for one on March 27.   <p> DAN SULLIVAN <p>THE CHARTIST <p>Uses technical analysis to identify long-term equity investments.<p><a name="NASD:JLGI"></a><b>JLG INDUSTRIES</b> (Nasdaq: JLGI) Up to $43: JLG (McConnellsburg,Pennsylvania) is a hydraulic-machinery company that has made a habit of exceeding Wall Street estimates. For example, in the most recent fiscal quarter, ended January 31, earnings rose 115 percent to 58 cents a share -- roughly 20 cents a share better than analysts had projected. The company has managed to cut manufacturing costs while raising prices. I expect these trends to continue and earnings to grow at an annual clip of 18 to 20 percent over the next three to five years. Although the stock has had a strong run-up recently and could be vulnerable to some profit taking, I think it is very attractive as a long-term holding.  <p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE BUYING NOW  <p> Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about  their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here -- the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. The manager also may have sold the stock after March 25, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these eight managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends that they conduct their own due diligence.  <p> PRESTON ATHEY <p><a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. ROWE PRICE SMALL CAP VALUE</b></a> <p>Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million. <p><a name="NASD:CULP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13142"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CULP</b></a> (Nasdaq: CULP) Up to $13: Culp (High Point, North Carolina), a home-furnishings and upholstered-fabric company, has a long-term record of exceptional performance in a very difficult industry. I think investors can make a lot of money in the stock. Culp's 33 percent compounded earnings growth over the past six years belies the industry's cyclicity and bodes well for the future; Culp should increase earnings again this year thanks to higher exports and lower raw-material costs. Culp is so cost-efficient that it has been able to increase exports 13-fold since 1989 while improving profit margins abroad. The stock is trading atten times my 1996 earnings estimate of $1.05 a share, and it's a great value.  <p> JAMES P. CRAIG <p><a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>JANUS FUND</b></a> <p>Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.  <p><a name="NYSE:LLY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10509"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ELI LILLY </b></a>(NYSE: LLY) Up to $65: The stock of Prozac-producer Eli Lilly (Indianapolis) certainly hasn't been depressed, but I think two new drugs could drive the price even higher. In the same way that Prozac expanded the market for treating depression, the release of Zyprex should increase awareness and demand in the relatively small schizophrenia market. The second promising drug, already released, is ReoPro, an anti-clotting drug made by Centocor; Lilly markets it in exchange for half the revenues. Lilly's earnings, which I expect to be $2.80 a share in 1996, should grow at close to 20 percent for the next several years. I think the stock can reach $80 a share over the next year. <p> SHELBY M.C. DAVIS <p><a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>NEW YORK VENTURE FUND</b></a> <p>Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style. <p><a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>INTEL</b></a> (Nasdaq: INTC) Up to $57: Here's a chance to buy this chip maker cheap. For only 12 times my 1996 earnings estimate of $4.50 a share, investors can own a quality long-term-growth company. The stock of Intel (Santa Clara, California) has come down because of rising inventory and disappointing earnings, but Intel is still the dominant player with the dominant market share. The long-term story is intact; a wave of corporate PC upgrades, using Intel's Pentium Pro and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft's</b></a> Windows NT system, is about to begin.

The company had a rocky period some years ago, but has a new CEO and is back on track. The company sells to both component makers and big retailers, and its backlog of orders is building. Universal also has the largest database of infrared codes and faces no real competition because of the difficulty of obtaining these codes from component makers. The company should be debt-free by mid-1996. I'm looking for earnings of 70 cents a share this year, up from 5 cents a share (after a onetime charge) in 1995. This could be a $20 stock within the next 12 months. <p> WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ <p><a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>HEARTLAND VALUE FUND</b></a> <p>Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be under valued. <p><a name="NASD:BOCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15973"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BOCA RESEARCH </b></a>(Nasdaq: BOCI) Up to $21: Boca Research (Boca Raton,Florida) makes products -- mostly circuit boards -- that transmit information among personal computers, networks, and the Internet. Three factors will be pushing the company's earnings up 30 to35 percent a year in the near term: rising demand for faster modems; increasing use of the Internet; and surging growth in the small-office market. The kicker for the stock is Boca's new low-cost video-conferencing product, due out in the third quarter. At 14 times my estimated 1996 earnings of $1.40 a share, Boca is a much better bet than its high-end competitor PictureTel, which trades at 46 times my 1996 earnings estimate.  <p> ERIC E. RYBACK <p><a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LINDNER DIVIDEND FUND</b></a> <p>Seeks current income first, capital appreciation second. <p><a name="NYSE:RSP"></a><b>SOUTHERN PACIFIC RAIL </b>(NYSE: RSP) Up to $27.50: Merger plans between Southern Pacific Rail (San Francisco) and Union Pacificare chugging toward the September completion date. According to the deal, investors will be able to exchange one share of Southern Pacific stock for $25 in cash or 0.4065 shares of Union Pacific. The combined company will benefit from large cost savings. To further enhance shareholder value, the new U.P. will spin of its holdings in its oil-and-gas company, Union Pacific Resources. There has been talk that opposition to the merger may hold it up, but I feel the companies are addressing the concerns fully. Investors should buy at up to 37 percent of the price of U.P. <p> RALPH WAGNER & CHUCK McQUAID <p><a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ACORN FUND</b></a> <p>Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.  <p><a name="NASD:UVSGA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16685"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UNITED VIDEO SATELLITE GROUP</b></a> (Nasdaq: UVSGA) Up to $23: United Video (Tulsa, Oklahoma), which is now 40 percent owned by Tele-Communications, is a satellite-communications company that provides programming to cable franchises and services to the owners of satellite dishes.Its Prevue channel (which features TV listings and clips) has hit critical mass of 40 million homes and will likely add 6 million more. It's selling a lot of advertising, too. Other areas are also turning profits, including Sneak Prevue (for pay-per-view), Prevue International, and SpaceCom (data and audio distribution). Prevue Interactive also has great prospects. Our 18-month target for the stock is $29.50 a share.  <p> DONALD A. YACKTMAN <p><a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>YACKTMAN FUND</b></a> <p>Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion. <p><a name="NYSE:FNQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15674"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FRANKLIN QUEST</b></a>(NYSE: FNQ) Up to $24 <p>Investors in search of solid growth should look at Franklin Quest (Salt Lake City), a company whose annual earnings have grown at an average rate of about 20 percent for the past four years. The stock has stayed flat since I recommended it in January, but all the fundamentals for a strong move are still in place. Franklin makes a lot of money by dominating a very simple business-- it makes day planners -- and is also a growing presence intime-management seminars (its original business) and retail. The company has a high return on assets, and though earnings growth slowed a bit last year, I expect to see strong earnings of $2 a share in 1996.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> MARKET RADAR  <p> After a brief flirtation with optimism last month, the "Market Radar" indicators retreat toward pessimism. The Composite Bellwether index of brokerage and utility stocks heads south again, after failing to match last September's peak. Just as significant, the Advance/Decline Line shifts from positive to neutral as the daily number of stocks losing ground on the New York Stock Exchange catches up to the number advancing. Other markets look worse: On the Nasdaq, declines outpace advances at an alarming rate.  <p> Sources: Advance/Decline Line, Composite Bellwether, and Monetary Exposure Profile from Inves Tech; Advisory Sentiment from Investors Intelligence; Yield Ratio from the Leuthold Group; Consumer and Corporate Debt from Safian Investment Research.   <p>

						May 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> KEEPING UP <p>  <p>By John Fried  <p> *The securities industry does a poor job policing brokers, according to a report jointly prepared by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the National Association of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange, and the North American Securities Administration Association. The report criticized the industry for failing to adequately monitor broker trades, for slipshod hiring practices, and for willingly overlooking problem brokers.  <p> *Vanguard Group, the nation's second-largest mutual-fund company, plans to offer financial reviews to individuals this year. The check ups, covering such areas as investments, insurance, and trust services, will be provided at what Vanguard says will be a discount rate. At the moment, no other mutual-fund company offers such a service, though it is now more likely that some of the larger fund families will follow suit. The business has traditionally been the province of independent financial planners, private banks, and the networks of advisers employed by full-service financial firms, such as <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>. <p> *Fidelity Investments has reassigned the managers of 26 stock mutual funds. Although Fidelity has ranked among the industry leaders in performance during the past decade, its stock fundsas a group have done less well during the past two years a period when the company's strengths have been out of sync with the market. The management reshuffling which involved 30 percent of Fidelity's equity-portfolio managers was the most sweeping ever at a company that is known for a competitive internal work environment.  <p> *The Securities and Exchange Commission plans to impose new standards on money-market funds, requiring them to reduce their exposure to interest-rate, credit-quality, and currency-related risks. The new rules, scheduled to take effect later this year,encourage greater diversification and prohibit investments in certain derivative securities.  <p> *Hedge funds and other private investment pools may be used in 401(k) retirement plans, the SEC has ruled. Although hedge funds are restricted to no more than 100 investors, the government agency said a self-directed retirement plan even one with thousands of members may be counted under its rules as a single investor. <p> *More workers may be suing their employers in the wake of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that has made it easier for employees to file lawsuits alleging that they were misled about their health and pension benefits. The court's ruling found that a farm-and-industrial-equipment manufacturer in Buffalo, New York, can be held liable for such deceit. A rise in such litigation, however, could make it more expensive for companies to provide benefits.  <p> *Spring Street Brewing will resume operating what apparently is the first-ever system that allows stockholders to buy and sell a company's shares on the Internet. The New York brewer,whose president is a former securities lawyer, halted trading in late March, following a request by securities regulators, who asked for modifications to the system.  <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> GLOBAL MARKETS  <p> By Todd G. Buchholz  <p> Year of the Rat, the Bull, or the Bear? Oliver Stone's film Nixon may have bombed at the box of-fice, but it does remind us of the historic "opening to China," the 1972 renewal of relations with the world's most populous nation, engineered by Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger.   <p> Of course, no one foresaw that the U.S. would run a $33.8 billion annual trade deficit with China less than 25 years later. Still, companies like <a name="NYSE:BA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10221"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boeing</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a> have done quite well during China's rapid industrialization, and bilateral trade has created about a million U.S. jobs.  <p> So far this trading relationship has been win-win, and it could get better. As Chinese incomes rise, peasants move off the farms and into the cities, and China's need to import food grows. U.S. farmers want to feed all those open mouths, and since China's exports generate lots of foreign currency, its people will not go unfed, as they did in the 1950s and 1960s. And China's remaining farmers will ultimately buy U.S. farm equipment to help meet growing demand.  <p>So why, as of March 25, has the index for Shanghai B stock, which is available to foreigners, fallen 35 percent to 1242 from its May 22, 1995, high of 1913?  <p> There are several plausible explanations. First, the Asian markets are being affected by the Dow Jones average, which looks jittery after last year's spectacular run-up. Second, the Chinese economy has slowed because of a tight monetary policy, which cut inflation from 21.7 percent in 1994 to about 8 percent this year. But whath as really spooked the markets is that U.S.-China relations have slid back to where they were before 1972. The principal reason is that, for most of March, China was lobbing unarmed missiles into the seas off Taiwan in a crude -- and failed -- attempt to frighten the Taiwanese into voting on March 23 against political democratization and against a government that might move toward national independence. In response, President Clinton sent naval vessels to the region, and tense words were exchanged.   <p> The crisis seems to be abating, with China making conciliatory gestures toward Taiwan's newly elected president, Lee Teng-hui. But, nonetheless, 1996 promises to be a miserable year for Beijing-Washington commercial relations. For example, Caterpillar plans on sharing in one of the biggest construction jobs in history, China's Three Gorges Dam, which depends partly on loans from the U.S. Export-Import Bank. Washington may well nix these loans, sending the Chinese elsewhere for financing and equipment (Japan's Komatsu corporation will be happy to oblige).  <p> In addition, the deadline for extending China's most-favored-nation status is June 3, and while the White House would like to extend MFN to help Caterpillar, <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>,General Motors</b></a>, Boeing, and other exporters (and lots of working voters), the president's advisers remember how George Bush was hurt in 1992 by being perceived as "soft" on China.   <p> The U.S. will probably extend MFN but may impose sanctions that target China's piracy of intellectual property (despite a 1995 trade deal, China continues to rip off billions in CD recording sand software) and alleged sale of nuclear technology. Of course, China will retaliate against U.S. firms, to the delight of our competitors. It's no surprise that U.S. investors are growing wary of putting more money into Asian mutual funds in 1996. <p> Contributing editor Todd Buchholz is a managing director of a New York­based international investment fund and the author of From Here to Economy: A Shortcut to Economic Literacy. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> A BUYING OPPORTUNITY?  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> The recent slump in the bond market has brought long-term issues back into buying range. On March 8, when a report showed an increase in the number of new jobs of more than twice what analysts had expected, bond prices plunged, and yields on 30-year Treasurys jumped from 6.46 percent to 6.74 percent. Yields had already climbed from about 6 percent in early February as hopes for Federal Reserve rate cuts faded and politicians stopped focusing on the deficit. "Republicans started talking about things like flat taxes instead of balanced budgets," says Jim Floyd, a senior analyst at the Leuthold Group in Minneapolis.   <p> Why is this a good time to buy? Many analysts argue that the jobs data were a fluke. Other numbers, such as declining producer prices, point to low inflation and slow growth. "Bonds are very fairly priced right now," says David Rosenberg, a fixed-income manager with Oppenheimer Funds in New York. "Today's real returns of 3 percent or so on intermediate bonds are a good deal" for patient investors. But the moment isn't right to try to make a short-term killing. "The market will react strongly to any economic news," says Floyd. "This probably isn't the time to load up on long-term bonds as a short-term, tactical maneuver." <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> BORROWING TROUBLE  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> There's something deeply wrong with the bond market. On Friday, March 8, the Dow Jones Industrial Average took a 171-point drubbing. Equity investors howled, and the press put the story on page one. On the same day, the bond market took an even worse beating-- a $1,000 30-year Treasury bond lost $31 in value as long-term interest rates recorded their biggest one-day rise since Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990.  <p> The stock market has since recovered from its vapors, but the bond market has sunk into a deeper funk. Not only has it failed to recover any of the ground it lost, but it has continued to punish investors. As of March 22, an investor in the 30-year Treasury bond was showing a year-to-date total return of negative 8.25 percent, according to Ryan Labs Inc.  <p> Exactly what's wrong with the bond market? On March 8, the quick answer was "the economy." Government employment numbers announced that day showed that the nation had created 705,000 jobs in February, almost three times as many as Wall Street expected.  <p> That was terrible news for the bond market, which had been counting on a weak economy to force the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates at its March meeting. The expectation was built into bond yields -- and when the jobs number ensured the Fed's inaction, the market was set to tumble.  <p> But that doesn't explain why it tumbled so far or so fast. To understand the size and speed of the move, you have to look at the market's peculiar structure.  <p> "There are no investors in this bond market," says James Bianco, research director at Arbor Trading Group in Barrington, Illinois."Bonds are being bought by speculators and dealers. Everybody is in the bond market for the short run."  <p> It's easy to see what attracts traders to this market. The short run is potentially far more lucrative for bond traders than for anyone who trades in equities. Regulation T of the Federal Reserve Board requires that equities investors put down at least 50 percent of the price of a stock in cash. Their maximum leverage is two for one.  <p> Bond traders, however, can easily up their leverage by borrowing from the big investment houses that finance the bond trade. When George Soros trades bonds, for example, he often employs leverage  of eight to one. Leverage is great, of course, when bond prices are going up. But it's a disaster when prices tumble. Traders with eight-to-one leverage didn't lose $31 per $1,000 bond on March 8; they lost $248.  <p> Of course, bond traders can't borrow the money to buy bonds on margin for nothing. The banks in this business charge interest, and bond traders are always looking for the cheapest source of money. For a good part of this year and last, that has meant Japan. In order to stimulate the Japanese economy, the Bank of Japan has cut interest rates to almost nothing. International bond traders have been able to borrow yen in Japan at just 0.5 percent and then buy U.S. Treasurys yielding 5 percent.  <p> Leverage like this doesn't come without its dangers. If rates head up and prices go down, the leveraged investor will take a big hit. If the exchange rate between the dollar and yen changes, with the dollar getting weaker so that it takes more dollar profits to repay those yen loans, traders will also feel the pain.  <p> The bond market has been lifted by a sea of borrowed money. There's the money traders have borrowed from banks to buy bonds and the money borrowed from Japan. Bianco estimates the first at around $170 billion and the second at $100 billion. But that's not all. Foreign central banks, which have been buying dollars to prop up the value of the buck, have been recirculating their dollars by buying Treasury securities in the U.S. market. The Fed currently estimates that balance at $552 billion.  <p> All this money has kept interest rates lower and bond prices higher. And it has made equities look like better investments by keeping yields on bonds so low. <p>How long can the situation go on? Bond traders have decided that the Fed is not likely to cut rates soon and have begun to unwind recent positions. But foreign central banks are still buying bonds. How much more they'll hold is anyone's guess. <p>This all adds up to a fundamental change for those who invest-- rather than trade -- in bonds. In this market, bond and bond-fund investors can't buy and forget. They need to be much more active about managing the fixed-income part of their portfolios. "If I'm a fixed-income investor, I don't plan on investing for the long term but for a year or so," says Chip Norton, managing editor of IBC's Bond Fund Report.  <p> Most investors are better off now in bond funds than in individual bonds. Look for a fund family with funds of different maturities-- at a minimum a short-, an intermediate-, and a long-term fund.Then use a number called "duration" -- a measure of a fund's sensitivity to changes in interest rates -- to build a portfolio.(The longer the duration, the more interest-rate sensitivity.) Do some what-ifs that look at combinations of funds with higher and lower yields and different durations. The goal is to find a balance of tolerable potential loss and income.  <p> The whole process should take about an hour. Considering the potential return, that's a pretty good investment -- even without leverage. <p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> 10 STOCKS TO CONSIDER/AVOID  <p> DAVID TICE likes to challenge Wall Street's darlings. As editor of Behind the Numbers, a Dallas newsletter, he advises some 100 portfolio managers on sell decisions, and he recently started a $1 million short-selling mutual fund, the Prudent Bear. To identify stocks with problems that should blow up within a year, he screens for equities at the high end of their trading range and then scours their financial data to identify land mines, such as earnings per share that are growing faster than operating earnings. For example, from the third to the fourth calendar quarters of 1995, <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> spent more than $2.50 in marketing costs to add each dollar of new revenue. Oil-and-gas producer <a name="NYSE:CHK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12049"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chesapeake Energy</b></a> is overstating cash flow because of on going drilling costs to  replenish quickly diminishing reserves.

Up 36.9 percent during the last 12 months, the fund has averaged an annual return of 28.6 percent for the past five years. Auriana buys mostly small-company stocks at initial public offerings -- 17 out of the fund's top 20 holdings were bought as IPOs. He targets companies that can increase earnings by at least 20 percent annually over the next two to three years, that sell proprietary products in multibillion-dollar markets, and that show recurring sources of revenue. Using proprietary software, Altera designs and produces programmable logic microchips that can be tailored to fit customers' needs. While the news of the recent glut in memory chips has driven down the stock prices of all chip makers, Auriana expects earnings growth at Altera to be unaffected: He's looking for earnings to increase 30 percent a year for the next few years. A proprietary information system allows Borders Group's book superstores to tailor 70 percent of inventory to local buying patterns. Diagnostic Products has an ongoing source of profits in the high-margin reagents it developed for use in medical tests. <p><a name="NASD:ACSA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42188"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Affiliated Computer Services</b></a> (Nasdaq: ACSA) $43 <p>Recurring service revenue <p>Growing through acquisitions <p>Benefits from outsourcing trend <p><a name="NASD:ALTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12568"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Altera </b></a>(Nasdaq: ALTR) $65 <p>Proprietary products  <p>Launching new products <p>Strong industry growth <p><a name="NASD:BSST"></a><b>Baby Superstore </b>(Nasdaq: BSST) $40 <p>Leading player in market <p>Plenty of room to expand <p>Growing private-label sales <p><a name="NYSE:BGP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42887"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Borders Group</b></a> (NYSE: BGP) $30 <p>Proprietary technology <p>Efficient inventory management <p>Expanding into new markets <p><a name="NASD:CENT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15905"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Central Garden & Pet</b></a> (Nasdaq: CENT) $11 <p>Dominant market share <p>Broad range of products <p>Strong industry growth <p><a name="AMEX:CYE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12967"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cheyenne Software </b></a>(AMEX: CYE) $27 <p>Value-added distribution <p>Growing through acquisitions <p>Strong industry growth <p><a name="NASD:DANKY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43628"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Danka Business Systems</b></a> (Nasdaq: DANKY) $45 <p>Recurring service revenue <p>Growing through acquisitions <p>Strong industry growth <p><a name="NYSE:DP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10456"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Diagnostic Products </b></a>(NYSE: DP) $43 <p>Proprietary technology <p>High-margin recurring revenue <p>Under followed by analysts <p><a name="NASD:NKOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15814"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nu-Kote Holdings</b></a> (Nasdaq: NKOT) $18 <p>Low-priced products <p>Gaining new economies of scale <p>Strong industry growth <p><a name="NASD:TCNL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13352"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tecnol Medical Products</b></a> (Nasdaq: TCNL) $19 <p>Recurring revenue <p>Low-cost manufacturer <p>Imminent earnings turn around  <p>  <p>UPDATE <p>Last year's market rally was cruel to May 1995's "Ten Stocks to Avoid" selections by Scott Turkel, founder of TCM Partners, a New York hedge fund: His portfolio appreciated 12.5 percent in the past 12 months ended March 15.

						March 1996
Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>ZEROS ARE ADDING UP<p>By Bernie Napach<p>Many fixed-income investors are betting that falling interest rates will further boost bond prices. At least that's the hope of investors looking to match the 19.24 percent total return racked up by the <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lehman Brothers</b></a> government/corporate bond index in 1995.<p>But 30-year rates fell 193 basis points (100 basis points equal one percentage point) last year, and few expect a decline this year of more than an additional 50 basis points. That won't be enough to produce double-digit returns, except for intrepid investors who resort to zero-coupon bonds. Last year, 30-year zero-coupon Treasurys soared more than 60 percent. In 1996 they're the vehicle of choice for investors who want to get the most bang from any fall in interest rates.<p>Zeros pay no interest; there's nothing to cushion the effects of interest-rate swings. When rates rise one percentage point, long-term zeros plummet 30 percent, compared with a 12 percent drop in 30-year, interest-paying Treasurys. But if rates drop 50 basis points, 30-year zeros will gain 22 percent.<p>Only a few mutual funds invest solely in zeros. And the  only fund company offering truly long-term zeros is Twentieth Century's Benham Group (800-331-8331). It has zero funds that mature in 20 or 25 years. <p><p>

						March 1996
Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>TREND SPOTTER<p>By Monica Corcoran <p>I LAUGHED, I CRIED, I TANNED. How do small-video-store owners boost profits? By bronzing patrons, of course. Thomas K. Arnold, editor in chief of Video Store Magazine, numbers the movie rental outlets offering on-site tanning beds at more than 2,000. "Stores are looking to provide services that cable can't offer," he says.<p>GLOOMY BOOMERS. Fiscal pessimism is especially high among the 30-to-49-year-old set. A study by the Lutheran Brotherhood reveals that twice as many baby boomers expect their family income to drop in 1996 as did in 1995. "When the government closes down, people get nervous about their job security," says Rolf Bjelland, chief investment officer of the Brotherhood.<p>$ILVER $CREEN. The Writers Guild of America, West, reports that screenwriters' earnings have jumped 47 percent since 1991. But don't quit that day job yet. The top 50 film scribes__meaning just 3 percent of all the WGAW's working members__account for as much as 50 percent, or $144.5 million, of last year's overall earnings.<p>LOCATION, LOCATION. A study by the William M. Mercer human-resources consulting firm takes a close look at the impact of your zip code on your paycheck. Using a benchmark $50,000 salary for a middle manager in Yakima, Washington, Mercer gauged the income drop or jump for that job nationwide. Heading to New York increases that $50K by $7,400. But how many cups of joe will that buy in high-priced Manhattan? <p>EVE'S RIB. The scales of justice certainly aren't tipped in favor of female lawyers. The Association of the Bar of the City of New York reveals in a 1995 study of NYC law firms that more women are getting passed over for partnerships. Promotion rates for female associates hired after 1981 have fallen to 5 percent__a third the rate of promotion for female associates hired between 1973 and 1981. Promotion rates for men have dropped slightly, but male associates are still promoted at a rate of 17 percent. <p>RISING DOUGH. Better get cookin' if you're aching to retire. Pillsbury recently upped the grand prize for its perennial Bake-Off from $50,000 to a hot-and-piping $1 million.<p>PASS THE PROZAC, PLEASE. Scott-Levin, a marketing firm for the health-care industry, reports that the number of in-force prescriptions for the ber-antidepressant has soared 65.4 percent, from 10.9 million in late 1992 to more than 18 million by the end of last year.<p>WHY ALL THE JUNK? Because it works. A recent U.S. Postal Service survey discovered that nearly two-thirds of consumers consider all those catalogs, circulars, and coupons useful. That explains why the volume of third-class mail has jumped about 70 percent since the mid-1980s and why it is projected to increase by 6.5 percent a year through the millennium.<p>LET'S MAKE A DEAL. If Uncle Sam won't give you a break next month, try your accountant. The trend among CPAs, who are vying for business with all those tax-preparation computer programs, is alternative billing. "For accountants to make money, they have to adopt different pricing philosophies," says August Aquila, author of Breaking the Paradigm, a book on alternative billing strategies for accountants. Aquila suggests you discuss paying a flat rate or by the form. "Getting billed by the hour is the worst for the customer," he cautions.<p>FOUR LEGS AND A FOUR IRON. Somebody had to find a use for the exploding population of llamas__they've doubled in number, to 75,000, since 1990.  At Minnesota's Elmdale Hills Golf Course, golfers pay $25 to have a llama carry their clubs.<p>

						March 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE BUYING NOW  <p> Eight acclaimed mutual-fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. The manager may also have sold the stock after January 22, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these eight managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends that they conduct their own due diligence.  <p>  <hr>  <p>PRESTON ATHEY <p><a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. ROWE PRICE SMALL CAP VALUE</b></a>  <p> Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.  <p> <a name="NASD:WGOV"></a><b>Woodward Governer</b>  up to $75  Nasdaq: WGOV <p>Woodward Governor (Rockford, Illinois) is the world's leading manufacturer of fuel controls and speed controls for engines. Because of a drop in its defense and commercial-aircraft business, earnings fell from a peak of $10.74 a share in the fiscal year ended September 30, 1990, to a loss of $1.11 a share in fiscal1994. The company underwent a painful restructuring and got earnings back up to $4.11 a share last year. Trading at 1.1 times book value (12 times estimated 1996 earnings a share) and yielding 5 percent, WGOV is a great value. I'm particularly optimistic because a new aircraft cycle is beginning. My target price is $125 a share.  <p> -------------------- <p>JAMES P. CRAIG <p><a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>  <p> Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.  <p> <a name="NYSE:BNI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10250"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Burlington Northern Santa Fe </b></a> up to $80  Nyse: BNI <p>Rail giant BNI (Fort Worth, Texas) is making a single company of Burlington Northern and Santa Fe faster than expected, thanks in large part to Robert Krebs, formerly the Santa Fe chief and now head of BNI. This provides huge cost savings and growth potential. The stock has been hurt by concern over the economy, but booming exports in grain (15 percent of revenue) and a growing demand for low-cost coal (25 percent of revenue) in the Powder River Basin should give the company revenue stability. I think BNI will earn $6.30 a share in 1996 and at least $7.50 a share in1997. The stock should reach the mid-$90s this year.  <p> -------------------- <p>SHELBY M. C. DAVIS <p><a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a> <p>  <p>Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.  <p> <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> up to $88  Nyse: MS <p>With roughly 48 percent of its profit earned outside the U.S., Morgan Stanley (New York) is one of the top global financial-services franchises. It is emphasizing growth of its global money-management and mutual-fund business, and recently acquired Pennsylvania-based Miller Anderson & Sherrerd. The stock is trading at about nine times my 1996 earnings estimate of $9 a share and only slightly above its expected book value of $64 a share. Morgan has a big backlog of mergers and acquisitions and an active share-repurchase program. My 12- to 18-month target is between $110 a share and $120 a share, just less than twice book value.  <p> -------------------- <p>DANIEL B. LEONARD <p><a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology</b></a>  <p> Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.  <p> <a name="NASD:LFUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13984"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Littlefuse</b></a> up to $35  Nasdaq: LFUS <p>Littelfuse (Des Plaines, Illinois) is the world's leading designer and manufacturer of fuses; the company makes fuses for cars, for industry, and for electronic equipment. (For electronics, the fuses can be as tiny as a grain of rice.) Littelfuse, which has a market capitalization of $330 million, is also diversifying abroad: It recently acquired land in China to build a manufacturing plant and purchased an interest in a South Korean fuse company. Littelfuse has only scattered competition and is under-followed by Wall Street, which is a big plus. My 12-month target for the stock is $45 a share, well above the recent high of $38.  <p> -------------------- <p>WILLIAM J.

RightChoice is in the midst of launching one of its most successful products ever, AllianceChoice, a hybrid between an HMO and a PPO. It lets members use any doctor and see a specialist without a referral. Employers like this product, and the company will soon be offering it to individuals. RightChoice should earn $1.50 a share in 1996 (up from $1.25 last year) and $1.70 a share in 1997. Though earnings are growing at 15 percent, the price-to-earnings ratio is only nine. The company's buyout value is about $30 a share.  <p> -------------------- <p>ERIC E.

This spring, Tuboscope, which has a market capitalization of $150 million, plans to merge with Drexel Oilfield Services, another manufacturer of products for drilling and maintaining oil wells. SCF Partners, a shareholder of Drexel, intends to invest an additional $31 million in the combined outfit. After the merger, the chairman of Tuboscope will be SCF Partners' L. E. Simmons, a well-respected industry veteran. I plan to hold the stock up to $15 a share. <p> -------------------- <p>RALPH WANGER <p>CHUCK McQUAID <p><a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a>   <p> Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.  <p><a name="NASD:MTEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14149"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> Mobile Telecommunications Tech. </b></a> up to $24  Nasdaq: MTEL <p>Mobile Telecommunications (Jackson, Mississippi) provides nationwide paging service. The subscriber count for its one-way service grew 103 percent to 900,000 last year, so it maintained its dominant market share. The company won a Pioneer's Preference license from the FCC. As a result, it has an 18-month lead over its competition in launching the first nationwide two-way paging service. MTEL also has interests in paging services in 20 countries. The stock is off 45 percent from a 1995 high of $36 a share because of a shortage of pagers, a problem that now appears to be solved. At around $20, we think the stock is extremely cheap.  <p> -------------------- <p>DONALD A.

The stock had been a steady gainer for years, rising as high as $43 a share in 1993 before tumbling to the low $20s last year. Hurt by a slowdown in the video-game market and a bad retailing environment in general, Toys "R" Us should still be the first to benefit from an easing of competitive pressure. In addition, its product breadth allows it to cross-subsidize its different lines, something mom-and-pop stores and general merchandisers such as Wal-Mart and Target can't do. I think the company can get earnings back up to around $2 a share in 1996. <p>   <p> WHAT THEY"RE RECOMMENDING <p>These four top financial-newsletter writers the most recent additions to our panel of experts identify their favorite domestic stocks.

The company is distinguished by its great partners <a name="NYSE:PFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pfizer</b></a>, Glaxo, Smith Kline Beecham, American Home Products, and Abbott Labs. This provides a substantial amount of research support and money. The company is currently developing products to treat osteoporosis and inflammation, and to regulatelipid levels. It is also making estrogen-like molecules that don't have the side effects of estrogen. Ligand has no earnings yet, but has $80 million in cash, enough to last three years. <p> -------------------- <p>MICHAEL MURPHY <p>CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER  <p> Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.  <p> <a name="NASD:IDTI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13785"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>INTEGRATED DEVICE TECHNOLOGY</b></a>  up to $15  Nasdaq: IDTI <p>IDTI (Santa Clara, California) got pummeled in the recent semiconductor sell-off, but it should bounce back in the next year. About half of its revenues come from static random-access memory, or SRAM, which is used as a cache between the fast microprocessor and the rest of a computer, which is much slower. With demand for <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>'s Pentium microprocessor driving PC growth and a new factory in Oregon coming on-line this quarter, IDTI's sales volume should accelerate. The company spends a high 18 percent of sales on research and development, which bodes well for the long term. I think the company can earn $2 a share in 1996.  <p> -------------------- <p>LOUIS NAVELLIER <p>MPT REVIEW  <p> Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks.  <p> <a name="NASD:CUBE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17270"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>C-Cube Microsystems </b></a> up to $58  Nasdaq: CUBE <p>C-Cube (Milpitas, California) is a leader in the digital video market. The company provides a wide range of video-compression equipment, such as encoders, decoders, and codecs. Applications for its products include everything from video CD players to digital television systems to video play back on PCs. The stock has very strong earnings-estimate support from industry analysts as well as very strong earnings momentum. What I think is most compelling about this stock from a technical perspective is that it has a high alpha, which means its returns are uncorrelated with the market's. This is a very healthy sign for the stock. <p> -------------------- <p>DAN SULLIVAN <p>THE CHARTIST  <p> Uses technical analysis to identify long-term equity investments. <p> <a name="NASD:AMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12623"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Amgen </b></a> up to $60  Nasdaq: AMGN <p>Amgen (Thousand Oaks, California) develops, manufactures, and markets human therapeutics based on cellular and molecular biology. Two of Amgen's drugs Epogen, for treating renal-related anemia, and Neupogen, for stimulating the production of white blood cells generate 95 percent of the company's revenue. Demand should continue to grow as Amgen develops new uses for these drugs. Revenue for the first nine months of 1995 rose 18 percent while net income increased 25 percent. I expect earnings to come in at $1.95 a share for 1995 (a 25 percent jump) and to grow at around 20 percent for the next three to five years.  <p><p><p>

					<font size=4>
						By Jim Jubak  <p> You'll probably agree that investors have plenty to worry about already: interest rates, inflation, the budget stand off. And now corporate earnings suggest that deflation should be added to the list. Understanding deflation, in fact, may be the key to success in what is shaping up to be a stock picker's market. <p> When economists talk about deflation, of course, they are describingan economic trend that is the opposite of inflation: when prices fall across the economy. Deflationary periods occur rarely; we haven't seen one in this country since the Great Depression. <p> But the U.S. economy is not on the verge of a general downturn in prices, so let's leave that kind of deflation to the economists and other theorists. What the year's first corporate-earnings reports have begun to reveal is something different: steady downward pressure on the prices that individual businesses can charge for their products. This kind of spot deflation has recentlyled companies as diverse as <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:RBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rubbermaid</b></a> to deliver earnings far below Wall Street's expectations.  <p> Motorola reported its results for the fourth quarter of 1995 after the market closed on January 8, 1996. The company's sales for the quarter rose 13 percent from the year-earlier period, yet its earnings fell 16 percent. The market knocked $10.63 a share off Motorola's stock the next day.  <p> Both industry analysts and company officials blamed aggressive price-cutting in the cellular-phone industry. In the fall of1995, for instance, Motorola had reduced wholesale prices on its Teletac phone by $15, at least partly in response to an earlier trim by NEC. It's not exactly surprising, then, that Motorola's net-profit margin fell to just below 6 percent of sales from 8 percent.  <p> This kind of price deflation is a well-established fact of life for technology companies: it's only investors who occasionally forget that a computer with today's power and features will cost less tomorrow. <a name="NYSE:SGI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11735"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Silicon Graphics</b></a>, the manufacturer of the speedy graphics work stations that made the dinosaurs of Jurassic Parkwalk, was a favorite of investors until Wall Street noticed that competitors such as <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a> and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> had introduced low-end products that were cheaper than those of Silicon Graphics. In early 1996 Silicon Graphics struck back with a new system priced about $1,500 below Microsoft's product.   <p> But the spot deflation that's common in technology has now spread to companies in sectors of the economy that usually escape these pressures. In one of the earliest signs of the trend, in July 1995, Rubbermaid, a producer of such low-tech goods as plastic garbage cans, food storage containers, and children's toys, announced that the soaring cost of resins, the raw materials used to make plastics, had sent its second-quarter earnings tumbling almost 50 percent in comparison with the year-earlier quarter. In normal inflationary times, Rubbermaid would have simply passed those costs along to consumers by raising prices. But the company was already losing shelf space to the cheaper products of competitors at chains such as <a name="NYSE:WMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11600"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wal-Mart</b></a>. So instead of raising prices, Rubbermaid announced plans in December to wring $50 million in costs out of overhead. But that won't fix the company's problems overnight. Net margins have slipped to 8 percent from more than 10 percent in 1994.   <p> Corporations are responding to these product-by-product pressures in very different ways. Some, such as Motorola, have decided to do whatever it takes to hold on to market share, even if that punishes short-term earnings. Others, such as <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> in computer printers and <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> in computer chips, have concluded that they are more production efficient than their competitors and are relentlessly driving down prices to seize market share. Still others, such as <a name="NYSE:EK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10500"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eastman Kodak</b></a> in copiers, have decided to get out of businesses that they can't dominate.  <p> That gives investors trying to pick stocks new food for thought. Take the auto industry, for example. When <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor</b></a> brought out the redesigned Taurus, it hiked base prices on its four-door GL model by almost 6 percent, apparently believing that the car's innovative styling, added standard features, and quality were more important to consumers than dollars. <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, on the other hand, has priced its Chevrolets and Pontiacs below its competitors' products. The results: Sales of the Ford Taurus fell 35 percent in December 1995 compared with December of 1994, and Ford is now waving $600 rebates at consumers. General Motors' longtime money-losing operations in North America look like they'll be in the black for a second straight year. An even bigger winner,though, may be <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>, which is selling cars with smaller rebates than Ford and has a better product line and lower costs than <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>.  <p> In 1995 declining interest rates and soaring profits lifted almost all stocks in all sectors. In 1996 investors, like the companies themselves, will have to bet on the success or failure of very different corporate strategies for coping with a tough competitive environment. Investors will have to study companies in unfamiliar ways, looking at costs and manufacturing efficiencies, the growth or decline of margins, pricing strategies, and other indicators of competitive position. This year promises to be especially damaging to the second-rate.  <p><p><p>

						March 1996  <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> KEEPING UP  <p> By Teri Karush   <p> *Fidelity investments, reverting to an old policy, has told its fund managers to stop talking to the press about individual stocks. The decision follows news reports that Jeffrey Vinik, manager of Fidelity's flagship <a name="FUND:FMAGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FMAGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Magellan Fund</b></a>, publicly touted the stock of<a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> Micron Technology</b></a> even as he reduced Magellan's holdings in the stock. Fidelity now faces a class-action lawsuit from holders of Micron stock, accusing Vinik of market manipulation. Fidelity denies the charges.   <p> *MONEY magazine has fired columnist Dan Dorfman, saying that the stock tipster wouldn't disclose news sources to the publication's managing editor. Dorfman had been on paid leave from Money since October, when Business Week said federal authorities were investigating Dorfman. The commentator, who says Money erred in its decision, continues his regular broadcasts on CNBC.  <p> *Paine Webber has agreed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to set aside an additional $175 million (on top of the $120 million it has already paid) to settle charges that it misled investors when it sold hundreds of millions of dollars in risky limited partnerships during the 1980s. Paine Webber took a $200 million charge against earnings in last year's second quarter in anticipation of the settlement.  <p> *A task force of securities-arbitration officials, headed by former Securities and Exchange Commission chairman David Ruder, has recommended a total of 70 changes in the way investors and brokerages settle disputes, including a wider pool of arbitrators, substituting the current six-year deadline for filing cases with existing statutes of limitations, and a cap on punitive damages of two times compensatory damages (up to $750,000). The recommendations go to the board of the National Association of Securities Dealers, which handles 85 percent of all arbitration cases. The changes could be in place before the end of the year.  <p> *Banks are doing a worse job of warning novice investors about the risks inherent in mutual funds, according to a survey by Prophet Market Research, based in San Francisco. Prophet says that, during an undercover audit of 400 brokers working at banks, 27 percent failed to caution investors that mutual funds aren't protected by federal deposit insurance. A year earlier, only 20 percent of the brokers surveyed neglected to give the warning to Prophet researchers, who posed as potential customers with $25,000 to invest.  <p> *President Clinton has recently signed a law barring a state from reaching beyond its borders to tax the pension benefits of retirees who earned their benefits while working in the state but have since moved elsewhere. The practice, which Worth reported in the October 1995 issue, had raised the ire of a number of retirement interest groups with the notable exception of the American Association of Retired Persons. The AARP says that it didn't support the bill for fear that it might prompt some states to limit tax deductions for pension contributions. <p>  <p>*Alan S. Blinder has returned to a teaching job at Princeton University after deciding against serving a second term as vice-chairman of the Federal Reserve. Blinder was a champion of lower unemployment and therefore lower interest rates.  <p> *The federal trade commission has given its blessing to a new Funeral Rule Offenders Program, under which funeral homes caught violating federal rules, such as the requirement that they provide itemized price lists to prospective clients would pay a fine to the U.S. Treasury and then undergo supervision by the National Funeral Directors Association.<p><p><p>

						March 1996   <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> GLOBAL MARKETS  <p> By Todd G. Bucholz  <p> SPAIN & FRANCE <p>A member of the Clinton administration once remarked that he would like to be reincarnated as the bond market, since it has more influence than officials in Washington.   <p> Last year's extraordinary global bond rally was proof that this is true far beyond Washington. The rally was fueled by fiscally conservative governments, from Brazil to Canada, that sought to find favor with foreign investors and big banks bond buyers all by cutting spending and privatizing national businesses. <p> Now it's Spain's turn; its markets have rocketed ahead as traders grow confident that a conservative government will come to power after the March 3 elections. Yields on ten-year bonds (called bonos) dropped from 10.14 percent on December 1 to 9.27 percent on January 18. Meanwhile, the Spanish economy is growing at between 2.5 and 3.0 percent a year, among the highest rates in Europe, and Spain's peseta is rallying against the deutsche mark. Trading at 93.35 in March 1995, the peseta is now valued at about 84 to the mark. It has remained strong even as the Bank of Spain has cut rates.  <p> The key to the Spanish economy lies in keeping inflation, which ended 1995 at a perfectly reasonable 4.3 percent, in check. Can this continue? The stronger peseta makes it easier, and global inflation levels look fairly tame. At the same time, Spain still suffers from 22.7 percent unemployment, so the Spanish public is paying a big price to boost the peseta. Labor laws have made businesses reluctant to hire new workers and hence expand because it can be impossible to fire them. There's lots of room for growth if the government loosens its regulatory grip.  <p> This is one of several economic issues that may be decided by the elections. The conservative leader of the Popular Party, José María Aznar, was expected to defeat incumbent Socialist premier Felipe González in 1993, but the charismatic González pulled off a surprise victory. Even if the Populists win this time around, they may have to form a coalition with the Catalanparty (CiU), which advocates political and financial autonomy for Catalonia. Markets don't like coalitions, which tend to be unwieldy and unstable.   <p> If Aznar wins, he and his party will inherit a fairly strong economy and a government that has already begun the process of economic reform. González sold large stakes in the banking, energy, and telecommunications sectors to the public, and he curtailed public spending as a percentage of gross domestic product. The big savings are yet to come from social security and pensions but it's unlikely the Populists will have the clout or the will to tackle them.  <p> For equity investors in the <a name="FUND:ABUSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ABUSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>U.S., Alliance Capital Management's Spain Fund</b></a> languished at about 8.50 for most of fall 1995, but moved up to 9.50 in mid-January. But keep in mind that González may not yet have exhausted his store of charisma.  <p> NOT SO WILD OATS <p>Last spring, the French elected as president Jacques Chirac, the conservative former prime minister. The Chirac government has struggled inconclusively to convince the financial markets that it has the guts to cut France's huge retirement and social-security programs and  bloated civil service. Because of this, the markets have on occasion punished the French franc and OATs (bonds). Last fall was the low-water mark. In October, the Bank of France ordered emergency rate hikes to defend the franc against speculators, and in November and December, strikes paralyzed the country. Still, the French markets have begun 1996 in pretty good shape. As of late January, the franc had risen about 3 percent against the deutsche mark since mid-October, and the stock market ended last year up about 8 percent.   <p> Now, though, France's economy is weakening with GDP growth around 2 percent and overall demand shrinking. A slower economy meansless money in Treasury coffers, so deficits may rise, not fall,in 1996. French bonds may do well initially, reflecting the growing weakness of other French investments, but by spring the nation's fiscal mess will cause the risks on bonds, too, to rise.  <p> Contributing editor Todd G. Buchholz is president of the G7 Group Inc., an international economic-consulting firm, and author of From Here to Economy (Dutton, 1995).  <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING  <p> The most recent additions to our panel of experts, these four top financial-newsletter writers identify their favorite domestic stocks. The price listed is the maximum at which the author considers a stock attractive. In some cases, the newsletter writer may hold the stock either in a personal account or in a fund he manages. He also may have changed his opinion after the publishing deadline for this issue.  <p>  <p>JIM McCAMANT <p>Medical Technology Stock Letter  <p> Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.  <p>  <p><a name="NASD:ARRS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16571"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ARRIS PHARMACEUTICAL</b></a> up to $12  Nasdaq: ARRS  <p>  <p>Arris (South San Francisco, California) is a development-stage biotech company focusing on protease inhibition. Its lead product, APC 366-A (for the treatment of asthma), is already in clinical trials. Arris's broad technology base has allowed it to sign deals with quality partners such as Amgen, Bayer, and Pharmacia. Funds committed by these partners (Bayer, for example, has put up $40 million) more than exceed the current market capitalization of Arris and help off set losses. The stock's performance should improve in 1996 as the results of the trials come in over the next year. My 18-month target for the stock is $20.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> MICHAEL MURPHY <p>California Technology Stock Letter  <p> Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.  <p>  <p><a name="NASD:VICL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16150"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>VICAL</b></a> up to $11  Nasdaq: VICL  <p>  <p>Vical (San Diego) is the leading publicly traded gene-therapy company. It emphasizes naked DNA technology, which doesn't require a virus to carry a cure, and just started phase-two trials for a melanoma drug called allovectin. If phase two goes as well as phase one (in which there were some cases of complete remission), it may be able to bypass phase three. Vical has invested $40 million in R&D, yet its market value is only $120 million. So the stock is cheap by that measure. <a name="NYSE:RP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rhone Poulenc</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a> are strong partners. My target is $18 a share for 1996 and $100 a share for 1997 or 1998, whenever (or if) allovect in wins federal approval.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> LOUIS NAVELLIER <p>MPT Review  <p> Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks.  <p>  <p><a name="NASD:ASND"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41997"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ASCEND COMMUNICATIONS</b></a> up to $40  Nasdaq: ASND  <p>  <p>Ascend (Alameda, California) is ascending because it's one of the few Internet stocks that actually earn a profit. It does so because it supplies hardware for servers and has few competitors. As traffic on the Net builds, the servers that control the traffic will need more of Ascend's hardware. Last quarter, sales were up 289 percent over the like period last year. Improvement in the company's margins have paused recently but should resume in 1996. Following a two-for-one stock split scheduled for early1996, the stock could more than double to $80. It's a great story, but this stock is hotter than hot. This is a risky play.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> DAN SULLIVAN <p>The Chartist  <p> Uses technical analysis to identify long-term equity investments. <p>  <p><a name="NASD:HBOC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13619"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>HBO & COMPANY</b></a> up to $92  Nasdaq: HBOC  <p>  <p>HBO (Atlanta) designs, sells, and services information-processing systems for hospitals. Its software facilitates patient care, as well as clinical and financial management. The stock is extremely attractive on a relative strength basis, and profits have consistently outperformed analysts' expectations. In the third quarter, earnings rose 65 percent to 38 cents a share from 23 cents a year earlier. Given the ongoing pressure on health-care costs, we expect HBO's profits to improve about 30 percent annually over the next three to five years. One warning: the shares have experienced an impressive run-up of late; above-average volatility is likely in the short term.  <p><p><p>

						Eight acclaimed mutual fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite stocks. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund at a price lower than the one mentioned here the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. The manager may also have sold the stock after December 22, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these eight managers are meant to illustrate a broad range of successful investing styles. Before readers buy any stock, Worth strongly recommends that they conduct their own due diligence.  <p>  <p>PRESTON ATHEY <p><a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value</b></a>  <p> Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.  <p>  <p><a name="ASE:SGA"></a><b>SAGA COMMUNICATIONS</b> up to $17  ASE: SGA  <p>  <p>Saga (Gross Pointe Farms, Michigan) operates one television station in Missouri and 24 radio stations in the East and Midwest, including Columbus, Ohio; Norfolk, Virginia; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. This is a conservative, low-debt company that has been growing at a slower, more deliberate pace than its peers mainly because it hasn't been willing to pay exorbitant prices for acquisitions. If the economy softens, Saga is in a position to scoop up some good deals. Saga's stock currently trades at 10 times its 1995 after-tax cash flow cheap in comparison with the 17.7 average for its industry. This could be a $20 stock by the end of 1996. <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> JAMES P.

Instead of acquiring other banks, it has been buying their security-processing departments, such as J. P. Morgan's and Bank of America's. Security processing involves high fixed costs, so BK gains leverage on its margins with each acquisition. It just announced a 16-million-share buyback for 1996. BK is highly efficient: Non-interest expenses are only 49 percent of revenues and heading even lower. (The industry average is over 55 percent.) Equity as a percent of capital is also well above average. We think the stock could trade at 12 times expected 1997 earnings of $5.65 a share within a year, or $68.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> SHELBY M.

It has one of the best efficiency ratios in the business and recently signed arrangements to put small banking centers in eight of the ten largest supermarket chains. This will significantly lower its branch costs. Wells Fargo is also at the forefront of electronic banking. Management runs the bank as if it owned it, buying back a lot of stock. If the much-talked-about merger with First Interstate happens, it would create huge savings. The stock, which is selling at around the industry average often times 1995 earnings, could move to $300 a share within the next 18 to 24 months.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> DANIEL B.

So MEMC is in the driver's seat and should have a very good year. Polycon (material used to make wafers) is tough to get, but MEMC makes two-thirds of its own supply. In addition, there's nota lot of competition in this area. I expect the company, which earned $1.65 a share in 1994, to make $2.57 a share in 1995 and at least $3.20 in 1996.  <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> WILLIAM J.

There's some risk because UNC has more long-term debt ($160 million) than equity ($110 million). But the stock is trading at only four times cash flow. UNC turned the corner in 1995 and should be more profitable in 1996. We're looking for earnings of 20 cents a share in 1995 and at least 50 to 70 cents in 1996.   <p> - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -- - - - - - - - -   <p> ERIC E.

The stock has declined sharply on concerns over slowing growth in the cellular market. My positive stance is based on three things: the company's expansion in overseas cellular markets; strong, shareholder-focused management; and a low valuation for the premier company in a rapidly growing industry. Trading at 10 times 1996 estimated earnings and 8.6 times 1997 estimates, Nokia shares should appreciate into the low $50s.

Because this form of care is relatively inexpensive, the field is growing rapidly. Lincare has a leading market share in a highly fragmented industry and has been growing both internally and through acquisitions. The stock was hurt by the proposed Medicare cutbacks, yet even if the government goes ahead with its latest proposal, Lincare's 1996 earnings will still grow by 10 cents a share to $1.90. We think Lincare's sellout value is more than $40 a share, or 12 times 1995 cashflow.

This has driven the stock even lower and created a buying opportunity. This maker of leisure footwear is struggling in the U.S., but its position worldwide versus Nike's is stronger than Pepsi's versus <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coke</b></a>'s. The business has excellent economics: Reebok does the design and marketing, but the shoes are made by foreign manufacturers. Reebok is using excess cash flow to repurchase stock. The shares are cheap, selling at around 8 times our estimate for 1996 earnings of three dollars a share; Nike's multiple is 18. <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know/Street Wise  <p> KEEPING UP  <p> By Teri Karush  <p> * Congress has overridden a presidential veto and passed legislation that will make it harder for investors to sue underwriters, corporate officers, and accountants. The measure received intense support from major accounting firms, the brokerage industry, and high-technology companies (which have been vulnerable to shareholder lawsuits because of the extreme volatility of their stocks). Consumer groups and many state securities regulators opposed the legislation. Among other things, the bill protects a company and its officers from being sued over predictions about future corporate performance.  <p>  <p>* The securities industry began lobbying to head off a Treasury Department proposal that would reduce certain tax advantages associated with preferred stock and instruments with maturities exceeding 40 years. These would include instruments known as trust-originated preferred securities (sold by <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> as TOPrS) and monthly-income preferred securities (sold by Goldman Sachs as MIPS). TOPrS and MIPS had been popular among fixed-income investors because they pay dividends as much as one percentage point higher than corporate bonds. With the outlook for TOPrS and MIPS clouded by the Treasury proposal, Merrill Lynch unveiled a new instrument called a "cumulative fixed/adjustable rate preferred stock" (or FRAP). A FRAP offers investors a sweeter dividend if Congress does change the tax law.  <p>  <p>* <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a> has said that it plans to provide online banking over the Internet by the second half of this year. Users will be able to download free software to establish their home banking connection. At the moment, Intuit requires customers to own its Quicken personal-finance software and to dial into a private network in order to bank electronically.  <p>  <p>* The Clinton administration has floated the possibility thatit may seek to close a tax loop hole that involves "shorting against the box." Investors use the hedging technique to lock in profits on stocks while deferring capital-gains taxes.  <p>  <p>* Most mutual funds reveal their investments only twice a year. But GIT Investment Funds of Arlington, Virginia, has begun posting the portfolios of its four equity funds and five tax-free bond funds each day on the Internet. The portfolios appear on GIT's home page at http://www.gitfunds.com.  <p>  <p>* Using an ATM may get more expensive following a decision by Visa U.S.A. to allow its member banks to charge noncustomers for using its Plus system ATMs. Charges could range from 25 cents a transaction to $2.50 starting in April, when the new policy takes effect. MasterCard International, which operates Cirrus, may follow the move. <p>   <p> * <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a> has backed away from its previously reported promise to discontinue paying for order flow on Nasdaq stocks the controversial practice of buying customer orders from other dealers, bundling them together, and reselling them at a profit. Schwab now says such a move would be financially impractical. <p>  <p>* The Internal Revenue Service won't come close to its goal of receiving 80 million tax returns electronically by 2001, according to the General Accounting Office. The GAO also predicted that the number of 1995 electronic returns filed with the IRS will drop about 10 percent to 14.8 million from 1994's 16.4 million. <p>  <p>* Some supermarkets now offer two kinds of cabbage. About 35 banks have installed automated loan machines (ALMs) at approximately 60 locations, including grocery stores, according to Affinity Technology Group. The ALMs provide unsecured personal loans of up to $10,000. Users typically need a driver's license and a major credit card.  <p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> THE DOW IS NOT THE MARKET <p>Just seven stocks drove the latest surge of the Dow average.What does that tell us?  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> All investors know "the Market" is up, but how much? The Dow Jones index of 30 industrials, for example, climbed from 4755.48 on October 31, 1995, to 5176.73 on December 15 a little more than 8.8 percent. The Standard & Poor's 500 Index didn't do quite as well; it rose 6 percent. The Value Line Index lagged even further behind, with an increase of just 4.1 percent. And then, of course, there's the poor Nasdaq Index, which tracks the over-the-counter market. According to this measure, the market isn't up at all the Nasdaq fell 0.5 percent in the period.  <p> The recent divergence of these indexes is telling investors about a change in the style of this market and signaling its future. To interpret this story, though, it's necessary to understand how each index is constructed.  <p> The Dow is the most frequently cited index when people say the market is up or down, they're usually referring to the Dow but it's also the index least representative of the market as a whole. Despite many changes in its membership, the Dow, which datesback to 1896, is a relic of an earlier America. The index, which is revised by <a name="NYSE:DJ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dow Jones & Co.</b></a> when it seems too far out of touch with the current economy, is heavy on old-style industrial stocks and light on consumer and technology companies.

Partly because of what the Dow is missing. During that late-1995 period when the market pummeled technology stocks the Pacific Stock Exchange Technology Index fell 3.9 percent in ten weeks it was to the Dow's great benefit that it contained only one pure technology company, IBM. That stock did go down 7 percent in that time.  <p> But even more important is what the Dow includes and how the average is calculated. The Dow is a price-weighted index; it is calculated by dividing the price of one share of each stock by a divisor (currently 0.34599543). This means that a big dollar change in the price of an expensive stock counts for more than a big percentage increase in a cheaper stock. To see the implications of this, look at the movement in two stocks, AT&T and Westinghouse, between October 31 and December 15.  <p> AT&T gained $4 a share during that time and closed at $68. Westinghouse gained $1.88 a share to close at $16. And the impact of each on the Dow? AT&T moved the Dow average by $11.56 twice as much as Westinghouse, even though AT&T was up just 6.25 percent and Westinghouse was up 13.3 percent.   <p> As a matter of fact, just seven stocks Boeing, General Electric, Goodyear, Merck, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing, Philip Morris, and Texaco account for 44 percent of the Dow's climb from October 31 to December 15.  <p> Specific circumstances fueled some of those stocks 3M announced a restructuring, and Boeing rose on an upturn in orders for jetliners and the end of a strike but the fact that they've thrived as a group testifies to investors' appetite for stocks with solid and predictable earnings and broad exposure to international markets. In comparison, the Nasdaq Index, with its heavy exposure to faster-growing but less predictable technology stocks, went nowhere during the same period.  <p> Looking at another set of indexes helps to flesh out this picture. The Frank Russell Company's Russell 3,000 tracks a universe of 3,000 stocks. The company also breaks that universe into pieces by size (large- and small-capitalization companies) and style (value and growth). After ten months in which growth stocks outperformed value stocks, value stocks surged ahead for companies of everysize to close 1995.  <p> For the short run, at least, the indexes tell investors that the market has entered a new stage. Whereas the first three quarters of 1995 belonged to high technology specifically and growth-at-any-price stocks in general, recent months have rewarded investors in Dow stocks with more predictable growth rates and in purer value plays.  <p> In the longer run, this strategy may not be as safe as it seems, according to another index. In contrast to the Dow, the Value Line Index isn't price-weighted. Instead it assumes that an equal dollar amount is invested in each of the 1,632 stocks that the index tracks. So this index gives a better picture of how a typical stock has performed.  <p> All last year, the Value Line Index underperformed the Dow 35.01 percent for the Dow versus 24.50 percent for Value Line through mid-December and that underperformance has been accelerating.While the price appreciation of the Value Line Index was 70 percent that of the Dow for 1995 through December 15, for just the period of October 31 to December 15 the appreciation of the Value Line Index was only 47 percent that of the Dow.  <p> That divergence has raised warning flags among investors who know that a market in which gains go to an ever-smaller population of stocks isn't healthy. Investors can use these indexes they all appear weekly in Barron's to measure market danger. A rising Dow isn't great news if the real market doesn't follow.  <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> FIXED INCOME <p>The Problem With UITs  <p> By Bernice Napach   <p> In the first three quarters of 1995, investors put $2.8 billion into municipal unit investment trusts, or UITs. It's easy to understand why municipal-bond UITs seem to combine the advantages of bond funds and individual bonds. Like a fund, a UIT offers diversification through a fixed portfolio of about seven to ten different bonds. And like individual bonds, UITs have a set maturity, or a specific date by which investors can recoup their principal. <p> But UITs aren't as good a deal as they appear. They carry loads which range from 2 percent of assets for a five-year trust to 4.9 percent for a 25-year UIT and annual expenses of 20 basis points. Compare that with the up-front charge of zero on any no-load muni-bond fund.  <p> Right now UITs are particularly bad news for long-term investors. Although a 25-year UIT will spread the effect of that 4.9 percent load over a long period, it also locks an investor into current low yields for too long. At the end of November 1995, the estimated net long-term return on a five-year muni UIT ranged from 3.7 percent to 4.4 percent (equivalent to 5.4 percent to 6.4 percent for those in the 31 percent tax bracket). The estimated return on a 25-year trust was just 1.5 percentage points higher.  <p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> 3   WE'LL TREAT YOU LIKE GOLD. For the first time, banks are peddling gold cards even more aggressively than standard plates, according to the market-research firm Behavioral Analysis. And in case prestige isn't enough, more banks are waiving annual fees and offering low introductory rates on 24K plastic, too. BAI found that 95 percent (up from 84 percent in 1994) of all gold-card offers carried no fees and 80 percent (up from 54 percent) came with special rates.  <p> 3WHAT, NO LOLLIPOP? Ask physicians "Where does it hurt?" and they'll probably point to their wallets. According to the American Medical Association, doctors' annual income dropped 6 percent, to $92,000, in 1994. That's the first time doctors' income has gone any way except up in more than a decade, and it may help explain why the trend among doctors is to cluster in group practices. "A solo physician probably can't afford the latest technology," says Dennis Barnhardt of the Medical Group Management Association. "With group practices, the doctors can divvy costs and reduce overhead."   <p> 3OWNERSHIP ADVANTAGE. A recent study by the consulting and accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand reveals that businesses run by their founders expand faster than those headed by inheritors or new owners. Over the past five years, founder-run companies have grown 66 percent more quickly than businesses in the other two categories.  <p> 3WALL STREET WANTS NERDS. With online banking and financial services so popular, financial firms need techno savants more than ever before. And they're looking in all the right places to recruit them. "More financial firms come every year," says Dianne McLauchlin of the California Institute of Technology, where ten financial-services companies scouted for talent on campus last year. At MIT, the percentage of firms who come calling for future graduates has more than doubled in the past decade.  <p> 3ENGLISH MAJORS WANT JOBS. College graduates with liberal-arts degrees, meanwhile, get less attention. According to a new Michigan State University report on recruiting trends, liberal-arts majors accounted for 7.6 percent of new college grads hired last year, significantly down from 15.6 percent in 1994.  <p> 3DON'T FORGET THE GUEST ROOM. Nearly 25 percent of first-time home buyers (up nearly 5 percent since 1988) now get a monetary gift from kin for the down payment, according to a new study. "Those who do get gifts tend to save less because they anticipate the money from relatives," notes Chris Mayer, economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston and co-author of the study.  <p> 3BOY TALK. Shattering one gender stereotype, a survey by <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a> Home Business Resources reveals that of those who work at home, men (82 percent) are more likely than women (70 percent) to make personal phone calls while on the job. Note, however, that women (84 percent) outdo men (72 percent) when it comes to coiffing before work.  <p> 3THE NET HAS EYES. When employees are pleasure-surfing the WorldWide Web on the job, that is. According to a recent survey by new-media market-research firm Jupiter Communications, Web users spend an average of ten hours per week browsing the Net at work. But are they chatting about Baywatch or doing work-related research? Thanks to a monitoring device created by Webster Network Strategies, a privately held Florida-based software company, employers can now find out and even block Net access to time wasters. Webster already counts <a name="NYSE:LMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10903"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lockheed Martin</b></a>, Sikorsky Aircraft, and Northeast Utilities among its clients.   <p> S.H.E., INC. The number of women-owned businesses has jumped 43 percent since 1990, according to the National Foundation for Women Business Owners. <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> MARKET RADAR  <p> Market Radar loses its sole positive indicator this month as investment advisers turn optimistic, a traditional sign that a market top may be at hand. The advance/decline line and the bellwether composite continue to show serious weakness. Since the financial markets largely anticipated the December 19 interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve, the cut won't be enough to turn any of these indicators positive. That will require further interest-rate reductions and a budget deal in Washington.   <p> ADVANCE/DECLINE LINE  The line tracing the broad market has drifted upward but barely matches its October high, an anemic performance compared with the blue-chip indexes. The divergence will be resolved by renewed strength in the broader market or, more likely, by a downturn in the indexes.  <p> COMPOSITE BELLWETHER  This indicator has hit a three-month low. The two components are in a tug-of-war: Utilities are holding up, but many brokerage stocks have lost half their 1995 gains. Are investors in utilities because of optimism about interest rates, or are they just looking for a safe haven?   <p> ADVISORY SENTIMENT Investment advisers have bounced back from a bout of severe pessimism, and that could spell trouble. Advisers stayed skeptical for much of last year's rally; now, with optimism back to the high side of the normal range, this indicator urges caution. Much higher and it would be signaling a market top. <p> YIELD RATIO This is Market Radar's water-torture indicator; this month marks the one-year anniversary of its turning negative, and the numbers just keep getting worse. Again, yields on T-bills hold their own, while the S&P 500 yield slips another four basis points. Will the Fed's December 19 rate cut stop the ratio's slide?  <p> MONETARY EXPOSURE PROFILE Just as in July, the December cut in the Federal Funds rate was a case of the Fed's playing catch-up; market interest rates had already declined to similar levels. Although this move didn't change the MEP reading, a further rate cut by the Fed could turn this indicator positive.   <p> CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEBT The amount of consumer and corporate debt is still going up, but the rate of increase remains stuck in the steady-as-she-goes 5 percent range. Recent interest-rate declines could spur companies to issue more debt, but they won't impel consumers to borrow more.  <p> ASSET ALLOCATION <p>Cracking On  <p> The U.S. market may be choppy, but none of the four private banks in our monthly survey is trimming its sails. UBS adds stocks: five percentage points domestically and seven points internationally. Bessemer shifts one percentage point from overseas equities to U.S. bonds; Brown Brothers and Northern Trust stay their courses. <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE RECOMMENDING  <p> Four top financial-newsletter writers join us this month, each identifying his favorite domestic stock. The price listed is the maximum at which the author considers it attractive. In some cases, the newsletter writer may hold the stock either in a personal account or in a fund he manages. He also may have changed his opinion after October 23, the publishing deadline for this issue. <p>  <p>Writer: JIM MCCAMANT <p>Medical Technology Stock Letter  <p>Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:AGPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12537"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AGOURON PHARMACEUTICALS </b></a>  $30  Nasdaq: AGPH<p>California-based Agouron is the leader in structure-based drug design. Basically, it develops new molecules that attach themselves to specific proteins. The stock has been strong based on early clinical trials of protease inhibitor, a class of AIDS drug. Less noticed is the potential for the company's new anti-cancer drug, which also is showing impressive results in early clinical trials. Agouron also has a pipeline of other excellent products. The company has a total market capitalization $270 million and has a very high level of cash--more than $100 million.  <p>  <p>Writer: MICHAEL MURPHY <p>California Technology Stock Letter <p>Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:EUPH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=44511"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>EUPHONIX</b></a>  $10  Nasdaq: EUPH <p>Euphonix went public in August. It makes digital user interfaces for audio mixing boards. Its product helps reduce studio time and is less expensive than the competition's. Three quarters of its revenue comes from music business, 15 percent from film and television postproduction (for such features as Entertainment Tonight, The Lion King, and Crimson Tide). Short-term sales grow this close to 50 percent a year. I expect earnings of 25 cents a share in 1995 on sales of $14 million. I see the stock rising to the equivalent of 30 times projected 1996 earnings, which would get it up to $12 a share early next year.  <p>  <p>Writer: LOUIS NAVELLIER <p>MPT Review <p>Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, low-volatility stocks.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:ZIGO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15204"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ZYGO </b></a> $40  Nasdaq: ZIGO <p>Zygo, based in Middlefield, Connecticut, makes precison optical equipment for manufacturers. Companies from a variety of industries (Canon accounts for 32 percent of sales) use these measuring instruments to monitor product quality. With Wall Street looking for new technology industries, this is one of the hotter groups right now. It is a very small company with strong sales and margin expansion, so when institutions start biting, it could go up quickly. Right now, there are more buyers than sellers. Profit was 25 cents a share for the second quarter, up from 8 cents a year earlier.  <p>  <p>Writer: DAN SULLIVAN <p>The Chartist <p>Uses technical analysis to identify long-term equity investments. <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NYSE:HPC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10721"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>HERCULES </b></a>  $62  NYSE: HPC <p>So what if chemicals are boring? The profits aren't. Hercules's earnings have increased at an annual clip of 25 percent during the past 5 years. I think this is sustainable. For one thing, Hercules is still finding ways to reduce costs. Second, it is aggressively expanding overseas, especially in Asia and in Latin America. Third, it is continuing to divest non-core businesses. It is using some of the cash it is raising from selling businesses to repurchase its own shares--at a rate of 5 to 6 percent of the outstanding shares annually. The stock buy back program should go a long way toward increasing shareholder value.  <p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE BUYING NOW  <p> Eight acclaimed mutual fund managers tell Worth readers about their current favorite domestic stocks. The price listed is the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. Assume that the manager has bought the stock for his fund, perhaps at a lower price than the one mentioned here. The manager may also have sold the stock after October 23, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these eight managers illustrate a broad range of successful investment styles. The picks on these pages are intended to serve as long-term recommendations.  <p>  <p>Manager: PRESTON ATHEY <p><a name="FUND:PRSUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value </b></a><p>
Invests in value stocks with market capitalizations under $250 million.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:UICI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15009"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UNITED INSURANCE </b></a>   $20  Nasdaq: UICI <p>Two things make this company, which sells health and life insurance to small businesses, special. One is Ron Jensen, the founder and chief executive. He's a true salesman, plus he gets paid $1 a year and writes his annual report like Warren Buffett. The other: 60 percent of the outstanding shares of stock is owned by management, employees, and the 5,200 agents who sell the policies. The incentive this provides is an advantage no competitor has, and it shows on the bottom line: Revenue has been rising at 19 percent annually, earnings per share at 41 percent. EPS should maintain this pace in 1995.   <p>  <p>Manager: JAMES P. CRAIG <p><a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund </b></a> <p>Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NYSE:UTX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11559"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UNITED TECHNOLOGIES </b></a>  $90  NYSE: UTX <p>UTX is improving its profit margins by cutting costs at each of its five divisions: aircraft (Pratt & Whitney), air conditioners (Carrier), elevators (Otis), flight systems, and automotive parts. The aircraft unit has captured a big chunk of the market for 777 jet engines, due to delays at <a name="NYSE:GE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10634"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GE</b></a>. Replacement of air conditioners should increase over the next five to six years due to environmental regulations. UTX is trading at a very low 11 times expected 1996 earnings of $7.60 a share. I think the stock could rise to $110 a share within a year, which would provide more than a 20 percent return on investment.  <p>  <p>Manager: SHELBY M.C. DAVIS <p><a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a> <p>Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NYSE:EQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13307"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>EQUITABLE COMPANIES </b></a>  $24  NYSE: EQ <p>Equitable is a potential growth company disguised as a financial concern. Its stock warrants a higher valuation than that of other insurers because of its diverse business mix, which includes investment banking, money management, and real estate in addition to insurance. Equitable's book value is close to $20 per share, barely below the stock's recent price. Life and annuity sales are picking up. Its Alliance Capital unit is gaining new assets. And Equitable will soon sell stock in its Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette unit. Earnings should exceed $2 a share in 1996. My 18-month target for this stock is $30.  <p>  <p>Manager: DANIEL B. LEONARD <p><a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology </b></a> <p>Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:ITRI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16259"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ITRON </b></a>  $32  Nasdaq: ITRI <p>Based in Spokane, Washington, Itron makes electronic measuring instruments for gas, electric, and water utilities. Its customers include more than 1,200 utilities worldwide. Itron recently signed lucrative contracts with Public Service of Colorado and Puget Sound Power and Light. Annual sales growth is around 35 percent, but earnings are rising at an even faster clip. Net income was 67 cents a share in 1994. I'm looking for 80 cents in 1995 and $1.15 in 1996. No big New York research firms follow the company, but when they catch on, the stock should get a boost. My 12-month target for the stock is $45.  <p>  <p>Manager: WILLIAM J. NASGOVITZ, HUGH F. DENISON <p><a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value Fund </b></a> <p>Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be undervalued. <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NYSE:URS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14365"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>URS </b></a> $7  NYSE: URS <p>URS Corp., a leading engineering and architectural-services firm based in San Francisco, does design work for infrastructure, environmental, and telecommunications projects. The company's backlog and designations (work that has been awarded but hasn't brought in any money yet) total a record-high $400 million. Despite one of the lowest overhead rates in the business and annual earnings-growth potential of 15 percent, URS is trading at only 8.6 times projected1995 profit of 75 cents a share. The Street is ignoring URS's industry, but we think there's a lot of work out there to keep this company busy.  <p>  <p>Manager: ERIC E. RYBACK <p><a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a><p>Seeks current income first, capital appreciation second.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:GNCMA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11424"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GENERAL COMMUNICATION </b></a> $5.50  Nasdaq: GNCMA<p>This Alaska-based telecommunications company is 30 percent owned by <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI Communications</b></a>.

Based on strong cashflow, profitable operations, savvy management, and the value of its personal-communications services, a fair takeover price for the stock might be $8 or $10 a share, more than double the current price. GC also recently announced its intention to buyback 100,000 of its shares. This move should provide strong downside support for the stock.  <p>  <p>Manager: RALPH WANGER, CHUCK McQUAID <p><a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund</b></a><p>Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NASD:WFSL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15118"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>WASHINGTON FEDERAL </b></a> $25  Nasdaq: WFSL <p>Washington Federal is a savings and loan association with 85 branches in five states, including Washington, Idaho, Oregon, Utah, and Arizona. In addition to being well capitalized (13 percent equity-to-assets ratio versus 8 percent for the industry),WFSL is a low-cost lender: Its expense ratio of 24 percent is less than half the industry average. Now that interest rates are going down again, we expect this S&L's margins and earnings to improve. We think the stock should trade at 12 times earnings, which gives us a target price for the stock one year from now of $36 a share.  <p>  <p>Manager: DONALD A. YACKTMAN <p><a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund </b></a> <p> Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion.  <p> This Month's Pick: <a name="NYSE:UST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11533"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UST </b></a> $31  NYSE: UST <p>UST stock is like a beach ball being held under water--when it surfaces, it will really pop. This maker of smokeless tobacco is one of the most profitable, if not the most profitable, manufacturing companies in the country. Its brands include Copenhagen, Skoal, and Skoal Bandits. But ongoing worries about the liability of tobacco companies has held the stock down for four years, even though earnings have grown from $1.18 a share in 1991 to $2.15 this year and an expected $2.40 in 1996. Management raises the dividend every year and is buying back shares. <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> TRENDSPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> * DEPTH OF A SALESMAN. Die-hard peddlers might not sell their own grandmother, but they would consider haggling with Mom and Dad--or misadvising a client. In a recent survey of 2,000 salespeople, 22 percent of used-car sellers and 15 percent of stockbrokers admitted they would out negotiate their parents for a done deal. Even worse, 21 percent of stockbrokers said they would pitch advice to a customer that they would not follow themselves. "Some are so desperate to get clients, they'll do anything to sell," says Robert Shook, who conducted the study. By the way, Shook himself is trying to sell something: his new book, The Greatest Sales Stories Ever Told From the World's Best Salespeople.  <p> * SAY IT AIN'T SO. Baseball fans who think they purchased the late Mickey Mantle's autograph for a steal may have struck out instead. Sweet Spot, a publication that tracks sports collectibles, reports that Mantle forgeries have been on the rise following the famed Yankee's death. "Mick fans who got a signed ball or photo for less than $85 probably bought a fake," says editor and publisher Charles Kaufman. "The market has become less scrupulous as demand for Mantle memorabilia increases."  <p> * TAKE A LOAD OFF. That's what mutual fund investors are doing: No-load funds have grown at more than one and a half times the rate of load funds over the past nine years, according to a recently released study by Goldman, Sachs. Some investors also plan to bypass full-service brokers. A poll by the Investment Company Institute found that while 41 percent of first-time buyers purchased their mutual-fund shares from a full-service broker, only 25 percent anticipate going through a broker next time. <p>  <p>* EXPECT A BIRTHDAY CARD FROM YOUR BROKER. According to a recent study commissioned by Oppenheimer Management Corp. and Registered Representative magazine, 54 percent of financial advisers crave a personal friendship with their clients. Only 24 percent of investors, however, want to buddy up with brokers.  <p> * STICKER AFTERSHOCK. If your new car was expensive to buy, don't expect it to be cheap to drive. When market-research firm Runzheimer International estimated operating costs for selected1996 model cars, it put the annual price of driving a Mercedes 320S at $19,832. That amount reflects fuel, insurance, and other expenses, as well as depreciation. Keeping a 1996 Ford Taurus on the road requires only $8,704 annually, Runzheimer said. <p> * HOUSTON, WE FORGOT THE ASHES. With cremation steadily gaining favor as a funeral option, one company hopes to cash in on the trend: Celestis Inc. of Houston plans to launch a space memorial service. For $4,800, the company will rocket a loved one's ashes into orbit.  <p> * HONEY, GET THE AXE. Although sales of Christmas trees have declined since 1993, the number of cut-your-own-tree farms continues to grow. "A quarter of all tree buyers will head to these farms to chop down their own tree this year," says Joan Geiger of the National Christmas Tree Association. "It's more of a family outing than just getting one from a corner lot." Expect to pay anywhere from $3.10 to $5.65 per foot for a tree this holiday season. <p> * OFF-RAMPS ON THE INFOBAHN. Everyone's plugging in their modems and going online, it seems. But are they staying there? After surveying 10,000 personal-computer users, consulting firm IntecoCorp. estimated that 6.2 million people have tried and later canceled a subscription to one of the top five online services. <p>  * STANDING ROOM ONLY. A recently sold seat on the New York Stock Exchange commanded $950,000, up 14.4 percent from last year's high of $830,000. That's not necessarily a good omen.The record price for a seat on the Big Board, $1.15 million, was paid just a month before the 1987 crash.  <p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> SPECULATION FOR THE MASSES <p>"Just put that on my card," and other signs that the bubble may burst  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> Have you Noticed that Wall Street is paying more and more attention to the amount of money flowing into mutual funds? That's because the difference between a 7000 Dow and a sickening correction increasingly depends on these cash flows. At 1,834 days and counting (as of October 19, 1995), the current rally is the longest of this century--handily beating the second-place 1,492-day uphill charge of 1942-1946, according to Ned Davis Research. Since 1945, the market (as measured by the Standard & Poor's 500 index) has never risen for this long without a correction of 10 percent or greater. Why should this time be different?  <p> Because of cash from mutual fund investors, say those predicting a continued upward march. In the four weeks ended October 18, investors in stock mutual funds sent $8.2 billion in new capital chasing after a limited supply of equities. And that's after $11.5 billion over the previous four weeks. Every time the market tumbles for a day or two and threatens to correct, the optimists point out, this money steps in to buy the resulting "bargains."  <p> Nonsense, say the gurus of gloom. It's exactly this flood of new money that has prevented the healthy correction that all markets need. Instead we're in the middle of a speculative bubble, with investors willing to buy stocks at almost any price because they believe that some fund manager with money to invest will buy tomorrow at an even higher price. Just wait, the pessimists say, until all these investors head for the door at once.  <p> Financial history is full of speculative bubbles, from tulip maniain 17th-century Holland to the 1929 stock market crash in the U.S. to the real estate and stock euphoria that seized Japan during the 1980s and is still unwinding. Only the greatest pessimists are raising the specter of those financial disasters right now, but it's worthwhile taking the comparison seriously for a moment. Looking for signs of speculation in the stock market of 1995 can tell investors exactly why this market might be vulnerable to a downturn.  <p> Speculative bubbles share two traits. One, assets are bid up to prices far beyond their actual worth. And two, the frenzy of buying is sustained as investors borrow on the inflated value of the assets to buy more. Once the price of the assets used as collateral starts to fall, lenders demand payment (since the collateral behind the loan has just vanished), investors are forced to sell, and the market sinks all the faster.  <p> In 1995, valuations seem restrained--the price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500 was recently 16.7, which is historically average. It's leverage that connects today's market to bubbles of the past.  <p> Here's one current sign of leverage. Margin debt--loans made to investors by their brokers, secured by the investors' stocks and used to buy more shares--has risen steadily since 1991. Outstanding New York Stock Exchange margin debt stood at a record $71.4 billion at the end of August. According to Safian Investment Research, August's $7 billion jump was a record increase for a single month.  <p> Mutual fund investors may also be using their credit cards to finance their stock purchases--not directly by calling up a broker and saying, "Put 100 shares of Seligman Communications on my Visa," but by running up debts to pay for current consumption as they "save" for retirement.  <p> Largely because of stagnant incomes, the national ratio of consumer credit plus home-mortgage debt to income (wages and salaries) climbed to a record high of 115 percent in the second quarter of 1995, according to Safian.   <p> As leverage, margin loans and credit card debt seem like mild excesses when compared with mortgaging a house to buy tulips. But today's leverage makes this market especially sensitive to the direction of the economy. In an economic downturn, individual investors already facing high levels of debt would cut back on new investments in stocks and mutual funds. That's not enough to send the market into a tailspin, but it wouldn't help push it higher either. In a more severe recession, households, which currently hold about 33 percent of their financial assets incash--near the low since 1952--might be forced to liquidate some of their investments. That could undermine the market.  <p> So what should cautious investors watch? The standard reports on economic growth aren't useful indicators, because they severely lag events. Instead, try watching delinquency rates on credit card debt. After falling to 1.7 percent in late 1994, the lowest rate since 1969, delinquencies have moved back up to around 2 percent. That's still below 1992's 2.7 percent.  <p> Pay careful attention, also, to the consumer-confidence numbers calculated by the University of Michigan and the Conference Board. Flagging confidence could lead to an unwillingness to assume a greater debt load. That would have negative effects on both the stock market and the economy.  <p> And finally, pay attention to your own household leverage. This is no time to get caught short of cash when life issues one of its own unpredictable margin calls. By all means, follow the old rule that recommends keeping six months' income in cash. But also look out over the next year to 18 months to see what large-ticket expenditures lie in wait. If you were planning to pay for them by liquidating equities, think about what you'd do if the market fell and you still had to meet these obligations. Remember, if the market does correct, the profits will go to those who can buy at the bottom, not to those who had to sell there.  <p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> KEEPING UP  <p> By Teri Karush  <p> Securities firms have been falling all over themselves recently to show they care about the small investor--in some cases abandoning practices they once vehemently defended. <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a>took perhaps the boldest step, announcing that by year's end it will stop paying for order flow on Nasdaq stocks--the practice of buying customer orders from other dealers, bundling them together, and reselling them at a profit. Critics believe this behind-the-scenes industry custom undermines open bidding and results in less attractive prices for smaller investors.  <p> <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> meanwhile, said it will quit routing certain orders in New York Stock Exchange issues to the Pacific and Boston stock exchanges, where it has dealer operations. It promised that in the future it will send all orders only to a stock's primary market--where the stock is listed and where, presumably, demand is greatest.  <p> Finally, Dean Witter Reynolds ended its long-time holdout as one of the last major firms to pay its brokers more for selling proprietary products--including mutual funds and initial public stock offerings underwritten by the firm--than for selling outside products.   <p> ----- <p>Congress is weighing a rule change that would allow highly paid employees to contribute the maximum amount to their 401(k) plans regardless of the level of participation by lower-paid workers. Next year, the maximum pretax employee contribution will rise to $9,500 from $9,240 this year. Under current tax law, however, many highly paid employees actually have lower contribution ceilings because of anti-discrimination provisions included in federal rules.  <p> ----- <p>The National Association of Securities Dealers disclosed plans to prohibit brokers from paying referral fees to unlicensed people, including bank tellers. The new NASD rule must be approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission.  <p> ----- <p>Do they know something we don't? According to CDA/Investnet, corporate executives this year are selling shares in their own companies at a rate likely to surpass 1993's record for the dollar value of insider sales. The 1993 mark is about $13.5 billion. <p> ----- <p>Michael Steinhardt, the aggressive hedge-fund manager, will wind down his $2.6 billion in investment partnerships by year's end. Steinhardt, 54 years old, told The Wall Street Journal that investing no longer holds the "psychic rewards" for him that it once did. <p> ----- <p>The Internal Revenue Service has indefinitely postponed its plan to conduct so-called super audits of 153,000 taxpayers, because of budget cutbacks and, according to the General Accounting Office, administrative foul-ups.  <p> ----- <p>Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette plans to begin offering customers access to no-load funds managed by competitors. (Schwab, Fidelity Investments, and Vanguard Group already have similar programs.) Expect Merrill Lynch to follow suit soon.  <p> ----- <p>In 1996, Social Security taxes will be levied on the first $62,700 of workers' income, up from $61,200 this year.<p><p>

						January 1996--Special Issue <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran   <p> A STATE OF WELL-BEING. For the second consecutive year, New Hampshire tops the list of the healthiest of the United States, as ranked by insurance company Relia Star Financial. The company rated states on 17 criteria and found that, among other differences,Yankees tend to smoke less and have better prenatal care. Downin the Delta, folks aren't so hearty and hale. Mississippi placed last on the list, down a notch from its rank of 49th last year. <p> OPEN THE BANK VAULT DOOR, HAL. Would you rather let your friendly personal computer handle your banking transactions instead of visiting your branch office? Banks hope so, it seems. A recent survey by Forrester Research, a technology consulting firm, found that 79 percent of the commercial banks queried are cyber savvy, with 34 percent currently offering personal-computer banking and 45 percent actively developing a system. Just over a year ago, only 54 percent of banks surveyed either offered techno-banking or planned to do so.  <p> YOUR BOSS WANTS YOU TO RELAX. More companies are providing counseling for modern-day problems. William M. Mercer Inc., a management consulting firm, reports that 92 percent of the employee benefit programs it examined offer services to help employees cope with stress. Sixty-seven percent provide counseling on gambling and education on workplace violence issues.  <p> DON'T CALL THEM SLACKERS. The Lutheran Brotherhood, a financial-services company for Lutherans, reports that those much-maligned Generation X-ers may be good for something after all. In a survey, the group found that 40 percent of people aged 18 to 29 are already providing or expect to provide financial help to mom and dad after their retirement.  <p> GETTING SOAKED AT THE STANDS. Catching your favorite sports team in action is rapidly getting more expensive. According to Team Marketing Report, a newsletter that tracks professional sports, the cost of a ticket for an NBA game has jumped nearly 37 percent since 1991. NFL tickets are up more than 32 percent, while major league baseball fans are paying 23 percent more. And once you've paid for your seat? Philadelphia Eagles fans really suck it up by shelling out $5 for a 14-ounce beer the priciest in pro football. The ticket-price increases must seem easier to swallow for Green Bay Packers fans, who can buy a beer for just $2.75.  <p> SOMETHING'S IN THE AIR. Expect to see those no radio signs propped in car windows amended soon to read no air bag, either. According to Kim Hazelbaker of the Highway Loss Data Institute, a nonprofit insurance research firm, 5 percent of all auto-theft claims are for stolen air bags. "Ripping off air bags is becoming the stereo theft of the '90s," Hazelbaker says. Replacement cost for a driver-side bag: Anywhere from $450 to more than $1,000, with insurance covering all but the deductible.  <p> SCHOOL OF HARD KNOCKWURST? Cheer up next time you write out that tuition check. After all, that college degree might put your progeny in the driver's seat of the Wienermobile, that is.In the past five years, Oscar Mayer Foods has seen a 75 percent increase in the number of college-educated applicants (over 800 in 1995) hoping to spend a year at the wheel of the 27-foot frank. <p> BANKERS BEWARE. The American Management Association says the financial-services sector leads others in the downsizing trend. Job reductions were reported at 61.2 percent of all financial firms last year, up from 51.3 percent in 1990.  <p> ONE MORE REASON TO FEAR A MARKET CRASH. Investors can now trade their way to Hawaii. Bull & Bear Securities, a discount brokerage firm, has become the first brokerage to reward customers with frequent-flier miles for each transaction. Alas, there's no bonus for investing in airline stocks.  <p>  <p>

						January 1996--Special issue <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> KEEPING UP  <p> By Teri Karush  <p> The National Association of Securities Dealers, moving to deflect criticism that it operates the Nasdaq market to the benefit of insiders and to the detriment of the public, has unveiled a plan for a new three-board governing structure that would include more non-brokerage firm members. The reform plan, which requires the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission, would place a total of 40 governors on the three boards by the first quarter of 1997 with 19 governors selected from within the industry and 21 governors from outside it. Currently, 72 percent of the NASD's governors come from the brokerage business.   <p> The New York Stock Exchange has announced plans to lower transaction charges for smaller orders placed through its Super Dot system as of January, subject to SEC approval.   <p> Mutual Fund Companies now manage a larger share (37 percent) of the $600 billion in 401(k) retirement plans than do insurers (30 percent), according to Cerulli Associates, a Boston-based financial-services consultant.  <p> <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a> plans to offer electronic banking services to the 4 million customers of <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> sometime during the first half of1996. Intuit, the maker of Quicken, currently has 22 banking partners. <p>  <p>An October ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court will allow banks to temporarily freeze the accounts of depositors who defaulton a loan and seek bankruptcy-court protection.  <p> The Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) will begin offering reverse mortgages early in 1996. These adjustable-rate mortgages will allow people over age 61 to essentially trade equity in their homes for either fixed monthly payments or aline of credit. Fannie Mae's information line is 800-732-6643. <p> American International Group, the global insurance holding company, has launched its first mutual fund for U.S. investors: the AIG Children's World Fund 2005, aimed at parents saving for their offspring's futures. As a sweetener, AIG said it would guarantee the original investment of shareholders as well as refund the initial upfront sales charges for those who meet certain conditions. <p> Fidelity Investments, sharply expanding its global fund offerings, is opening six new country funds covering established and emerging markets in France, Germany, Hong Kong and China, the Nordic region,the United Kingdom, and small companies in Japan.  <p> The American Homeowners Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Arlington, Virginia, will now investigate loan-payment histories for adjustable-rate mortgages. The group says about 30 percent to 40 percent of its customers find they are entitled to refunds, which average about $1,500. Customers must agree to split the proceeds of any refunds the group obtains as a result of its research. Call 800-489-7776 for further information.  <p> The average 1996 salary increase is projected to reach 4 percent the same as 1995's says Hewitt Associates, following a survey of1,811 employers. The benefits-consulting firm, based in Lincolnshire, Illinois, says other forms of compensation, including bonuses and profit sharing, are expected to rise 7.5 percent in 1996, compared with 7.6 percent in 1995.  <p> Some hotels, led by Westin and Hyatt, have begun charging fees to guests who check out one or more days ahead of schedule. The fees range from $25 to $50.   <p>

						January 1996--Special issue <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> FIN DE CYCLE?  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> No one wants to get off the gravy train too soon, but no one wants to be the last out the door, either, if the market's recent exploration of 5000 on the Dow turns into the big blow-off. At the moment the market is populated by fully invested but faint-hearted optimists who have one eye on the exit.   <p> The odds of anyone correctly predicting when to jump are pretty small. Professional economists will probably miss the next turn in interest rates. From 1982 to 1994, the consensus prediction of economists surveyed by The Wall Street Journal got the direction of change in interest rates over the next six months wrong 18 out of 25 times, according to a study by Ryan Labs, a New York money-management firm. Professional stock analysts actually did worse when it came to predicting an earnings turn, accordingto a study by Salomon Brothers. Heading into the recessions of1981 and 1990 and the slowdown of 1984-86, analysts missed the coming earnings downturns completely. In 1981, for example, they were predicting profit growth of 20 percent even as earnings on the Standard & Poor's 500 index were set to fall 15 percent for the year.  <p> The professionals' dismal track record in calling major changes of direction is especially important now. Evidence suggests that the interest-rate and earnings cycles that have driven this market are drawing to a close. The next 12 to 18 months will give birth to a new market, driven by new cycles. Smart investors will change gears now.  <p> For 15 years, the stock market has reaped the rewards of one of the great sustained declines in interest rates of the 20th century. In 1982, the yield on a 10-year Treasury bond hit 14.14 percent. On November 17, 1995, the yield fell to just 5.97 percent. Notwithstanding some temporary blips, rates have been falling steadily for 14 years.  <p> Those years add up to the fourth major wave to roll through the bond market this century. From 1900 to 1920 interest rates rose steadily. From 1920 to 1946, they declined (the yield on the long Treasury went from 5.32 percent in 1920 to 2.08 percent in 1946). From1946 to 1981, bond investors suffered a steady erosion of the price of their bonds as rates rose steadily toward that 1982 high of 14.14 percent.  <p> Partly because of this fall in rates, the past decade has been extremely kind to equity investors. Stocks have recorded annual gains far above their long-term track record of 10.2 percent per year for the past ten years, the annual return on the S & P 500 is 15.5 percent. But bonds have fared even better, far outperforming their long-term track record. For the past ten years, ten-year Treasury bonds have returned 9.91 percent annually just belowthe long-term historical return on stocks and well above the 5.1 percent annual return for intermediate-term bonds.  <p> The interest rate cycle isn't over, but it is nearing an end. The bond market is betting on at least one more rate cut by the Federal Reserve the Fed's discount rate of 5.75 percent is above the 5.6 percent yield on 90-day Treasurys and a series of cuts isn't impossible if Congress takes decisive action to balance the budget and the economy grows more slowly than the Fed expects. But yields on the 30-year Treasury haven't been below 5 percent since 1967, when inflation was consistently below 3 percent.  <p> The same winding down shows up in Wall Street's estimates on corporate earnings. For the third quarter of 1995, preliminary results show that Standard & Poor's weighted earnings measure for the S&P 500 will come to $8.65 about 88 cents below earlier projections, says Arnold Kaufman, editor of S&P's The Outlook. In mid-November, analysts lowered their full-year projection to $36.87, from $37.90 a month earlier. Kaufman says the final number will probably come in at $35.50.  <p> That's certainly not a precipitous dip: If the current $35.50 projection holds, 1995 earnings will still show a 16 percent increase beyond 1994 earnings. But the pattern shows a definite slowing, from a stunning 39.9 percent in 1994 to the expected 16 percent for 1995 to a projected 15.4 percent in 1996.  <p> At the moment, the market is happy playing the end game of these two cycles. Slowing growth is just fine, since it may prompt the Fed to cut rates some more. With modest inflation and growth, interest rates could drop another point and the bond market could continue its rally. If earnings grow at a slower but still steady12 percent in 1996, and if the S&P climbs 10 percent, the market's price-to-earnings ratio would still be a moderate 16.6. And with yields on bonds so low, stocks would remain the investment of choice for baby boomers worried about retirement.  <p> But endgames are dangerous. Investors determined to get the last dollar out of this market could instead get hurt. The risks are especially great and the reward especially small for investors with new money to invest.   <p> Here's one way to handicap the endgame strategies. If the rosy scenario comes true in 1996, new investments will reap a 10 percent return. If instead the Fed raises rates earlier in the year or earnings sink like a stone, the market will correct and that new money might be worth 5 percent less in a year. If new cash is parked in short-term Treasurys until the trends are clearer, it will earn, say, a little better than 5 percent. That may not seem like much, but consider this: An investor who bought into the market at the begining of 1973's major market decline would would have earned just 3.2 percent on his investment annually through the end of 1978. Still feel like plowing that year-end bonus into the market?   <p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> WHAT THEY'RE BUYING NOW  <p> Seven acclaimed mutual fund managers have agreed to tell Worth readers each month about their current favorite domestic stocks. The price listed is the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. Assume in each case that the manager has bought the stock for his fund, perhaps at a lower price than the one mentioned here. The manager may also have sold the stock after September 25, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these seven managers illustrate a broad range of successful investment styles. The picks on this page are intended to serve as long-term recommendations.  <p>  <p>MANAGER/FUND/STYLE: <p>Shelby M.C. Davis <p><a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a> <p>Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.  <p> PICK: <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> (NYSE: GM) $49  <p> General Motors is the only major organization that has yet to be restructured other than the U.S. government. Can GM turn back 30 years of mediocrity? We think so. It just has to follow the road map provided by <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a>. GM's current management is attempting to undertake the streamlining process while business is soft. The automaker is cutting costs and repairing its balance sheet. Some divisions--most notably GM Hughes and GMAC--could be worth more as stand-alone entities. In two to three years, GM could be earning $10 a share--up from about $7 a share this year--and the stock could be at $75.  <p>  <p>MANAGER/FUND/STYLE: <p>James P. Craig <p><a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a> <p>Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.  <p> PICK: <a name="NYSE:UNM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11525"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>UNUM</b></a> (NYSE: UNM) $56   <p> I recommended this leading disability-insurance provider at $47 a share in July. But now the story looks even better than it did back then. Management has continued an aggressive restructuring, which includes getting out of the tax-sheltered annuity business (only a 7 percent return on equity business). This will free up $150 million in capital, raise the company's overall returns, and speed it toward share buy backs. UNUM's core disability business is also improving faster than I anticipated. Earnings should start beating expectations soon. I think the stock will go to $80 in early to mid-1997.

Through its roughly 20 units, this diversified company produces analytical instruments for the environmental, medical, and biomedical industries. It also makes alternative energy systems and environmental products. The company has grown considerably and has enhanced shareholder value by spinning off its subsidiaries while retaining a significant equity interest in each unit. Thermo Electron's net income is growing at well above 20 percent annually. It earned $1.40 ashare in 1994 and should net $1.65 this year. I expect profits to reach $2 a share in 1996.

Its primary product: Single-premium deferred annuities--a business that should benefit as baby boomers begin to save more. The industry is consolidating, and this company could get scooped up. But we like it for its inherent value. Book value is close to $13, there's no debt, and the stock is trading at less than eight times this year's earnings. Even though insurance companies tend to trade at a discount to the market, this low valuation seems unwarranted. AmVestors' revenue is rising by more than 20 percent a year, and it has a rock-solid bond portfolio.  <p>  <p>MANAGER/FUND/STYLE: <p>Eric E.

The spot price of U308, which usually weakens in the summer, has been holding at $11.90 per pound. It could reach $15 by next year. The company should earn at least 50 cents a share in 1996. Using a 22 multiple (where two direct competitors are trading), Uranium Resources should be at $11.

Yet this is a simple story. In brief, people simply aren't going to stop wearing underwear. Fruit of the Loom has low costs and dominates Hanes in market share. The passage of GATT means it won't locate any more assembly work in the U.S., though it will keep making fabric domestically. This company has the capability of earning $3 a share. The stock sold at $50 a share a few years ago and looks cheap now at $22. There's no dividend, so earnings go toward reducing debt. <p><p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> * Nice house, but where are the biking and hiking trails? So ask nearly three quarters of potential home buyers when they're looking at real estate, according to a study by market-research company American Lives. In fact, proximity to walking and bike paths ranked fourth among important factors that affect house-hunters' buying decisions. The most desirable feature in the study was low traffic density, followed by placement on a cul-de-sac, and having lots of natural, open space. Low-ranking factors included local tennis courts and community golf courses.  <p>  <p>* Madison Avenues finds a new niche. Gay print publications--encompassing both magazines and newspapers--boasted a 16.2 percent surge in advertising revenues for the year ended April 1995. That outpaced both mainstream newspapers, which saw ad revenues grow 6.8 percent, and mainstream magazines, which enjoyed 13.3 percent growth. Meanwhile, ad revenues for Hispanic publications increased 6 percent, while the black print market grew only 3 percent.  <p>  <p>* Family comes before money when moving. That's the trend among workers deciding whether to accept company relocation offers, according to a recent survey by Runzheimer International. The study found that 63 percent of relocation offers rejected last year were vetoed because of family considerations; 27 percent were passed on because of the money factor. Back in 1991, 76 percent of those who declined a transfer did so for financial reasons.   <p>  <p>* Another sign of the 70s revival? Volunteerism in the Peace Corps is projected to reach 7,000 members by the end of this year, the highest level seen since 1978, when 7,072 activists served. Back at its start in 1961, nearly 70 percent of volunteers were male, and the average age of volunteers was 22. Nowadays, women outnumber men--53.5 percent to 46.5 percent--and the average volunteer's age is 30.   <p>  <p>* Attention all turkeys: There's some good news and some bad news. The good news is that Thanksgiving isn't becoming any more dangerous to turkeys; American consumption of the birds at holiday time has been nearly flat since 1990. But any fowl that escapes the dinner table here in the U.S. is likely to wind up on a boat, because Russians and Mexicans have recently developed a taste for turkey. "Exports are skyrocketing, especially the thigh meat and drumsticks," says Stuart Proctor, president of the National Turkey Federation. Indeed, exports of turkey parts have jumped 559 percent in the past five years. According to Proctor, Mexicans favor thigh meat as an alternative to pork in processed foods, while Russians import drumsticks for a cheap source of protein.  <p>  <p>* Wrinkles are in. According to the American Society of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgeons, the number of collagen injections (to fill out facial crevices and cavities like laugh lines and brow furrows) dropped to 27,000 last year from 41,600 in 1992.  <p>  <p>* A career change? Head to Atlanta, says economic think tank Cognetics Inc. in a study that ranks the regions with the highest anticipated job growth. Atlanta topped the list, with 161,630 new white-collar jobs expected to be created over the next nine years. Right behind Atlanta were Los Angeles, San Francisco-Oakland-SanJose, Dallas-Fort Worth, and Miami-Fort Lauderdale.  <p>  <p>* Businesses may finally be feeling more generous. The Conference Board, a nonprofit business research firm, asked large and midsize corporations to project their contributions to charitable causes and concluded that giving should rise 3 percent this year and 5 percent in 1996. It's been a while since companies felt so beneficent; for the past five years, the survey had found that giving wouldn't increase. Pharmaceutical companies headed the list of industries expected to ramp up their giving the most.  <p>  <p>* Cruising the Sunset Strip is no cheap thrill. According to Runzheimer International, it costs a typical driver in Los Angeles $8,375 a year to operate a car--more bucks than any other metropolitan area. The figures are based on a 1995 midsize sedan driven 15,000 miles a year and include insurance expenses, depreciation, license and registration fees, taxes, and operating costs such as gas, oil, tires, and maintenance. The least expensive of the 80 cities included in the survey was Burlington, Vermont, at an annual cost of $5,459, followed by Little Rock, Arkansas, at $5,660. <p>  <p>* The line on towing. Last year, the American Automobile Association received 26.8 million calls for emergency road service, the highest volume in AAA's 93-year history. Dead batteries and electrical failures accounted for 32 percent of calls. "Because cars are built better, the average vehicle today is 8.3 years old," says Mike Morrissey of AAA. "That, plus last year's lousy weather, upped the number of breakdowns." Or maybe it was just plain forgetfulness. Thirteen percent of those stranded on the highway had locked their keys in their cars. "We had one call where the woman's dog had locked her out of the car," says Morrissey. "We suggested that she teach Fido to drive so she'd have a chauffeur."  <p>

The founder of the $270 million New York-based Roanoke Asset Management,Vroom likes companies that are poised to dominate product trends.Positive signs include hefty research-and-development budgets and strict cost controls. Vroom is sour on the stocks of companies that don't exhibit these traits. For example, despite its apparentturnaround, Vroom believes IBM has failed to regain a leading position in high-growth areas such as operating systems, PCs, data networks, and the Internet. America Online is still adding members, but the cost of acquiring new members has been rising along with member turnover. Meanwhile, cheaper Internet services are reducing the number of potential subscribers. Advanced MicroDevices must go head to head with Intel in the competitive semiconductor and microprocessor industry. The company may not have the capital to develop and release a competitive next-generation product.U.S. Healthcare is caught in a competitive vise. Vroom believes the company has kept margins high by keeping reimbursements to hospitals and doctors low. But increased competition is forcing the company to cut fees and raise payments to doctors. In the wireless-communications market, Qualcomm's valuation relative to that of larger industry leaders appears excessive, Vroom says:The company's new product for the cellular-telephone industry must hit a home run to justify the current stock price.  <p>  <p>TEN STOCKS TO CONSIDER  <p> By Jim Melcher  <p> COMPANY/EXCHANGE/SYMBOL FAIR VALUE <p>(REASONS)  <p> <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a> (NYSE: CAT) $60 <p>(Strong product line; International and domestic growth; Strength in emerging markets)  <p> <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a> (NYSE: CCI) 75 <p>(International and domestic growth; Modest price for assets;Management strength)  <p> <a name="NYSE:FLR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10594"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fluor</b></a> (NYSE: FLR) 60 <p>(International and domestic growth; Industry growth)  <p> <a name="NASD:LJPC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=20082"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>La Jolla Pharm.</b></a> (Nasdaq: LJPC) 6 <p>(Industry strength; Market niche; Innovative research)  <p> <a name="NASD:LIBT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16058"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Liberty Technologies</b></a> (Nasdaq: LIBT)   8 <p>(Market leader; Innovative technology; Anticipated high growth) <p> <a name="NYSE:SAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10238"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SunAmerica</b></a> (NYSE: SAI) 65 <p>(Industry growth; Earnings growth; Broad product line)  <p> <a name="OTC:TBRAY"></a><b>Telebras S.A. </b>(OTC: TBRAY) 40 <p>(Inexpensive price for assets; Industry growth; Dominance within market)  <p> <a name="NASD:VICL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16150"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vical</b></a> (Nasdaq: VICL) 14 <p>(Diversification; Market growth; Innovative technology)  <p> <a name="NYSE:WAB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43798"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Westinghouse Air Brake</b></a> (NYSE: WAB) 20 <p>(Inexpensive price for assets; Industry growth; Market leader) <p> <a name="NYSE:YPF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42017"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>YPF Sociedad Anónima</b></a> (NYSE: YPF) 22 <p>(Inexpensive price for assets)  <p> Jim Melcher qualifies as a grizzled veteran.

To pick stocks, Melcher starts with a top-down approach that looks for industries poised to benefit from economic and demographic trends. He then searches to find the company in that industry that seems best suited to capitalize on the trend. Fundamentals such as financial strength play a role in the process, but Melcher will buy a great company only if it's strategically positioned to take advantage of one of the themes he's identified. Currently, Melcher's theme of choice is international growth. U.S. companies with a strong international presence make up 15 percent of his portfolio, while foreign stocks account for 30 percent. He likes Fluor because it has a strong record of marketing its engineering and construction services in developing countries. Similarly, Westinghouse Air Brake's new foreign sales effort will market air couplings and braking systems to the fast-growing foreign rail transportation market. Melcher sees Brazilian telephone company Telebras set to ride on the coat tails of Brazil's growing economy. Citicorp has built a global consumer business, but its stock is still modestly priced considering the value of its assets.  <p><p>

						November 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> THE NEXT CHALLENGE <p>We've navigated enough dangers to arrive at (of course) another dilemma: What to buy in a slow-growth economy  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> Wall Street has curled up comfortably with the soft landing engineered by Alan Greenspan and the Federal Reserve Board: moderate growth at an annual rate equal to 2 to 2.5 percent and low inflation of between 2.5 and 3.5 percent. So now might be a good time for investors to ask, what kind of stock is best suited to this slow-growth economy ?   <p> The recent gyrations of the market have been sending mixed signals. One week stocks with big consumer names like <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a> lead the pack, apparently benefiting from the theory that such companies will perform well no matter what happens in the rest of the economy. The next week, consumer issues fade and cyclical stocks light up the board. Cyclical companies (autos, housing, metals) are those whose earnings ebb and flow in tune with the classic business cycle. A bet on cyclicals is a bet on a strengthening economy.  <p> Cyclical stocks have had a remarkable earnings story to tell this year. In the second quarter of 1995, earnings among cyclical companies leapt almost 50 percent above their year-earlier level, according to Safian Investment Research in White Plains, New York. The achievement marked the sixth consecutive quarter in which the year-to-year profits of cyclical companies grew by at least 40 percent. Analysts who follow cyclical stocks expect the streak to continue.  <p> By comparison, the earnings of blue-chip growth companies have been paltry. The outfits whose stocks compose Safian's Traditional Growth Average Index reported an average earnings improvement of 12.8 percent for the quarter ended June 30, 1995. They weren't expected to do any better in the July-through-September period. <p> These measures, however, don't tell the whole story, according to Kurt Walters, vice-president of Safian. The long cyclical earnings rally, he says, really consisted of three mini-rallies by different kinds of companies. Starting in 1991, the consumer cyclicals such as <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford Motor</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:WHR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11632"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Whirlpool</b></a> began showing big gains on the bottom line. Then, in 1992 and 1993, equipment makers such as <a name="NYSE:CAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10304"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Caterpillar</b></a> and Deere began raking in profits. Finally, in 1994, commodity companies such as Alcoa and <a name="NYSE:IP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10800"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>International Paper</b></a> joined in.  <p> The stages show up clearly in the earnings history of three representative stocks. For the most recent cycle, Ford's earnings bottomed in 1991, when the company showed a loss of $2.40 per share, climbed to $2.28 in 1993, and then more than doubled to$4.97 in 1994. Ford probably won't match that in1995.  <p> Caterpillar bottomed a year later with a 1992 loss of $1.08 per share. Earnings hit $3.36 in 1993, then $4.70 in 1994. Value Line estimates 1995 earnings at $6, but projects 1996 earnings growing to just $6.40.   <p> Alcoa didn't hit its low point until 1993, when the company earned just 40 cents a share. Earnings climbed to $1.08 in 1994 and are projected by Value Line at $4.35 in1995.  <p> Now, this multi-stage pattern is beginning to head in the other direction. Near the end of September, analysts lowered their estimates of Ford's 1995 earnings to $3.96, down 7 cents from their projections a month earlier. And in mid-September Caterpillar executives warned Wall Street that the company's third-quarter earnings probably wouldn't equal those of a year earlier, ending Caterpillar's string of six quarters of record profits.   <p> This leaves just the commodity cyclicals to sustain the sector."You've lost two legs," says Walters. But the third leg hasn't shown any sign of weakness yet, he adds. Year-to-year earnings gains of 100 percent are still possible for the commodity cyclicals for the next few quarters. <p> Just days after Caterpillar threw a bucket of cold water on the market, Coca-Cola rose to the podium with quite a different message. The company confirmed it was "comfortable" with the analysts' third-quarter estimates of 63 to 66 cents a share, compared with 55 cents a share a year earlier. Comfort commands quite a premium these days: Coke's stock jumped $4 a share for the week, hitting a 52-week high of $70.63. That drove Coca-Cola's price-to-earnings ratio to 31, the rarefied atmosphere more typical of a high-flying technology stock. Too much to pay for earnings growth that averaged 17 percent annually for the past ten years? <p> Growth stocks may have relatively stable earnings, but they still go through periods of high and low valuation. There are periods when investors will pay 31 times earnings for Coke, but there also are times, such as 1988, when 14 times earnings seems like a fair appraisal of the soda maker's value. (Since 1980 Coca-Cola's average annual price-to-earnings ratio has been as low as 9.6; it's never been higher than 28.7.) Safian has tracked the valuation of its Traditional Growth Index back to 1959 by contrasting the yield on these growth stocks to the yield on Treasury bonds. When the index is high, growth stocks traditionally are good values (1978-81 and late 1993 were such times). When the index is low, growth stocks often give poor value (1987, for example). Right now the index is neutral. In other words, growth stocks aren't a screaming buy, but neither are they yet overpriced.  <p> Safian's valuation number may slightly understate the attractiveness of blue-chip growth stocks in this market. Changes in the utilities industry have made that traditional safe haven for nervous investors far less attractive. Electric utilities face an uncertain period of deregulation, making profits hard to predict. The regional phone companies face new competition from the long-distance carriers and from cable-television companies. To many investors, convinced that stocks are the only game in town, blue-chip growth stocks,pricey as they are, seem the only alternative.  <p> To us, though, it's no time to be buying growth stocks just to be buying something. At the least investors ought to take a long tough look at how sustainable those blue-chip earnings really are. How many cents a share are dependent on exchange rates? Are margins near historic highs that may be set to contract if the economy slows or competition heats up? Is a brand nameand franchise really one that consumers will pay extra for if the household budget gets a little tight? Remember that Merck, a favored blue chip of the moment, has just recently recovered the $20 a share it lost in the wake of the Clinton administration's health care reform effort.  <p> And where do cyclical valuations fall at the moment? In August, they appeared to be nearing a new high continuing a climb they began from the low valuations of November 1990. That was the best time to buy those stocks, when their valuations were near a bottom. It's hard to find a good reason to load up on cyclicals now. Betting against history is always a risky proposition. <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> WHEN NUMBERS TURN TRUSTWORTHY  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> How long does it take before investors can feel confident about a mutual fund manager's track record? Three years may be too short to test a fund against all market conditions. But changes in a management team may render a ten-year record irrelevant. Says Robert Padgette, president of Mobius Group, a software and data provider to professional investors: "A lot of people use five years because it generally will get you through at least one full market cycle."  <p> If that's right, then Michael Gerding, portfolio manager of <a name="FUND:FRINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FRINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Founders Worldwide Growth Fund</b></a>, may just have won his spurs.The fund, which hit its crucial fifth birthday under Gerding's control in May 1995 (the fund itself began operation in December1989), has recorded an average 14.2 percent annual return for the past five years. After adjusting for sales loads, none of the 38 other global funds with five-year track records have performed as well with as little risk. Investors have just started to notice: While still small at $190 million in assets, Founders Worldwide has collected $100 million of that since the start of 1995. <p> There's nothing fancy about Gerding's methods. "I absolutely believe that what makes a stock go up is earnings growth," says the 33-year-old manager, who got his start in international investing ten years ago running money for a bank's trust clients. Gerding cleaves to a growth-at-a-reasonable-price strategy modified to fit the international scope of his fund. (About 75 percent of the fund's portfolio is invested overseas.)  <p> Gerding looks for companies with both sales and earnings growing faster than the average for their industry and home market. He's willing to pay a 10 to 20 percent premium and sometimes more over the price-to-earnings ratio of a stock's home market, but at that price he hopes to find a stock growing at twice the rate of the average stock in that market.  <p> For instance, the fund's largest holding, <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>Nokia</b>, a Finnish maker of cellular-phone hardware, sells at 18 times estimated 1995 earnings. That's about a 40 percent premium to the Finnish market's price-to-earnings multiple of 12.5, but the stock is still cheaper than its larger American rival <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a>, which trades at a 23.8 multiple and is growing more slowly.  <p> Because his method depends so heavily on forecasting earnings, Gerding met with managers from more than 300 companies last year and spent ten weeks abroad assessing new products, new markets,and management. "If we don't see how the earnings will grow,we can't be confident in the estimates," he says. "Investing is more sweat than art or science."  <p> Gerding's portfolio is concentrated in just 60 to 80 stocks,75 percent of them small- or medium-size companies. Benefon, a Finnish maker of handsets for cellular phones, is typical. With a market capitalization of just $300 million, the company is too tiny for many global managers to bother with. But Benefonis releasing a new digital phone, Gerding says, that has the potential to double company revenues.  <p> Founders Worldwide isn't without risk. Gerding owns fewer stocks than his peers, and they're smaller which could add up to a bigger fall in a down market. And a substantial portion of the fund's gains has come from the dollar's fall versus foreign currencies, which could hurt the fund if the dollar stages a prolonged rally. "A lot of people buy our fund because they want to diversify their own dollar exposure," he says. "For me to hedge that away, I'd have to be very confident that we're in a major dollar bull market."  <p> Accelerating economic growth in the rest of the world outweighs any downside for the dollar, in Gerding's view. "Since the Gulf War, we've had virtually no growth in the developed world outside the U.S.," he says, "and we're beginning to see that change."That will fuel stronger earnings growth, and earnings grow this what this fund is all about.  <p>  <hr>   <p> Fund Briefs  <p> Rebutting Doom: In April 1994, economist Henry Kaufman, known on Wall Street as Dr. Doom for his negative views, proposed a mandatory 60- or 90-day wait before investors could redeem stock and bond funds to prevent a market meltdown. The fund industry's trade association, the Investment Company Institute, wasn't about to let that go. In a new study ICI concludes that's unnecessary since the peso crisis, bond market decline, and bankruptcy of Orange County didn't trigger withdrawals last year. Kaufman's not buying it: "1994 wasn't a real test," he says.   <p> The Big Shakeup: On August 24, Fidelity Investments named new portfolio managers at 21 bond funds, including 6 of Fidelity's12 largest fixed-income funds. Just as significant, since the arrival of Fred L. Henning Jr. as the new director of fixed-income investment, Fidelity has lowered risk by shortening durationand dumping emerging-market debt.  <p> Short form: Eight fund families have begun sending out prospectuses that boil down the typical 20 pages into just three or four. For this year, the families, which include Vanguard and Dreyfus, will send out both forms while the Securities and Exchange Commissiontests investor reaction.   <p><p><p>

Assume in each case that the manager has bought the stock for his fund, perhaps at a lower price than the one mentioned here. The manager may also have sold the stock after August 28, the publishing deadline. The approaches of these seven managers illustrate a broad range of successful investment styles. The picks on this page are intended to serve as long-term recommendations. <p>

<a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a> <p>
Invests primarily in large growth of preserving capital over the long term.  <p>
 <a name="NYSE:CHA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10317"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Champion International</b></a> Nyse: CHA $60   <p>
 Champion has been raising prices on its main paper products. Unlike the industry's boom-bust pricing cycles of the past, paper companies aren't raising capacity so rapidly this time around so the higher prices should hold, boosting profitability. During the last three months, Champion has repurchased over 10 percent of its outstanding shares, and it just announced plans to buy back another 6 percent. I can see it devoting 30 percent of earnings to buying its own stock about $300-$400 million annually. This will push up earnings per share. I'm looking for earnings per share of $8 this year and $11 in 1996. Barring a major economic downturn, I believe Champion could become an $80 stock in the next 9 to 12 months.  <p>

<a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a> <p>
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.  <p>
 <a name="NYSE:ALL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16182"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Allstate Corp.</b></a>   Nyse: ALL  $33  <p>
 Allstate, with 20 million customers and a broad product base, is one of the top insurance franchises around. <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> recently distributed its 80 percent stake to the public. As often happens with spin-offs, the management is rethinking its mission: Now it has something to prove. Allstate is reducing its catastrophe exposure by avoiding high-risk places like California, Florida,and Long Island, and it is emphasizing high-growth lines of business such as life insurance and annuities. Barring any large-scaledisasters, Allstate could earn $3.50 per share in 1995 and $4 in 1996. The stock is now selling at six times cash flow and eight times earnings - too cheap. My target is $45 a share in two to three years.  <p>

<a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Technology Portfolios</b></a> <p>
Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.  <p>
<a name="NASD:LOJN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16551"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LoJack Corp.</b></a>    Nasdaq: LOJN $15  <p>
 Located in Dedham, Massachusetts, LoJack produces a patented detection system that assists the police in tracking, locating, and retrieving stolen cars. After a car owner has installed the $595 radio transmitter and registered with the police, the vehicle can be tracked in any of the 11 states in which the system operates mostly east of the Mississippi. I expect the company to go nationwide very soon. There are no direct competitors. There's only room for one player in this market. And some insurance companies are now offering hefty discounts to LoJack owners. The company reported net income of 16 cents per share in fiscal 1995, up from 2 cents in 1994. I think it will earn 32 cents next year and 55 cents in 1997.  <p>

Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed  to be undervalued. <p>
 <a name="NYSE:KCN"></a><b>Int'l Colin Energy Corp.</b>   Nyse: KCN   $6   <p>
 This Alberta-based independent oil and gas exploration company has been a real laggard. The company expanded too fast and took on too much debt, which prompted a lot of institutions to lose interest. At $5 a share (down from $20 two years ago), the stock is trading at less than three times 1995 cash flow and at about a 50 percent discount to the value of its assets. It's not unusual for oil and gas companies to trade at six to eight times cash flow and at about 80 percent of asset value. We think this gap will close. Small, independent oil and gas companies have been one of the worst places to be this year so this is a turnaround play. Cash flow per share should be $1.65 this year and $1.75 in 1996.  <p>

 Metricom got its start building systems for the utility industry. Now it installs wireless data networks in large cities (San Francisco, Seattle, San Jose) and on college campuses. Operating in a license-free spectrum, it attaches its small radio units to street lights.This allows it to provide high-speed, two-way communications at a very low cost to subscribers. College students, for example, get wireless modem access from their laptop computers. While Metricom is a viable company on its own, its proprietary technology makes it a likely partner for one of the big boys <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a>,or Southwestern Bell. It has no earnings yet but could easily be a $50 stock. Paul Allen, cofounder of <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, is the largest stockholder.  <p>

Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.  <p>
 <a name="NYSE:FAM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15628"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Int'l Family Entertainment</b></a> NYSE: FAM  $19   <p>
 This media company provides programming for cable television. Its core domestic cable channel The Family Channel reaches over 60 million homes in the United States, is very profitable, and has cash flow growth of over 20 percent this year. International Family Entertainment's net income rose 60 percent in the first half of 1995, despite startup costs associated with the new Cable Health Club network and the U.K. Family Channel. Right now, investors who buy stock in this company essentially get these start-up channels for free not to mention a valuable film library, a production company, and live-entertainment assets. If the new channels develop as I expect, the stock could double in a few years.  <p>
DONALD A. YACKTMAN <p>
<a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund</b></a> <p>
Seeks long-term growth in companies with market  capitalization of at least $1 billion.  <p>
 <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris </b></a> Nyse: MO  $78   <p>
 Philip Morris, of Marlboro, Miller, and Miracle Whip fame, is extremely profitable. New management is focusing on high-return-on-assets businesses. The stock is trading at a very low relative multiple based on expected reported earnings of $6.50 this year (excluding $0.50 of goodwill) and $7.50 next year. At the next meeting, directors will probably raise the dividend to $3.90 a share from the current $3.30. Maintaining a 5 percent yield should get the stock up to $78. It also looks attractive on a technical basis: Once it breaks through its all-time high of $86.6, it should keep going. The big reason we own it, though, is that it sells at a huge discount to its private market value conservatively, $120 billion, or $135 a share.  <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran, Elizabeth Macdonald, and Manjeet Kripalani <p> * Paying more for produce doesn't seem to bother consumers, as long as the veggies and fruit display that all-natural glow. Nearly one quarter of all shoppers buy organic products at least once a week, according to the Food Marketing Institute. With sales of organic goods up 23 percent since 1993, it's no surprise to see more farmers getting green. The Department of Agriculture says farms' applications for organic certification have surged this year.  <p> * "Made in America" fever returns. Starting this month, all new vehicles sold in the U.S. will display showroom stickers detailing their foreign and domestic parts content. Will folks actually consider Uncle Sam's feelings before buying? According to a survey by the Dohring Co., 68 percent of car buyers will scrutinize the domestic-content information, and 84 percent of that group will make it a major factor in their purchase decision.<p>  <p>* Meanwhile, car buyers are overlooking good mileage these days, notes the Williams Inference Service. Although gas prices are at their peak since the Gulf War, fuel economy ranked last in a list of 20 factors that affect automobile buying decisions.  <p> * A generation of couch potatoes? A recent study by American Sports Data reveals that frequent fitness participation among teens (between the ages 12 to 17) dropped 10.3 percent from 1987 to 1994. The 45-plus group, however, must be sweating to the oldies; their frequent-fitness activities soared 40.5 percent. But don't expect to hear "Tennis, anyone?" among any ages it's down 21.4 percent. Basketball, on the other hand, is up 22.3 percent.  <p> * Perhaps the tennis industry needs to get its mind in the gutter and take a tip from bowlers. To boost the flat bowling business, Brunswick Recreation Centers now sponsors "cosmic bowling" at19 of its alleys. Glow-in-the-dark pins and fog machines are offered to draw younger crowds.  <p> * The suits who oversee corporate investments, budgets, and forecasts are growing more pessimistic about the economy. According to the Institute of Management Accountants, for the first time in more than two years nearly half of corporate controllers and financial managers believe the economy is in a downturn.   <p> *  Look for better data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. It spent the last three years overhauling its number-crunching methods so it can deliver a more accurate gross-domestic-product figure. One conclusion:  Last year, annual GDP growth was overstated by half a percentage point. The updated figure is 3.6 percent.  <p> * Crime may be on the decline, but nobody's taking any chances. Among the top growth business categories of 1994 were door- and gate-operating devices (up 32.4 percent) and auto alarms (up 28.4 percent), according to data compiled by American Business Information. Some, however, prefer the ninja approach to personal safety: Martial-arts instruction soared nearly 60 percent. "The trend in security is personal protection," says Albert Janjigian, president of security-consulting firm Stat Resources. "Eventually, we'll see handheld systems that would allow people to locate you anywhere if you pushed a panic button."  <p> * Move over, Robert James Waller. The American Association of Publishers reports that annual sales of Bibles and kids' paperbacks were up 13.2 percent and 39.2 percent, respectively, through June of this year well above adult hardcovers or paperbacks. The Student Bible, published by Zondervan, topped the Bible best-seller list for August.   <p> * Computer buffs can be obsessive about souping up their favorite toys; witness the rush to buy </wam-co NASD:MSFT>Microsoft</wam-co>'s Windows 95 operating system. Of course, new software often demands new hardware to make it work such as additional memory chips, otherwise known as RAM. The old version of Windows required only 4 megabytes of RAM, but Windows 95 demands at least 8. Since it runs better with more, look for devotees to snap up memory upgrades. Advice to nerds: It pays to plan ahead. According to Dataquest, memory prices have jumped 15 to 20 percent since January and aren't expected to drop anytime soon. <p>  <p>* Still paying student loans? According to a study by Louis Harris & Associates, 70 percent of Americans say their parents didn't put away money for their education. Today's parents, however, plan to support Junior's academic endeavors: 80 percent would give up their vacations and 79 percent would work overtime or take a second job to pay these expenses.   <p> * While bank fees keep rising up 22 percent since 1993 more consumers are giving credit unions a try. Membership in credit unions has grown 5.8 percent since 1993, to a total of 69.2 million members. <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> MARKET RADAR  <p> Most of the indicators this month are in a holding pattern, as investors  pause to consider whether there's enough energy left in this market for it to scale new peaks. Bellwether utility and brokerage stocks are leveling  off, the monetary environment offers no new fuel, and investment advisors are pulling back from their recent optimism. The Advance/Decline line shows continued momentum, but even that is flagging. In this atmosphere of indecisiveness,the yield ratio's flashing red "Overvalued!" sign stands out. Each indicator gets an arrow indicating its message for stocks this month.  <p> Advance/Decline Line The trend is still decidedly upward, but this indicator, which tracks the market as a whole, is climbing less steeply than  the Dow industrials and the S&P 500. When the broad market follows the indexes instead of leading them, it's a sign that the market is moving upward  more on momentum than on strength. The market and the Dow may be getting winded. <p> Composite Bellwether The scale of our chart masks some recent turbulence. Diverging from the climbing market, these bellwether utility and brokerage stocks have moved mostly sideways in the last month. Should this line start to turn downward, there would be cause for concern; if the line were to break below the plateau of early summer, it could mean trouble.  <p> Monetary EXPOSURE PROFILE This indicator remains firmly rooted in slightly negative territory, showing that this market isn't getting a boost from monetary policy. The sporadic brief dipsare not significant, largely due to banks' end-of-quarter funds-shuffling, and the Fed's most recent quarter-point rate cut didn't even register. The profile is consistent with an aging rally rather than a new upsurge.  <p> YIELD RATIO The S&P 500's yield hit an all-time low last month. It's climbed a smidgen since then while T-bill yields have stayed put, so this ratio looks a tad better. But that's little consolation. Historically, when T-bill  yields more than double the yield on stocks, the market is very overvalued. It would take more than another quarter-point rate cut by the Federal Reserve to turn this indicator around.  <p> ADVISORY SENTIMENT This month a few more investment advisors lost confidence in this market, a positive sign according to this contrarian indicator. But sentiment continues to flirt with the danger zone: This indicator doesn't need to climb too far to reach the 55 percent mark that, historically, has signaled that enough investment advisors have turned optimistic to indicate a market top.  <p> Consumer and Corporate Debt The 5.38 percent jump in private debt compared with the same time last year is the biggest growth in five years, but it's still no match for the double-digit levels reached in the mid-1980s and the late 1970s. Even though consumer credit demand has been picking up, corporations remain cautious about borrowing, keeping overall debt growth moderate. <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> IN SEARCH OF MARKET LEADERS  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> If you've ever gone backpacking in the mountains with a group of friends, you know something about the way the stock market moves uphill. Early in the morning one hiker, warm with breakfast,perhaps, leads the climb. About mid-morning, he fades, and someone else moves to the front until lunch. Often, a third person takes the pace after the meal, and yet another comes forward toward the end of the day when everyone else has begun to flag. It's an unusual day when the same hiker leads the way from breakfast to dinner.  <p> The stock market climbs mountains in the same way. One sector assumes leadership, soars to remarkable heights and price-to-earnings multiples, suffers a correction, and watches another sector pass it by. In the language of Wall Street, this is sector rotation. Right now, it looks like technology, the sector that took this market to records on the Dow industrials, the Standard & Poor's500, and the Nasdaq Composite Index, is getting pretty tired. And looking around, it's hard to see another sector ready to lead. That should worry investors betting on a continuation of this market's remarkable climb.  <p> This stage of the five-year-long market rise began after the indexes bottomed in late 1994, following a Federal Reserve Board decision to hike interest rates. From its close at 3674 on November 23, 1994, the Dow climbed to a high of 4736 on July 17, 1995 a 29 percent increase before backing off recently. The comparable figures for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq were 27 percent and 43 percent, respectively.  <p> Historically, leadership in a market like this begins with the financial stocks, passes to growth stocks, moves to cyclical industrial stocks as the market matures, and then finally blows off in a speculative flurry of initial public offerings and mergers. The 1995 market started out as you'd expect: Financials did well, and then technology, a classic growth sector, took over leadership. By the end of May, for example, the S&P Bank Composite index was up 25 percent from its November 1994 low. After starting out slowly, with just a slight rise in December1994 and January 1995, the S&P High Technology index picked up speed to rise 53 percent from its December 14 low through July12.  <p> But then the silicon hit the fan. The big stocks that were carrying the market, such as <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>, are all now well off their July highs: Intel is down about 20 percent, Microsoft more than 12 percent. The big semiconductor and PC stocks "are dead for the next three months," says Michael Murphy, editor of the California Technology Stock Letter.  <p> Murphy paints a convincingly dire picture for the companies that depend on personal computers and the immediate roaring success of Windows 95. To make sure they wouldn't be caught short of such components as disk drives, microprocessors, and memory chips as the world rushed to adopt Microsoft's new operating system, companies throughout Silicon Valley built up inventories in the first half of this year. But "we've never really had a fast transition to any operating system," Murphy says. He expects the adoption of Windows 95 to be slower than expected, and if he's right, the likely result will be price cutting, slower sales of components, and big hits to profits as companies try to reduce inventories. "We could have a significant sell-off for the next three months," Murphy says.  <p> Then what stocks could lead the market higher? Many of the traditional candidates seem unlikely point men this time. Cyclicals such as automobiles? Auto sales in the U.S. fell sharply in June and July, and looked weak in early August, according to economist David Levy. Retail sales remain weak. The pickup in growth outside the U.S. helped big multinationals such as<a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b> Coca-Cola</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a> for a while, but the recent strength of the dollar has put adamper on these stocks.  <p> Three other sectors could come to the rescue. Financials, propelled by the wave of mergers sweeping through banking, could reassume the role they played in the early part of this market. The recently proposed union of <a name="NASD:CHFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12961"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chemical Bank</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:CMB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10322"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chase Manhattan</b></a>, which would leapfrog the combined company over Citicorp as the biggest U.S. bank, is likely to set off a chain reaction.  <p> Although cyclicals such as auto stocks aren't good candidates for leadership, companies producing more basic raw materials may be. Prices for metals such as copper, nickel, and tin were all up by 4 percent to 12 percent in August, according to Goldman Sachs. Even the price of aluminum, perennially depressed, has stabilized. Investors have started to notice that at these prices,the metals companies can make money. Alcoa is up 59 percent fromits 52-week low; copper producer <a name="NYSE:PD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11176"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Phelps Dodge</b></a> is up 26 percent. <p> And lastly, don't count technology out. The sector is so big that even if PC makers and semiconductor companies tank, other companies can make up the difference. For example, while Intel and Microsoft were retreating from mid-July to the end of August, the Pacific Stock Exchange Index of 100 technology stocks actually climbed 3 percent. Electronics companies probably make up only 50 percent of all technology companies, Michael Murphy estimates, and PC companies make up only about half of that. Some of these companies will thrive whatever happens to Windows 95 and the PC market. For companies making computers that serve as distribution hubs in corporate networks and the related software makers it doesn't make much differerence what PC makers do, says Murphy. His list of such companies includes Sequent Computer Systems,<a name="NASD:ROSS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11793"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ross Systems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:SYBS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15350"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sybase</b></a>, Powersoft, <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, <a name="NASD:COMS"></a><b>3Com</b>, <a name="NYSE:BAY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bay Networks</b></a>,and <a name="NASD:ORCL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14337"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oracle</b></a>.  <p> The next few months will be crucial for technology and the market. Watch to see if any sell-off in PC and semiconductor stocks starts to spread to other technology shares. Check the S&P financial index, and the Dow Jones aluminum and nonferrous metals indexes, to see if these sectors are taking the lead.  <p> And remember October 29 through November 1. Those are the dates of the American Electronics Association's big fall financial conference. Technology stocks almost always get a bounce from that conference as money managers and analysts start to focus on the good times ahead. If technology stocks don't move up in the wake of the conference, then investors will know the sector is in the throes of more than just a short-term sell-off.   <p><p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> OVERVIEW  <p> As the Federal Reserve Bank applauds itself for piloting the U.S. economy to a soft landing, politicians and central bankers in Europe, Japan, and Latin America are all too aware that their economies never really got airborne in the first place. Justa few weeks ago, for example, French finance minister Alain Madelin resigned after President Jacques Chirac made it clear he wouldn't slash government spending in the face of 11.5 percent unemployment. The markets reacted immediately by driving down the French franc and French bonds. The next few months will be crucial, not just for France, but for Japan, Germany, Mexico, Argentina and the United States. After all, if our trading partners falter, who will buy our exports?   <p>  <p>Focus On: Japan  <p> Back in the 1980s, pundits predicted that U.S. workers faced a future of flipping hamburgers as Japanese high-tech firms devoured Silicon Valley. Today, the future looks rather different. In yen terms, Japan's exports have been stuck at about the same level for 10 years, while Korea and China have gained market share in electronics. The unemployment rate, officially 3 percent, is closer to 10 percent under U.S. accounting standards, and bad loans at Japan's banks could reach $800 billion, about five times the cost of the U.S. savings & loan bailout. There is, too, a pervasive anxiety among the Japanese about what they call their "donut economy," which is being hollowed out as factory jobs migrate to lower-wage countries, such as China.  <p> Japanese investors are also beginning to leave home. Paradoxically, this may be one remedy for Japan's woes. The yen, which hit a high of 79.75 to the dollar in April, has now slipped to 96.50 as of August 28, which has helped push the Nikkei stock index up more than 22 percent since April (with foreigners doing most of the buying). Why? The overvalued yen has been ruinous to Japanese manufacturers, allowing <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a>, for example, to price its Taurus far below <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a>'s Camry. But when investors expatriate yen, they push down the currency's value, making Japanese goods more competitive, Japanese firms more profitable, and Japanese equity markets more buoyant.   <p> In fact, the Ministry of Finance has been encouraging capital flight, lobbying insurance firms and other institutions to buy U.S. Treasury, German, Canadian, and Australian bonds. Imagine Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin strong-arming his old Wall Street colleagues into dumping U.S. securities. He'd be hanged for treason. Yet this trend could pick up dramatically this fall, as Japanese experience "sticker shock." Ma and Pa investors had been receiving 7 to 8 percent returns on five-year bank notes issued amid the bubble economy of 1990. But those notes are now starting to expire, and annual yields on new ones have fallen to around 1.5 percent. In response, for the first time, Japanese investors of modest means are looking to invest elsewhere than with their local banks unless they pay competitive rates. Japanese securities firms, meanwhile, have begun holding nationwide retail seminars on how to buy foreign bonds with higher yields.  <p>  <p>Continental Divide  <p> While Japan scrapes the bottom, Germany has stagnated. Here, too, exchange rates are playing a leading role, with the giant Daimler-Benz company announcing that it cannot earn profits with a superhigh deutsche mark. On August 24, the Bundesbank (Germany's central bank) cut interest rates to get the economy moving. Unfortunately for the bank, bond and equity traders throughout Europe assumed the cut would be the last for some time to come, and they began betting on when the Bundesbank would reverse course and tighten credit, which would force other European central banks to follow suit. So the mark stayed high and the economy continued to stall.  <p> Betting Below the Border  <p> By now it's a cliché to say that emerging markets "pose enormous risks." Still, it's true, especially when investors tie their fortunes to individual policymakers. Everyone knows, for example, that Mexican markets would collapse again if President Ernesto Zedillo tumbled from power. In Argentina, Economy Minister Domingo Cavallo almost singlehandedly defeated speculators during the Mexican crisis by his unwavering commitment to Argentina's "convertibility law," which pegs the Argentine peso at a 1:1 ratio to the U.S. dollar. Cavallo saved the Argentine markets, but he plunged the economy into a deep recession. Now the unions and old guard Peronists are after his scalp. If they get it, they'll plunder Argentina's Brady bonds and the Merval stock index as well.   <p> Good Investment News, Anyone?  <p> Is there any good news? Consider Canada and Colombia. After hemorrhaging red ink for years, Canada's provinces have finally begun tackling their budget deficits, which spells good news for Canadian bonds and the currency. The Quebec separatist movement, meanwhile, looks much weakened. Colombia presents a riskier case. President Ernesto Samper is fighting allegations of ties to drug cartels, and traders have hammered Colombian stocks and American depositary receipts in New York. The underlying economy is in pretty good shape, however, and Colombian equities could bounce back, with or without Samper. Just say "enormous risks" three times before laying your bets.    <p> Todd G. Buchholz is president of the G7 Group Inc., an international economic-consulting firm, and author of From Here to Economy:A Shortcut to Economic Literacy (Dutton, 1995).   <p><p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> BUILD FISCAL FITNESS WITH BARBELLS  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> When economic signals are as confusing as they have been of late, simply buy the most attractive bargains in the market. <p> That opportunistic advice is behind the "credit barbell strategy" that savvy fixed-income portfolio managers have begun to employ recently.   <p> The credit barbell is similar to a more familiar strategy, known as the "maturity barbell," used by many bond investors. A maturity barbell calls for investing in a mix of short- and long-term bonds when those issues, taking risk into account, offer moreattractive yields than intermediate issues. The result is a portfolio that looks like a barbell a big bulge on the extreme short-termend, a big bulge on the extreme long-term end, and almost nothing in between. By combining short and long maturities, the maturity barbell aims to create a portfolio with roughly the same riskas an intermediate bond but with a higher payout.  <p> A credit barbell involves a similar strategy, but instead of buying short and long maturities, an investor combines different credit risks. On the safe end, the investor building a credit barbell buys a portfolio of Treasury bonds; on the risky end, he buys junk bonds. The combination captures higher yields thaninvestment-grade corporate bonds the middle of the credit spectrum while taking the same or less risk. "We've been splitting our portfolio between Treasurys and high-yield bonds since May 1994," says Jerry Paul, manager of the <a name="FUND:FBDSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FBDSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Select Income Fund</b></a> (800-525-8085; no load; $1,000 minimum investment).   <p> Why is this strategy so attractive right now? Lately, corporations flush with profits haven't needed to issue bonds to raise money; the resulting scarcity of investment-grade issues has driven the prices        of existing bonds up and their yields down. For example, ten-year A-rated corporate bonds recently yielded only 67 basis points (100 basis points equal one percentage point) more than ten-year Treasurys. Meanwhile, high-yield corporate bonds rated B1 were recently paying around 9.6 percent a full 2.39 percentage points higher than A-rated corporates. "High yields are where the real bargains are," says Paul.  <p> Thomas Ole Dial, manager of the <a name="FUND:NNHBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NNHBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northstar Advantage High Total Return Fund</b></a> (800-595-7827; 4.75 percent load; $2,500 minimum), recommends a mix of 70 percent Treasurys and 30 percent B-rated bonds. One way to follow that advice is to divide your fixed-income money between a pair of funds such as <a name="FUND:VFITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VFITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard F/I Intermediate-Term U.S. Treasury</b></a> (800-662-7447; no load; $3,000 minimum) and <a name="FUND:FHYPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FHYPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco High-Yield</b></a> (800-525-8085; no load; $1,000 minimum).   <p> <p>

						By Andrew Gluck<p>Does Lennon deserve more credit than McCartney? Woodward more than Bernstein? Could Regis make it without Kathie Lee?<p>Should investors buy shares in Carlene Ziegler's first solo fund because the funds she previously comanaged, SteinRoe Special Fund and Strong Common Stock Fund, are among the best performing mutual funds over the last nine years?<p>Ziegler and Richard Weiss, her mentor and longtime coportfolio manager, were a great team, first at the <a name="FUND:SRSPX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SRSPX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SteinRoe Special Fund</b></a> from 1986 to 1991, then at <a name="FUND:STCSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/STCSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Strong Common Stock Fund</b></a> from 1991 until October 1994. With just a touch more volatility than the market over those nine years, the team averaged a 19.2 percent annual return. No stock fund took less risk and performed better in that period. Late last year, Ziegler, 39 years old, split with Weiss to launch her own investment advisory firm, Artisan Partners of Milwaukee, and her own mutual fund, <a name="FUND:ARTSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ARTSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Artisan Small Cap Fund</b></a>.<p>Investors have poured $130 million into the fund since its March 28 start-up. Are those investors smartly grabbing a good thing before it's gone, or are they overly impressed by the small-cap fund's promise to close to new investors when it reaches just $300 million in assets? That depends on how much credit an investor gives Ziegler for her track record.<p>There's no doubt that Weiss trained Ziegler. In 1980 Ziegler, a French major fresh out of the University of Illinois, responded to a blind ad in the Chicago Tribune for a research analyst. She interviewed with Weiss, then a 29-year-old wunderkind at SteinRoe, who hired and trained her. Five years later, she was comanaging a fund with him. In 1991, Richard Strongwooed the pair to his fund family, where Ziegler worked until her resignation last October.<p>While her departure hasn't caused bad blood between them, both clearly want to claim the team's track record. <p>"Dick and I both had the same number of stocks we were responsible for," Ziegler says. Weiss, who continues to comanage Strong Common Stock Fund, disputes that. "I wouldn't say it was ever 50/50," he says, adding, "I was the senior member of the team." No-Load Fund Analyst, an investment newsletter in Orinda, California, has calculated that Ziegler was responsible for 15 to 25 percent of the stock picks at Strong, a figure Ziegler calls inaccurate.<p>But these attempts at bean counting are really beside the point. A team, built around Ziegler and Weiss but also including analysts, researchers, and traders, created the track record at SteinRoe and Strong. "Carlene can live up to the track record," says Weiss, "but she has another team, and I don't know that other team."<p>That point wasn't lost on Ziegler when she set up Artisan. She hired Millie Hurwitz, a fund portfolio manager at SteinRoe, as a stock analyst at Artisan. Hurwitz was a research assistant to Ziegler and Weiss at SteinRoe from 1986 to 1989.<p>The team's style, a mix of growth and value, could best be described as "growth at a price," similar to the discipline at Strong Common and SteinRoe Special. Ziegler forages for little-known growth companies--half the stocks owned by the fund are covered by fewer than five Wall Street analysts--temporarily buffeted by bad news.<p>To set target buy and sell prices, Ziegler calculates the private-market value of a company. "If you have a target for what you think the business is worth, you're much more likely to buy when the stock is cheap and sell when it's expensive," she says.<p>No one can be certain Ziegler will match her track record with Weiss, but 14 weeks after starting up, Artisan Small Cap was up nearly 20 percent. <p>"Carlene learned the process we use," says Weiss, "and it's proved effective over many years and market cycles. If she sticks to that process, I have no doubt she'll do fine."<p>

						Seven acclaimed mutual fund managers have agreed to tell Worth readers each month about their current favorite domestic stocks. The price listed is the maximum at which the manager considers it attractive. It should be assumed that in each case the manager has bought the stock for his fund, perhaps at a lower price than the one mentioned here. The manager may also have sold the stock after July 24, the publishing deadline for this issue. Taken as a whole, the approaches of these seven managers illustrate a broad range of successful investment styles. The picks on this page are intended to serve as long-term recommendations; the managers describe the specific time horizons of their selections below.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
James P. Craig
<a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a>
Invests primarily in large growth companies with the idea of preserving capital over the long term.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NYSE:CCK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10419"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Crown Cork and Seal</b></a>Nyse: CCK
$55 <p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
When it comes to enhancing shareholder value, this packaging-industry giant specializing in beverage cans is one of the best-run companies I've come across. Right now there's a pending merger with CarnaudMetalbox, a French company that specializes in plastic bottles; this would add $5 billion in sales and hundreds of millions in cost savings. Packaging is a low-margin business, so when you change the margins slightly, there's huge earnings potential. The stock rose $5 when the company announced the merger. If it happens, this thing could go to $80 or $90 over the next one and a half to two years; if not, the downside is limited.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
Shelby M.C. Davis
<a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>New York Venture Fund</b></a>
Invests in large companies using a value-oriented style.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NYSE:SAI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10238"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>SunAmerica</b></a>
Nyse: SAI
$54<p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
SunAmerica is led by Eli Broad, one of the first people to spot the demographic shift driving the savings and investment boom. With more Americans buying packaged financial products, the company should earn $4.40 a share this fiscal year (ending in September) and 15 percent more next year. The stock had a nice run last spring but is still attractive. SunAmerica has a multifaceted distribution network for its fixed- and variable-annuity products. Broad is a proven winner; he's also an acquirer with excess cash on the balance sheet, so if we get into a tough market, he could be looking to buy.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
Daniel B. Leonard
<a name="FUND:FSFSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSFSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Invesco Strategic Portfolios Technology</b></a> Seeks growth stocks in technology and related fields.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NYSE:HRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>H&R Block</b></a>NYSE: HRB
$50<p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
H&R Block is a diversified service company. It owns CompuServe, the largest service network out there. People think of Block as an income-tax preparer or maybe as a financial-services franchise, but it's really a technology stock. CompuServe now makes more profit than the tax unit does; with earnings and revenues both growing at 35 percent annually, it now accounts for 43 percent of the company's revenues. CompuServe is also the only online company to own its own network; when the market recognizes this, the stock could go to $60 a share.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
William J. Nasgovitz
Hugh F. Denison
<a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value Fund</b></a>
Buys stocks of domestic small-cap companies believed to be undervalued.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NYSE:JA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15828"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>John Alden Financial </b></a>
Nyse: JA
$18 <p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
John Alden sells health insurance to companies with fewer than 100 employees. The stock hit a high of $40 a share in 1994 but is now trading at $17. It plummeted because the company reported poor first-quarter earnings, 40 cents a share versus 78 cents one year earlier. This was due to higher claims. The second quarter should also be poor, 45 cents versus 94 cents last year. However, I'm buying the stock on the bad news because it's trading at book value and has earning power of $3 a share or more. The stock should double in two years. <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
Eric E. Ryback
<a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a> 
Seeks current income first, capital appreciation second.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NASD:URIX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17101"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Uranium Resources </b></a>
Nasdaq: URIX
$7 <p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
This is the lowest-cost uranium producer in North America. It drills a lot of holes in the ground in Texas and New Mexico, then injects water to dissolve the uranium; when the solution is pumped out, the water evaporates, leaving only the uranium. The stock fell to $4 earlier this year when its former chairman filed for bankruptcy. The company received a new cash infusion and has resumed drilling. Demand, which already exceeds supply, is rising. Barring a major drop in oil prices, the stock will certainly go above $20 and probably as high as $30. <p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
Ralph Wanger
Chuck McQuaid
<a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acorn Fund </b></a>
Holds stocks of small-cap companies that may benefit from favorable economic trends.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NASD:LICIA"></a><b>Lilly Industries Class A</b>
Nasdaq: LICIA
$15 <p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
Lilly Industries, a manufacturer of industrial coatings and chemicals, is gaining market share and making smart acquisitions. It has strong cash flow, a 25 percent return on equity last year, and long-term earnings growth of 15 percent. Raw-materials costs have recently stabilized and lower interest rates should help demand. At 13 times this year's earnings, the stock is cheap--down from a 1994 high of $18. Second-quarter earnings were flat and I don't know when they'll improve, but when they do, the stock should jump; meanwhile, the company is buying its own shares.<p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FUND MANAGER/NAME/DESCRIPTION:
Donald A. Yacktman
<a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund </b></a>
Seeks long-term growth in companies with market capitalization of at least $1 billion.<p>PICK AND TARGET PRICE:
<a name="NYSE:VCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12305"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Valassis Communications</b></a>
Nyse: VCI
$18 <p>THE MANAGER EXPLAINS HIS CHOICE:
Valassis, which prints the coupon inserts in Sunday papers, has an extremely profitable and secure duopoly with a subsidiary of Newscorp. The industry pricing environment, which was hurt when a third company unsuccessfully tried to enter the market a few years ago, is starting to come back. Profit margins are being pinched by the rising cost of paper, but the coupon-insert-business continues to grow. The company also is expanding overseas and diversifying into related fields. With more rational pricing, earnings could be at $1.50 to $2 a share by 1996. I can see the stock reaching the mid-30s.<p><p>

						September 1995
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>TRENDSPOTTER<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>* Spectators at the summer 1996 Olympic games will carry the latest in currency: smart cards. They look like credit cards, but they're, well, a lot smarter. A microchip embedded in the card allows it to store electronic cash in amounts from $10 up. About a million smart cards will be sold to Atlanta's visitors and residents; the cards will be accepted at fast-food restaurants and grocery stores and by vending machines and pay phones. No personal data will be stored on the cards circulating in this pilot program, but plastic packed with data, such as medical and insurance information, will debut in 1997. <p>* Let us not give thanks: The Kiplinger Washington Letter reports that religious contributions are flat, even though the pews are packed. Episcopalians give the most: $640 per member per year. After that are Assemblies of God, $625; Presbyterians, $610; Baptists, $545; Mormons, $525; Jews, $510; Lutherans, $410; Methodists, $380; and Catholics, $160.<p>* Back in 1970, thieves stole cars to joyride. Today, ripping off autos makes for a lucrative career. According to the National Insurance Crime Bureau, the number of vehicles stolen in the past 25 years has jumped 67 percent while the recovery rate has dropped 26 percent.<p>* Citizens utilities boards--not-for-profit watchdog agencies that fight rate increases proposed by gas, electric, and telephone companies--are getting louder. New York City's CUB attracted 20,000 members last year alone. This surge of consumer advocacy, coupled with the transition to a competitive market, could signal trouble for the utilities sector. "There's a lot of general pressure for the utilities to reduce prices," says Sandford Cohen, utilities analyst at Merrill Lynch. "We believe this group will underperform the market on a regular basis."<p>* Another reason to grouse on the job: A recent study reveals that merit-based salary increases are at a six-year low, with 1995 raises for top and middle management averaging 3.6 percent. Five years ago, top corporate brass pocketed a 5.4 percent raise, and middle managers received a 5.2 percent increase. <p>* A new study finds that 39 percent of Americans put off routine medical care when they're low on cash, with women (46 percent) more likely to do so than men (31 percent). Postponing routine care, of course, can lead to less routine, more expensive care. The study was sponsored by MasterCard, which recommends--yes--that we charge our checkups.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>GREAT EXPECTATIONS
The biggest danger to the stock market may not be a recession or interest rate hikes, but excessive investor expectations.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Listen and you can hear the stock market changing gears. It's not a pretty sound. The market always insists on accelerating, moving faster and faster until, with a grinding of gears, it abruptly downshifts. No wonder the passengers get whiplash.<p>Everyone knows--well, to be precise, most Wall Street economists agree--that the economy has slowed from the blistering pace that scared the Federal Reserve into raising interest rates seven times between February 1994 and February 1995. Real growth in gross domestic product in the second quarter of 1995 was about 1 percent, for example, Robert Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities, estimated in late July.<p>Logic suggests, therefore, that corporate earnings growth should slow in turn, a supposition that appears to be confirmed by some early numbers. After a 37 percent increase in earnings in 1994, for example, first-quarter earnings for the Standard & Poor's 500 stocks grew 25 percent in the first quarter of 1995, according to Zacks Investment Research. For the second quarter, Zacks projects S&P 500earnings to grow at around 18 to 19 percent.<p>With decelerating economic and earnings growth clearly in evidence, Wall Street has had plenty of time to reduce expectations and earnings projections, and the market could conceivably make its own smooth transition to slower growth.
But that's not the way this market operates. The investment world is so dominated by momentum investors right now that trends are almost guaranteed to go to excess--before making a violent correction. Take the case of  <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>--a technology stock that went from highflyer to road kill in the space of a week.<p>On Tuesday, July 18, after the market closed, the company reported quarterly earnings of 99 cents a share. Revenue had climbed 41 percent and earnings 36 percent. The next day, the stock dropped $8, and it fell another $2.31 by week's end.<p>Why the crash? After all, earnings weren't dramatically off the $1.03 consensus estimate of analysts ($1.10 per share at the upper end). But these official calculations bore little relation to the stratospheric expectations of the momentum crowd. In the days before Intel's earnings announcement, the electronic world was abuzz with excitement. On July 14, at 9:30 p.m., one investor on <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> first guessed that earnings had to come in at $1.10--then, a few lines later in his message, raised that to $1.11. The next morning, another invest-or on the same service started by suggesting $1.25 a share would be a reasonable quarterly figure and wound up predicting $1.32. To this investor, Intel missed projections by a mile, almost 25 percent, not just a few cents. These individual investors weren't alone, obviously. Intel's volume spiked sharply upward on the day of its $8 decline. The big boys sold, too.<p>The disturbing irony to this story is that the biggest danger to the stock market currentlymay not be a recession or inter-est rate hikes, but excessive investor expectations. Certainly the market has little to fear from the economy right now. Earlier signs of a classic "inventory" recession--in which slowing consumer demand causes a buildup in inventories, which eventually leads to a cut in manufacturing activity--have disappeared. Sectors showing faster growth in inventories than in sales on a year-to-year basis have seen sales pick up in recent months, says Nikko's Brusca. For example, retailers--who saw inventories grow at 9.4 percent and sales grow just 6.3 percent year to year--showed sales growing faster than inventories in May.<p>Inflation, too, seems subdued. Capacity utilization, which measures how much of existing manufacturing capacity is in use, hit 85.5 percent in December 1994 but was down to 83.5 percent in June 1995. That's not high enough to lead to serious production bottlenecks, especially because consumer demand isn't likely to heat up fast. Consumers are carrying high debt loads and low savings rates, Brusca notes, which should limit increases in spending to approximately the slow growth rate of consumer incomes.<p>Under these conditions, inflation is likely to creep upward at 3.3 to 3.5 percent this year, and Brusca projects the 30-year Treasury bond will fluctuate between 6.6 and 6.9 percent.<p>How dull: Decent but not great growth; growing but not rapidly accelerating profits; small interest rate fluctations but no multiple rate cuts.<p>Will investors successfully adjust, scaling back expectations to fit this market? There is reason for pessimism. Some of the recent frenzy over technology stocks, for example, occurred because money managers and individual investors, having missed the first-quarter rally, threw their money at the latest winners, whatever the share price, in an effort to catch up.<p>That practice can quickly reach a point of diminishing returns. If some of these highflyers disappoint, investors could start putting their cash on an ever smaller number of stocks. With more money chasing them, those stocks could get bid up to levels that can't be sustained.<p>The hallmarks of this situation aren't impossible to spot. Watch the various indicators of market breadth--the number of rising stocks versus the number falling. In healthy rallies, the market will move up on the back of a large number of stocks. If on the other hand, the overall market gains but on fewer and fewer stocks, that's a danger sign. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>FUND BRIEFS<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>FEEING FRENZY: <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab & Co.</b></a> and Fidelity Investments are about to add new fees on small accounts. Beginning October 1, Schwab will assess a $7.50 quarterly fee on accounts with less than a $1,000 balance in three consecutive months. Starting in November, Fidelity will charge a $12 annual fee if an investor has less than $2,500 in any fund--up to a maximum of $60 per customer. Fidelity will waive the fees for accounts above $50,000 and Schwab for customers with $10,000 in all household accounts.<p>XENOFUNDIA: Just 26 percent of U.S. households that own funds invest in international or global funds, according to a poll conducted for Scudder Funds. Of those surveyed, 18 percent--up from 10 percent in the poll a year ago--said funds primarily invested in foreign securities are too risky.<p>FINANCIALLY SOUND? Large concentrations in any sector can add unexpected risk to a portfolio. In mid-July some 21 supposedly diversified equity funds had more than 50 percent of their assets in financial companies, according to data from Morningstar. The 21 include CGM Mutual, Selected American Shares, Clipper, Third Avenue Value, and Legg Mason Total Return Trust.<p><p>

						<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Is there any such thing as a free lunch? In the financial world the answer is occasionally yes. Sometimes an investor can combine better-than-average returns with lower-than-average risk by exploiting an underresearched part of the market. Almost always, however, the advantage is fleeting__other investors, attracted by success, flood in, or the investor gets too big for his niches.<p>Amazingly, the <a name="FUND:LDDVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LDDVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lindner Dividend Fund</b></a> has been able to enjoy such a free lunch for more than 15 years. But investors considering the fund as a high-return, low-risk haven in today's volatile market should know that some things about the fund have changed in recent years.<p>The Lindner Dividend Fund has returned 11.92 percent annually over the last ten years__just a tad below the average equity fund. But the fund earned that return with far less risk. Lindner Dividend's standard deviation (a measure of how much any year's return deviates from the average) for the period was just 6.53__making the fund less than half as volatile as the average. Think about the fund in these terms: Lindner Dividend Fund was about as risky as the average bond fund for these years and returned about three percentage points more a year.<p>"I work in my own little world here," says manager Eric Ryback, 43, of the relatively underresearched markets in convertible bonds, convertible preferred stocks, preferred stocks, and junk bonds in which he invests. The junk bonds of troubled apparel maker Hartmarx are a typical Ryback pick. Hartmarx nearly went bankrupt in the early 1990s, but Ryback liked the company's balance sheet. He bought the bonds at a deep discount to yield 11.6 percent and plans to hold them to maturity, thus locking in oversize yields without taking long-term interest rate risk.<p>Lindner Dividend had a tough year in 1994, when it fell 3.31 percent as interest rates rose. But that kind of short-term glitch isn't what worries some analysts.<p>"This fund is different than it was five years ago, or even three years ago," says Erik Witkowski, an analyst at North- field Information Services, a Boston-based investment consultant. After years of zigging when the major indexes zagged, Lindner Dividend's correlation to the Standard & Poor's 500 and Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond Index has been higher in the last three years. Witkowski frets that if the fund's character has changed so much, its performance will, too.<p>"All funds are different than they were three or four years ago, particularly if they were successful," Ryback says. "But we haven't put on different clothes." Ryback took over the fund in 1983, shortly after he joined the fund company run by legendary investor Kurt Lindner. Assets have soared from $235 million at the end of 1991 to $1.76 billion through March 31, 1995. Still, the fund's 10.84 percent return for the last three years only slightly trails the fund's ten-year record, and the risk is down for the period.<p>As the fund has grown in size, Ryback has broadened the fund's investment universe. In June 1993 the fund's shareholders voted to let Ryback put up to 25 of the fund's assets in private placements, which trade in exactly the kind of inefficient market Ryback likes. On the other hand, these issues could be hard to sell in a sharp market correction.<p>But the biggest change at the fund has nothing to do with the contents of the fund's portfolio. In February 1993, an ailing Kurt Lindner sold his fund company__then consisting of just two funds__to Ryback, who has since opened four new funds. Ryback manages or co-manages all four new funds
.
"We're stretched thin," Ryback says. "I've basically had to play catch-up over the last two years." He has added four researchers and intends to hire two new portfolio managers. All these changes add up to risk of a kind that doesn't show up in past performance. <p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran  <p> Bye-bye, greenback. If current legislation passes in Congress, the dollar bill will be yanked from circulation and replaced by a dollar coin. Although the mint would ultimately decide whose face would grace the coin, the General Accounting Office calls for it to be quarter-size and gold in color. "Public opinion is against it," says Nye Stevens of the GAO. "But the public has no choice." The public can, however, keep an eye on mining companies, vending-machine outfits, and transit companies: All three industries are lobbying for the coin.   <p> Like hem lines, car colors soar and sink in popularity. Right now, earth tones and deep hues like midnight blue are in vogue. But new car buyers might think twice before driving off in the mocha-bean colored sedan, cautions Charles Vogelheim, editor of the Kelley Blue Book Used Car Guide. "I'm not convinced those earth tones will be popular down the road in the resale market," says Vogelheim. "I also think teal will peak out and lose its appeal." Safe bets? Red, black, and white cars never go out ofstyle.    <p> A rose may be a rose by any other name, but a company definitely gets a little extra investor attention when it changes its moniker. Professor Chiranjeev Kohli of California State University at Fullerton and intellectual-property lawyer Thomas Hemnes studied the 866 name changes made by NYSE-listed companies between 1960 and 1991. In the short term, they found, a name change often affects a company's stock price sometimes for the better and sometimes, when investors think a new name signals corporate uncertainty, for the worse. "When a company changes its name, it signals that something big is going on inside," Kohli says. "Either they are restructuring or repositioning or just looking for a new image."  <p> "We don't." So say more women. The Census Bureau reports that the proportion of females between 25 and 34 years who have never married nearly tripled from 9 percent in 1970 to 26 percent in1993.   <p> Crashing for cash is the latest trend among insurance fraudsters. According to a study released by the Insurance Research Council, the ratio of auto-injury claims to property claims has jumped 64 percent over the past ten years. Staged auto accidents aren't the only schemes for profit. Some folks just fake whiplash orinflate damages following a fender bender. In fact, a 1993 IRC poll found that one out of every five adults think it's okay to pad an accident claim.    <p> Expect to hear more pleas for cash from the nonprofit sector. Fiscally troubled cities, such as Philadelphia and Buffalo, New York, are pressuring charities to pay taxes on property or municipal services for the first time. That, according to nonprofit specialists, will mean higher fees at some colleges and hospitals and lots of additional fund-raising.    <p><p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> ONE DOWN, ONE TO GO  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> Can we tell you that the market will dive 200 points on Tuesday, or that the Dow Jones Industrial Average will climb straight to 5000 without a hitch? Nope. Over the short haul, the stockmarket is essentially random. No one can predict what will happen tomorrow. But we do believe in the power of fundamentals over the long term. And right now we know that the bond market rally that began at the end of 1994 and accelerated this year has knocked one major support out from under the stock market. That leaves only the hope of growing corporate earnings to sustain stocks at current levels, cold comfort to those who understand the relationship between earnings and stock prices.  <p> Let's start with why a bond rally, at this moment, is bad news for stocks. "The key idea is decoupling," says Bluford Putnam, chief strategist at Bankers Trust Global Investment Management. The bond market rallies that is, the price of bonds goes up and the yield on bonds goes down, when investors believe that interest rates are headed down and inflation isn't a danger. That's exactly what happened beginning last November. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond was 8.11 percent on November 22, declined to 7.71 by January 31, hit 7.40 on March 20, and finally tumbled to 6.9 percent.  <p> Now, often such a rally drives the stock market up too. When that happens, analysts say the markets are coupled. As bonds pay less interest, stocks look more attractive, assuming that earnings aren't falling. If the economy is slowing just enough to keep inflation fears at bay, but not enough to hurt corporate earnings, rising bond prices are good for stocks.  <p> At some point, however, falling interest rates start to signal bad news for the economy and thus for stocks. If rates go too low, that means the bond market expects growth to slow so much that earnings will fall.  <p> The bond market may have reached that point in late May. "We've completely milked the low interest rates and slow-growth story," says Putnam. "The market has completely discounted a safe landing by the economy."  <p> To Putnam, the economy must walk a very fine line to sustain the current combination of stock and bond prices: Inflation has to stay at 3 percent or less, and the economy must grow at a rate between 1.5 and 2 percent. "I don't think we can walk that line," he says, noting the rate of inflation at the consumer level hit 3.1 percent in April, up from 2.9 percent in March and 2.4 percent a year ago.  <p> Putnam sees two possible scenarios. In the first, which he believes has a two-thirds chance of coming to pass, the economy grows faster than expected. If this happens (if the economy grows at, say, 2.5 percent and inflation rises to just 4 percent), Putnam believes the interest rate on the 30-year bond will rise to 7.5 percent and hurt both markets.  <p> Alternatively, the economy could grow more slowly than the market expects, slipping into recession. "I don't think it would be a severe one, but it would take profit growth into negative territory," Putnam says.  <p> It's the little things that worry Putnam. If growth is 2.5 per-cent instead of 2 percent, if in-flation rises to 4 percent instead of 3, if the economy grows less than 1.5 percent, then the stock market suffers. "Risks have gotten to a really high level, and you should be cautious even if you're bullish," he says.  <p> The Wall Street optimists, meanwhile, have turned increasingly to earnings to justify their views. Standard & Poor's is projecting earnings growth for the companies in the S & P 500 of about 21 percent this year, on top of the 37 percent increase in 1994. Despite the market's rally, the price-to-earnings ratio on the S & P is 17.2, down from 20.8 in May 1994. Conventional wisdom says that the market's average price-to-earnings ratio lies between 13 and 18. And another rule of thumb says that a stock is fairly priced at a price-to-earnings ratio equal to its growth rate. Those two formulas suggest that the market, while no bargain, isn't in dangerous territory either.  <p> But this analysis misunderstands the relation between earnings and stock prices. "What is it that moves stock prices?" asks James Stack of InvesTech Research. It is not earnings, he says, but expectations, and everyone still expects strong growth, which is reflected in today's stock prices.  <p> Stack finds little consolation in today's price-to-earnings ratio or next year's projections. "The problem with earnings is they have a poor correlation with stock prices," he says." At 17, the S & P price-to-earnings ratio is down to the level where the 1973­1974 bear market started. In 1991, when this current market blasted off, the p/e ratio on the S&P was near the highest level in history at 26."  <p> Imagining the entire market as one giant stock helps illustrate the difficulties in using a specific ratio to forecast futureprices. A cyclical stock <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, for example, shows its highest p/e ratio when its earnings are lowest, when it's struggling to sell cars. When the company's factories are running full tilt, the p/e ratio plummets. At which point would an investor rather buy? When the ratio is high (before the company recovers and before its price moves up) or after?  <p> Or think about a technology growth stock. An investor who buys <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>when earnings are growing 45 percent a year and its p/e ratio is 37 expects future earnings to grow at that same rate. A dip in earnings to, say, 20 percent would send the stock plunging. You might still want to buy Microsoft, but at a lower price.  <p> This market is coming off what looks like a peak in earnings growth. Profit margins aren't going up in the next year in all likelihood, companies will see their margins fall. Most investors wouldn't jump to buy a stock with those prospects. Why should the entire market be any different?    <p><p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> INDUSTRY SECTORS  <p> By Manjeet Kripalani  <p> Investors, expecting flat or declining interest rates this summer, bid up the share prices of home builders and savings and loans. Pulte Corp. was one of the only two home builders to report increased orders for the first quarter of the year, up 4 percent from last year. Among S & Ls, the primary home lenders, Golden West Financial was a strong performer.  <p> Metals and gold-mining stocks, traditional hedges against inflation, lost luster. The slowdown in auto sales hit the steel industry, and demand for basic metals like copper and aluminum is expected to drop. J. Clarence Morrison, senior metals analyst at Prudential Securities, forecasts a copper surplus of 175,000 tons by 1997. The recently higher dollar hurt gold, and Morrison does not recommend buying gold or copper stocks.  <p> Recent tensions in the Middle East boosted the energy sector. The U.S. trade embargo against Iran helped oil prices rebound from last year.  <p> Health care services continue to do poorly. U.S. Healthcare's announcement of possible price cuts has created fears of an HMO price war and consequent lower growth rates. However, Kenneth Abramowitz, health care analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein, advises investors to stick with stocks like U.S. Healthcare, saying,"Earnings will eventually fall in line with revenues."  <p> Slow growth also dogged the cyclical transportation sector, especially Pittston Services (air freight). But hang tight, says Sam Stovall, editor of Standard & Poor's Industry Outlook: "After an economic slowdown, transportation issues are among the first to recover."  <p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> GOOD VALUES THE BOND RALLY LEFT BEHIND  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> On January 24, 1995, the 30-year Treasury bond yielded 7.93 percent. During the next few months, as interest rates fell, the price of the 30-year bond soared. By May 18, the yield on the 30-year bond was down to just 6.9 percent, and the price of a bond purchased in late January had climbed by 15 percent. <p> Those kinds of returns have brought money flooding back into long-term bonds and bond funds. But investors putting money into this part of the bond market now are running to catch a train that left the station months ago. It's unlikely that rates are headed down much further this year, and investors who buy long-term bonds could be setting themselves up for big losses without achance of earning big profits. "Investors aren't getting paid for the added risk at the long end," says Joseph Zarr, managerof <a name="FUND:FLXBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FLXBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Flex-Funds Global Income Fund</b></a>. "Long-term Treasury bond yields could go back from 6.9 percent to 7.5 percent or 8 percent."If that happened, prices could decline10 percent or more.  <p> Rather than chase the last rally, investors looking for income and maybe a little capital gain, should look at bonds that missed the surge.  <p> Intermediate bonds. In late May, seven-year Treasurys yielded 6.5 percent. That's 94 percent of the yield on much riskier 30-year issues. "With intermediates, you can protect yourself without giving up much income," says Walter Frank, chief investment officer for IBC Donoghue's Moneyletter.  <p> Municipal bonds. Munis have lagged the bond market in part because investors expect Congress to slash taxes on investment income, making munis' tax-exempt status less valuable. Yields on tax-exempts recently amounted to around 88 percent of those on Treasurys, up from 81 percent in February.  <p> Mortgage-backed securities. During 1993 and 1994, 7.2 million homeowners refinanced $741 billion in mortgages. That sliced returns for mortgage-backed securities, such as Ginnie Maes, which are in effect bundles of mortgages. Whenever a homeowner prepays a mortgage, there's less in interest income to pass along to the holders of the securities. Concern about additional refinancings has caused these issues to lag this year; as a result, 30-year Ginnie Maes yield 7.56 percent. But these fears are overblown, argues Garitt Kono, manager of the <a name="FUND:DREVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DREVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dreyfus GNMA Fund</b></a>. Even if rates fall further, far fewer homeowners are still looking to refinance.  <p><p><p>

						July/August 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> GLOBAL MARKETS  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> The U.S. economy has, for the moment, its soft landing. Inflation and growth rates are moderate, perhaps sustainably so. If the Federal Reserve is indeed finished raising interest rates, as Chairman Alan Greenspan hinted last spring, equity markets everywhere are likely to be buoyed by the news. "There was a big sigh of relief heard around the world," says Todd Buchholz, president of the G7 Group, an Alexandria, Virginia, economics consulting group.   <p> Global markets should do well at least through the summer, depending on the U.S. economy. "There are two very distinct schools of thought," says John Trott, the chief international investment officer at Bessemer Trust in London. "Some think we've seen the last rise in interest rates and that everything looks pretty good. Others see the soft landing as an extended pause in U.S.growth and believe that in the third and fourth quarter, interest rates will go back up." A lot will depend on U.S. consumer spending; if it heats up, so will the economy and interest rates.   <p> Clark Winter, president of Global Asset Management, says U.S. politics, not economics, may have the greatest effect on world stock markets. "The rest of the world is paying close attention to what's going on in Washington, D.C., and state capitals such as Albany," he says. Winter says the U.S., by reducing deficits and state spending, could raise confidence in its economy and perhaps inaugurate a global post­cold war reformation of government spending.  <p> HIGHLIGHTS  <p> FRANCE  With Jacques Chirac and the conservatives in power, the time may be ripe to shrink the central government and privatize state-held industry. "The tension is high in the Chirac camp," says Buchholz. "He's conservative, so he should believe in deficit reduction, but he's also a populist, which puts him against unemployment, now at an unacceptable 12 percent. If you're on the side of deficit cutting, financial markets love you. But if you believe in reducing unemployment, that usually means government spending and investors will turn on France."  <p> BRAZIL  Emerging from the "tequila hangover" that struck emerging markets after the Mexican peso devaluation last December, President Fernando Henrique Cardoso is beginning to push some economic reforms through Congress. Says Joseph DeSantis, head of international equities for Chase Asset Management, "The agenda is far from complete, but investors saw enough of a shift in momentum that money started to flow in."<p><p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> TRENDSPOTTER  <p> By Monica Corcoran and Ellen Simon  <p> *This might not be the time to play gentleman rancher. Stock cows that went for $1,200 a year ago are worth just $850 now. Range and slaughter cattle are cheaper, too. Greg Sanders, a reporter for a USDA market newsletter, dates the problem to 1986, when farmers sold off huge numbers of cows. The ranges have gotten more crowded every year since, and supply is now growing faster than demand. The winners in this are consumers, who should see "better, more exciting specials or features," says C.J. Valenziano of the Chicago-based Beef Industry Council. "This is one of those big, ugly, cyclical things."  <p> *Safe surfing is the latest buzz on the Net. To protect confidential data, including credit card numbers, companies are learning to firewall and encrypt. Firewalling involves the creation of an impenetrable wall around parcels of top-secret info. Encrypting means translating messages into indecipherable codes that are, of course, decrypted at the other end. The leaders in security software are still small and privately held, but you might want to remember these names: RSA Data Security, <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a>, and Trusted Information Systems.  <p> *How are regulated industries such as cable, telecommunications, and gas and electric utilities planning for the prospect of deregulation and increased competition? First, by playing musical chairs, rushing into industries they know nothing about, and second, by slashing staff, the management panacea of our time. John Siegman, director of utilities and communications at Equifax National Decision Systems, a San Diego marketing company, points to cable operators' eagerness to muscle into telecommunications "despite the fact that cable's customer satisfaction is the lowest inregulated industry."  <p> *Last year, <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> needed the force of the U.S. government to muscle into the Japanese cellular-phone market: Until U.S.trade rep Mickey Kantor got involved, Motorola's Japanese distributor, IDO, refused to increase its purchases of Motorola phones. Well, here's the epilogue: Since the battle, IDO's subscribers have nearly doubled.   <p> *Maybe someday we'll think as much as we drink. But we aren't there yet. While spending on education and research recently surpassed the amount spent on off-premises alcohol, spending on books still looks like a pittance compared with beer: $72.9 billion versus $17.5 billion in 1990.  <p> *Does the workplace bite? Not according to Gen X-ers. A recently released study by the Wyatt Co., a retirement-consulting firm, reveals that it's the over-30 baby boomers who are dissatisfied with their jobs. Of the 4,300 employees surveyed, workers under 30 were more positive about their jobs than any other age group. Paul Sanchez, coauthor of the study, believes the cynical younger set simply has lower standards: "They don't have romantic expectations about their work."          <p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> THE VIEW FROM 400  <p> By David S. Liebowitz  <p> Judging from the jubilation at the stock exchanges on February 23, one might have thought the traders had erased the deficit and spotted Elvis on the same day. In fact, that was the day the Dow Jones Industrial Average broke 4000. And when, 60 days later, the Dow muscled past 4300, many of my colleagues on the Street thought they'd died and gone to heaven. Alas, wherever their minds are, they and their investments are still here. <p> It's my opinion that, from any real-world perspective, this market is overvalued. This is not to say it won't go still higher, but that just means it will have farther to fall.   <p> Bear in mind that 4000 represented a psychological barrier, not a measure of the Dow's intrinsic value. And the assault on the last "major resistance level," to use technical language, suggests it may be some time before the 4000 barrier can be decisively overcome. In 1964 the first attempt on 1000 was mounted, only to be aborted in the spring of 1965, when then-chairman of the Federal Reserve Board William McChesney Martin publicly commented on the similarities between the market of the day and that of1929, the beginning of the Great Depression.  <p> The 1000 barrier was actually scaled in 1966 on an intraday basis, but again the market backed off. Indeed, the Dow eventually fell as low as 607 in September 1974. It wasn't until the beginning of the bull market, coming off the August 1982 year low of 784, that 1000 was finally relegated to history's dust bin.  <p> Is this meant to imply that it will take 16 years before we bid a permanent adieu to 4000? Certainly not. Both the market and the U.S. economy have grown far larger and more resilient since then. But the signs augur an imminent correction.  <p> In the first quarter the Dow rose an impressive 324 points, but a number of key indicators are signaling caution. Consider, for example, the advance/decline ratio, the number of stocks trading higher on the day versus the number trading lower. It measures the so-called breadth of the market, or how many issues actually participated in a day's overall rise or fall. At the beginning or in the middle of a bull market, as investor confidence grows, so does the percentage of rising stocks. Over time, this daily pattern can be plotted as a rising advance/decline line, showing more and more of the market climbing. This was the case from January of 1991, when the last bull market kicked off, until the middle of 1993. During this period, advances sometimes outnumbered declines even on days when the Dow fell.  <p> In the present market, according to data compiled by James Stack, editor of the InvesTech Market Analyst newsletter, just the opposite has occurred. Though the advance/decline line has risen somewhat this year, it is down considerably over the last 14 months though the Dow has risen through this period. On two of the last ten new closing highs, decliners actually outnumbered gainers. This suggests investors are losing confidence and are growing more selective in their choice of stocks, a view supported by the fact that the push past 4000, which began in November, was propelled by a rise in 27 of the 30 blue chips making up the Dow.   <p> Never before in the 68 years for which the data is available has the advance/decline line shown a cumulative decline over such a long period at the same time the Dow was setting record highs. Ominously, the only comparable period occurred between1971 and 1973 and ended with the most miserable market in half a century.   <p> Several other fundamental stock market gauges are also sounding the alarm. One that has been doing so for a long time is the market's dividend yield, which measures the average current yield of all the stocks on one of the broad-based market indices. In the past, when that figure fell below 3 percent, it has signaled an overpriced market. Today that figure stands at 2.6 percent, and it has been below 3 percent since November 1992.  <p> Another valuable yard stick is the differential between the market yield and long-term bond rates, which indicates the relative attractiveness of stocks and bonds. The equilibrium point in the spread is approximately 3 percent. A lower rate differential favors stocks, while a higher one favors bonds. At present, the spread is pushing 5 percent.  <p> We also may be within one Fed interest rate increase of an inversion in the Treasury yield curve. During this rare phenomenon, the curve first flattens, narrowing the spread between short-term rates (Treasury bills) and customarily higher long-term rates (usually the bench mark 30-year bond). This is followed by the inversion, during which short-term rates exceed long-term ones. Over the past 50 years there have been fewer than a half dozen inversions; each heralded a market decline and a weakening economy. <p> What will trigger the decline? The continued weakening of the dollar, another rise in interest rates, more potentially inflationary price increases in raw materials such as copper, aluminum, paper, or platinum any, all, or none of these could start the market rolling downhill. So could a crisis in Mexico, China or the Middle East. Don't expect a crash, though. The end of a strong market usually starts with a slow erosion of share prices, before increasing trading causes the momentum to accelerate.   <p> There's a phrase you hear a lot on Wall Street: "This time will be different." Professionals say it as a joke, but it also shows up in articles and analyst reports on cyclical stocks and industry groups, generally as a reason for investors to buy shares that would otherwise seem to have peaked. Problem is: The phrase rarely holds true.   <p> David S. Leibowitz is a managing director at Burnham Securitiesin New York City. <p><p> <p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> OVERVIEW  <p> By Dean Robinson  <p> Currency tensions have been the big story lately, but they don't seem to have hurt the international equities markets much. "I'm surprised we have not seen more downward pressure on the markets," says Philip Ehrmann, a London-based investment director for Invesco Capital Management. "But they must've decided that U.S. interest rates are not going up." As David Beckwith, head of the international-equity division at John Hancock, notes, "There's been a long period of turbulence lots of profit taking, a lot of events that hurt the markets. But people are starting to settle down, shake off the effects of Barings, Orange County, Kobe. There are some good earnings numbers coming out; the fundamentals are still attractive. There's a renewed look at the world."  <p> WINNERS <p>POLAND Why Poland? "Bottom fishing after it totally dried up last year," says Ehrmann. Also, because the Polish market is so thin only a dozen or so stocks are traded any buying can cause a "sharp bounce," Ehrmann says. He notes that a conference of U.S. investors recently held in Poland may have inspired just such a bounce.  <p> NEW ZEALAND "A very nice economy," says Rich Lazarchic, a senior portfolio manager for IDS Mutual Fund Group in Minneapolis. "It relies on exports, which means it depends on the rest of the world doing well, particularly Southeast Asia and that's been doing well." Rising paper prices worldwide and <a name="NYSE:IP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10800"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>International Paper</b></a>'s April acquisition of a 50.1 percent stake in Carter Holt Harvey New Zealand's second largest company and above 15 percent of the market's index help as well.  <p> JAPAN Obviously the dollar's weakness against the yen pumped up this market's dollar gains. But currency values weren't the only factors at work, says Beckwith. The Nikkei 225 Index was hit so hard, falling more than18 percent in the first three months of the year, that valuations have dropped to the point where some find them attractive.  <p> TURKEY Falling interest rates, strong corporate earnings, and recent political stability have encouraged domestic investors, who account for most of the market's capital. "The numbers are flat-out good," says David Edgerly, general manager of Alliance Capital Management in Istanbul, Turkey. Edgerly says that even Turkey's invasion of Kurdish northern Iraq has stirred optimism.

						By Andrew Gluck  <p> The urge to merge has never been stronger witness <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft's</b></a> months-long pursuit of <a name="NASD:INTU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16001"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intuit</b></a>. There were more corporate deals in 1994 than ever before, according to Securities Data Corp., and 1995 has started off on a similar pace. But individual investors tend to watch these big-stakes deals from the sidelines, lacking both the expertise and the risk tolerance to bet confidently on whether a particular merger will go through.  <p> There's a better way to get in on the action: a no-load mutual fund called the <a name="FUND:MERFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MERFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merger Fund</b></a>. It's the only mutual fund to invest exclusively in companies that are objects of publicly announced takeover bids or other capital restructurings. The fund makes money by purchasing shares in the target company below what they will be worth upon completion of the merger. (Because of the risk that a deal will fall through, takeover targets always trade at some discount to their announced acquisition price.)  <p> That's risky business, but the Merger Fund has developed an admirable low-risk track record. According to data from Morningstar, the Merger Fund has outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Index at about half the risk. The Merger Fund averaged a 10.44 percent return annually for the last three years, compared with 8.56 percent for the S&P.  <p> The Merger Fund keeps its risk low by committing money only when a deal appears certain to pan out. The fund usually has stakes in about 40 to 50 merger deals. Of the transactions the fund has invested in, fewer than 5 percent have fallen through, says Frederick Green, who comanages the fund with Bonnie Smith."We spend a good part of our day analyzing prospective transactions, focusing on key issues affecting whether a deal will be completed," says Green, a former portfolio strategist for Goldman, Sachs. <p> To understand the fund in action, consider its investment in the recently completed acquisition of Western Company of North America by <a name="NYSE:BJS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12054"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BJ Services</b></a> (both are oil-service companies). On September13, 1994, BJ Services announced an offer to pay $18.50 a share to acquire Western. Western insisted it wasn't for sale, but its shares rocketed from $12.50 to $17 on speculation that a deal would eventually be worked out.  <p> The Merger Fund team jumped into action, calling company executives, speaking to Wall Street analysts, and reviewing public filings and financial statements issued by the companies. After all the homework had been completed, Green and Smith decided to passon Western because of the risk that the merger would not take place.  <p> But Western remained on the fund's watch list. On November17, BJ announced it had signed an agreement to buy Western for $20 in cash (or the equivalent in BJ shares) plus a fractional warrant to buy BJ shares. With the merger now looking solid, Green hired an economist and an attorney to study potential antitrust objections.When those consultants reported that antitrust problems were unlikely to kill the deal, the Merger Fund purchased about 200,000 shares of Western at an average price of a little more than $18 each. In the coming weeks, after the Justice Department cleared the deal, the fund added more shares. <p>  <p>When BJ's acquisition of Western was finally completed on April13, the Merger Fund reaped an average annualized gain of more than 26 percent on its Western holdings.  <p> One pitfall of the fund is that almost all its gains are short-term and therefore taxed as ordinary income. But the Merger Fund can strengthen a fund portfolio by diversifying risk. Because the fund spreads risk exposure to another market the takeover trading market its gains and losses are usually independent of the stock market's performance. That doen't make it immune to a crash, but it definitely provides a hedge against the market's usual ups and downs.  <p><p> <p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> FUND BRIEFS  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> NO WAY OUT: Beware of getting trapped in a mutual fund. Few investors know it, but the SEC allows funds to suspend redemptions in a crisis if they can't meet the demand for withdrawals. Holders of some <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lehman</b></a> funds with Mexican exposure learned that lesson the hard way when the peso crisis struck: Lehman blocked redemptions in three offshore funds not just for a day but for two weeks. <p> INTO AFRICA: If Mexico's too tame for you, the Calvert Group has introduced the New Africa Fund, a "socially responsible" fund that will invest in companies throughout the continent's14 stock exchanges. Sure, these markets are poorly regulated and face political instabilities. But Justine Beckett, the fund's manager, promises, "We won't be investing in companies operating in riskier markets, such as Somalia, Burundi, or Libya, anytime soon."   <p> DON'T BANK ON IT : Mutual funds will score a small victory overbanks if the IRS succeeds in yanking the tax-deferred status of the Retirement CD, a certificate of deposit that offers $100,000 FDIC insurance and works like an annuity. (Annuities sold by insurers and mutual-fund firms won't be affected.) If the planflies, income from CDs purchased after April 7, 1995, would be taxed in the year earned. Deposits made before that time would remain tax-deferred.    <p>  <p><p>

						June 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need to Know  <p> WHEN A FALLING DOLLAR PAYS OFF FOR INVESTORS  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> The plunging dollar certainly will make your next adventure overseas more expensive. But if you have money in a global income fund, you have less reason to pout. The weaker dollar has made your foreign holdings more valuable.  <p> As of mid-April, the dollar was down 19 percent against the yen and 13 percent against the deutsche mark since the beginning of the year. During that time, the J.P. Morgan Non­U.S. Government Bond Index rose16 percent. Better than two thirds of that ascent is attributable to the plunge in the greenback. "The dollar's fall has been a bonanza for global bond investors," says Ray Goodner, manager of <a name="FUND:IGBFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/IGBFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IDS Global Bond Fund</b></a> (800-328-8300; 5 percent load; $2,000 minimum).  <p> Is the bonanza likely to continue?  <p> Some analysts worry that the dollar could rebound from its recent lows, inflicting currency losses on overseas funds. This is certainly a worry in the short run, and investors concerned about preserving capital in the near term may want to consider switching to funds that hedge against currency risk, such as <a name="FUND:SCIBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SCIBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Scudder International Bond</b></a> (800-225-2470; no-load; $1,000 minimum).   <p> Over the long run, the dollar seems more likely to continue losing value against the yen and the mark. "The dollar's trend has been pretty much consistently downward since 1985," notes Susan Belden, senior editor of the San Francisco­based No-Load Fund Analyst.  <p> Long-term investors should thus steer clear of funds that consistently hedge their currency bets. "When you hedge, your returns will be more correlated with those of the U.S. markets," says John Scarborough of the San Francisco investment-management firm Bingham, Osborn & Scarborough. "That defeats the main purpose of investing overseas."  <p> Scarborough recommends investing roughly 20 percent of a long-term fixed-income portfolio in geographically diversified foreign income funds that do little currency hedging. One pick: <a name="FUND:RPIBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RPIBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price International Bond</b></a> (800-638-5660; no-load; $2,500 minimum). <p> Finally, some analysts think that foreign bond funds remain a good bet under any circumstances. Christopher Leary,  senior vice president at SunAmerica, believes that the risk of currency losses is offset by the chance of further gains in foreign bondmarkets themselves. "Income investors can do better overseas," he says. <p><p>  <p><p>

						May 1995
Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>TRENDSPOTTER<p>By Ellen Simon<p>First thing we do is have the lawyers kill the CEOs. Lawsuits filed against corporate directors and officers for mismanagement cost insurers more than $1.1 billion in 1994, according to the Wyatt Co., a Boston consulting and actuarial firm. Wyatt surveyed 1,231 companies and found that their insurers paid out an average of $967,000 to defend a mismanagement suit and an average of $4.62 million to settle out of court or pay civil penalties. <p>The building industry raised more roofs last year than in any year since 1988, but demographers see more interest in the ratio of single-family to multifamily homes. In 1988, 32 percent of new building was multifamily; by 1993, only 18 percent was multifamily. Gopal Ahluwalia, director of research at the National Association of Homebuilders, explains that multifamily building has slid since 1988 because it is typically dominated by rental units, and people under 30--those most likely to rent--made up the fastest-declining age group. With the children of baby boomers growing older and moving out, multifamily building should come back.<p>Brawny sport-utility vehicles, like Jeeps and <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> Explorers, now command 11 percent of the car and truck market, up from 9 percent in 1992. Now luxury-car makers such as Lexus and Cadillac have SUVs on their drawing boards, according to Tom Healey, a partner at J.D. Power and Associates, a marketing-information firm that specializes in the automobile industry. The automakers are hoping the mud sloggers will appeal to women who want more room than a sedan affords but "would rather cut off their arms than drive a minivan," says Healey.<p>We're fat and getting fatter. Almost seven in ten Americans are overweight, up from 63 percent in 1991 and 58 percent in 1983, according to the latest Prevention Index. Why the cellulite upswing? Well, we're exercising less: Only 30 percent of women and 45 percent of men work out strenuously three times a week.

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>THE BIG PICTURE<p>By Dean Robinson<p>OVERVIEW<p>The declining dollar improved the value of stocks held by U.S. investors in every European equities market except Italy. But some European manufacturers are worried about the long-term consequences of having to compete with U.S. firms that can now effectively charge lower prices. "The Europeans are selling off, saying, 'We can't compete,''' says Dan Jacobs, a portfolio manager with the Franklin Templeton Group. "They have to reduce prices and squeeze margins." Of course, not all exporters are so unlucky. Notes Jane Siebels-Kilnes, another portfolio manager with Franklin Templeton, "The low dollar is sort of a godsend for those countries tied to the dollar; it helps exports." South Korea was but one example of this.<p>
WINNERS<p>TURKEY The possibility of increased access to European markets helped excite this small and extremely volatile market. <p>PERU A cease-fire in the border war with Ecuador and an easing of election worries brightened the outlook for Peru, which has a stronger economy than many Latin American nations. Another strength, according to Robert Heisterberg, a global-policy analyst with Alliance Capital: High levels of direct foreign investment, which tends to stick around longer than international capital that arrives via the local stock exchange.<p>SOUTH AFRICA The addition of South Africa to several broad indexes such as <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> Capital International helped stimulate foreign interest in this country. In March, South Africa's dual currencies, the commercial rand and the financial rand, were unified. (They were originally created to keep capital from fleeing the country during apartheid.) The change led to "tremendous appreciation of the currency," says Tom Haslett, a portfolio manager for Montgomery Funds. <p>SOUTH KOREA "A great story," says Haslett. A dollar-linked currency has certainly helped here. "The economy is heavily geared toward exports, so the dollar's 10 percent drop against the yen gives South Korea's export base a tremendous opportunity to expand," Haslett adds. Also, South Korea's restrictions on foreign ownership insulate it from the sudden outflow of funds experienced by so many emerging markets after the Mexican devaluation.<p>CANADA "There was concern Canada might be headed Italy's way [see below]," says Heisterberg, but Canada "passed a budget with much more austerity built into it than the market had anticipated."<p>
LOSERS<p>ITALY The honeymoon for the new administration, which arrived in January, may be over. "The government is going to have to cut spending," says Kelly McDermott, a Dreyfus portfolio manager, "but all it's done so far is raise taxes, and that's not going to fly in the long term. So the market is being penalized now."<p>PAKISTAN The murder of U.S. consular officials doesn't inspire investor confidence. "The issues are almost entirely political--law and order in Karachi, for example," says Haslett. "There's a tremendous amount of political uncertainty. In my opinion, if martial law were declared, you would see a rally of 20 percent." <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <p>"People keep wondering how the stock market can go up if the dollar is falling. Well, my answer to them is, what's it been doing since 1985?"<p>--Bartley Blout of Strome, Susskind, a hedge fund in Santa Monica, California<p>
"Kick the IRS out of your wallet and out of your records. Get back to an America free from the IRS in terms of day-to-day micromanagement."<p>--House Speaker Newt Gingrich, suggesting to viewers of CNBC's Talk Live that the size of the IRS would be cut by the imposition of a flat income tax<p><p><p>

Worth Magazine/Need to Know<p>CAPITOL GAINS?<p>By James K. Glassman<p>The jaundiced eye wall street traditionally casts on Washington these days often looks like little more than indifference. Big investors, money managers, and traders no longer think that federal decisions on taxing and spending make much difference in a $7 trillion global economy.<p>Beyond that, Contract With America or not, they just don't think politicians will keep their campaign promises. Following November's stunning election, fund manager Martin Zweig's comments were typical: "Republican control (of Congress) is not going to cure the stock market's ills, which include extreme overvaluation, poor monetary conditions, an economy that is too strong, and the hangover from several years of intense speculation."<p>In the four months after the election', the S&P 500 rose about 4 percent--a slight reproach to the bearish Zweig, but the balanced-budget amendment had been defeated, tax cuts were in trouble, and House leaders put off announcing their deficit-reduction plan until May. <p>Still, if skepticism were a stock (possible symbol: SKP), I'd say it's been overbought. This is nothing new. After Ronald Reagan's election in 1980, it took the market two years to recognize that this fellow really wanted to cut taxes and keep a lid on government spending. Then interest rates fell and the S&P almost tripled between mid-1982 and the end of Reagan's second term.<p>That pattern could repeat itself. The current Republican majorities in the House and Senate are too thin to do the things (like replace the current tax code with a flat or consumption tax) that capital markets want. But those majorities could grow after next year's election. Two studies of the 1994 elections--one by Fred Steeper, a partner in Market Strategies, Inc., a Southfield, Michigan, market-research firm, and the other by three scholars from the Hoover Institution and Stanford University--independently concluded that the decisive factor in the congressional elections was voter ideology rather than some vague desire to throw the bums out.<p>Normally, in a swing election, voters of all sorts shift away from the party in power. That is why, as William Schneider of the American Enterprise Institute puts it, "Every landslide carries with it the seeds of its own defeat." But Steeper's recent paper, "This Swing Is Different," showed that in 1994 there was polarization based on policy. Conservatives voted more Republican than usual, liberals more Democratic. As the three Stanford/Hoover researchers--David W. Brady, John F. Cogan, and Douglas Rivers--wrote, "Our most important finding is that the large Democratic Party losses in the House were due to voters' rejecting President Clinton's legislative agenda." That strongly suggests Republicans will retain their gains through 1996.<p>Will they add to them? Quite possibly. In the Senate, where Republicans need another half-dozen seats to break filibusters consistently, it appears far more Democrats will be retiring. Incumbent Republicans also hold more safe seats. Charles Cook's insider publication, The Cook Political Report, currently ranks 11 Republican and only two Democratic senators as safe in 1996. <p>This year, if the market pays any attention to fiscal policy at all, it will probably concentrate on the defeats of key portions of the Republican agenda. But as the prospects for 1996 become clearer, investors may realize that SKP would make a great short.<p>As Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan said before the House Budget Committee in March, "The effects [of Congress decisively attempting to balance the budget] I think would be rather startling." In other words, rates would fall and the economy would boom.<p><p>

Worth Magazine/Need to Know<p>MARKET RADAR<p>Sigh. The cautious optimism that our technical indicators showed last month has vanished. Though the Dow Jones Industrial Average has conquered 4000, a lack of participation in the upswing by a wide group of stocks dampens hope for a prolonged run-up in the market. And ominously, our bellwether indicator reversed direction during the latest rally. To make matters worse, investment advisors continue to turn upbeat--and you know how we feel about their reliability. As usual, each of our indicators gets a rating (10 is most bullish) and an arrow (near-term message).<p>
Composite Bellwether (4 this month/5 last month) 
This index, computed by InvesTech, tracks utility and brokerage stocks, which usually predict market turns. Weakness in utilities pushed it down even as the Dow surged; some investors apparently see interest rate hikes ahead.<p>Put/Call Ratio (5/5) 
Based on the volume of equity put and call options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. This contrarian measure is positive if traders bet big against stocks. Optimists fought pessimists to a standstill to keep this indicator neutral for the month.<p>Advance/Decline Line (2/3) 
A moving average of the difference between the number of rising and falling stocks, this indicates if market moves are broadly or narrowly based. Computed by InvesTech, this measure shows participation drooping despite new market highs, a bad sign.<p>Advisory Sentiment (6/8) 
Investment advisors tend to be followers, not leaders: Historically, they're most optimistic at market tops. They've been getting psyched by a record-setting Dow lately; soon they'll be scaring us away from stocks. Compiled by Investors Intelligence.<p>Commodity Index (4/4) 
Supplied by Goldman, Sachs, this measure of raw-material prices remained steady again this month as metal prices continued to fall. The index is down more than 2 percent in 1995 so far, a reassuring sign for inflation hawks.<p>Consumer and Corporate Debt (5/5) 
This aggregate measure of private debt remained steady last month, halting a two-year trend toward more borrowing. A statistical blip or a positive development? It's a little early to say. Provided by Safian Investment Research.<p>Yield Ratio (3/3) 
The ratio between yields of 90-day Treasury bills and the S&P 500, computed by the Leuthold Group. For the first time in more than a year, the ratio didn't increase this month. But it didn't shrink either. Those healthy T-bill returns still look like a safer bet than stocks.<p>Monetary Environment (3/3)  
This model from InvesTech measures how much money is available to flow into the stock market. It remained unchanged from last month, meaning the cash still isn't there for a major, sustained advance in equities.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>IS IT TIME TO JOIN THE MOVE TO JUNK?<p>By Clint Willis<p>Professional investors have lost billions investing in emerging-markets bonds. Now they're shifting some of their assets into high-yield (or junk) bonds, the riskiest class of corporate bond. Should the rest of us follow? <p>"A lot of investors who got killed reaching for extra yield last year are moving into the high-yield market," says Ole Dial, the manager of the NWNL <a name="FUND:NHYBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NHYBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northstar High Yield fund</b></a> (800-595-7827; 4.75 percent load; $2,500 minimum initial investment). Even characteristically staid pension plans such as the City of New York police department's and employees' funds recently invested a total of $800 million in junk bonds, hoping to profit from the best performing of all bond categories over the last decade.<p>Foolish as that may sound to investors seeking safety after 1994's bond-market meltdown and this year's international-bond debacle, this actually may be a good time to put a modest portion of your fixed-income holdings into a well-managed high-yield bond fund. Rising demand and falling supply are likely to produce capital gains in the months  ahead.<p>Institutional investors looking for some extra yield are providing the demand. On the supply side, redemptions and tender offers took some $2 billion in junk bonds out of play during the first ten weeks of 1995.<p>That has already pumped up prices and lowered yields for bonds with credit ratings near the top of the junk heap. (Junk bonds are defined as those rated BB or lower.) But lower-quality issues remain inexpensive: Some B-rated issues are yielding more than 12 percent, almost five percentage points higher than 30-year Treasurys. "The lower-quality tier of junk bonds is still trading very cheaply," says Clark Stamper, manager of the Venture Income (+) Plus fund (800-279-0279; 4.75 percent load; $1,000 minimum). <p>Of course, such bonds could sink in price. In a recession, junk-bond prices fall as sales and profits decline at the financially challenged companies that issued them. But a serious economic downturn doesn't seem to be in the cards for 1995. And balance sheets at many junk issuers are in much better shape than they have been anytime in the last 15 years. <p>Still, for safety, Ralph Norton, managing editor of IBC Donoghue's Investing for Income, recommends diversified mutual funds. One excellent choice: <a name="FUND:NTHEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NTHEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Northeast Investors Trust</b></a> (800-225-6704; no load; $1,000 minimum). <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>INDUSTRY SECTORS<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>As we enter the 50th month of the economic recovery--the average length of an economic expansion--investors are anxious. They worry the business activity may come to a sudden halt. But they also worry business may not slow rapidly enough, prompting the Fed to raise interest rates again. The latter fear caused utility stocks to lose steam in March, even as the falling dollar sent investors in search of safe havens, lifting gold-mining stocks. <p>Other safe harbors included consumer-staple stocks like beverages, tobacco, and health care. Unlike basic materials--metals, chemicals, and forest products--these noncyclical industries do well in up or down markets. Meanwhile, the tobacco industry, vilified by many in the U.S., is expanding aggressively in Europe and Asia and hoping for improved earnings.<p>Sam Stovall, editor of S&P's Industry Reports, notes that, having "drunk 'em and smoked 'em, you have to pay for 'em afterward--with health care." The sector is still benefiting from the failure of health-care reform and from industry consolidation, including the GlaxoWellcome and Columbia/HCAHealthTrust mergers.<p>Computer software and services have outperformed the S&P by 26 percent over the past year. But their gain has been the retail sector's loss. "The consumer has been spending on computer software over apparel," says analyst Jennifer Black Groves of Black & Co. <p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>GOING AGAINST THE GRAIN<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Martin Whitman, manager of the <a name="FUND:TAVFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TAVFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Third Avenue Value Fund</b></a>, is not one of the crowd. He scoops up stocks that others dump and has gotten into hot water over what some consider his too-cozy relationships with some of the companies in which his fund invests. But his returns--a 14 percent average annual gain for the last three years, versus 6.33 percent for the S&P 500--are hard to argue with. <p>When investors fled Piper Jaffray, a brokerage facing big shareholder suits over derivatives losses, Whitman bought. When <a name="NYSE:DEC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10462"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Digital Equipment</b></a> was the pariah of high tech, Whitman kept buying. Now that derivatives are in the doghouse, he's interested.<p>A government-backed mortgage derivative he recently bought is pure Whitman. Worst case--interest rates head higher and stay there--he'd earn 5 percent annually. If rates fall by year end, he could earn 50 percent. <p>Whitman, 70, who started as a Wall Street analyst in 1950, has run Third Avenue--a no-load since it discontinued a 4.5 percent load in February--from its founding in 1990. The fund holds 88 securities, but half its $214 million in assets is in 20 stocks. To make Whitman's list, shares must trade at less than half their estimated buyout worth; assets must exceed liabilities, including offbalance sheet items like lawsuits; a company must be easy to follow from public filings; management must be attentive to shareholder interests. Take <a name="AMEX:FCE.A"></a><b>Forest City Enterprises</b>, for which Whitman paid some $20 a share: The value of its real estate land alone is worth $80 a share.<p>Whitman has been a target of controversy. His fund owns stock in <a name="AMEX:DHC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11180"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Danielson Holding Corp.</b></a>, a financial company in which Whitman owns a stake and which pays him $75,000 a year in director's fees. Also, a partnership he runs bid on a troubled insurance company owned by Third Avenue. <p>Whitman confirms the Securities and Exchange Commission examined his role in both investments last year; the SEC won't comment. But Whitman says he and his family have $4 million invested in the fund, so his interests are the same as shareholders'. "I wouldn't compromise my commitment to fund investors," he says. <p><p>

Worth Magazine/Outfront<p>YES, WE DO WINDOWS<p>Financial gurus have found a new realm to populate: computer software. Soon, whenever you boot up your CD-ROM drive, you may have a recognizable advisor along for the ride in the form of digital photos and sound clips. Andrew Tobias, for example, gazes out from the new version of Block Financial Software's Managing Your Money. Jane Bryant Quinn and Marshall Loeb, meanwhile, are full of gestures and advice in Intuit's latest edition of Quicken. "People want a reassuring voice," says Loeb. "If you're sitting alone working at a computer on your desk, it's nice to have a human face speaking to you." <p>And as long as the subject is money, the emphasis will be on familiar, trustworthy, human faces__not caricatures like Bob, <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>'s planned computer pal. "I'm not sure anyone wants to take personal financial advice from a cartoon rat," says Quinn. "Unless they're cheating on their taxes."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>RATTLING THE ORTHODOXY<p>By Dean Robinson<p>The minimum wage has been a maximum hot spot ever since President Clinton suggested raising the base pay rate in his state of the union address. David Card, a Princeton economist, has helped fan the fire__and felt the heat, too.<p>"This is very controversial within economics," says Card, the coauthor, along with Labor Department chief economist Alan B. Krueger, of Myth and Measurement: The New Economics of the Minimum Wage. This controversial study debunks the traditional notion that boosting the minimum wage also raises levels of unemployment. "Some colleagues feel it's not right to study the minimum wage. To do research on the subject is like saying, 'I'm going to see if there are bones in this saint's tomb.'"<p>Given the passionate criticism Card has heard, he's beginning to feel like something of a heretic. "One of my colleagues said to me, 'Your work is dangerous,'" he says. "They don't quite realize that makes them sound like they're the Catholic Church in the 1300s."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>PAINTED INTO A CORNER
Picasso's fingerprint may be the last hope for Mark Harris to prove the art experts wrong<p>By Dean Robinson<p>It is every art lover's dream: to stumble upon what appears to be an unknown masterpiece at a flea market and buy it for a pittance. Usually, of course, the work turns out to be a piece of junk, and that's that.<p>Mark Harris is one dreamer who won't give up. Despite many rejections, the 39-year-old Englishman and former art student refuses to accept that the pen-and-ink gouache he owns isn't an authentic Picasso. As far as Harris is concerned, the failure of any acknowledged expert to support the authenticity of the work says more about the clubbiness of the gatekeepers of Picasso's legacy than it does about the value of his work.<p>Harris believes the work first surfaced about 15 years ago at a house clearance, a sort of English estate sale, in London. About four years ago, a friend of Harris's purchased the work from a Brighton dealer for 25. Soon after, Harris purchased a share in the work (there are now four shareholders in all). He then set out to confirm his belief that he was now part owner of a genuine Picasso.<p>It hasn't gone well. Perhaps the biggest setback came last year, when Claude Picasso, the artist's son, declared that the work had not been created by his father. "You are off on a wild goose chase," Claude Picasso wrote Harris.<p>Harris believes that Claude Picasso's summary judgment has forever ended his chance of a fair hearing among art experts. So, in his latest tactic to authenticate the piece, Harris has offered a $1,000 reward to anyone who can prove that a fingerprint on his drawing came from Picasso himself. This could be his last hope. "The big guys in the Picasso establishment have stopped me all down the line," Harris says.<p>Is there a chance Harris will ever convince the art world to come around to his view? "It looks impossible," says Picasso scholar Robert Rosenblum, a professor at New York University. And a fingerprint match wouldn't necessarily prove anything, Rosenblum adds: "Even if the fingerprint is Picasso's, that doesn't mean it's by him."<p>The disputed painting may never hang in a museum or bring Harris fame or fortune, but it's become a kind of performance art, available for anyone to look at in a high-tech "virtual" gallery. To publicize his fingerprint reward, Harris is displaying the piece on the Internet's World Wide Web. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>LOOKING LIKE A MILLION<p>Talk about bargains: You can now purchase a million-dollar bill for just $12.50, thanks to the International Association of Millionaires. The Florida outfit mints authentic-looking million-spots as a cutesy corporate giveaway. "Most of our customers are banks and financial types who present them to their employees or clients as a thank-you gift, as in 'Thanks a million,' " says Tari Steward, the owner of the association. Steward shouldn't expect a thank-you from the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which has been fielding hopeful calls about the funny money. "We've got to tell people that it's not a real million-dollar bill," says a bureau spokeswoman. "But some of them insist that it's redeemable and say they're going to their banks." They'd probably be better off saving their millions for a down payment on the Brooklyn Bridge__there's no such thing as a genuine million-dollar bill.<p>

						April 1995   <p>Worth magazine/Outfront  <p> DEBT THAT'S USER-FRIENDLY <p>At New York's Womanshare, the members pay their bills in skills  <p> By Elizabeth Royte  <p> Jane wilson, 69 years old, slipped on an Oriental rug a yearago and sustained multiple fractures of her pelvis and wrist.Doctors set her recovery time at three months, but Wilson surprisedthem by taking only six weeks. To what does she attribute herHerculean rebound? Going into debt.   <p> "We encourage debt,'' says a friend, Diana McCourt, from herbook-lined apartment in the heart of New York City's politicallyliberal Upper West Side. "It oils the system.''  <p> The system is called Womanshare, and it operates on a novelsystem of credits and debits. Wilson and McCourt, sitting backagainst Guatemalan throw pillows in McCourt's home, are happyto explain how the group started. Four years ago, Wilson, a formercaterer, and McCourt, 57, who had just sold her woodworking business,were looking for "new ways to be in the world,'' as they putit. They began trading labor: help with a dinner party in exchangefor building a shelf. "We were very comfortable with that,''Wilson says. "Then we began meeting in the mornings, with ouroats and berries and yoga, and we began telling friends."  <p> Eventually, a plan for a "cooperative skill bank'' emerged.New members, they determined, would list five resources (suchas a computer or a car), five interests (concerts, walking),and five skills (counseling, designing). In action, it workslike this: Sally needs a wedding cake. She peruses her Womanshare"yellow pages,'' which are updated four times a year, and findsLucy, who bakes the confection and gets three hours credit inthe "bank." Lucy can then trade in her credit for, say, threehours of psychotherapy from Anna, or any of 180 available skills. <p> Womanshare currently has 80 members who cross racial and socioeconomiclines and range in age from 30 to 72. McCourt and Wilson believethey have room for another 20Ðwomen, that is. "Having just womenwas easier,'' says Wilson, because men tend to take over, tokeep exact count of trades. "Women barter out of need and morecooperatively,'' she adds. "It's not tit for tat."  <p> Womanshare has consciously not imitated the market economy andassigned credits to skills. And, perhaps surprisingly, no memberhas balked at the idea that walking a dog for an hour has equalvalue to an hour of private detective work. "That's a yuppiementality, that if you need it, you buy it,'' says Wilson. "Butin the '90s, we feel a need to come together and support eachother. We're looking for community again.''  <p> A central tenet of the group is that women respect each other'stime, whether they're caring for plants, writing a will, or walkingthe dog. Or having poetry read to them while their broken bonesmend, which is how Jane Wilson got better and fell into gratefuldebt.   <p>  <hr>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>COMPULSIVE IN AUSTIN
Broker Chris Anderson couldn't stop playing the market. Now he counsels other gamblers.<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Losing is a part of life on Wall Street. No stockbroker can expect to best the market all the time, and even the most skilled financial wizards can make costly mistakes with investments that sour. But what about the guy who just can't win? When trade after trade results in defeat and loss, perhaps it's a sign of more than a lack of investment prowess. Maybe that unlucky broker is actually a compulsive gambler.<p>That's what Chris Anderson thinks, anyway. Anderson, 42, blames a betting addiction for ending his career as a broker. "For a long time, I wrote off my bad investments as part of the education," he says of his three years working as a stockbroker in Austin, Texas. "But I kept trading any profits I made so impulsively. I kept looking for a big win."<p>Anderson had never been tempted by blackjack tables or roulette wheels. Instead, he put all his chips on the market. He says he squandered tens of thousands of dollars of his clients' money and roughly $250,000 of his own before he acknowledged his gambling problem. His epiphany came when he resorted to liquidating family assets to support his market-betting habit. "When I sold the property I owned with my wife, put the equity in my account, and lost it in the market in two days, I knew I was in big trouble," he says.<p>It was investments in the notoriously risky options market__what Anderson calls "the greatest gambling casino in the world"__that finally drowned him in debt and forced him to file for bankruptcy. He lost his home, and finally, his wife left him. Looking back, he's most disturbed by how easy it was to get by at work despite the constant losses. "As long as I was generating commissions," he says, "I was left alone."<p>Now Anderson wants to warn other brokers of the potential dangers of getting hooked on the market. With his investment career now permanently behind him, he spends his days as head of the nonprofit Illinois Council on Problem and Compulsive Gambling, counseling stockbrokers who are struggling with the issue. It's not easy to get people to take the idea seriously. Although other former brokers will acknowledge in private that they gambled compulsively on the market, few will speak out openly. "To mention the word gambling in the securities industry is anathema," Anderson says.<p>Fortunately, Anderson has found an ally. Last July, he teamed up with Dr. Marvin Steinberg, a psychologist who heads the Connecticut Council on Compulsive Gambling, to increase public awareness of the problem. Steinberg has been conducting research on the subject but has encountered the same resistance as Anderson. When Steinberg mailed out a survey to 1,000 Connecticut stockbrokers, only 70 even bothered to respond.<p>Anderson isn't surprised by such obstacles__after all, he once considered himself a "speculative investor," not a gambler. Because all investments are at some level a gamble, it can be difficult to gauge the border between a healthy acceptance of risk and a destructive compulsion. "I know firms where some of the biggest producers were compulsive gamblers," Anderson says. "They were labeled as heroes."<p>

Worth magazine/Outfront<p>CLIPPING THE AD MAN
No mere mutual fund manager, David Herro waged war with Saatchi & Saatchi and won<p>By Ted C. Fishman<p>David Herro, the mutual fund manager who ousted Saatchi & Saatchi's chairman and co-founder late last year, relied mainly on support from other shareholders to sack Maurice Saatchi. But Herro looks like he would have been capable of physically tackling the man had it come to that. At 34, Herro is curly-haired, broad-shouldered, and fit__the kind of guy who hasn't let his physique slide from his high school football days in Fond du Lac, Wisconsin.<p>These days, Herro calls the plays for the <a name="FUND:OAKIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OAKIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oakmark International Fund</b></a>, a billion-dollar fund that invests mainly in value stocks overseas__that is, foreign companies that appear cheap relative to their underlying assets. It's a big fund, but far from the biggest, and most people in Herro's position work in relative obscurity. However, thanks to his decision to tangle with Maurice Saatchi, Herro has earned a modicum of fame, especially among investment buffs.<p>He appears to be enjoying it. At a recent investment conference in Appleton, Wisconsin (about 35 miles from his hometown), questions soon turned to his Saatchi-slaying exploits, and Herro seemed happy to oblige the audience with the tale.<p>As Herro tells it, London-based Saatchi & Saatchi's global advertising conglomerate looked like a terrific value, so he began buying up shares and waiting for the stock to rise. When it didn't, Herro focused on Maurice Saatchi and his brother and co-founder Charles as the cause. The Saatchis, Herro believed, were interfering with the executives who averted a collapse at Saatchi & Saatchi in the late '80s__a near disaster brought on by massive debt accumulated in an acquisition binge. To Herro, those executives, and not Maurice Saatchi, were the key to the company's future.<p>"They refinanced the company and got rid of all the gar-bage," Herro says. "They concentrated on the better parts."<p>Herro didn't resort to a public battle immediately. First, he wrote Saatchi & Saatchi's board and told them to rein in Maurice or get rid of him. With Herro's Oakmark International holding 9 percent of Saatchi & Saatchi's shares, that request should have been taken seriously. But the board stalled, and Herro felt he had no other option than to orchestrate a shareholder revolt.<p>"Generally, I wouldn't go hounding a company's management, but this was a special case," he says.<p>So Herro began networking with other investors to rally support. In December, with 70 percent of Saatchi & Saatchi's shareholders behind him, Herro forced the directors' hands. Maurice Saatchi was out.<p>The exit wasn't graceful. Maurice Saatchi announced plans to start a new agency, sparking fears that longtime Saatchi & Saatchi clients__such as M&M/Mars and British Airways__would follow him. Instead of bolstering Saatchi's shares, Maurice's departure sent the company's American depositary receipts down nearly 40 percent, to around $4.50.<p>But Herro has no regrets, even despite being vilified in the British press (accounts ridiculed his Wisconsin roots by tagging him "the Herro from Zero"). And Saatchi's shares have already begun to recover. Eventually, Herro believes, they will prove a winner His confident prediction: "I think the stock still could go to $10."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>THIS BABY REALLY MOVES<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>Janus Capital may have found a new prodigy.<p>In the late 1980s the fund family had James Craig and Tom Marsico, two of the hottest managers in the business. In 1989, Marsico's first full year at the helm, the <a name="FUND:JAVLX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAVLX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Twenty</b></a> fund soared 50.9 percent. Craig's <a name="FUND:JAVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Venture</b></a> fund also turned in stellar numbers, beating the S&P 500 index by an average 5.3 percentage points a year between 1986 and 1991.<p>Warren Lammert, 33, manager of <a name="FUND:JAMRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAMRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Mercury</b></a> since its birth in May 1993, may be continuing the tradition. He produced a 19.8 percent total return in 1993, then followed that with a 15.9 percent gain in 1994, a year in which Lipper Analytical's capital-appreciation category showed a 3.4 percent loss.<p>Among fund managers, however, 20 months isn't a long-term track record. Lammert has stormed out of the gates again in 1995, but he now runs $1 billion, up from $127 million at the start of 1994, and this will be a testing year for Lammert.<p>His strategy at Janus Mercury is solidly within the tradition established in the 1970s by Janus founder Tom Bailey. Janus equity managers combine the Graham and Dodd school of value stock picking with growth-at-any-cost momentum investing. Janus looks at a stock only if its price-to-earnings multiple is lower than its projected earnings growth. Lammert also judges companies qualitatively, looking for consistency of earnings and assessing how well he and his analysts know an industry.<p>Mercury has the most flexible charter of any Janus offering, allowing Lammert to invest in companies of any size or nationality. Foreign-based multinationals, such as Finland's <a name="NYSE:NOK.A"></a><b>Nokia</b>, a manufacturer of cellular phones, make up one fifth of assets.<p>As befits the manager of a fund called Mercury, Lammert moves quickly when the market warrants. In late 1994, he held 46 percent of the fund's assets in cash. By mid-February, after falling interest rates changed Lammert's risk assessment, he had already plunged back into the market, reducing cash to 14 percent. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>THE BIG PICTURE<p>By Dean Robinson<p>OVERVIEW<p>Two months after Mexico's currency exploded, the fallout is still raining down on markets around the world. According to Gary Thayer, an economist at A.G. Edwards & Sons in St. Louis, "The countries that appear risky [to investors] have to raise their interest rates to defend their currencies. When a country such as Argentina wants to keep its currency stable, that hurts stocks." Investors, however, have started to make distinctions among emerging markets.<p>Although Latin American markets continue to suffer, Asian markets are rebounding from the bout of selling that immediately followed the Mexican blowup and made those markets invitingly cheap. The perception that the Federal Reserve is finished raising U.S. interest rates after February's hike also had a positive influence on the Asian markets, since many of the developing Asian countries link their currencies to the dollar. And finally there's the Chinese New Year factor: "Usually the Chinese New Year kicks off a rally__there's a huge Chinese community entrenched in every Asian market," says William Wilby, director of global equities for Oppenheimer Management.<p>WINNERS<p>MALAYSIA "A very good story," according to Joe Quinlan, senior international economist at Dean Witter Reynolds. "The currency is pretty strong, the economy's doing well. They got some backwash from Mexico, unfairly, but now they're getting a bounce." Thayer adds that the Malaysian government, which has long feared its economically dominant native-Chinese population as a potentially destabilizing force, has recently made overtures to China.<p>HONG KONG Despite concerns about Deng Xiaoping's health and a possible trade war between China and the United States, investors found Hong Kong too tempting a bargain to pass up after the market plunged following the Mexican fiasco. "The market had declined too fast relative to the information out there," says Wilby.<p>UNITED STATES A double-barrel appeal pushed indexes to record highs in mid-February. Woes in the emerging markets have put a new shine on domestic stocks, and U.S. interest rates remain high. "The prospect of higher interest rates brings capital home," says Quinlan.<p>
LOSERS<p>AUSTRALIA A slowing U.S. economy could dampen demand for Australian commodities. "The mining part of the market__roughly 50 percent of the market__is very weak," says Robin Garrow, investment director at Scottish Widows, a pension-management firm in Edinburgh, Scotland. <p>ARGENTINA This is perhaps the best example of the impact of the Mexican financial crisis on other emerging markets. "The most unfair hammering has taken place in Argentina, and to some extent Brazil," says Wilby. "Argentina probably has the best single financial and economic system in all the emerging markets, but it's given no credit for that."<p>POLAND Another market slammed by the Mexican tidal wave, but with some justification. "Poland hasn't worked out a long-term strategy," says Thayer. "It's moving toward economic freedoms, but more slowly than the Czech Republic." <p>- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - <p>"Quit complaining! It's a wonderful life if inflation is just 3.5 percent."<p>-James W. Coons, chief economist at Huntington National Bank in Columbus, Ohio, on speculation that inflation could go beyond 3 percent this year<p>
"It's going to be the greatest intergenerational struggle of our times. [It will pit younger workers against] the Greedy Geezers of America Amalgamated."<p>-Senator Alan Simpson on the future of Social Security, to the Institute for Research on the Economics of Taxation and the Tax Council, Washington, D.C.<p><p>

Either way, investors cannot make sense of today's economy without an understanding of this concept.<p>Physical inertia proposes simply that bodies at rest tend to stay at rest while bodies in motion tend to stay in motion, tracking a straight line unless some new force intervenes.<p>If the economy were a physical object__say a 1988 Saab__speeding along too fast and heading toward inflation, it likely would continue in this direction__unless the Federal Reserve Board intervened to slow the car down. To do this, the Federal Reserve indeed applies a force: It raises or lowers interest rates. <p>Sadly, though, the economy doesn't respond like a car. First, there's a delay, a lag, between pushing or braking and the economy's response. Second, this lag is longer for some parts of the economy than others. So a change in rates doesn't have an immediate__or even__impact.<p>During the 12 months beginning in February 1994, for example, the Fed raised interest rates seven times, but the economy is only now beginning to show signs of slowing down. On February 16, the Department of Commerce announced that January housing starts slumped 9.8 percent, the second straight monthly decline since the revised numbers for December. An 8.6 percent drop in building permits issued also suggested a building slowdown.<p>Housing starts are among the most widely followed economic indicators because the loans home buyers usually require are highly sensitive to interest rates.<p>But what portion of the braking force applied by the Fed is reflected in January's housing slowdown? Home buyers, presumably, didn't put off signing a contract after the first quarter-point rise in rates a year ago. Nor did builders cancel their lumber orders. Perhaps the housing market didn't believe that the Federal Reserve was serious about inflation until after four or five rate hikes.<p>Meanwhile, the government also recently reported that the country's factories ran at 85.5 percent of capacity in January, the highest level since 1979. No slowing there.<p>So just how much of an effect have the Fed's rate hikes had? Knowing the answer would tell us a lot about the future of the economy. If the housing declines were a response to early rate hikes, then the economy may slow considerably or even slide into recession. If the numbers reflect a reaction to most of the hikes, then the Federal Reserve may reach its goal of steady, sustainable growth. Alternatively, the economy could continue to expand at an inflationary rate. No one can know for sure.<p>At the moment, the humble investor concentrates on what he can know__the quality of a company's management, its prospects for growth, and the strength of its balance sheet. He or she remembers that no economic scenario is a good one for a bad company.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>MUNI BONDS AREN'T ANY BARGAIN NOW<p>By Clint Willis<p>Last year, municipal-bond investors took a terrific beating as interest rates rose and rose, lifting yields and squashing prices. This year, muni advocates insist, the bonds are due for a comeback.<p>"There will be unheard-of scarcity in the municipal-bond market this year," says Robert Dennis, head of the municipal fixed-income department at Massachusetts Financial Services. "For the first time ever, there could be a significant decline in the number of issues." <p>The decline is a result of cutbacks in state and local government spending, as well as bond refundings, redemptions, and scheduled maturities totaling $150 billion in 1995. In theory, that should give a boost to the prices of tax-free bonds as investors in the top tax bracket fight over the diminished supply.<p>Of course, investors heard the same arguments early last year. That didn't prevent the average muni-bond fund from suffering a 6 percent loss in 1994, according to Morningstar.<p>This time it will be different, the optimists argue. Last year's municipal-bond market was a victim of higher interest rates, which battered every sector of the bond market. As the economy slows down, the Fed isn't likely to push rates much higher__and the muni market will rally in response to tight supply and heavy demand. <p>Trouble is, the rally already occurred. "There was a brief buying opportunity in late '94, but right now the municipal-bond market stinks," says Joe Mysak, editor of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. Experts commonly judge the attractiveness of munis by comparing their yields to Treasury bond yields. "Yields on municipal bonds in mid-February were only 81 percent of Treasury bond yields, versus 88 percent last November," says Mysak.<p>And the Orange County debacle suggests that investors must tread carefully to avoid credit problems. "Few investors are qualified to build a diversified portfolio of munis on their own," says Ralph Norton, managing editor of IBC Donoghue's Investing for Income. <p>People who do invest in the municipal market should choose a mutual fund with 80 percent or more of its portfolio in issues rated investment grade or higher. Norton recommends <a name="FUND:VWITX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWITX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Municipal Intermediate-Term</b></a> (800-662-7447; no load) and <a name="FUND:SCMTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SCMTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Scudder Medium-Term Tax Free</b></a> (800-225-2470; no load). "It used to be easy to invest in munis," he says. "These days, you need a pro."<p><p>

Worth Magazine/Need to Know<p>MARKET RADAR<p>We officially leave the ranks of the pessimists this month. But that doesn't mean we think the market is about to blast skyward. True, our indicators have improved a lot since hitting a bottom late last fall. But we'd like to see more stocks participate in rallies, as measured by our Advance/Decline Line. And the pesky Yield Ratio continues to make Treasury bills look better than equities. As usual, each of our indicators gets a rating (10 is most bullish) and an arrow (near-term message).<p>
Composite Bellwether (5 this month/4 last month) 
This index, computed by InvesTech, tracks utility and brokerage stocks, which usually predict market turns. The index is gaining steam__but it's moving in lockstep with the market, which blunts its predictive power.<p>Put/Call Ratio (5/5) 
Based on the volume of equity put and call options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. This contrarian indicator is positive if traders bet big against stocks. It's been in limbo lately, possibly awaiting a signal on the direction of the economy.<p>Advance/Decline Line (3/2) 
A moving average of the difference between the number of rising and falling stocks, this shows if market moves are broadly or narrowly based. Computed by InvesTech, this measure continues to improve but remains at a discouraging level.<p>Advisory Sentiment (8/9) 
Investment advisors tend to be followers, not leaders. Historically, they're most pessimistic at market bottoms__and they hit the depths in December. Now they're warming up to stocks, but not enough to scare us. Compiled by Investors Intelligence.<p>Commodity Index (4/4) 
Supplied by Goldman, Sachs, this measure of raw-material prices remained steady this month, thanks to a decline in the cost of metals such as lead and tin. Commodity prices are off almost 3 percent so far this year, a reassuring sign for inflation worrywarts.<p>Consumer and Corporate Debt (5/6) 
This aggregate measure of private debt keeps inching upward, a bad sign. Fueled by higher use of credit cards, the index recently reached a four-year high. But it isn't dangerous quite yet. Provided by Safian Investment Research.<p>Yield Ratio (3/3) 
The ratio between yields of 90-day Treasury bills and the S&P 500, computed by the Leuthold Group. This spread keeps widening, albeit slightly. As long as this is so, those healthy T-bill returns will siphon prudent investors away from the stock market.<p>Monetary Environment (3/2) 
This model from InvesTech measures how much money is available to flow into the stock market. It made a positive move in the last month but remains vulnerable to any further interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>INDUSTRY SECTORS<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>The latest industry-sector rankings from Standard & Poor's show automakers down (again) and toy makers up__prompting the question: How come Wall Street is favoring playthings for kids over playthings for adults?<p>The answer has to do with the business cycle. Now that most analysts are expecting higher interest rates to slow economic growth, the Street has lower expectations for heavy industry, especially big cyclicals like autos, steel, and aluminum. "It's the fear of going into a recession that creates the pullback from these sectors," says Robert Schenosky, steel analyst at Smith Barney. On the other hand, if these worries prove exaggerated, the stocks in these sectors may soon stabilize.<p>That apparently has already happened in the home-building and building-materials sectors, among the first to get clobbered when interest rates began rising last year. Sam Stovall, editor of Standard & Poor's Industry Report, thinks these sectors both offer good buys. <p>Industries less sensitive to interest rate changes are also doing well. They include, beside toy makers, restaurant chains and entertainment companies. Among the last group, <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Walt Disney Co.</b></a> (NYSE: DIS) was a standout as The Lion King became the second-highest grossing film of all time after Jurassic Park.<p>Health care stocks also did well as it became clear that government reform efforts were unlikely and merger activity might increase. <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> TREND SPOTTER  <p> By Ellen Simon  <p> * Want a raise? Go to the Northwest. Idaho, South Dakota, Utah, Oregon, and North Dakota led the country in income growth between1990 and 1993. Idaho led the pack, with 10 percent growth. A record wheat crop in '92 boosted wages in the Plains States, which reached an annual $30,856 in Idaho. High-tech jobs are growing out West,  though not in California, where personal income dropped almost 15 percent. Meanwhile, income slumped throughout the Northeast.  <p> * The down payment and closing costs for a first home now represent 58.5 percent of the annual income of first-time buyers, according to Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies. That's a gloomy number for renters looking to buy. Renters have a median net wealth of $2,203, compared with the average $14,036 for 20 percent down plus closing costs. With 10 percent down, costs average $7,426.  <p> * One third of adults in the U.S. have saved nothing for their retirement, and about 19 percent "are almost deliberate in their refusal to deal with retirement," according to a Public Agenda report. Where to turn? Forty-nine percent of those surveyed by Lutheran Brotherhood Reports say they've prayed for financial guidance.  <p> * The number of civil-rights cases brought annually to federal court has more than quintupled, from 5,138 in 1971 to 27,655 in 1993. Much of the increase results from the Civil Rights Act of 1991, which made jury trials available in civil-rights cases. Personal-injury lawyers have stopped chasing ambulances and started advertising for discrimination suits from those laid off at work. <p> * Carpoolers are becoming an endangered species. From 1980 to1990, their percentage among commuters dropped from 20 percent to 13 percent.   <p><p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> NOW WHAT?  <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> Investors took such a pounding from rising interest rates in 1994 that they may be excused a little euphoria now that interest rates look like they may top out soon.  <p> But an end to the Federal Reserve's rate hikes wouldn't guarantee a bull market. In fact, in 1995 investors could go from interest rate anxiety to recession depression.  <p> Stock bulls say investors ignored terrific earnings last year in their obsession with rates. While profits for the Standard & Poor's 500 rose an estimated 38 percent in 1994, the S&P managed a total return of only 1.32 percent. Faced with climbing interest rates, investors devalued the favorable news about earnings. The price-to-earnings ratio on the S&P 500, about 23 at the beginning of 1994, fell to 17 at the end.  <p> In 1995, however, the bullish case argues, the Fed will raise rates just once or twice, not six times as it did last year. Investors will be willing to focus on earnings--and pay more for companies with healthy bottom lines.  <p> What could go wrong with this scenario? Inflation could be tougher to subdue than expected, which could force the Fed to keep tightening. For example, one leading indicator of inflation, the CRB Spot Raw Material Price Index, was up a worrisome 38 percent in the 15 months ended mid-January.  <p> Or the Fed could wind up stopping the economy dead in its tracks,which could hurt corporate earnings. After all, only twice in nine tries over the past 40 years has the Fed managed to raise interest rates just enough to slow the economy without creating a recession, according to James Stack, president of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Montana.  <p> Even absent a recession, the bulls could be thwarted. Earnings growth for 1995 will probably peak in the first quarter, so by the time the Fed has signaled an end to its interest-rate boosts, quarter-to-quarter earnings growth will begin to slow.   <p> In 1995, as in 1994, alert investors will be watching inflation and economic growth.  <p>  <p>

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> MARCH TIP SHEET  <p> * In a universe of 7,000 mutual funds, a "fund of funds'' where a manager picks a portfolio of the best mutual funds sounds appealing. But most require large minimums or charge high fees. Markman MultiFund Trust offers conservative, moderate, and aggressive funds, all investing in no-load funds so there's just one management fee--capped by Markman at 0.95 percent annually. The trust has been open only since January, but over the last five years, the investment advisor to the funds, Markman Capital, with $300 million under management, has outperformed Lipper Analytical's indexes in its three risk categories using no-load funds. The minimum initial direct investment is $25,000 (800-2DAISY2), or $3,000 through <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> Mutual Fund Marketplace.  <p> * Mutual funds that invest in emerging-market bonds crashed following Mexico's December peso devaluation, but bonds of some emerging nations, particularly Brazil and Argentina, may now be bargains. Mark Headley, director of international investment at Litman/Gregory, recommends <a name="FUND:FNMIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FNMIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity New Markets Income</b></a> (no-load,10.9 percent yield, $2,500 minimum initial purchase; 800-544-8888)and <a name="FUND:SCEMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SCEMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Scudder Emerging Markets Income</b></a> (no-load, 12.5 percent yield,$1,000 minimum; 800-225-2470), which hold less than 10 percent Mexican debt and are weighted toward Brazil and Argentina. Remember, says Headley, "The short term could still be rough."   <p> * Recently, mutual fund companies Fidelity Investments and Neuberger & Berman began offering personal trust management, long the preserve of banks. Fidelity and Neuberger require minimum accounts of $400,000, below the usual threshold: Laird Norton Trust Co., for example, requires a minimum of $1 million. Fidelity Personal Trust Services' (800-448-0538) minimum annual fee is $3,000; Neuberger's (800-223-6448) is $7,500.  <p> * Investors burned by rising interest rates have been buying variable-rate CDs. In the fourth quarter of 1994, LaSalle National Bank sold $250 million of ten-year "multi-step" CDs whose yields rise at a set annual rate. Currently, the ten-year CD starts at 7.70 percent and rises to 11.25 percent. If interest rates drop after one or two years, the bank has the right to call the issue, in which case you get back your principal and accrued interest. Multi-step CDs,  also in five and 12-year maturities, are sold through brokers and require an initial investment of $5,000.  <p> * South Africa, once a pariah market, will be added this spring to Morgan Stanley Capital International's and International Finance Corp.'s emerging-market indexes, adding to the impressive sums already flowing into the country. Vahid Fathi, senior vice president for minerals and mining research for Kemper Securities, says the potential is "enormous for investors." Fathi says home-building, heavy-equipment, and food-distribution companies will all take advantage of President Mandela's infrastructure-building program. Investors can participate through vehicles such as the Morgan Stanley South Africa Fund.

						March 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> CONSISTENCY PAYS   <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> Donald Yacktman and the <a name="FUND:YACKX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/YACKX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yacktman Fund</b></a> are back in style. After a dismal 1993, the 53-year-old fund manager staged a comeback in 1994, gaining 8.8 percent while the average growth fund lost 2.1 percent. And with a slowing economy on the horizon, the big, undervalued growth stocks in Yacktman's portfolio could well outperform the market again in 1995. "The market is moving in his direction," says Robert Markman, a Minneapolis investment advisor who recently put his clients in Yacktman's fund.  <p> For Yacktman, the comeback is particularly sweet. From 1983 to 1991, as the manager of Selected American Shares, he delivered annualized gains of 18.2 percent, above the 17.2 percent realized by the S&P 500 stock index. But in1992, Yacktman shocked investors and the industry by quitting the fund after a bitter dispute with Kemper Financial Services, the owner of Selected Asset Management. <p> The Yacktman Fund, started in July 1992, got off to a terrible start, dropping 2.17 percent in its first 18 months while the S&P 500 shot up 18.19 percent. "Everything I touched turned to lead," Yacktman says.  <p> Yacktman stubbornly waited for the market to come to him. He kept buying large companies that had earnings of at least $100 million and above-average earnings growth and that also offered good relative value. This approach gave him a portfolio of companies whose collective earnings growth is nearly twice the S&P 500's and whose price-to-earnings ratio is 20 percent below the index. <p> In 1994, as investors started to worry about slowing economic growth, the market shifted away from cyclicals toward Yacktman's kind of stocks: companies that can keep growing earnings even if the economy slows. The fund's largest holdings include <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:SLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11410"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Student Loan Marketing Services</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BMY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10232"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bristol-Myers Squibb</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:FTL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11960"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fruit of the Loom</b></a>.  <p> "If you buy good, high-return businesses at low prices and have patience, then it will work out," Yacktman says. "The concept is relatively easy, but the execution is not."   <p>  <p>Name: Yacktman Fund <p>Manager: Donald Yacktman <p>Phone: 800-525-8258 <p>Minimum initial investment: $2,500 <p>Load: None <p>1995 return as of 1/19:1.5% <p>1994 return: 8.8%  <p><p>

On the average, the sector's revenues grew by 7 percent in 1994.<p>Yet investors remained obsessed with falling circulation and rising newsprint rates. Newspaper stocks underperformed the S&P by nearly 9 percent in 1994.<p>But most analysts say higher newsprint prices are always eventually offset by higher ad rates.

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>TRENDSPOTTER<p>By Ellen Simon<p>* The people of cyberspace love Star Trek. For eight weeks Prodigy offered online images from the latest Trek flick, Generations; subscribers downloaded them more than 100,000 times. Compare that with about 10,000 downloads of pictures from the much-hyped hoop-skirts-and-heartbreak TV movie Scarlett. <p>* Cheap stuff and lots of it--that's the retail formula that's working now, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce. Sales at warehouse clubs, the fastest-growing places to shop, were up 221 percent between 1987 and 1992. Discount department-store sales grew 62 percent. The biggest regional surge occurred in eight northwestern and mountain states. The District of Columbia was last nationwide.<p>* As go (or went) Richard Nixon, Jacqueline Onassis, and Oregon, so goes a well-prepared chunk of the nation. Nixon and Jackie had prepared living wills: instructions about what care they wanted and didn't want at the end of their lives. Usually about 100 people call New Yorkbased Choice in Dying each day for information on living wills. In the weeks after Nixon's death, 2,000 called each day; after Jackie's, 3,000. After Oregon voters passed a "death with dignity" act, which permits the terminally ill to obtain prescriptions for lethal drugs, 12,000 people called daily.<p>* It's like love--the harder they try, the less we want them. Credit card companies stuffed mailboxes with a record 1.2 billion solicitations in the first half of 1994, and the recipients threw out a record 98.4 percent of them.<p>* Death-penalty states pay a lot to kill a few. A Duke University study found that one in every ten North Carolina capital cases ends in execution. Adding up the extra trial costs for all capital cases, that means each execution costs taxpayers $2 million. <p>* Now who would pay 35 cents extra per directory-assistance call just to have the phone company dial the number? In the <a name="NYSE:NYN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11044"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Nynex</b></a> service area, about 3.5 million callers a month, or 9 percent of all information customers. And the service isn't yet available everywhere in NYNEX's calling area. <p><p>

						February 1995
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>TIME TO CATCH A STAR THAT STUMBLED?<p>By Andrew Gluck<p>"We're having a lousy year," acknowledged Earl McEvoy, lead manager of the $6 billion <a name="FUND:VWINX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWINX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard/Wellesley Income Fund</b></a>, in late December. At the time, the fund was down 4.3 percent since the beginning of the year. "This is the worst kind of environment for us," McEvoy said. Fund comanager John Ryan was equally blunt: "With rising interest rates and rising inflation, the fund is relatively disadvantaged." <p>Mutual fund managers normally aren't so quick to admit to subpar performance. But McEvoy and Ryan know they have nothing to be ashamed of. Over the last ten years, their fund, which invests in a mix of bonds and equities, has averaged an annual return of 12.3 percent. It has done so with far less volatility than the average bond or stock. Also, 1994 was just the second time in 20 years that the fund posted a loss. The decline occurred mostly because the fund was heavily invested in bonds with long maturities. As interest rates rose, the underlying value of these bonds declined, creating principal losses.<p>Nevertheless, the two managers believe 1995 could be a rebound year for their fund. "When newspapers are filled with stories about the threat of inflation and when there seems to be no end to economic expansion, that's when this fund will be a good choice," said Ryan.<p>Once long-term interest rates flatten or even decline, these same long bonds will appreciate while continuing to provide high yields. Pressed for a forecast, McEvoy said the 30-year Treasury is likely to close 1995 at 7.85 percent. That would help put Wellesley Income back on track with a total return of 8 or 9 percent. <p>If the economy contracts and corporate profits slow, as Ryan and McEvoy expect, the stock market will slump. But the stocks that this fund buys for the 30 to 40 percent of the portfolio it keeps in equities tend to drop less than the broad averages because of their high dividends. A value investor, Ryan, who runs the stock part of the portfolio, looks to buy dividend growth on the cheap by snapping up out-of-favor blue chips. Right now, the average yield on the fund's stocks is 5.5 percent, and he expects dividends to grow 7 percent annually. <p>Said Ryan, "We're laying the foundation for that future period where our style comes into play."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>LISTENING TO SWEET SEOUL MUSIC<p>By Gary Hector<p>Sequels are rarely as good as the originals, but South Korea could be the exception. South Korea was the bright spot for investors in Asia last year. In dollar terms, stocks rose some 20 percent in 1994 as corporate profits soared more than 40 percent. With reduced political tension taking the worry out of the market, continued growth is likely to push the market even higher in 1995. And the government's tight control on capital flows could keep the market from being battered if the U.S. Fed hikes rates in 1995.<p>Exports drive South Korea's growth. With a boost from the transcendently expensive yen, South Korea's muscular chaebols, the country's industrial conglomerates, are picking up business from high-priced Japanese competitors throughout Asia, especially in China. South Korea's export sector, in turn, drives construction and equipment spending at home, as exporters modernize to offset rising labor costs. All told, GDP is likely to grow 7.5 to 8 percent this year, and corporate profits should climb 17 percent. <p>Despite the recent downing of a U.S. helicopter across the North Korean border, political risks have declined over the last six months. North Korea, eager for American aid to shore up its ancient, inefficient economy, has agreed to scale back nuclear plans--a major source of international tension.<p>Investors have several options. The best bet is the 11-year-old <a name="NYSE:KF"></a><b>Korea Fund</b> (NYSE: KF), a closed-end mutual fund heavily invested in South Korean blue chips. While the fund once sold for a stiff 150 percent premium to its net asset value, it recently traded at $23.38, slightly above its net asset value of $21.09. The fund approached the end of '94 down some 1.5 percent. Two other closed-end funds, the <a name="NYSE:KIF"></a><b>Korean Investment Fund</b> (NYSE: KIF) and <a name="NYSE:KEF"></a><b>Korea Equity Fund</b> (NYSE: KEF), date back only to 1992 and 1993, respectively. (The <a name="FUND:MAPTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MAPTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Matthews Korean Fund</b></a>, the first open-end South Korea fund, has an even shorter track record--it opened in January 1995. It is managed by Paul Matthews, former president of G.T. Capital Holdings.)<p>Players can also invest directly in major companies. The <a name="NYSE:KEP"></a><b>Korean Electric Power Corp.</b> (NYSE: KEP), the nation's biggest power producer, should benefit from the booming domestic economy. Pohang Iron & Steel (NYSE: PKX), a large, efficient steel producer, should get a boost from both domestic and export growth.<p>

						February 1995
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>FEBRUARY TIP SHEET<p>* TAKE A LOAD OFF: Putnam Investments has launched what may be a trend-setting fee plan for 15 of its funds--Class M shares, which carry lower front-end loads (up to 40 percent lower than regular shares) and tie brokers' fees to performance. Putnam will extend the new pricing option to all its funds in 1995, says senior vice president Chris Meyer, who brags of putting brokers "on the investor's side of the table." Don't cheer yet: Putnam will raise trailing fees to offset these cuts. The annual bite on Class M shares is 0.65 percent of assets for equity funds and 0.4 percent for bond funds. That's up from 0.25 percent on regular shares. "They're shuffling fees so investors think they're getting a deal," says Don Phillips, publisher of Morningstar. In fact, Class M shares favor short-term investors; in the first year, a stock-fund buyer saves nearly two points. If you have a horizon of more than five years, however, the regular front-end load will be a better deal.<p>* FOR GREENSPAN WATCHERS: One bond-fund category was spared from last year's slaughter--loan-participation funds, also know as prime-rate funds. Since they invest in high-quality bank loans whose rates track the Fed's moves, such funds weren't hammered by rising interest rates. They returned an average 5.92 percent through November, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Getting into a prime-rate fund--smart if you're skittish about interest rates--takes timing. Most offer shares only via quarterly tender offers. Most also levy a fee on investors who cash out after less than a year. The names: Eaton Vance Prime Rate Reserve, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> Senior Floating Rate Fund, Van Kampen Merritt Prime Rate Income Trust, Prime Income Trust, and Pilgrim Prime Rate Trust.<p>* HAZARD PAY: Global investors who can tolerate risk should look at Venezuela. Once-solid Caracas has been a basket case since two attempted coups in 1992. Hopes for a recovery were dashed in 1994 when President Rafael Caldera instituted state controls on banks and foreign exchange. Investors have fled, waiting for Caldera to see the light. But investors who want to play the turnaround shouldn't wait for this to happen--Venezuela is almost certain to roar back so fast that no one will be able to jump on board once the train is moving. "It's like Peru in 1992, when nobody would invest a dollar," says Jose Gonzales of Credit Lyonnais. "Whoever got in then made major profits a few months later." Want to gamble? Venezuela's Brady bonds sell at 50 cents on the dollar, but potential investors will need the help of a private banker. A few closed-end mutual funds have decent exposure to the country; check out Alliance World Dollar Government I and II, Latin America Dollar Income, <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> Emerging Markets Debt, Morgan Stanley Global Opportunity Bond, and Worldwide Dollarvest. And six Venezuelan stocks are available to U.S. investors as ADRs.<p>* CLEAN AIR COSTS: Now's the time to buy lawn mowers, outboard engines, and other motor-driven gizmos. Because of new environmental rules, upcoming models will have lower emissions but higher prices--perhaps 30 percent higher, say some boat-engine makers. The Environmental Protection Agency says the hike should be 15 percent, but that's still $750 on a $5,000 outboard.<p>* DON'T GET TAKEN FOR A RIDE: Beware the economics of auto leasing, warns consumer crusader Ralph Nader. Although many people grasp the basic buy-or-lease calculation, he says, few protest leasing fees that can add over $1,000 to the price of a car. The problem: Dealers don't do the leasing--they sell cars to a finance company that leases them to customers. But, Nader says, dealers often charge leasing companies a cushy 15 percent over the sticker price, a rip-off that's passed along to lessees. Along with the Consumer Task Force for Automotive Issues, he's developed a "reality checklist" for consumers to assess the deals they're offered. Write Checklist, P.O. Box 7648, Atlanta, GA 30357, for a free copy.<p><p><p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> CHEAP IS RELATIVE   <p> By Jim Jubak  <p> Without doubt the stock market was cheaper at the end of 1994 than it was when the year began. Only the Dow, the narrowest of the major stock indexes, eked out a gain, 1.6 percent. But the question is, could equities get cheaper still?   <p> The most popular measure of whether stocks are cheap or dear is price-to-earnings ratios. These have been falling all year, thanks to strong corporate profits produced by a hot economy. Earnings on the S & P 500 surged from $20.42 at the end of 1993 to $27.33 by December 16, an increase of 34 percent. As earnings rise and stocks stand still, p/e's decline.  <p> Such was the case for both large- and small-capitalization stocks, according to numbers run by Frank Russell Co. From year-end '93 through November '94, price-to-earnings ratios of large stocks fell from 19.6 to 15.8; for small stocks, ratios dropped from 24.2 to 19.4.  <p> Lower ratios signal a cheaper market, but they don't necessarily mean the market is cheap. So says Rolf Agather, product manager for the Russell indexes. Investors instead must juxtapose current p/e ratios with historic valuations. Such a comparison shows that while the market as a whole is fairly inexpensive, growth stocks, the current darlings of the Street, are not.  <p> Russell compared valuations at the end of November--the month prior to the market's year-end rally, when prices were lowest--with average valuations of the past eight years. In November both large- and small-cap stocks overall traded below their average past valuations. For large-cap stocks, this hadn't occurred since1991.  <p> But large- and small-cap growth stocks are another story. The market normally charges a premium for growth, but the premium in November exceeded the historic average, Russell calculated. It was richest for small-cap growth stocks: The p/e ratio premium on small growth stocks reached 27 percent last year, far above the average 16 percent premium of the past.   <p> Message: Joining in the current mania for growth is more expensive--and riskier--than it looks.  <p>  <p>

						February 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Need To Know  <p> BEST INVESTMENT FOR '95  <p> By Gretchen Morgenson  <p> The year just ended was the worst on record for investors in long-maturity bonds--the worst, that is, since 1948. That's as ancient as data compiled by Richard Suttmeier gets. He's the yield curve strategist at Smith Barney in New York. If you bought 30-year Treasurys at the beginning of the year, you lost 13 percent by year end. That decline is double the next two worst performances over the past 46 years, which took place in 1973 and 1987. During both times, long bonds fell roughly 7.3 percent.   <p> Note that those declines immediately preceded horrific markets in stocks. Will 1994's bear market in bonds prove to be yet another precursor to stock market blues? Nobody knows. You can certainly make a very good case for moving money out of stocks and into Treasurys with one- to three-year maturities paying better than 7.5 percent.   <p> That's exactly what many small investors did at the end of the year. During the late-December auction of $17.25 billion in two-year notes, the noncompetitive bid for those notes--an indicator of small-investor participation--amounted to $2.4 billion. That demand--almost 14 percent of the auction--was the largest since January 1984. Says Suttmeier: "The small investor sees value in the short-term maturities with yields of 7 to 7.75 percent." <p> Investors know a good thing when they see one. The question is, are Treasurys the right place to be in '95? Absolutely, says Suttmeier, who believes real rates of return of 3 to 3.5 percent are mighty compelling. He thinks yields will drop significantly this year, and projects the long bond to trade between 6.5 and 7 percent by the end of 1995. Suttmeier goes out on this limb: "The top-performing asset in 1995 will be Treasurys. They will outperform if rates decline and will perform less badly than any other asset if rates go up." The risk, meanwhile, is minimal. <p>  <p>

						November 1994
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>TREND SPOTTER<p>By Carla Koehl<p>-> If industry forecasts can be trusted, revenues for all computer magazines will soar from $1.8 billion last year to $5 billion in 2000 and $8.1 billion by 2005. "There is a lot of money in demystifying computers," says Arthur Gruen of New York-based Wilkofsky Gruen Associates, the authors of the study.<p>-> National sales of hair-color products have risen by a steady 8 percent since 1984. From 1992 to 1993, though, sales jumped 10 percent, and in 1994 they're up 12 percent. In ten years, coloring products are expected to account for half of all salon sales. Why? "Baby boomers are finally going gray," says Mary Atherton of Modern Salon magazine. "We've waited years for this."<p>-> Two years ago the National Committee for Quality Assurance of Washington, D.C., unleashed its clipboard-wielding inspectors on America's 541 HMOs. Just 30 percent of the 133 HMOs inspected so far have met NCQA's 50 standards in areas ranging from consistency in record-keeping to encouraging preventive testing to sniffing out old malpractice suits involving prospective physicians. <p>-> Bitter over missing the chance to buy Manhattan for $24? The Mineral Policy Center of Washington, D.C., says the U.S. government is now selling $34 billion worth of mining rights on public lands to mining firms -- for the bargain price of $800,000.<p>-> Barbara Levy, an editor at Footwear News, proclaims, "Women's shoes are ten times more comfortable now than they were a decade ago." A recent study for the American Podiatric Medical Association, however, finds exactly the same percentage of women complain of painful shoes as did ten years ago.<p>-> Crime has been on the decline since 1981. But the cost of it -- losses from theft, damage, medical costs, and lost pay -- is up 38 percent, says the U.S. Justice Department.<p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>STALKING CATEGORY KILLERS
Take care that your superstore investment isn't battling in an overpopulated niche.<p>By Ellen Simon<p>Category killers, stores that sell everything in a specific niche -- be it bedding, babies, or home improvements -- have been one of the hottest concepts in retailing. Investors who got in early on <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys "R" Us</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a> carted home bags of goodies. And the beat goes on. <a name="NASD:BSST"></a><b>Baby Superstore Inc.</b>, a late-September offering slated to sell for $15 to $18 a share, was expected to be a hot IPO in a cool market. <p>But while crowded stores are great, overpopulated niches are not. A category may be big enough for one killer, but investors in others could end up dead. "`There seem to be one or two winners" per niche, says Steven Kernkraut, retail analyst at <a name="NYSE:BSC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10191"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bear, Stearns</b></a>. "The rest eventually seem to fail."<p>Winners know how to cater to their customers. For instance, male shoppers seem overwhelmed by the too-huge selection at Today's Man clothing stores, contributing to the company's rocky bottom line. Competitor the Men's Wearhouse has fewer racks, more manageable stores, and consistent 30 percent earnings growth in recent years. Home Depot simply has a much better assortment than the competition, says N. Richard Nelson, analyst at Duff & Phelps. The prospects for Baby Superstore? Too early to tell. Stick with the old standbys, says Nelson: Home Depot, Toys "R" Us, and Sports Authority. "From an investment standpoint, it's still really early in their growth cycle."<p><p><p><p>

						November 1994
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>ON THE RECORD
Here's what experts think could shake up the market.<p>We asked six market professionals: What event would be most likely to rock stocks in coming months? We also asked for an overall market outlook and a rating of their sentiment from 1 to 5, with 5 the most bullish.<p><p>LOUIS NAVELLIER, MPT REVIEW, INCLINE VILLAGE, NEVADA: "The bottom line is, if interest rates go up another percentage point, it will probably take 12 to 15 percent out of the market. Earnings growth could counterbalance some of that, but the stock market could be very vulnerable." <p>Market Rating: 3<p><p>DAN SULLIVAN, THE CHARTIST, SEAL BEACH, CALIFORNIA: "An unexpected rise in the discount rate would really spook the market. The Fed has been raising it about a half percent at a time, and the Fed Funds rate is three quarters of a percent above the discount rate, so we're due for another raise. If they raise it one percent instead of one-half, the market could go down a couple hundred points."<p>Market Rating: 1<p><p>JAMES STACK, INVESTECH RESEARCH, WHITEFISH, MONTANA: "Any factors that confirm a stronger-than-forecasted economy will have a negative impact on the market as investors realize that more interest-rate hikes lie ahead. Most critical will be consumer confidence and capacity utilization, which is bumping against a 14-year high."<p>Market Rating: 1<p><p>GERALD APPEL, SYSTEMS AND FORECASTS, GREAT NECK, NEW YORK: "Treasury-bill yields getting to be twice the dividend payout of the S&P 500 would constitute a serious sell signal. The current T-bill-to-dividend ratio [90-day bill yields divided by the S&P dividend payout] is about 1.7; it would have to get above 2.1 to become bearish. This has been an excellent predictor of bear markets since 1969."<p>Market Rating: 2<p><p>ROBERT BOWKER, THE BUSINESS CYCLE MONITOR, DALLAS: "If economic growth figures are significantly strong so that Greenspan will be forced to raise short-term interest rates above 5 percent, pushing long-term rates over 8 percent, the stock market, which is already overvalued, must fall."<p>Market Rating: 2<p><p>MARIEL CLEMENSEN, CLEMENSEN CAPITAL ACCESS, NEW YORK CITY: "The Federal Reserve relies on movement in gold prices to set interest rates. Therefore, a breakout in gold through the psychologically important $400-an-ounce level may presage a correction in the stock market as interest rates adjust upward. But the correction should be short-lived as the stock market decouples from the bond market and focuses on strong earnings growth in the economy rather than interest-rate levels." <p>Market Rating: 3<p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>NOVEMBER TIP SHEET<p>-> SPLITSVILLE: Some high-priced stocks may soon be the best deals on the Street. Sixty or so companies listed on the NYSE are poised to split shares in the next 6 to 12 months, according to the Standard & Poor's newsletter Outlook. A company's decision to split shares is usually a thumbs up for investors, with healthier dividends and a positive earnings report often accompanying the split. Whom to watch for a split soon? The following candidates carry a buy ranking from S&P's analysts: <a name="NYSE:AIG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10095"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American International Group</b></a> (AIG), recently $90 a share; <a name="NYSE:C"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10334"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler Corp.</b></a> (C), recently $44; <a name="NYSE:CB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10335"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chubb Corp.</b></a> (CB), recently $70; and <a name="NYSE:NWS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41816"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>News Corp.</b></a> (NWS), recently $49.<p>-> TAXING NEWS FOR MUNI INVESTORS: Recent changes in federal income-tax laws have taken a little bit of the appeal out of municipal bonds for anyone above the 28 percent tax bracket. Those same investors buying municipal-bond funds will feel the pinch as well. On 1994 tax returns, any appreciation of the principal value on munis bought at a discount to par value on or after May 1, 1993, will now be taxed as ordinary income, as with ordinary bonds. (This tax applies to the difference between the discounted purchase price of the bond and the bond's par value.) Those higher taxes will, of course, lower effective yields. Before the change, if a bond with a face value of $10,000 was bought for $9,200, the $800 appreciation was taxed as a capital gain, at the capital-gains rate of 28 percent. Now that gain is taxed as ordinary income, at up to 39.6 percent. <p>-> IS THE END NEAR FOR IRA FEES? <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> started offering no-fee IRAs in the spring of '92 for anyone with an account value of $10,000. Since then, IRA fee schedules have been adjusted across the industry -- though the terms are rarely simple. Prudential started waiving its $35 per IRA fee last March for anyone who has had a fund for at least a year and contributed to it in the last year or who has Prudential mutual funds in the IRA. For top clients, Smith Barney waives its $40 annual custodial fee on IRAs if their household average commission on their Smith Barney accounts is $100 per account per year. Fidelity charges $10 for each mutual fund in an IRA if the balance in each fund is less than $5,000. There's no charge for funds with a balance greater than $5,000, and a maximum charge of $60. Dreyfus charges $10 for each IRA, with a maximum total of $25 per customer. <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> doesn't offer no-fee IRAs, but it periodically reviews the issue. If Merrill follows the competition, a fee-free future can't be far off. <p>-> WHERE THE MONEY COMES FROM: Have you wondered why the interest banks pay on savings accounts and CDs hasn't gone up faster, given the Fed's five hikes in short-term rates (totaling 175 basis points) this year? It's because banks aren't terribly interested in your dough -- they can get money cheaper somewhere else. As the economy expands and loan demand increases, banks typically raise capital by luring new deposits. This time, they're moving away from consumer deposits toward riskier, uninsured, but less costly borrowing. "A bank can borrow from the wholesale market and save a lot more money than if it raised deposit [interest] rates above current levels," said Tom Brown, a banking analyst with brokerage Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. <p><p><p>

MARKET RADAR
A monthly look at the outlook as told by our eight market indicators.<p>
Our technical indicators have suddenly headed south again, while fundamental measures remain fairly stable. The message for equity investors: There's sentiment for a correction. As usual, we give each indicator a rating (10 is most bullish).<p>
BEARISH: INVESTOR SENTIMENT (2 this month/2 last month). Fidelity Investments says small-investor enthusiasm for stocks is inching closer to its all-time high -- a bearish sign, since small investors often get excited at market peaks.<p>
BEARISH: COMPOSITE BELLWETHER (2/3). Last month's upturn had raised the prospect of a bullish move for this index, which tracks the movement of utility and brokerage stocks, historical predictors of market turns. Falling utilities have trashed that hope, says InvesTech, which computes the index.<p>
BEARISH: ADVANCE/DECLINE LINE (2/3). A moving average of the difference between the number of rising and falling stocks, computed by InvesTech. This indicator is now flashing a classic bearish signal.<p>
NEUTRAL: PUT/CALL RATIO (4/5). Based on the volume of put and call options traded on the Chicago Board of Options Exchange, this indicator swung sharply negative but then bounced back slightly. A mixed signal.<p>
NEUTRAL: COMMODITY INDEX (4/3). Supplied by Goldman, Sachs, this measure of raw-materials prices has gotten a bit sunnier, but mostly because the Nigerian oil crisis was resolved. Other prices remain on an upward trend.<p>
NEUTRAL: YIELD DIFFERENTIAL: (5/5). Comparison between yields of 90-day Treasury bills and the Standard & Poor's 500, computed by the Leuthold Group. Fairly steady, but T bills still look a bit more attractive than stocks.<p>
NEUTRAL: CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEBT: (6/6). This aggregate measure of private debt continues to edge upward, but still not enough to be called a negative signal. Provided by Safian Investment Research.<p>
BEARISH: MONETARY ENVIRONMENT: (3/3). This model from InvesTech measures how much money is available to flow into the stock market. It remains steadily bearish and shows little likelihood of moving into bullish territory by the end of the year. <p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>DROUGHT WARNING
Is the world's supply of cash drying up?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Maybe the world is running out of money. While almost everyone on Wall Street is worrying about too much growth setting off inflation, a few analysts have started to worry about the world's supply of cash, knowing that a liquidity crisis would send interest rates up and markets tumbling. Sound far-fetched? Consider that those worrying about liquidity don't belong to a single Wall Street camp and are finding their evidence in very different sets of numbers.<p>David Shulman, chief equity strategist at Salomon Brothers, takes the macroeconomic view. Early in the current economic cycle, Shulman says, when business activity was slow and loan demand weak, the economy had excess cash: "There was a lot of liquidity, and most of it was going into the financial markets." Now that the economy has picked up, Shulman says, "it's Main Street's turn" to need money for inventories and capital equipment. That puts the productive sector in competition with the financial markets for cash.<p>Analysts who watch the domestic money-supply numbers have come to a similar conclusion. Recently M1 and M2, two measures of the amount of money in circulation, have shown slower growth. Over the last 12 months, M1 has grown at an annual rate of 5.1 percent; during the last 3 months the annualized rate is just 3.5 percent. "From an investment standpoint, it would be a lot better if M1 weren't slowing down," says James Stack, president of InvesTech Research in Whitefish, Montana.<p>And finally, Wall Street has started to worry that higher interest rates on CDs will draw money out of the stock and bond markets. After looking at the last 20 years, Katherine Hensel, chief investment strategist at Lehman Brothers, recently concluded that the rate on short-term CDs would have to climb another 2 percentage points before individuals would completely stop putting money into stocks. Of course, that implies that some investors have already found CDs an attractive alternative.<p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>BUYING A BETTER CD
Consider shopping at a brokerage instead of a bank.<p>By Deborah Pont<p>Why would anyone buy a simple financial product like a CD from a brokerage house? That's what banks are for, aren't they? Don't brokerages charge commissions for everything and require big minimums?<p>All good questions, but investors still ought to consider brokerage CDs. For one thing, brokerage-offered CDs yield 1 to 1.5 percentage points more than CDs from leading banks. And for another, brokers sell CDs without commission with minimums that range from $1,000 to $10,000.<p>Here are two examples: In September, branches of <a name="NASD:CHFC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12961"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chemical Bank</b></a> offered a one-year CD yielding 3.9 percent. At the same time, <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> offered a Chemical one-year CD at 5.4 percent. A Bank of New York CD yielding 4.3 percent at branches yielded 5.35 percent through Merrill. <p>But front-end gains aren't the only reason to look to a broker. Brokers can often resell CDs before their term -- an important option if rates climb sharply.<p>Pay close attention to the yields on brokerage CDs: Premiums often reduce the coupon. For example, Smith Barney's true yield on a six-month 7.65 coupon is 4.90 percent -- still okay when banks average 3.83. <p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>BOND-FUND INVESTORS GET HELP GAUGING RISK<p>By Gregory Millman<p>This year, bond-fund investors have learned about risk the hard way. Since January, taxable bond funds are down 2.97 percent, largely because of an increase in interest rates. But some derivative-laden funds have taken far bigger hits -- for example, the total return of <a name="FUND:PJIGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PJIGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Piper Capital's Institutional Government Income Portfolio</b></a> is down 25.23 percent so far this year because of derivative trading by fund manager Worth Bruntjen. That has left investors scrambling to find out just how risky their funds really are. Prospectuses and fund reports often reveal precious little about a fund's potentially risky securities trades.<p>Two major credit-rating services have recently stepped into this information breach. Standard & Poor's and Fitch Investor Services in New York introduced two new risk-rating systems to analyze the market volatility of bond funds. To calculate the ratings, analysts use sophisticated computer simulations to test how a bond fund will react to prepayments, interest-rate fluctuations, and choppy markets. Fitch rates funds on a scale from V1 through V10 (V for volatility); V1 funds are the least volatile. S&P uses the letters a, b, and c, with an aaa-rated fund carrying the lowest possible risk, and ccc the highest.<p>Not surprisingly, few fund managers are signing on. Managers worry that the threat of a rating downgrade could make it harder for them to earn top returns. So far, Fitch has taken on just over a half-dozen funds, while S&P has just over 50 takers. (S&P is also forcing funds that want to use its credit ratings to carry its risk ratings.) "This is something that benefits investors," says John Schiavetta of Fitch, "and some fund managers are nervous about it." <p>Russell Long, a director of S&P's managed-funds group, says investors can gauge an unrated fund's risk by seeing if gross assets are much higher than net assets, which could mean it is highly leveraged. Also, a big discrepancy between a security's par and market values may indicate a risky derivative sensitive to interest and prepayment rates. <p>-- by Gregory Millman<p>

						November 1994
Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>BAG GLOBAL PROFITS AT HOME<p>By Jim Jubak<p>The recovery that the U.S. economy has been enjoying for the past 22 months is finally beginning to spread to the rest of the world -- as most economists said it would. But next year may turn out quite differently than these same economists expect.<p>In 1993, U.S. real growth of 3 percent far outstripped the rest of the developed world's. That year the U.K. grew 1.9 percent, Japan broke even, and Germany fell 1.2 percent.<p>Forecasts for 1994 show our economy in overdrive -- 3.8 percent real growth -- with the rest of the world playing catch-up. Germany should grow by 2.8 percent, the U.K. 3.0 percent, Japan 0.9 percent.<p>That sets the scene for 1995, the year the U.S. is supposed to slow down and be overtaken by the countries following in the recovery cycle. Things may not happen that way. Estimates have U.S. growth slowing to 2.6 percent, but the rest of the developed world doesn't look as if it's set to zoom ahead. German growth should stay at 2.8 percent, U.K. growth will likely drop to 2.7 percent, and Japan should inch up to 1 percent.<p>Why no surge? David Munro, chief U.S. economist at High Frequency Economics in New York, explains that European economies have natural growth rates about 1 percentage point lower than the U.S.'s long-term growth potential of 2.5 percent. "Europe tends to run into inflation before we do [in its growth cycle]," he says. Low birth rates and aging population help keep its growth modest too.<p>But investors can still play the European recovery. So says Jeffrey Applegate, chief investment strategist for CS First Boston. Corporate profits have been growing faster than their historic trend line in the U.S. and lagging in Europe. As U.S. growth slows, he's projecting only a 5 percent bump in domestic profits in 1995, but a 20 percent rise in profits overseas. U.S. multinationals with strong European sales could get a nice boost just as the U.S. economy begins to level off.<p><p><p><p>

						November 1994
Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>BAD NEWS FOR TELEMARKETERS<p>By Carla Koehl<p>Pencil sets. Penny stocks. Swampland in Florida. Fraudulent telemarketers hawk everything imaginable. And until now, the minute they sniffed legal trouble, they had only to flee the state, set up shop, and start all over again. But a new law, enacted August 16, makes scheming telemarketers a federal concern--and could save investors more than $10 billion a year. <p>The Telemarketing and Consumer Fraud and Abuse Prevention Act gives state attorneys general the right to ask federal courts to seize the assets of telemarketing-fraud suspects, then chase them across state lines. "These boiler rooms are built to move," says Scott Cooper, legislative aide on the House transportation subcommittee, where the bill originated. "They use rented phones, rented coffee machines, rented people. By the time attorney generals can go looking, they're already gone."<p>The principal federal agency charged with carrying out the law, the Federal Trade Commission, has until August 1995 to decide on the specific rules it will develop to prohibit such practices. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities and Futures Trading Commission will have six months after that to add their own rules. The North American Securities Association estimates one quarter of the $40 billion that consumers lose each year in fraudulent telemarketing schemes involves phony investment ploys.<p>John Barker, director of the National Fraud Information Center, praises the law but adds, "There's an easier way, of course: Don't go shopping--or investing--on the phone."<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need To Know<p>A CHANGE OF STRATEGY
Want to reach your short-term goals?  Then don't buy stocks or equity mutual funds.<p>By John Koten<p>Are you saving for a second home? Your children's education? Or a retirement that's only a few years away?<p>Then don't try to do it by buying stocks -- or, for that matter, by buying mutual funds that invest in stocks. If your goals are short-range, stay out of the market. Buy Treasury bonds or CDs instead.<p>Strong advice? Yes, indeed. And it may just turn out to be wrong.<p>No one can ever say for sure what stocks will do next. There's certainly a chance that short-termers who plunge into equities now will be laughing at us skittish types a year -- or even a few months -- hence. They'll be camping out in their new beach houses; we'll still be sleeping in our tents.<p>At the moment, though, the odds appear stacked in the opposite direction. Our Market Radar feature (see "Market Radar Shows Bearish Signs" further down in this file) tells part of the story: Stocks are overvalued in comparison with their historic levels. Concerns about liquidity, inflation, the dollar, and trade talks also have placed the market on precarious footing of late.<p>At the same time, the rises in interest rates have made fixed-income investments a more attractive option. Short-term investors can now earn returns on bonds and CDs that are extremely competitive with anything they might hope to get from stocks. Better still, the risks associated with these investments are much lower.<p>We're so convinced about the importance of this change in the investment climate that we've dropped short-term ratings from our mutual fund listings this year. As far as we are concerned, no equity fund offers enough promise to justify its near-term risk.<p>None of this, of course, applies to investors with more distant horizons. In the long run, the only way to be assured of getting the higher returns that stocks offer is to remain invested at all times. Nothing about this has changed.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>FUND MANIA GOES GLOBAL<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>The U.S. market for financial services may be near saturation, but the infant overseas market for mutual funds has just started to explode. Last January, for instance, <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a>'s Bombay office ran a newspaper ad inviting Indians to invest in their country's first private mutual fund. In just three days an estimated 1 million investors plowed $300 million into the fund -- three times the anticipated offering amount.<p>The boom isn't limited to emerging markets, either. In Europe, aggregate assets held in mutual funds jumped 18.5 percent from 1992 to 1993. <p>American companies are feverishly pushing their products abroad. "All the non-U.S. markets are still evolving, and there's a lot of opportunity over there," says William McBride, international editor at Lipper Analytical Services, a mutual fund tracking firm.<p>The big publicly traded companies for investors to watch include <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> (MER), which has 29 mutual funds overseas and a big presence in Japan, Mexico, and Brazil; <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a> (CCI), which has 28 funds overseas; and <a name="NYSE:AC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43712"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alliance Capital Management</b></a> (AC), which has a heavy market presence in Japan, Australia, the United Kingdom, and India. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>THE WHINING CEO
Be wary if a company's chief is denouncing the Fed.<p>By John Koten<p>If you own stocks, this is a good time to pay attention to what your companies are saying about rising interest rates. Is the chief executive angrily denouncing the Federal Reserve Board or demanding Alan Greenspan's scalp? If so, there's reason to be wary as an investor.<p>This isn't to say that some amount of executive-suite disappointment isn't in order. After five straight interest-rate hikes this year, economic growth is certainly bound to slow down. What's more, given the nation's increasingly tight industrial capacity, some companies out there must have been looking forward to making some easy money. There's nothing like reduced competition when it comes to enhancing the bottom line.<p>This, of course, is exactly what the Fed has been trying to avoid -- unearned price increases that lead to inflation. In raising rates, its message to business is this: You can earn more money only if you improve productivity and invest in new capacity. Tough medicine, yes, but it's also fair.<p>In this way, you might say the Fed is practicing its own brand of supply-side economics. Yet whereas Ronald Reagan offered up a carrot in the form of lower tax rates, the Fed is brandishing a stick in the form of higher interest rates. This time, industry must either respond or get clobbered.<p>The companies that will do well in this environment are those that can cut costs, raise productivity, and build modern new factories. Industries that help manufacturers achieve these goals -- such as the suppliers of computers and other labor-saving devices -- should benefit as well.<p>Of course, higher interest rates also can make the cost of capital improvements prohibitive for marginal outfits. If your company's CEO is wailing on about the evil Fed, you might want to make sure that's not the real reason.<p><p>

October 1994
Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>TREND SPOTTER<p>By Carla Koehl<p>-> Not since 1982 has the Federal Reserve ordered the U.S. Mint to make such a big chunk of change: 19 billion new coins for 1994. That's 25 percent more than the average made over the past 11 years. "You have to mint more coins when the economy's better," says Mint spokesman Michael White. "There's more business out there this year. And a whole lot more next year."<p>-> At last count, women in the workforce with children under age six numbered 9.6 million. The estimated number of spaces at licensed child-care centers? Just 4.2 million, says the National Association for the Education of Young Children.<p>-> National Park Service rangers counted up 28 percent more backcountry overnight stays in the first half of 1994 than for the same period last year. That's more campers than the parks have seen since 1983. "It's pretty damn many is what it is," gruffs Ken Hornback, NPS chief of socioeconomic studies. Hornback chalks up the rise to rampant consumer optimism. "Must be," he says. " 'Cause the weather's been awful."<p>-> Given the choice between figuring taxes and killing Nazis on computer screens, America is choosing Nazis. Says PC Data of Reston, Virginia, 11.8 million software games were sold last year, compared with 4.2 million personal-finance packages.<p>-> From the "It May Mean Nothing, but..." Department: A NYSE seat sold in June 1994 for $830,000. The last time the price of a seat was in that neighborhood (on its way up in value, that is) was April 1987, when it hit $850,000. In September of that year a seat went for $1.1 million. A month later came Black Monday.<p>-> Alarm systems now protect 10 million American homes. That's great for alarm owners, who'll save $500 million this year by fending off would-be burglars. The rest of us, though, will blow $700 million paying police to answer bogus alarms, says Lee Jones, president of Support Services Group in San Clemente, California. In 1995, 20 percent more homes will be armed -- and you can count on 20 percent more false alarms. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>IS STEEL A DEAL?
These are the best of times for big steel. And that's what worries investors, who know this industry has a history of squandering good fortune. <p>By Ellen Simon<p>It's hard to imagine a better scenario. The bitter cuts that big, integrated steel makers made in the '70s and '80s, reducing manufacturing capacity by one third, are paying off. Now, thanks to heavy demand for consumer durables such as appliances and cars, steel makers can dictate price hikes. A weak dollar has kept offshore competitors from undercutting domestic steel makers' prices. A revitalized U.S. auto industry has provided steady contract work. Good times are even letting big steel adequately fund pensions for the workers it laid off way back when. <a name="NYSE:BS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10210"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bethlehem</b></a>, for instance, used its $355 million spring stock issue to fund pensions. <p>But steel is exactly the kind of cyclical industry that worries some analysts. Hard times lie ahead, many say. Karlis M. Kirsis of New York's World Steel Dynamics is looking for the steel market to rise over the next two years but thinks a "death spiral" will hit in the late '90s. "Those companies that have not vigorously attacked their cost structures between now and then will find themselves in great distress," he says. New competition looms: Five new plants coming on line will give low-cost mini mills the capacity to capture 25 percent of the flat-sheet steel business, a bread-and-butter segment for the biggies. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>IT'S TIME TO SIFT THROUGH THE RUBBLE<p>By Gregory Millman<p><a name="NYSE:HTT"></a><b>Hyperion 1999 Term Trust</b> was last year's frog, but it may be this year's prince. The trust, which dropped in price from $10 a share in January 1993 to $6.88 a year later, is now a bargain-priced way to profit from rising interest rates.<p>The term trust is a species of closed-end mutual funds. Managers sell shares in the trust, then use the money to buy assets. Shares trade like stocks and pay dividends. At a pre-established time (hence term trust) management liquidates the assets and distributes them.<p>Few investments got hammered harder by falling interest rates last year than Hyperion 1999 (NYSE: HTT). Betting that interest rates would rise, the fund's managers put 30 percent of capital into derivatives called IOs. (These are created by breaking up the stream of payments from a mortgage. The term stands for interest only.) IOs gain in value as interest rates rise and lose value when interest rates fall.<p>In 1992 and 1993, interest rates fell and Hyperion took a beating. Over the past year, as rates have risen, IOs have performed well; the trust's net asset value increased by 9.4 percent in the first seven months of 1994.<p>But the share price has not reflected the improvement. At $7, shares trade at a discount of about 9.1 percent to NAV. Analysts figure the trust could return as much as 13.1 percent annually by the time investors get their 1999 distribution. The downside return, they calculate, is 6.73 percent annually -- roughly the current yield on a three-year treasury note. As for the distribution, management remains committed to returning the $10 a share original investors paid in 1992. Analysts think that's extremely unlikely, but investors have a good chance at getting a distribution of more than the current share price.<p>Of course, Wall Street bargains come with risks. The fund manager and its original underwriters face a possible class-action lawsuit for last year's debacles. And if rates go down again before 1999, Hyperion will once again head south fast. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>NEXT: SECOND-GUESSER SUITS<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>Sue your mutual fund for making a bad investment? One shareholder is trying it, seeking class-action status for a suit in Illinois against <a name="FUND:SCOBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SCOBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Scudder Global Fund</b></a>. "I don't think anyone views this as a simple nuisance suit," says Larry Rogers of Shereff, Friedman, Hoffman & Goodman, a New York law firm.<p>In the suit, investor Jonathan Panfil says Scudder Global breached its fiduciary duty first by buying shares of software maker Policy Management Systems in the absence of what the suit calls "reliable financial or accounting information," and second by not selling the shares when, the suit alleges, improprieties became public. Panfil wants Scudder and other funds to refund $100 million. <p>Scudder says it didn't know the depth of problems until auditors withdrew their approval of Policy Management's financials in August 1993. Selling then would have sealed a loss, Scudder says. The stock has since risen but is still down 25 percent since Scudder bought it. In the past 12 months, the fund has gained 11.5 percent -- apparently good enough for Panfil. He bought more shares last October and this March.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>the return of the cd<p>By Deborah Pont and Jim Jubak<p>It's not a flood yet, but money is starting to flow back into those small-denomination time accounts known as certificates of deposit. According to the Federal Reserve, the amount of money held in CDs rose from $769.1 billion in May to $770.4 billion in June. In July, the sum crept up to $772.5 billion. Those levels are still far below last year's (the total in May 1993 was $832.4 billion), but the turnaround in CD deposits is certainly significant. Higher interest rates are the driving force. In July, Southern Pacific Thrift and Loan in southern California offered 5.13 percent on a six-month CD. In August, the rate hit 5.44 percent.<p>The recent move in CD rates has raised yields to levels at or above those paid by Treasury bills with comparable terms. On August 19, one-year T bills were paying 5.63 percent. Top rates on one-year CDs ranged from 5.5 to 5.8 percent. "When rates were going up in February, the Treasury bill and note were higher than even the top CD rate in the market, which was historically an aberration," says Norbert Mehl, president of MasterFund/BanxQuote, a firm that tracks national interest rates. <p>How far will CD rates climb? James Fry, the chief financial officer of Southern Pacific, says increases in CD rates could outpace the Fed's efforts to push interest rates higher -- assuming loan demand improves.<p>Another factor that could drive CD yields higher: "The banks will see an enormous opportunity to recapture funds that have fled to mutual funds," says Mehl. If that's the case, count on aggressive hikes in CD rates in October, a traditional time to launch marketing campaigns.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>HOW RATE HIKES HIT HOME
When credit tightens, younger consumers may feel the pinch.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Higher interest rates will slow the economy. That, of course, is the entire premise of recent Federal Reserve policy. Raise rates, slow growth, keep inflation in check. But the Fed's moves have another effect. Each time it changes interest rates, the Fed shifts income from one age group to another. <p>Consider consumer credit. The latest numbers from the Fed show no letup in Americans' pursuit of debt. Outstanding consumer installment credit -- everything from automobile loans to credit card debt -- grew by 1.3 percent in June, or $10.9 billion. That follows an $11.5 billion jump in May.<p>This may not be as ominous as it seems. Now that almost every form of consumer credit has been turned into income-bearing securities, one man's interest owed is another's interest income. Peter makes a payment on his mortgage; Paul gets an interest payment from the collateralized mortgage obligations in his government bond fund.<p>The numbers used by the Department of Commerce to measure personal interest income and interest expense (including mortgages) show that interest income fell right alongside rates. It hit bottom -- $628 million -- in the fourth quarter of 1993. Then, as rates began to climb in 1994, income again tracked right along, rising to $644 million in the second quarter of 1994. Interest expense also rose from $366 at year end to $377 million in the second quarter of this year.<p>The bottom line? Because Americans in aggregate own more than they owe, individuals are making more in interest than they are paying out. The differential was $261 million in the fourth quarter and $267 million in the second quarter of this year.<p>This doesn't mean consumers are going to keep on getting richer as rates rise, or that all consumers will prosper equally. That's mostly because mortgage rates lag changes in Fed policy. Despite five Fed rate hikes this year, effective mortgage rates averaged 8.02 in the second quarter of 1994, just 1 basis point higher than at the start of the year. As mortgage rates catch up, younger consumers may feel the pinch -- and spend less. Their parents, who have already paid off their mortgages, will collect bigger payments on the investments they hold. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>ON THE RECORD
Here's what experts think are  the most promising foreign markets.<p>We asked five global market experts to tell us what foreign arena looks most promising. We also sought their views on the U.S. market, plus a near-term rating from 1 to 5, with 5 the most bullish outlook. <p><p>J. MARK MOBIUS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, <a name="FUND:TEDMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TEDMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TEMPLETON EMERGING MARKETS FUND</b></a>: "Brazil is finally beginning to bring inflation under control and is moving toward a more logical economic system. A new currency seems to be taking hold. We've taken a long-term bet on Brazil, and it's paying off. I'm concerned about the U.S. because of generally declining competitiveness vis-a-vis other countries in the world." <p>U.S. Market Rating: 3<p><p>MATTHEW WILSON, ECONOMIST, OLLIFF & PARTNERS, LONDON: "I'm a bull on Taiwan for capital growth. Although its interest rates went up earlier in the year, Taiwan's fairly independent monetary policy makes it an alternative to U.S. interest rate uncertainty. I'm neutral on the U.S. It's very defensive, stands up well to knocks. I just don't think it's a very aggressive market. "<p>U.S. market rating: 3<p><p>MARTIN MARMOLEJO, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MMA CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, MEXICO CITY, MEXICO: "The Mexican market is in an excellent expansionary phase. I think in the next year or two it could well be up in excess of 30 percent in dollar terms. For the U.S. market to be stagnant is about the healthiest thing for it because the U.S. economy is still growing at a vigorous pace. Eventually the U.S. market will be more in line with rational valuations. Looks like we'll see a soft landing of prices without major damage to investors."<p>U.S. market rating: 3<p><p>LEAH ZELL, PRINCIPAL, WANGER ASSET MANAGEMENT, CHICACO: "I like the U.K. market of all the European markets. It's come down a lot and seems to be holding.The economy is in pretty good shape; U.K. stocks are more reasonably priced than U.S. On the U.S. I'd be neutral; give it a three on price and fundamentals."<p>U.S. market rating: 3<p><p>CHRISTOPHER H. BROWNE, GENERAL PARTNER, TWEEDY, BROWNE, NEW YORK CITY: "France has really underperformed other European markets this year; first six months of '94, it was down 11.2 percent, compared with all Europe down 5.7 percent. Its price-to-earnings ratio looking out to '95 is under 16, cheaper than some other European markets. The market is at two times book value; U.S. is three times. The U.S. market is not going anywhere until earnings start justifying valuations. It has discounted the future, but there's no reason for it to fall off a cliff." <p>U.S. market rating: 2<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>OCTOBER TIP SHEET<p>* CORPORATE COST CUTTING IMPROVES PERFORMANCE, BUT BY HOW MUCH? 
A new study by Mercer Management Consulting of Lexington, Massachusetts, finds that investors can achieve much higher returns by focusing on companies that boost earnings through higher revenue rather than lower expenses. The Mercer study analyzed the performance of 1,000 companies versus their peers from 1989-1992. It found that while cost-cutters improved shareholder value by an average of 12 percent annually, companies with above-average revenue growth returned an average of 21 percent annually to shareholders.<p>* NEARING THE CLOSE OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY: 
Twentieth Century Funds have always been marketed as friends of the small investor. Until January 1, 1993, the fund family didn't even require a minimum investment. Now, however, investors not only need $2,500 to open an account (a fairly common figure in the industry) but also can't let the value of their account fall below that figure. If it does, Twentieth Century will liquidate the account even if the cause is poor performance by a fund. With <a name="FUND:TWCUX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TWCUX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Twentieth Century Ultra Investors</b></a> fund down 8.93 percent for the seven months ended July 29, that's a very real possibility for some people. "We want to leave the door open to small investors," says company spokesman Gunnar Hughes, "but we need a really tight handshake from them." Investors have two choices: They can either meet the minimum by December 10, 1994, or they can sign up for Twentieth Century's monthly investment plan with its own $50 minimum.<p>* TALK LIKE A PRO: 
"The stock market has returned an average 10.3 percent a year since 1926." That and other oft-quoted statistics on the financial markets are available in the just-published 1994 Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation (SBBI) Yearbook, a compendium of market research from Ibbotson Associates in Chicago. A financial wonk's dream reference, the $90 SBBI tracks returns and index values for asset classes such as large- and small-cap stocks and long-term government bonds back to 1926. To order, call 800-758-3557.<p>* BEEN DOWN TOO LONG: 
For the first half of 1994, short-selling was the most successful "alternative" equity strategy, reports the Frank Russell Co. With the mean short-selling fund up 19.2 percent, the group substantially outperformed three other categories of funds that posted double-digit returns in 1993: hedge funds (down 1.6 percent through June), controlled-risk funds (down 2.9 percent) and "event-driven" funds (up 1.7 percent). That's quite a turnaround from 1993, when the mean short fund was down 8.2 percent. So have investors responded to this turn of events? According to Don Hardy, director of Russell's Private Investment Services, the answer is a resounding no. Hardy, who tracks 350 investment managers who pursue alternate strategies, says he continues to detect more investor interest in hedge funds, which play both sides of the market, as well as in event-driven funds, which attempt to profit from corporate mergers and acquisitions. Controlled-risk funds, which play anomalies in interest-rate swings, are holding about even, he adds. <p><p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>MARKET RADAR
A monthly look at the outlook as told by our eight market indicators.<p>With four of our signals now flashing neutral, things look less gloomy for equity investors than last month. Still, no bullish signs yet. This month we've given each indicator a numerical rating (10 is most bullish). The arrows represent each indicator's near-term message.<p>THE INDICATORS:<p>BEARISH: INVESTOR SENTIMENT (2 this month/2 last month). Fidelity Investments says small-investor enthusiasm for stocks remains near an all-time high -- a bearish sign, since small investors often get excited at market peaks.<p>NEUTRAL: COMPOSITE BELLWETHER (3/2). This index, computed by InvesTech, tracks utility and brokerage stocks -- which historically predict market turns. It has moved ahead of its five-week average -- a good sign, but it's too early to call this a bullish move.<p>NEUTRAL: ADVANCE/DECLINE LINE (3/2). A moving average of the difference between the number of rising and falling stocks. This indicator, computed by InvesTech, appears to have bottomed out after a bad stretch.<p>NEUTRAL: PUT-CALL RATIO (5/4). Based on the volume of put and call options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, last month's only non-bearish signal remains neutral -- but it's edging the right way.<p>BEARISH: COMMODITY INDEX (3/3). Supplied by Goldman Sachs, this measure of raw-materials prices has been buffeted by the political crisis in oil-rich Nigeria. Overall, the numbers still show upward pressure on prices. <p>BEARISH: YIELD DIFFERENTIAL (5/6). Ratio between yields of 90-day Treasury bills and the Standard & Poor's 500, computed by the Leuthold Group. It currently suggests that stocks are a bit overpriced.<p>NEUTRAL: CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEBT (6/6). This aggregate measure of private debt continues its upward trend -- a warning to bears. Provided by Safian Investment Research.<p>BEARISH: MONETARY ENVIRONMENT (3/2). This model from InvesTech measures how much money is available to flow into the stock market. Although it has inched back from a three-year low in July, it remains bearish.<p><p><p>

October 1994
Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>BARGAIN HUNTING ALL OVER THE WORLD<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>Tweedy, Browne Co. believed in staying close to its customers long before the phrase became a management mantra. In the early 1940s, it even moved its New York headquarters just down the hall from the office of Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing and a treasured brokerage client of the firm.<p>Maybe it's Graham's spirit that has enabled the <a name="FUND:TBGVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TBGVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tweedy, Browne Global Value Fund</b></a> to rack up a year-to-date 9 percent return by mid-August while its mutual fund rivals in Morningstar's world stock group were hovering around breakeven (up 1.9 percent for the year to date). The blue-blooded firm has moved its offices again since Graham's days, but it still follows his approach to value investing.<p>Graham believed in paying less for a stock than the company's assets were worth. About half of the 180 stocks in the Global Value fund reflect this strategy; these issues sell for an average of 72 percent of book value. Since many of these companies are in the midst of turnarounds, or have no earnings at all, their price-to-earnings ratios are misleadingly high. The other half of the fund's portfolio is selected on the basis of low price-to-earnings ratios, which collectively average about 10.<p>Co-managers Christopher Browne, William Browne (both sons of a founder), James Clark Jr., and John Spears have done well this year largely by avoiding hard-hit Asian and Latin American markets; nearly two thirds of the fund's money is in 132 undervalued companies spanning the recovering economies of Western Europe, with strong concentrations in Switzerland and the Netherlands. Another 25 percent of the fund is split evenly between the U.S. and Japan, with the rest in Hong Kong, Australia, Canada, and cash. The fund leans toward smaller companies, but does hold some name brands, including Heineken, Nestle, and Fuji Film.<p>The greatest threat to the fund's continued success could be its own rapid growth: Started in June 1993, the Global Value fund already has $477 million under management. But Tweedy, Browne's management team is convinced that the world's equity markets are full of undervalued companies. So convinced, in fact, that the four managers have roughly $8 million of their own money in the funds. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>IS THERE A YIELD PROBLEM?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Yields on CDs are up. With a little shopping, investors can find one-year certificates paying more than 5 percent. One-year Treasury bills pay 5.6 percent now, up from 3.6 percent in January. And the stock market? The dividend yield on the Standard & Poor's 500 is at 2.78 percent, a measly 6-basis-point increase from the 2.72 percent yield in January. Is this a sign that the market is overvalued? <p>In the past, Wall Street analysts have used dividend yield as an indicator of the market's direction. "For 13 or 14 years I've been in the market, dividend yield has been a pretty good indicator of the market's direction," says Eric Ryback, president of Lindner Funds. The thinking is that if the market's yield drops significantly below that offered by competing investments, investors will buy bonds or CDs instead of stocks, sending the market lower. That says the market's yield gap is a bearish sign.<p>But things may be different this time. Not because analysts expect the market to catch up with higher yields elsewhere, but because changes in the economy have made dividend yield a less useful indicator. Companies are simply not passing good earnings along to investors as dividends to the extent they did in the past.<p>"Traditionally, there's been a big lag before the market catches up," says Ryback. "Corporations will eventually raise their rates -- if they can." <p>But this time the three traditional big dividend-paying sectors -- drug companies, utilities, and oil-and-gas companies -- all face competitive pressures that make dividend hikes unlikely. Cost containment is now the driving force.<p>"Corporate America is focused on getting leaner and meaner, and there's more emphasis on staying competitive than on paying out that dividend," says Jim Floyd, senior analyst at the Leuthold Group. Floyd calculates that dividends on the S&P came in at $12.90 a share in 1993. For 1994, he's forecasting $13.50. If Floyd is right, dividends will grow by 4.7 percent this year, beating inflation. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>TIME FOR A TANTRUM?
The gloom on the horizon doesn't have much to do with whether equities represent a good value.<p>By John Koten<p>Optimism about the markets isn't easy to come by at the moment.<p>Not with the dollar in the dumpster. Not with inflation still looming as a threat. And not with the prospect of further interest rate hikes this fall.<p>Those who think otherwise should take a look at our Market Radar feature (further down in this file). Of eight technical indicators, seven bespeak extreme caution, while the eighth merely suggests mild caution.<p>At present, the gloom on the horizon does not have much to do with whether equities represent a good value. The more pressing concern is whether or not there's any money left out there to buy stocks.<p>President Clinton's policies promise little help in this regard, either in creating more wealth here at home or bringing it in from abroad. Back when the market was steaming along on its own power, this wasn't regarded as a huge problem. Better not to risk him mucking things up. Now, however, it may be necessary to get his attention.<p>Teenagers issue a plea for help by staging a crisis. Given Wall Street's sometimes adolescent tendencies, we wouldn't be surprised to see it resort to this subconscious tactic sometime soon.<p>Investors watching from the sidelines may do well to distance themselves emotionally from the goings-on. If the market does tumble, it's likely the damage will be short-lived. <p>For those who can remain circumspect, this is a good time to do some shopping. Look for companies with strong fundamentals and solid growth prospects. Then, settle on a price that represents a good value -- and wait for the stock to drop to that level. Chances are that it will. <p>In the current investment environment, there's little risk that the highfliers will take off before you can get on board. There's no excuse for not taking the time to complete thorough due diligence. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>THE PERFECT STOCK MARKET HEDGE<p>Looking to diversify some of your holdings out of stocks? You're not alone. In search of the perfect hedge, investors have rushed to gold, real estate investment trusts, even commodities in recent months. <p>New data point to an even better stock market hedge, one that gives investors consistently high returns with substantially lower risk than commonly found in hard assets. It's a balanced long and short stock portfolio created by Michael Long, a money manager and general partner of Rockbridge Partners in Charlotte, North Carolina.<p>Short-selling of any kind is risky, but the structure of this so-called hedged portfolio -- 62 percent long and 38 percent short, rebalanced quarterly -- removes much of the downside associated with short-selling.<p>Long says that investors have been scared away from shorts since 1991, when they made some bad bets against stocks of money-center banks; the Nasdaq composite -- a favored hunting ground for short-sellers -- rose 57 percent in 1991.<p>Even cautious investors can be comfortable with the long/short portfolio thanks to its high returns and relatively low volatility. Investors looking for a short manager can try one of a couple of mutual funds that use short-selling or try to find an individual money manager who shorts stocks. <a name="FUND:RYURX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RYURX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rydex Ursa Fund</b></a>, for instance, is 100 percent short the S&P 500; <a name="FUND:RSCOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RSCOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Robertson Stephens Contrarian Fund</b></a> has one quarter of its portfolio in shorts. Be advised that neither of these achieve the balance in the hedged portfolio. Long (704-543-4880) also tracks money managers who short stocks. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>THE BAD NEWS ABOUT EARNINGS
Why isn't the market rewarding companies with higher profits?<p>By Jim Jubak<p>"Earnings are coming in better than expected," says Melissa Brown, director of quantitative research at Prudential Securities. "That's the good news." The bad? "The market just doesn't seem to care."<p>Take the action in two stocks on July 21. <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq Computer</b></a> reported a doubling in earnings, beating analysts' estimates by two cents a share. In response, its stock fell more than 5 percent. <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> announced quarterly earnings of 59 cents a share, above analysts' estimates and up 37 percent from the year-earlier quarter. The stock edged 1 percent percent lower. "It's a paradoxical quarter," says Brown.<p>But not inexplicable. The problem, Brown says, is that a bulk of the gains in corporate earnings are coming from tighter controls on costs rather than more goods being sold. Investors love companies that run lean and mean, but earnings increases that come from cutting costs aren't sustainable. Company after company, says Brown, "is coming out and saying that we don't expect this [earnings growth rate] to continue." Economists now say the economy is slowing. Corporate executives determined to manage the expectations of Wall Street analysts are vocally seconding the motion.<p>Investors are listening hard. Suddenly, everybody wants to look beneath the surface of earnings reports. If earnings are growing, what about sales and inventories? Rising inventories at Compaq in the second quarter signal trouble down the road to investors. If both sales and earnings are up, what about profit margins? The market slammed Intel recently: Even though its earnings had risen, profit margins had slipped.<p>The market may also be looking further ahead and saying that big gains in earnings are history in this business cycle. According to Standard & Poor's Compustat, quarterly earnings for the S&P 500 hit $6.93 during 1994's first quarter. That's way up from the low of $2.55 recorded in the fourth quarter of 1991. Which may be precisely the problem. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>SEPTEMBER TIP SHEET<p>-> HELP FOR THE MACINTOSH USER: Until now, you had to use an <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>-compatible computer to enjoy the benefits of investment software offering both portfolio-management tools and on-line trading. Now <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a> is selling a Macintosh version of its StreetSmart program for $59, offering unlimited real-time price quotes and trade orders. For a surcharge, users can gain access to Dow Jones news reports and Standard & Poor's data. One drawback: StreetSmart can't translate historical quotes into language that the portfolio-management part of the program can read. Still, StreetSmart is one small step for Mac users. And one big step for Schwab: Rival Fidelity Investments isn't scheduled to have a Mac version of its software until 1995 at the earliest.<p>-> LEASE RELEASE: Watch for an attractive way to buy a used car. This year, thanks to the auto industry's recent love affair with leasing, a record 2 million cars will return to dealers as their leases expire. "By 1997, we'll be swimming in them," says Ted Orme of the National Automobile Dealers Association. Previously leased cars sell for prices comparable to standard used cars. Many dealers recondition postlease cars and re-lease them with full warranties. Look for good deals on two- and three-year old Jaguars.<p>-> WHERE THERE'S NO WILL, THERE'S A WAY: In 19 states it's possible to designate heirs to your securities accounts without writing a will or worrying about probate of your estate. These states have passed the Uniform Transfer on Death Securities Registration Act, which allows nonprobate transfers of stock, bond, and mutual fund accounts without a will. Previously, such transfers were possible for bank accounts but not securities accounts. The law hasn't passed in New York -- home to many of the big brokerage firms -- but it will be reintroduced next year. <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>SECTOR FUNDS' SLOW DEATH<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>Are mutual fund families fed up with sector funds? An increasing number of these laggards are walking the plank. Since 1992, ten have been liquidated or merged into other funds. Recent kills: Vanguard Specialized Technology and Service Economy funds, Fidelity Select Electric Utilities, and Rushmore Precious Metals Index Plus. Says John Rekenthaler, editor of Morningstar Mutual Funds, "Sector funds are very dangerous animals [that] have played into investors' worst instincts. The more dead sector funds, the better."<p>Investors should beware merged slackers with shiny new labels. Oppenheimer Management now wants to splice its Global Bio-Tech and Global Environment funds to form a new global emerging-growth fund. The two have lost 24 percent and 10 percent, respectively, of their net asset value so far this year. "We're getting out of the sector-fund business," says Robert Doll, director of equity investments at Oppenheimer. Not quite -- biotech stocks would still compose 25 percent to 30 percent of the new fund. <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>ONE HOT FUND'S ROLLER-COASTER RIDE<p>By Jonathan Burton<p>When investors and the press get the scent, a hot-performing mutual fund can pull in close to a half-billion bucks in just one year. Gary Pilgrim's <a name="FUND:PBHGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PBHGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PBHG Growth Fund</b></a> did just that. The eight-year-old fund dumped its fat 4.75 percent load in July 1993 and then racked up a red-hot 1993 total return of 46.6 percent. As a result, the fund, which had just $8.1 million in assets in July 1993, boomed to $466 million in assets a year later.<p>However, before you invest, take a look past the champagne and confetti. The fund has a record of high volatility, including a 29 percent drop in the third quarter of 1990. In the past the nimble fund was quickly able to overcome such setbacks by running up even bigger gains in bull markets. But this isn't a tiny fund anymore. With 60 times more money, will Pilgrim still be able to run with the bulls when they return?<p>Winning in up markets is crucial to PBHG. Pilgrim plays the turbulent earnings-momentum game, which means he picks volatile companies, sometimes initial public offerings, with projected annual earnings growth of at least 20 percent. In down markets, such highfliers exact a heavy price. Two Pilgrim picks, IDB Communications and <a name="AMEX:CYE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12967"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cheyenne Software</b></a>, recently shed half their market value, and Pilgrim sold both at a loss. By midsummer, the fund's year-to-date total return was a negative 13 percent. The IPO market, which added a hefty 16 percent to 1993's return, has since cooled considerably. That market's "opportunity," he recently told shareholders, "is clearly behind us." <p>Of course, Pilgrim has been down before. After the fund lost 9.7 percent in 1990 (with that 29 percent third-quarter plunge), it rebounded to return 51.6 percent in 1991.<p>Finding enough small undiscovered stocks to fuel a rebound like that is tougher with $466 million than with $8 million. To cast a bigger net, Pilgrim has recently added several members to his portfolio team.<p>So should you invest? The outside experts and Pilgrim are in surprising agreement. Sheldon Jacobs, editor of The No-Load Fund Investor newsletter and who recently dropped PBHG from his best-buys list says, "It's a very good fund if you have a high tolerance for a lot of volatility." If you can't stand the heat, says the pragmatic Pilgrim, "move on." <p><p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>ON THE RECORD
Here's what strategists think is driving the market.<p>Six highly regarded strategists talk about what's driving the market right now. Each also rates the prospects for stocks for the rest of the year on a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 reflecting the most bullish outlook. <p><p>LOUIS NAVELLIER, MPT REVIEW, INCLINE VILLAGE, NEVADA:  "The market's been dying a liquidity death on light volume since early April. Interest rates have gone up so much, stocks should fall 20 percent to 30 percent. I think it's a good time to get in. As soon as earnings take hold, they'll probably drive  stocks higher." <p>Market rating: 4<p><p>GERALD APPEL, SYSTEMS & FORECASTS, GREAT NECK, NEW YORK:  "The expectation of higher interest rates is getting everyone panicky. I think rates are going to go up, but not dramatically. The market is going to stay under some pressure. It would not be at all surprising to see [the market] go down a few  percentage points by the end of the year and have trouble advancing."<p>Market rating: 2<p><p>DAN SULLIVAN, THE CHARTIST, SEAL BEACH, CALIFORNIA:  "The breakdown of the daily advance/decline line [the difference between the number of new highs and the number of new lows] indicates the [performance of the] Dow is masking the internal weakness of the market. We're in the early stages of a bear  market. The market will make zero progress through the rest of the year."<p>Market rating: 1 <p><p>MARIEL CLEMENSEN, CLEMENSEN CAPITAL ACCESS, NEW YORK CITY:  "The stock market is inexorably linked to the Fed short term. It is impossible to see forward momentum until investors get the higher rates they fear. [Long-term, however], due to the recovery in Europe already in sight and Japan's behind that, we  face the delightful prospect of a long economic expansion period. The stock market will eventually value securities on earnings growth rather than interest rates. This is a good time to pick those securities."<p>Market rating: 5<p><p>ROBERT NATALE, STANDARD & POOR'S EMERGING & SPECIAL SITUATIONS, NEW YORK CITY:  "Right now inflation expectations are around 2.6 percent. By year end, I think it's going to be 3.5 percent. If it comes in over that, the Fed will have to act more than it has. The market will drop."<p>Market rating: 3<p><p>JAMES B. STACK, INVESTECH RESEARCH, WHITEFISH, MONTANA:  "With interest rates now in an uptrend, investors must keep a watchful eye on the underlying pressures on the Federal Reserve. The deteriorating monetary climate and poor technical strength raise the odds that we are in a bear market, where broad  averages may eventually lose 20 percent or more."<p>Market rating: 2<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>MARKET RADAR
A monthly look at the outlook as told by our eight market indicators.<p>With seven of our eight indicators bearish and the other neutral, it's a good time for investors to be extra cautious in the financial markets. Indeed, at press time several indicators were hovering near all-time bearish levels. The bottom line:  Hold off on that stock-buying spree.<p>THE INDICATORS:<p>BEARISH: INVESTOR SENTIMENT. Fidelity Investments' measure of small-investor enthusiasm for stocks is a contrarian signal. High is bad; lots of cash is already in the market. Still very bearish after an all-time high in January.<p>BEARISH: COMPOSITE BELLWETHER. This index, computed by InvesTech, tracks utility and brokerage stocks (both of which historically move down before the rest of the market does) to predict market turns. The only times it's been more bearish were before the  corrections of 1974 and 1987.<p>BEARISH: ADVANCE/DECLINE LINE. A moving average of the difference between the number of rising and falling stocks. This indicator, computed by InvesTech, kept falling even during July's brief rally -- a bad sign.<p>NEUTRAL: PUT-CALL RATIO. Based on the volume of put and call options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange, this contrarian indicator remains officially neutral but appeared to be moving bearishly in July.<p>BEARISH: COMMODITY INDEX. Supplied by Goldman Sachs, this measure of raw-materials prices has been rising steadily this year, showing upward pressure on the inflation rate. Upward moves have been stronger lately; that means bad news for prices -- and possibly  the market -- later this year.<p>BEARISH: YIELD DIFFERENTIAL. Gap between yields of 90-day Treasury bill and Standard & Poor's 500, computed by the Leuthold Group. High yields on T bills and low dividend yields argue for a market correction.<p>BEARISH: CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEBT. This aggregate measure of the country's private debt continues to increase ever faster from year-ago figures -- a likely harbinger of higher interest rates.<p>BEARISH: MONETARY ENVIRONMENT. This model from InvesTech measures how much money is available to flow into the stock market. Bearish since the first quarter, this summer it reached its lowest point since 1990.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>GURUS IN FLUX
Investment tip sheets experience reverses from agitation in the market.<p>By Jim Melloan<p>This year's market turmoil has carried over into the world of investment newsletters. Many of the newsletters with the best long-term records for their model portfolios have lagged recently, according to Hulbert Financial Digest, while some tip sheets that were throttled by the bull market are finally turning around. <p>The top two tip sheets for the first half of 1994, Futures Hotline/Mutual Fund Timer (up 50.1 percent) and P.Q. Wall Forecasts (up 26.8 percent), had both performed miserably, losing 29.7 over five years and 64.8 percent over three years, respectively. Meanwhile, OTC Insight rode the bull market to a 432 percent gain from '89 to '93; it was down 28.2 percent through June '94. <p>The message seems to be that a jumpy market rewards strategies that can short stocks. Three of the top five gurus were advising futures and options plays. "Futures traders love that kind of volatility," says Digest editor Mark Hulbert. "They don't do well during stagnant markets." This doesn't surprise Hulbert, who thinks it may be easier to beat the market on the short side than the long.<p>The first-half winners: Futures Hotline/Mutual Fund Timer, P.Q. Wall Forecasts, Short on Value (up 20.9 percent), The Timing Device (up 16.4 percent), and Stockmarket Cycles (up 9.4 percent). The first-half losers: Wall Street Generalist (down 48 percent), Medical Technology Stock Letter (down 41.5 percent), Granville Market Letter (down 37.5 percent), The Princeton Portfolios (down 28.9 percent), and OTC Insight (down 28.2 percent).<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>FIXED-INCOME INVESTING
Why the Bond Market is Breaking the Rules<p>By Gregory Millman<p>When the Federal Reserve raises short-term interest rates, as it began doing in February, long-term rates should come down. Why? Because such a move indicates the Fed is on the job fighting inflation -- a signal to investors that they can stop worrying about the value of their long-term investments.<p>Recently, however, investors haven't been following this script,. In the spring, when the Fed nudged up short-term interest rates, long-term rates surged and prices plunged.<p>An analysis at the Fed suggests a troubling explanation: Widespread use of derivatives may have made the bond market less likely to follow the rules of the past. If true, this is bad news for investors trying to gauge the direction of rates.<p>The Fed acknowledges that fears of inflation weren't entirely extinguished by its efforts to boost short-term rates earlier this year. But it also implicates investors who bought mortgage-backed securities -- often through mutual funds.<p>On the surface, mortgage-backed securities seem fairly innocuous. They are derivatives created by Wall Street firms by repackaging household mortgages. An investor buys the flow of interest and principal payments on a group of mortgages.<p>So how did these securities end up distorting bond prices? The Fed study notes that when interest rates began rising, homeowners stopped refinancing. This, in turn, meant that investors in mortgage-backed securities could count on a longer flow of interest and principal payments, which, in effect, turned these securities into longer-term instruments.<p>Money managers try to insure their investments against the risk created by rising interest rates. They do this by shorting bonds of a similar maturity. In this case, that meant that fund managers had to short longer-term Treasurys to balance the government-backed securities. That drove down the price of ten-year bonds and drove up long rates.<p>Patricia Mosser, the Fed economist who led the study, was surprised by the findings. If this one kind of derivative could have unexpectedly changed the shape of interest rates, what other surprises might lurk in the market? <p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>FED UP WITH THE FED
Wall Street ponders the meaning of the central bank's inconsistencies.<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Robert Brusca, economist at Nikko Securities, is disgusted with Alan Greenspan. "The markets above all want consistency," says Brusca. "[Greenspan] hasn't provided us with the consistency that we need."<p>Brusca points to the Fed chairman's congressional testimony of July 20, where he argued that a weaker dollar, shortages of truck drivers, and lengthening delivery schedules at some manufacturers were danger signs of possible inflation ahead. Just a week before, however, Greenspan had posited a very different view: that we were in the best of all possible worlds with slow, steady growth and low inflation. <p>The market was expecting more reassuring testimony from Greenspan in his July 20 testimony. No such luck. Greenspan opened the door for another rate hike, and the bond market headed south. Yields on the 30-year Treasury climbed to 7.54 percent, up from 7.46 the day before. That's almost back to where rates were when Clinton defeated Bush in the 1992 election.<p>The recent jump in rates has more to do with traders' fears of Fed confusion than it does with Greenspan's case that inflation is looming. The problem: The markets simply have no idea what benchmarks the Fed is currently using to set monetary policy. <p>Now that the Federal Reserve has decided the traditional measures used to manage inflation -- M1, M2, and M3, which measure the money in circulation -- are no longer reliable, its members seem to be watching everything and anything. One week it's truck drivers, the next it's housing starts. One minute Greenspan discounts the inflationary impact of a weak dollar; the next he worries publicly about it. <p>The folks at the Fed may indeed have a theory behind their choice of indicators and what they mean for the economy. But no one in the bond market is sure what it is. Meanwhile, Wall Street is left to wonder whether the Fed's inconsistencies are a sign of increasing disagreement among Federal Reserve Board members or just evidence of a weak chairman. Neither possibility sits comfortably with traders.<p><p>

Large-format TVs:  The best of the beasts.<p>By Edmund Cadigan<p>My wife and I didn't bother with a prenuptial agreement; but if we had, I have no doubt that aside from length of in-law visits, the major point of contention would have been a nugget of technology that I have long longed for -- the big-screen television. While other guys are sneaking trips to strip bars or renting hotel rooms by the hour, I can be found wandering electronics stores, fantasizing about an interminable late night with a really big screen.<p>When you're choosing a set in the big-screen arena -- which includes both direct-view and rear-projection TVs and tops out with monstrous home-theater setups -- you are initially faced with some relatively inexpensive choices. If, for instance, you are not interested in redecorating your entire home -- this would definitely be in my prenuptial agreement -- then you might choose from dozens of large-screen direct-view models. In essence, these are basically just very big TVs.<p>One of my favorites, the 35-inch Toshiba CF-35C40, has 800 lines of resolution, about twice as much as a regular set, and costs about $1,700. Although I'd never admit to my wife that I can be this easily satisfied, I also have my eye on a 27-inch <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a> KV-27V55 that has better sound than the bigger Toshiba and runs only about $900. Big-screen purists seem to think that big screen-ness doesn't begin until around the 31-inch mark, but for a lot of people 27 inches is enough. My friend James, who is more into sports than landscape-sweeping motion pictures, tells me that he doesn't want a home movie theater. "I like my TV to be a TV,'' he says, and he has a point.<p>Somewhere between these large tabletop TVs and the even larger home-theater models lie TVs like the Sony KPR-41EXR96, about $2,700. This particular Sony has a 41-inch screen, but it's not as bulky as most televisions with screens this size. It's one of the slimmest models out there, in fact, and its well-apportioned speakers are designed sleekly and slipped into the bottom of the console. (As you notch up the big-screen-TV wish list, you quickly realize that you want the size of the sound to match the size of the picture.) This Sony has a rear-projection screen, which means that the colors tend to be more subtle in comparison to the relatively rigid colors of a direct-view screen. Like all rear-projection TVs, this model's screen generally works best in a darkened room, a feature that takes you one step closer to that more drastic home-theater environment. Also, unlike some of the more inexpensive rear-projection screens I've seen, the picture on the Sony is crisp, tight, never muddy. I recently watched a laser disc of Top Gun on it. Rarely are films so lacking in narrative substance, and yet, given how those dogfights looked and sounded, if I hadn't had something of a life to live, I would have watched it again.<p>Next on the list of big-screen philosophies is the issue of nonconventional aspect ratios. When considering aspect ratios, you are considering the shape of your screen. The aspect ratio of the traditional television is 4:3, which gives you an almost square picture. Certain sets are now able to play elongated pictures filmed in the Cinemascope ratio of 16:9 without placing black bars across the top and bottom of the screen; it's more like being in a movie theater. And what might seem merely artsy is actually a way to bring back a huge percentage of the picture that was lost when it was hacked down for TV size. I recently saw the difference between the two ratios while watching Adam's Rib. In one scene, on 4:3, I could see only Katharine Hepburn; in 16:9, watching the same scene, I could see Spencer Tracy quietly making faces at the edge of the frame. In this category, RCA makes a 34-inch direct-projection model, the ProScan CinemaScreen, which costs about $5,000.<p>There is a caveat to wide-screen, however. The backlog of TV history is in 4:3, as is what you might watch tonight. As a result, Pioneer has a series of sets that have an aspect ratio of 16:10.7, which is a little closer to the current standard. Pioneer's thinking is that most people will be forced to zoom up their images from 4:3 to 16:9 (the sets do so on command), and the 16:10.7 ratio makes this leap with significantly less distortion. At the top of the Pioneer line, the rear-projection Pro-107 Elite has a 55-inch Cinema Wide screen; it costs $5,550, a price that includes something called a digital comb filter that gives it 830 lines of horizontal resolution (great for such a big screen). The rear-projection Pioneer SD-P5071, at about $2,473, is a cheaper version of 16:10.7 and, though I haven't lived with it, looks almost as good.<p>From here on up the price list, it probably pays to hire a home-theater designer. (For that matter, it may pay to wait two years for the initial launch of high-definition television). I saw a system in Video magazine last year that -- when you added up the Altec Lansing subwoofers, the center-channel speakers, the surround speakers, the Acoustic Research M6 auxiliary speakers, the Kenwood amplifier and tuner, and the $1,000 Mitsubishi VCR -- was priced at about $12,500. <p>A system like that is definitely home theater, and when I think about a system like that, I think about building a whole new room onto my house, which pains me, not to mention a whole new marriage, which pains me even more. Come to think of it, I love our little 13-inch Trinitron.<p><p>

 MARKET RADAR  
<p>
 Most of our indicators are now giving off neutral signals, meaning
the market may be headed for a period of stabilization. Last
month's scary lurch in the commodity index didn't repeat itself‹heartening
news for inflation worriers. Still, it's hard not to wonder about
an all-time low yield on the Standard & Poor's 500. Is it a sign
that stocks are overvalued, or just that more companies are hanging
on to their cash or reinvesting it in their business? As usual,
each of our market indicators gets a historical rating (10 is
most bullish) and an arrow (message for this month).  
<p>
 <->Composite Bellwether (5 this month/5 last month) This index,
computed by InvesTech, tracks bellwether utility and brokerage
stocks. It has risen consistently since December but is lagging
broader indexes because of underperforming utility stocks.  
<p>
 <->Put/Call Ratio (6/4) Based on the volume of equity put and
call options traded on the Chicago Board Options Exchange. This
contrarian indicator turns positive when traders are feeling
gloomy‹which they were even as the Dow and S&P indexes were achieving
new highs.  
<p>
 <->Advance/Decline Line (4/3) A moving average of the difference
between the number of rising and falling stocks, this shows whether
market moves are broadly or narrowly based. The measure has surged
but is still playing catch-up with the overall market. Computed
by InvesTech.  
<p>
 <->Advisory Sentiment (5/6) Investment advisors tend to be followers,
not leaders. Historically, they get most excited at market tops.
For the fifth straight month, more advisors have gotten optimistic.
It scares us a little more each time. Compiled by Investors Intelligence.<p>
<p>
 [down] Commodity Index (3/3) Supplied by Goldman, Sachs, this
measure of raw-material prices‹an inflation precursor‹edged up
only slightly this month after a 4 percent gain the month before.
For the year so far, the index is up a net of 1.8 percent, slightly
above most expectations.  
<p>
 <->Consumer and Corporate Debt (5/5) This aggregate measure
of private debt continues its upward drift, a bad trend driven
by increases in real estate lending. Only an economic slowdown
will keep it in our comfort zone. Provided by Safian Investment
Research.  
<p>
 [down] Yield Ratio (3/3) The ratio between yields of 90-day
Treasury bills and the S&P 500, computed by the Leuthold Group.
At about 2.6 percent, the stock market's dividend payout is now
the lowest since 1926. Only declining T-bill yields have stopped
this indicator from falling considerably.   
<p>
 [down] Monetary Environment (3/3) This model from InvesTech
measures how Federal Reserve Bank policy affects credit availability,
interest rates, and other factors that encourage money to flow
into the stock market. It remains stable in negative territory.<p>

By Monica Corcoran<p>If you've got high schoolers in the house, watch your mailbox this summer: Banks may be trying to tempt them into starting a credit card account. This growing practice is a way for card issuers to get a jump on all the offers students receive in college. But it's condemned by consumer advocates because many teens just can't handle credit. "We're seeing more young people getting into debt at an early age -- and it's just because the credit card industry is desperate for new customers," says Ken McEldowney, executive director of Consumer Action.<p>"I can't think of one good reason why a high school kid needs a credit card," says Ruth Susswein, executive director of Bankcard Holders of America, an industry watchdog agency. But banks are pitching them nonetheless, buying mailing lists from companies such as American Student List of New York, which can provide statistics on 1.7 million college-bound high school seniors.<p>Most card issuers admit the practice but say it's a tiny part of their business. McEldowney says it's fairly widespread. Either way, here are some tips for avoiding disaster when your teen pesters you for plastic:<p>-> Educate. Use your own bills as teaching tools. Note that interest may start piling up as soon as a purchase is made; only 30 percent of college kids know this basic fact.<p>-> Don't cosign on a new card for your child -- add a second card to your own account. Get the bill sent to you, and agree on a payment plan.<p>-> Talk to your card issuer about setting the credit limit on your child's card much lower than on your primary card.<p>-> If you must unleash your child by cosigning, look into a "secured" card backed by the child's own bank account.<p>-> Consider a Visa or MasterCard debit card as an alternative. They're accepted most places but deduct money directly from a checking account. The party's over when the money's gone.<p><p>

Worth magazine/Need to Know<p>FUNDS MOVE INTO REAL ESTATE<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>As real estate continues its upswing, real estate equity mutual funds are trying to lure new players into gambling on the market. In April, both Columbia and Crabbe Huson introduced such funds, pushing the total to more than a dozen. Fully half these funds are newcomers, and at least three more await approval from the Securities and Exchange Commission.<p>Investors clearly are being tempted. Two years ago, only six real estate funds existed -- and none had $100 million in assets. By the end of the 1994 first quarter, however, total assets for the group topped $1.3 billion. Is it time to join the stampede? Perhaps. Robert Tracinski, an analyst at Morningstar, the mutual fund-watching company, praises the liquidity and diversification offered by real estate funds -- advantages that are harder to find in more traditional real estate plays.<p>Most real estate funds hold a portfolio of shares in real estate investment trusts, companies that invest in property or mortgages. This market has been booming: REITs raised more than $8.6 billion in public offerings during 1993, just 17 percent less than the total raised during all 31 previous years REITs had been around. "These are longstanding, reputable companies that are going public," says Barry Vinocur, editor in chief of Realty Stock Review newsletter. And they've been performing well. REITs offered an average 3 percent return for the year through April. That compares to a 4.2 percent  drop for the Standard & Poor's 500.<p>But not all real estate funds are created equal. <a name="FUND:CSRSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CSRSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cohen & Steers Realty</b></a> returned 6.8 percent for the year through April, for example, but DFA Group's fund was down 4.2 percent, according to Lipper Analytical Services. Such spotty results are typical in the real estate market, which fluctuates widely depending on region and type of property. When deciding on a fund, analysts say, it's smart to look beyond current yields for a manager with lots of experience in this capricious area.<p><p>

						<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Jim Williams doesn't make his living as a stock picker, but he sells advice to those who do. For nearly 30 years his firm, Williams Inference Service, has looked for long-term cultural trends that are powerful enough to move markets. Whenever he spots such a trend, Williams tries to identify the companies that will be affected -- for better and for worse.<p>Take the color black: Williams noted late last year that people are embracing all things black, from high-fashion clothes to sports merchandise. He figures it's a symbol of self-denial and says we're headed for a decline in consumer spending. That's bad news for retailers like <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears Roebuck</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:LTD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11471"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>The Limited</b></a>, Williams predicts.<p>Spotting trends is a broad-brush approach that's catching on at some brokerage houses, in part because such "themes" make stock picks easier to explain to customers. Wall Street's Kidder Peabody, for example, now has a five-person team busily reading cultural tea leaves.<p>Of course, several trends can be underway at the same time. Lately Williams has been focusing on what he calls a "meaning void." Americans are trying to combat the sense that their lives lack purpose, he says. He believes this helps explain the rise of hangouts such as microbrewery pubs, coffee bars, cafe bookstores, and other "watering holes" where people can find company and support.<p>What's good for the soul can also be good business. Here are a few stocks Williams thinks may benefit as people search for meaning.<p><a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b> (AMER): Like pubs and cafes, electronic chat services allow users to reach out and make contact with others.<p><a name="NYSE:HRB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10689"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>H&R Block</b></a> (HRB): Sure, helping people get tax refunds is meaningful. But Williams likes the company mostly because it has another on-line service, CompuServe, where people can come together.<p><a name="NYSE:LLY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10509"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Eli Lilly</b></a> (LLY): With the loss of meaning often comes depression. And these days depression means Prozac, the blockbuster drug made by Eli Lilly.<p><a name="NASD:TNEL"></a><b>Thomas Nelson</b> (TNEL): Those who don't turn to medicine may fill their void with religion. Nashville-based Thomas Nelson is a huge publisher of Bibles and other inspirational literature.<p><p>

						<p>By Manjeet Kripalani<p>The guru who invented new financial products such as air-pollution futures, catastrophe-insurance futures, and Treasury-bond futures is looking overseas for his next innovation - to India, in fact, where U.S. mutual funds and celebrated investors such as George Soros are already playing.<p>What's Richard Sandor's spin on the subcontinent? Monsoon futures, a new way to bet on India's often devastating weather patterns. Not a bad idea: India's $175 billion economy depends heavily on the June-to-August rainy season, and agricultural futures are at best a once-removed way to play the weather.<p>The 52-year-old former finance professor is short on specifics - "proprietary at this point" - but says the new product will hedge against the unpredictability of the monsoon. To play all possible outcomes, he describes a sketchy combination of flood-insurance futures and crop insurance.<p>If the rainfall is torrential, Sandor's product would be hurt by flood-damage claims but would benefit from good harvests. If the monsoon is mild, crops would do badly but flood insurance should be profitable. Investors likely would buy monsoon futures as a supplement to other Indian investments. Sandor won't say when his new product may be rolled out, but it won't be in time to play the 1994 monsoon.<p>Sandor has been interested in India since the 1960s, but his latest passion was triggered two years ago while he was vacationing there. At the time, he had been preparing a United Nations report on using financial markets to improve the environment. Traveling by road to see the Taj Mahal, he was impressed by two things: "The Taj was unbelievable, but so was the traffic and pollution. I saw the opportunity."<p>Indeed, Sandor thinks India may ultimately be a good market for his air-pollution futures. But for now he says he's focusing on the monsoon. If he succeeds, it'll mark a comeback of sorts. Although he gained lasting fame at the Chicago Board of Trade as the inventor of the T-bond future - now a $50 billion market - Sandor hasn't been at the forefront of the financial markets recently. His effort to create a derivatives group at Kidder, Peabody, for example, ended in failure after two years.<p>Shortly after leaving Kidder last year, Sandor started a small New York -  based firm, Centre Financial Products, an affiliate of the giant Zurich Insurance Group. Centre is a likely vehicle to launch the new monsoon futures, but Sandor says he'll also consider doing it through the Commodities Board of Trade.<p><p><p>

By Kevin Caliendo<p>In recent years, workers at several major companies have sued their employers for failing to run 401(k) retirement plans properly. Settlements in some cases - <a name="NYSE:HON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10742"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Honeywell</b></a> and CenTrust Savings Bank, for example - have run into the millions of dollars.<p>But in recent months, the issue of bad 401(k) management has heated up even more. New federal guidelines make it clear that lots of companies aren't acting appropriately - by limiting investment choices, for example, or not keeping employees informed. One national survey showed that only 52 percent of companies comply with the new rules, which aren't mandatory but will become an industry standard in 1995.<p>It isn't just the big boys that are falling down: Smaller companies may be even riper for complaints because they don't have enough resources to meet the new standard. "Employees must be vigilant," says Tom Schlossberg, president of Diversified Investment Advisors, a big retirement-investment firm.<p>Meanwhile, although the federal guidelines were designed to cut down on lawsuits from employees in 401(k) plans, they may have the opposite effect.<p>The regulations, dubbed 404(c) standards after the section of a law that established them, essentially spell out the steps a company should take if it doesn't want to be sued for bad management of a 401(k) plan. But some recommendations are vaguely worded, allowing for arguments over whether they've been met. And compliance requires lots of tedious work, which employers will inevitably shirk on occasion.<p>"I don't think anyone really understands all the little subtleties of 404(c)," says Michael F. Seidenburg, a principal with William M. Mercer, a consulting firm.<p>As a result, Seidenburg and other experts say 404(c) should actually make lawsuits easier, by establishing a code of conduct that's well accepted but hard to meet.<p>"No one is going to sue if he's getting a good return," says Howard Pianko, chairman of employee benefits at Epstein Becker & Green, a law firm. "But if one guy is getting 5 percent and his buddy is getting 15 percent, that first guy is going to want to know why he isn't in his buddy's fund." Indeed, the first man could easily claim he hadn't been educated about the other fund - and sue his company for the difference in returns.<p>Of course, suing your employer is probably a last resort, even if it runs a truly lousy 401(k). But the 404(c) standards give all employees a good look at the kind of service they should be getting:<p>-> A 401(k) plan should offer at least three investment options, each with a different level of risk.<p>-> A company-stock purchase plan doesn't qualify as one of the recommended three options.<p>-> Prospectuses must be handed out, where available.<p>-> Employers must educate employees on investing principles, as well as on the funds they offer. A stack of pamphlets in the office almost certainly isn't enough.<p>-> Employers must reeducate employees if conditions change.<p>-> Employees should be allowed to adjust their mix of 401(k) investments at least quarterly - and at any time during a quarter, not only on a specified day.<p><p><p>

These credit-card alternatives keep you in control of debt, but shop around for the best plan<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>Debit cards, which deduct purchases directly from users' checking accounts, may finally be taking off. Transactions have more than doubled in the past three years, to nearly 675 million in 1993. Even some New York prostitutes now accept debit-card payments.<p>Time to catch the wave? Sure, if you love the ease of credit cards but worry about debt getting out of control. When you use a debit card, you're spending money you already have--not borrowing, as with credit cards.<p>Debit cards come in two flavors, on-line and off-line. The difference is how fast payments are deducted from your checking account: An on-line card takes it out instantaneously, just like spending cash. An off-line card is really another sort of check, with a float period of two to five days.<p>Because they don't depend on high technology, off-line debit cards are accepted in far more locations. In fact, the Visa and MasterCard versions are taken wherever those credit cards are accepted, since they're processed the same way by merchants. This makes off-line cards a nifty alternative to checks, which are awkward to carry and cause hassles anyway.<p>An on-line debit card is exactly like an ATM card, but it's used to make purchases. In fact, many big-city cash cards now function as on-line debit cards too. The cost for a transaction usually equals the fee for using a cash machine, if any. The downside of on-line cards is that they require merchants to link to a computer that knows how much money each customer has. Because of this, the cards aren't yet widespread--though they're now accepted by many supermarkets, gas stations, and fast-food joints.<p>If you already have a cash card that works as a debit card in local stores, do you need an additional on-line debit card? Only if you travel much: Unlike local cash cards, the Visa or MasterCard on-line cards are accepted nationwide and should also be accepted in some foreign locations by the end of the year.<p>So, on-line or off-line? Or no debit card at all? The key points to consider:<p>-> What are you trying to replace? An on-line card is better than cash but isn't accepted many places yet. An off-line card is handier than a checkbook and accepted pretty widely. Neither performs as a credit card, which allows borrowing and can have a far longer float than an off-line debit card.<p>-> Fees. Few banks charge more than 25 cents per transaction for debit cards, and annual fees, if any, rarely top $24. If you plan to use a debit card a lot, opt for an issuer with a flat annual fee. And shop around: Deals vary.<p>-> Do your favorite merchants charge extra for debit transactions? Amazingly, some merchants do, resulting in a doubled fee that makes credit-card interest rates look good. The only way to find out is by asking.<p>-> Liability. As with credit cards, if you report a missing card within two days, you'll be out a maximum of $50. But if you wait any longer, you could be forced to pay up to $500. And after 60 days, you might even have to absorb a thief's entire spending spree.<p><p><p>

						<p>Back in March, the "Full Disclosure" column reported on a shadowy but increasingly popular practice by which U.S. companies sell shares of their stocks to overseas investors at discounts of 30 - 40 percent of what American investors pay. Unfair as the tactic is to U.S. investors, it is technically legal, because Securities and Exchange Commission rules on sales of shares to foreigners are less rigorous than the laws that apply in the U.S. The rules governing these types of foreign stock transactions are known as Regulation S. Under these rules, foreign buyers of discounted shares are not supposed to sell their holdings for 40 days and are not supposed to dump them back into U.S. markets. <p>But foreign investors have been doing just that, and American investors are being put at a great disadvantage. Hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised through these offerings, yet few U.S. investors know they may be paying big premiums to buy shares from canny Reg. S investors. <p>Our warning about the uneven Reg. S playing field had an effect in Washington. The March 15 issue of The SEC Today, a publication that summarizes SEC discussions and activities, reported that the commission staff is "reviewing the use of the (Reg. S) rule." <p>According to SEC deputy director Elisse Walter, "The staff will look closely at such offerings where the market for the securities has been solely in the U.S. but the company makes a substantial placement, purported abroad, at a significant discount of 20 percent to 40 percent off the market price." She says that the commission will revisit Reg. S if it is being abused and that it cannot be used to evade registration requirements. William McLucas, SEC enforcement director, says his staff will look at the deals "with a fairly skeptical eye." <p>Couldn't have said it better ourselves.<p><p><p>

						<p>By Ilyce R. Glink<p>The recent hike in interest rates is pushing reluctant home buyers off the fence: After an upswing in buying at the end of 1993, followed by a weather-damped first quarter, 1994 is shaping up better than any other real estate market in recent memory.<p>The prod is the near certainty of future rises. Even former optimists such as David Lereah, chief economist for the powerful Mortgage Bankers Association, have changed their view. After predicting last year that 30-year fixed rates would hold the line at about 7.5 percent, Lereah now believes rates will top 8 percent by year end--and may not level off until mid-1995. Still, despite the prospect of higher mortgage rates, buyers shouldn't get panicked. It's always a mistake to buy a house on national stats: Real estate is local, and many markets have room to fall yet.<p>Assess the momentum in your market, and try to remember that a house is mostly a place to live. Rising rates won't cost much if you're waiting for just the right place. On a fixed-rate 30-year loan of $100,000, the difference between 7.5 percent and 8 percent is only $35 a month.<p><p>

						<p>By Deborah Pont<p>Got a great discount voucher for one airline, but a fat frequent-flier account at another carrier? It's not such an agonizing choice: When it comes to airline discounts, you can often have it both ways.<p>Few people know it, but for competitive reasons many carriers accept coupons issued by their rivals. And with airlines now offering a flood of lucrative promotions through supermarkets, credit cards, and the like, this knowledge is more valuable than ever.<p>The offers can be substantial and easy to get. For example, <a name="NYSE:DAL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10448"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Delta</b></a> recently gave a $100 discount to customers who collected a mere $100 worth of receipts from the Stop & Shop supermarket. You prefer to fly on USAir? No problem--that carrier accepted Delta's voucher. United currently offers up to $50 off tickets for customers of Midwest Rocky Mountain Bank. You like American better? Again, no problem.<p>Transferring discounts takes a little work. For one thing, no reservation agent will suggest using another airline's promotion. But most carriers keep a database with details on all the rival offers they've decided to match. The key here: Always ask.<p>Suppose your coupon isn't in the database of your preferred airline? Well, that doesn't mean the carrier won't accept it, says a USAir spokeswoman: With so many discounts available nationwide, the airline just may not know about the offer. Her suggestion: Call the carrier's marketing department and ask it to add your deal to the approved list. That's how USAir hears about many of its rivals' offers, she says.<p>
A few more tips:
--Note the code number that accompanies any offer you want matched. That's how airlines keep track of discounts on their databases.
--Be aware of all the restrictions on your offer; airlines will match most of these if they decide to match the discount.
--Take note of some not-so-obvious advantages of transferring coupons. Some airlines may fly direct to a destination, for example, while the coupon issuer requires a connection. Some airlines might honor a MasterCard payment, while the coupon issuer requires <a name="NYSE:AXP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10085"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Express</b></a>.
--Keep track of which airlines are better about matching rivals' offers; it may be worth changing your preferred carrier. United, for example, has a reputation for being accommodating.<p><p><p>

						<p>By Carla Koehl<p>In the municipal-bond market, some cities are more fashionable than others as a destination for investors<p>IN:
Los Angeles; Charlotte, North Carolina
Don't let January's tremors or last year's debt downgrade fool you: Los Angeles isn't a complete basket case. A resilient economy and declining reliance on defense make it a chic (if risky) muni bond buy. Charlotte's bonds are already triple-A rated, but the city is bolstering its hot reputation by building a convention center and emerging as a banking-industry powerhouse.<p>OUT: 
Houston; Portland, Oregon
Despite an expanding economy and strength in the health-care industry, Houston's not home free yet: Its bondholders are still unconvinced of the merit of a recent debt restructuring. Meanwhile, despite a triple-A debt rating, Portland could have difficulties if its revenue is hurt by new state-imposed limits on property tax.<p><p>

						<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>Glance a moment at those newspaper charts that show the minute-to-minute movements of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. These days, there's often a big upswing in the index right before the stock market closes--a fact that was confirmed recently in a study by Robert Exler, a trader in Pittsford, New York.<p>According to Exler, moves in the last ten minutes of trading tallied a net gain equal to 89 percent of the Dow's entire gain during his seven-month study. "From 3:50 p.m. on, it's like clockwork," he says. Market watchers say the last-minute gains have been pronounced lately and agree they're caused by computer-controlled stock buying and large institutional traders. But is there any lesson for individual investors?<p>Well, investors who have already decided to sell a stock--especially a stock that's a component of the Dow--should think about instructing their brokers to make the trade "at the close." This doesn't guarantee a sale at the exact closing price, but "unless there's a market crash and the system is shut down, the trade will almost always be executed during the last few minutes," says Michael Grenon, a broker at PaineWebber.<p>Of course, big downdrafts in share prices sometimes happen at the end of the day, too, and could make this strategy a loser. But in the current bull market there have been more upswings than drops. For now, the odds seem to favor late-afternoon sellers. Exler thinks this may reverse whenever the market turns: Then, he says, late-day buyers may have an edge.<p>One caveat, echoed by market vets: Only trade "at the close" if you're going to trade anyway. The aim, says Laszlo Birinyi of Birinyi Associates, should be to get a better price or a better value--not to second-guess the big traders.<p><p><p>

						<p>By Kevin Caliendo<p>With the collapse of castro's Cuba apparently near and pressure growing for the U.S. to drop restrictions on investing in Vietnam, investors face new options as timely as the headlines.
Already, several Vietnam funds are poised to accept American investors whenever the embargo is lifted. And a Cuba fund is promoting itself in the U.S., even though it can't make direct investments in Cuba.<p>Is it time to think about betting on soon-to-be-former foes? Most observers say the bigger Vietnam is also the better prospect, with a stabilizing economy and good trade potential. Despite Cuba's onetime status as a go-go U.S. satellite, its post-Castro future is still far from certain.<p>But even with all restrictions lifted, neither country will rival the hottest foreign markets anytime soon. "Investors should realize that [Vietnam and Cuba] are not Mexico," says Mark Ahern, who manages the International Investment Group at SEI, a financial-services company in Wayne, Pennsylvania. "After the hoopla is over and markets are in place, investors can make intelligent decisions. These first funds, however, have nothing to invest in."<p>So far, that's almost literally true: All four existing Vietnam funds are almost totally in cash because virtually any investment in Vietnam amounts to outright speculation. Prospects may brighten when a stock market emerges as planned.<p>Cuba isn't even open to capitalist-style investing yet. But the country is tantalizing to investment types who remember it as a big U.S. trading partner before the 1959 revolution. Thomas J. Herzfeld & Co. in Miami, which manages the new Cuba-oriented Carribean Basin Fund, is buying into U.S. companies it thinks will prosper when the embargo is lifted--particularly in construction and transportation. It also helps fund expatriate Cuban businesspeople who plan to return when Castro is out of power.<p>Another risky but legal play is to buy pre-Castro Cuban bonds, which might be honored by a new government. A series of 1937 bonds has been in default since it came due in 1977. As Castro looks more vulnerable, trading in the bonds has warmed up on the New York Stock Exchange. But they still go for less than 50 percent of face value.<p><p>

						<p>By Dean Robinson<p>Airlines are battling to woo customers by offering frequent-flier miles for everything from hotel stays to flower purchases. This year the fight may expand to another forum--investing.<p>So far, only American Airlines has made the link by offering one frequent-flier mile for every $10 invested in one of three money market funds. But other carriers, currently noncommittal, may follow. InsideFlyer, a publication that tracks the frequent-flier market, says miles for money should be catching fire by the end of 1994.<p>American's plan performs respectably enough: Last year, its AAdvantage Money Market Fund ranked 15th of more than 200 funds in its class, according to Lipper Analytical Services. But mileage-conscious investors won't be happy until competition boosts the range of investment options and number of miles offered. Says Randy Petersen, editor of InsideFlyer, "This will be a win-win-win situation--for airlines, funds, and individuals." <p>American's funds, which are managed by an arm of parent AMR, require an investment of $10,000, a lot for a low-return vehicle. And at current rates, it takes a huge investment (or a long time) to earn free flights. Michael Lipper of Lipper Analytical thinks other frequent-flier tie-ins may emerge but raises some unresolved questions--whether the miles are taxable, for instance.<p>American recently pushed its funds by offering double miles. But investors may want to watch instead for the airline's competitors, which generally don't have parents with investment services, to hook up with major banks or mutual fund companies. Within two or three years, says Petersen, frequent-flier deals for investing will be as common as they are now for credit cards or long-distance calls.<p><p>

You can trade features without eating any losses - if you have an ear for fashionable grain.<p>Soft red winter wheat
Ready to be harvested at a tasty price on the Chicago Board of Trade this month. Despite a potentially soggy spring, July futures on this Midwestern wheat should be a great deal compared with competing strains, which haven't produced a decent harvest in two years. A good buy at $3.10 a bushel, says Patrick O'Connell, an analyst at Chicago's Refco Group.<p>Hard red winter and spring wheat
The wheat that makes bread and pasta is likely to trade at ridiculous premiums over the next few months on the Minneapolis and Kansas City commodities exchanges. Even blending last year's disastrous grains with potentially healthier 1994 crops won't push prices below $3.25 a bushel--and analysts say investors shouldn't buy any higher than that.<p><p>

						 <p>By Deborah Pont<p>While most interest rates dally in the single digits, credit cards still carry an average annual rate of 17 percent. And though many issuers are waiving annual fees or offering incentives, those high rates still hurt. Small wonder that consumers are snapping up a new breed of bank cards with rates as low as 6 percent from institutions such as Wachovia, Citibank, and Signet.<p>But unlike the last card rush--toward no-fee plastic such as <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>'s Universal Card--this new category has hefty entry requirements. Because they can't afford bad credit risks, low-interest cards accept only 20 percent of applicants, making them twice as picky as their high-rate brethren. Even some card users with an unblemished record from a credit bureau such as Equifax may get shut out. And those who are approved may get a measlier credit line than they expect (often less than $1,000), limited services, or a low interest rate that's good only for the first year or two.<p>Still, low-rate cards can save lots for anyone with revolving debt. How to qualify:<p>--Cut your debt-to-income ratio, a key figure calculated by low-rate card issuers. Add your monthly credit-card and housing costs. If the sum is 45 percent or more of your pretax income, you probably won't get approved--so throttle back on spending for a while. High-interest card issuers, by contrast, may accept ratios as high as 75 percent.<p>--Consolidate your credit. Don't keep more than four credit-card accounts active at a time. And if you opened more than two new accounts in the last six months or so, you're unlikely to get a low-rate card. <p>--Get well below the credit limits of your other cards--and always pay at least the minimum payment on time. Don't use more than 80 percent of any revolving credit line.<p>--Apply to an easy mark. According to Gerri Detweiler, executive director of Bankcard Holders of America, national issuers such as Wachovia, Signet, and AFBA Industrial Bank may accept people who have been rejected by other low-rate cards.<p>--Haggle. If you're rejected, it's likely the work of a computer. Get a human on the line. Many credit managers are willing to listen to arguments, and they must tell you why you were rejected. It may be something that's easily fixed, such as having one credit card too many.

 <p>Beware of so-called 19c3 trading. The strategy, most recently being touted by Smith Barney Shearson, steers investors' trades away from the cost-effective New York Stock Exchange--and sends them to more expensive arenas.<p>The term 19c3 comes from a rule that allows certain NYSE stocks to be traded over-the-counter. There's little reason to do this, however: The Big Board's transaction costs are among the lowest around. What's more, the NYSE often pairs buyers and sellers who specify a share price other than the market's quoted price, allowing better deals. Except for Smith Barney, 19c3 trading is a relative rarity on Wall Street. Dean Witter uses it to some degree, for example, but <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> apparently quit some time ago.<p>Internal Smith Barney documents claim the practice results in better executions for customers. That's unlikely, since Smith Barney pays brokers an incentive to use the company's 19c3 desk, which may in turn increase costs by tapping an outside firm to execute orders. That's not disclosed to customers. Nor do many customers know that their NYSE-stock trades may not be made on the NYSE--a virtual guarantee that they'll pay "ask" price rather than getting a shot at the lower "bid."<p>So why is Smith Barney pushing it? Non-Big Board trades carry a higher markup and generate more revenue for the firm, but Smith Barney's passion is mostly a holdover from its acquisition of Shearson, a big believer in 19c3.<p>It's hard to prove that 19c3 trading is always more expensive. But those Smith Barney incentives must come from somewhere and --one way or another--it's likely from the customer's hide. How to avoid 19c3? Always specify that NYSE trades must be executed on the NYSE. If you don't get such a promise, yank your account.

						 <p>By Emanuel Howard<p>With long-distance phone companies ever more desperate to boost market share, smart customers can make an easy buck. The trick is being willing to switch carriers.<p>For many people, the long-distance wars are intimidating: Cheap call plans are fiendishly complex, and it often seems easier to stick with a known quantity. That's a mistake. These days, all three major carriers offer big incentives to switch--<a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>, for example, sends some callers checks for as much as $100. Cashing AT&T's check authorizes a switch to its long-distance service.<p>Switching again when <a name="NASD:MCIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13996"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MCI</b></a> or <a name="NYSE:FON"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11560"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sprint</b></a> dangles a deal--usually $30 to $50 worth of free calls--boosts the return of this strategy. And AT&T has been known to send a second check to regain deserters.<p>Switching is seamless, with no extra digits to dial. AT&T and MCI even pay the switching fee of five to eight dollars. And all three carriers offer plans that are broadly comparable, so a well-planned switch won't make much difference--especially if it's brief.<p>In the long term, consumers still should find a plan that matches their calling patterns. Sprint favors people who call one number a lot, for example; MCI favors calls to other MCI customers. But in the short term, switching can make a big dent in long-distance bills. And remember, it's reversible, sometimes for more money.<p>Naturally, the carriers hate service switchers. For some customers, that could mean the sweetest deal yet: In a little-publicized move, MCI has started cashing AT&T's incentive checks so customers won't switch. For MCI users, that's free money.  <p> <p><p>

Ignore the doubters. Microsoft is fine-tuning new Windows software that has gained good early reviews and should cement the company's dominant position when the product is released sometime in 1994. Meanwhile, Cyrix's M1 chip mimics the ballyhooed Pentium design of investors' darling Intel--but works better. Both companies will ride the crest of the next technology wave.<p>OUT: <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> and <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a>
"Intel is cruising for a bruising," says computer gossip columnist Robert X. Cringely. The company's Pentium chip is too hot--and that means temperature, not performance. (Intel says it's working on it.) Meanwhile, Apple's rising sales come mostly from repeat customers: Sales of application software peaked two years ago. For both companies, the glory days may be past.  <p> <p><p>

						<p>By Dean Robinson<p>for high-income earners, the budget passed in August didn't just increase taxes for 1994--it applied the hike all the way back to the start of 1993. The result: Come April 15, rich folks may find that a hefty extra payment is due.<p>Now is the time to deal with this. The retroactive tax can be paid in equal chunks over the next three Aprils. Everyone should take this option: In effect, it's an interest-free loan from the Internal Revenue Service. To raise the yield of the "loan" while ensuring you don't get caught short, tax planners recommend setting aside money now for all the extra tax. Hand over a third in April and put the rest somewhere safe, such as CDs that mature in time for the other two payments.<p>There are a few caveats. If you'll be subject to the alternative minimum tax, you can't pay in installments: Start putting away money now. Also, if you're likely to file an extension, do at least enough planning to make sure you overpay the first installment. If you undershoot by too much, the entire amount comes due.<p>Finally, remember the psychological aspect. Financial planner Jack Blankinship says he's advising clients to pay in three chunks but will write only one check himself. "To hell with it," he says. "I'll pull the bandage off quickly. I just don't want to deal with it."<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By Andrew Gluck<p>They missed the bull run of the last three years, and their predictions of economic Armageddon have been wrong. But the trio of brainy money managers known as Comstock Partners remain locked in their bear cage.<p>Lately the pessimism has been paying off. Comstock's $540 million Strategy Fund was up 12.6 percent in the first nine months of 1993, for example--five points better than the showing of the Standard & Poor's 500.<p>"We think the wind is beginning to blow our way," says Stanley Salvigsen, Comstock's chairman. Perhaps the nation's most articulate bears, Comstock's principals think a crisis will eventually trigger a 40 percent drop in stock prices.<p>Among their current plays:<p><a name="NYSE:TGT"></a><b>Tenneco</b> (TGT). The company wants to deliver more value to shareholders. Salvigsen thinks it'll succeed by unloading a farm-equipment unit.<p><a name="NYSE:SFX"></a><b>Santa Fe Pacific</b> (SFX). Santa Fe plans to sell off its gold-mining division, and Salvigsen says the price it'll fetch isn't yet reflected in the company's shares.<p>Gold stocks.

						<p>By Emanuel Howard<p>In an effort to prop up credit-card profits, banks are finding new ways to wring extra interest from customers without raising rates. The latest ruse:18 of the 25 biggest card issuers--including, most recently, Mellon Bank and BankAmerica--now backdate interest charges to the moment a purchase was made. Previously, interest was charged starting when the card issuer was notified of a sale, usually two or three days later.<p>The change doesn't matter much if you're among the 29 percent of credit-card users who pay their full balance every month. But if you're less dutiful, it's important to know that the meter is now ticking from the moment you reach for your wallet.<p>For an average card user who spends $200 a month, the new policy adds $1 to each bill, according to Cardholder Management Services, a consumer group. That's probably not enough to force you to switch cards, but it's certainly annoying.<p>By backdating interest, card issuers can earn money on your debt even before they take possession of it. Here's how it works:When you buy something on credit, the store gets reimbursed by its own bank. Then the store's bank gets paid by the card's issuer. The process takes an average of 2.5 days--and the card issuer doesn't have an out-of-pocket expense until the very end.<p>Card issuers argue that once they've authorized a sale, they've guaranteed that debt, so they're entitled to interest from the time of the transaction. But such moves have prompted ire on Capitol Hill. Congressman Charles Schumer is sponsoring a bill that would require issuers to make little-noticed policy changes far more obvious. "If we can raise consumer awareness about the real costs, it will be more effective than regulating rates and charges,"says Randolph Harrison, a legislative aide at Schumer's office. "Credit-card companies are very creative at undermining regulations." <p><p><p>

						<p>By Monica Corcoran<p>If you want to take advantage of Medicaid--for yourself or for a parent--better get moving. New rules make it harder to finagle the help that can be a key to affording long-term medical care, and President Clinton's health-care plan may prompt further changes by 1995. One thing hasn't changed so far, however:Those who plan ahead can still qualify for government aid while protecting their nest eggs.<p>Medicaid was designed to help people with minimal assets. But the program can be a money saver even for wealthy folks. To get coverage, claimants give their assets away, usually to family members who'll allow use of them. The government frowns on such maneuvers, so officials check to see if applicants have met the low-asset rule throughout a "look back" period. If you transferred property recently, you can't get benefits.<p>Until August, the government looked back 30 months. Now it's 36 months. Setting up a trust fund to transfer assets is also tougher: The look-back period for this rich person's trick has doubled to five years, and some trusts don't protect assets anymore. Another new rule means your house can be seized if you don't transfer it properly.<p>Even attorneys find this stuff confusing; get lots of advice. But in general, these Medicaid planning tools should still work:<p>- Gifts to family members.<p>- Irrevocable trusts.<p>- Family limited partnerships.<p><p>

The true bargains convincingly combined two themes --efficient operations and financial strength:<p><a name="NYSE:BBY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10209"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Best Buy</b></a> (BBY), an electronics discounter based in Minneapolis, is poised for a profit breakout as it takes advantage of the troubles of other retailers.

The company, which sells software and video games, is riding an explosive market:It projects industry-wide sales of 70 million high-end video-game cartridges in 1993, up from 30 million in 1992.<p><a name="NASD:QRSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16312"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quickresponse Services</b></a> (QRSI) is a good way to play the retail industry's drive for efficiency. Its database and electronic "highway"allow retailers and suppliers to exchange orders, invoices, and product information.

						 <p>By Andrew Feinberg<p>Conventional wisdom says prepaying your mortgage is smart: Owning a home free and clear is a true status symbol for the 1990s.<p>But while prepayment can be shrewd for some, the strategy is no longer a sure thing. With fixed mortgage rates hovering around 7 percent, there are probably better things to do with your money.<p>However tempting it seems, don't focus on lopping years from your payment schedule. The key fact is this:When you prepay a fixed-rate mortgage, your pretax return is always equal to the mortgage rate.<p>That's good and bad. On one hand, your 7 percent return is guaranteed. On the other, 7 percent won't get you very far.<p>Some people should prepay, mainly those who have already funded most of their financial goals. And anyone who's risk averse may appreciate the psychic reward of paying off a mortgage--no small consideration in uncertain economic times.<p>But you can't take a psychic reward to the bank. Here are five things to do before prepaying your fixed-rate mortgage:<p>*  Pay off other debts. They're usually more expensive than mortgages and probably aren' tax deductible.
*  Create and fund a retirement plan.
*  Create and fund a college-tuition savings plan.
*  Build up some liquid reserves (but don't go overboard).
*  Buy disability insurance.<p> <p><p>

Investing has fashions, just like any other industry. Don't get caught in last year's style; check out hwt the well-dressed portfolio is wearing.<p>By Carla Koehl<p>IN:
A surefire trend alert:The mutual fund mavens at Morningstar expect to add a new fund category--telecommunications--to the 23 groupings they track. At least seven funds fit the telecom mold, and all but one are performing well. Morningstar editor John Rekenthaler guesses another five or six will launch soon.<p>OUT:
following 1993's automotive rally, the smart dollars are getting out of Detroit. "Auto stocks have gone about as far as they can go," says Hugh Johnson of First Albany. Among the warning signals:Weak consumer confidence and a late-stage bull market, when car stocks traditionally falter.<p> <p><p><p>

						 <p>In a few months, we'll know whether the rich will slam the U.S. economy into reverse.<p>President Clinton's economists have already knocked a quarter point off their anemic forecast of 2.5 to 3 percent growth for 1994. But that tiny notch was likely just the first of many downward revisions prompted by the budget bill.<p>One reason: Although the tax increases were widely expected, few wealthy people have increased their withholding or made higher estimated-tax payments. That means 1994 will be unusually tough for the upper-bracket set. The rich will face higher withholding, 1993's retroactive taxes, a 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax, and a possible health-care levy.<p>Such burdens may stall economic growth:The top 5 percent of taxpayers account for more than a quarter of all taxable income. If they slice spending to pay their extra tax, rather than dipping into savings, the effects will be felt throughout the economy.<p>Economists are split about whether this will happen. Allen Sinai of Economic Advisors Inc. has trimmed his estimates but isn't panicking. Believing the rich won't cut back much, he predicts the economy will eke out 2 percent growth for three years.<p>Others are far less sanguine. "I call [the budget] the recession act of 1994," says Lacy Hunt of HSBC Holdings, the banking giant. Hunt notes that many high earners are actually small businesses, which won't hesitate to cut costs. He looks for two quarters of decline at the end of next year--a real-life recession.<p>Tax advisors, who know high earners best, are closer to Hunt's view. William Clapp of Bessemer Trust believes his clients will cut back rather than dip into capital.<p>All this suggests a strategy for investors:Watch the rich and get set to buy bonds. There's almost no chance that growth will beat the official forecast for 1994. But if high earners start cutting back more than the government expects--which seems likely--the downside surprise could shock the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, a plus for bonds.<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By Jim Jubak<p>"Value" investing--looking for stocks with unrecognized value--has been hot for a year now, and the big-name stocks are pretty picked over. But don't despair:Plenty of less-familiar issues still trade far below their basic worth, says value vulture Scott Black, founder and president of Delphi Management.<p>At Delphi, Black manages $550 million for more than a dozen big institutions. He's shown an 18.5 percent annualized return since 1980 and notched 8 percent in the first half of 1993.<p>Black buys only stocks that trade well below the average price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500. He looks for companies that sell near the book value of their assets, have little debt, and show rising earnings. Three of Black's current favorites:<p><a name="NASD:ACCMA"></a><b>Associated Communications A</b> (ACCMA) Owns valuable cellular franchises and a 16-million-share chunk of cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. Black sees value of $30 a share--50 percent higher than recently.<p><a name="NASD:HDCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13618"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hadco Corp.</b></a> (HDCO) A circuit-board maker, Hadco is trading at just nine times 1992 earnings. With the stock trading near book value of $7, there's little downside.<p><a name="NASD:SERF"></a><b>Service Fracturing</b> (SERF) As oil rigs multiply again, this debt-free service company is back in the black. Shares trade at $5.25, not far above book value. Black sees a move to $8.<p> <p><p>

						 <p>By Jim Jubak<p>In a few months, we'll know whether the rich will slam the U.S. economy into reverse.<p>President Clinton's economists have already knocked a quarter point off their anemic forecast of 2.5 to 3 percent growth for 1994. But that tiny notch was likely just the first of many downward revisions prompted by the budget bill.<p>One reason: Although the tax increases were widely expected, few wealthy people have increased their withholding or made higher estimated-tax payments. That means 1994 will be unusually tough for the upper-bracket set. The rich will face higher withholding, 1993's retroactive taxes, a 2.9 percent Medicare payroll tax, and a possible health-care levy.<p>Such burdens may stall economic growth:The top 5 percent of taxpayers account for more than a quarter of all taxable income. If they slice spending to pay their extra tax, rather than dipping into savings, the effects will be felt throughout the economy.<p>Economists are split about whether this will happen. Allen Sinai of Economic Advisors Inc. has trimmed his estimates but isn't panicking. Believing the rich won't cut back much, he predicts the economy will eke out 2 percent growth for three years.<p>Others are far less sanguine. "I call [the budget] the recession act of 1994," says Lacy Hunt of HSBC Holdings, the banking giant. Hunt notes that many high earners are actually small businesses, which won't hesitate to cut costs. He looks for two quarters of decline at the end of next year--a real-life recession.<p>Tax advisors, who know high earners best, are closer to Hunt's view. William Clapp of Bessemer Trust believes his clients will cut back rather than dip into capital.<p>All this suggests a strategy for investors:Watch the rich and get set to buy bonds. There's almost no chance that growth will beat the official forecast for 1994. But if high earners start cutting back more than the government expects--which seems likely--the downside surprise could shock the Federal Reserve into cutting interest rates, a plus for bonds.<p> <p><p>

						This month Al Frank, editor of The Prudent Speculator, joins our panel of financial-newsletter writers. The price listed with each writer's stock pick is the maximum at which the author considers the recommended stock attractive. The newsletter writer may hold the stock either in a personal account or in a fund he manages, and may have changed his opinion after the April 22 publishing deadline.<p>AL FRANK
THE PRUDENT SPECULATOR<p>Looks for undervalued stocks with the potential for long-term appreciation.<p><a name="NASD:RDRT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10789"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Read-Rite</b></a> (Milpitas, California), a leading manufacturer of magnetic recording heads for computer disc drives, is a deal. The stock has fallen more than 60 percent since last September over concerns about a choppy product transition and the announced merger of <a name="NYSE:SEG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14678"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Seagate Technology</b></a> and Read-Rite customer Conner Peripherals. Given that Conner represents only 13 percent of Read-Rite's sales and that Seagate plans to continue doing business with the company, I believe the market has overreacted. Trading at less than seven times 12-month trailing earnings and four times cash flow, the stock looks extremely undervalued. My target is $48 a share within three to five years.<p>JIM McCAMANT
MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER<p>Focuses primarily on small biotechnology companies.<p><a name="NASD:IMGN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10185"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ImmunoGen</b></a> (Cambridge, Massachusetts) is developing some promising cancer treatments and is a major beneficiary of the FDA's recent decision to accelerate approval of cancer drugs. ImmunoGen's most advanced product, a treatment for B-cell lymphoma called Oncolysin B, is in phase-three trials. The company also has a full pipeline of other cancer treatments in earlier stages of development. ImmunoGen has a collaborative relationship with Harvard's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute for cancer research and will probably enter into a new corporate partnership sometime in the next few months. This would move the stock a lot higher.<p>MICHAEL MURPHY
CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY STOCK LETTER<p>Looks for high-growth high-tech companies.<p>Semiconductor-equipment maker <a name="NASD:GGNS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13559"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Genus</b></a> (Sunnyvale, California) dominates two markets: It has a 70 percent market share in tungsten chemical-vapor deposition (which puts layers of metal on the silicon chip) and an 80 percent share in high-energy ion deposition (a process that insulates the circuit lines from the underlying wafer). This latter process is used widely for DRAM chips and increasingly for logic chips. The stock has fallen 60 percent from a September high of $15 a share on the fear that DRAM makers will cut back production. On the contrary, Genus should have a strong backlog of orders. Investors have a good shot at doubling their money this year.<p>LOUIS NAVELLIER
MPT REVIEW<p>Uses modern portfolio theory to identify high-return, 
low-volatility stocks.<p><a name="NASD:IOMG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13832"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Iomega</b></a> (Roy, Utah) is in a great niche. The company makes fancy little Zip drives, otherwise known as removable data-storage devices. The stock is a big turnaround play: Earnings turned positive in the third quarter of 1995, and sales grew 287 percent from the fourth quarter of 1994 to the fourth quarter of 1995. On top of that, profit margins are expanding rapidly. One of the technical indicators I use__institutional accumulation__shows that Wall Street is very keen on the stock. In fact, Hambrecht & Quist, the West Coast investment firm specializing in technology, recently started pushing the stock, and other big firms have since piled in. <p><p><p>

Keep an eye on the 20 issues identified annually as the poorest performers by the Council of Institutional Investors. Compared with their peers, these have the worst five-year returns of the stocks in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index. But research shows that the stocks on this list outperform the S&P by 14 percent in the year after they're targeted by the CII. Below are some of last year's most down-and-out.<p>

Last year's overhyped offerings from designers <a name="NYSE:DK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42555"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Donna Karan International</b></a> , Guess?, and <a name="NYSE:MGX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47767"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mossimo</b></a> are now selling at steep discounts to their initial-public-offering prices. But the punishment handed out to most of the group has put one gem on sale. <a name="NYSE:DSH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51178"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Designer Holdings</b></a> (NYSE: DSH), which markets Calvin Klein sportswear under a 40-year licensing agreement, soared from $18 a share to $34 within ten days of its May 1996 offering. Since then the shares have dipped to a recent price of $18.13. Selling at only 14 times estimated 1997 earnings, the company has a solid balance sheet and recently won the license to market Donna Karan jeanswear. Ryan Jacob of IPO Value Monitor expects earnings to grow 40 percent in 1997, which could send the price to $28. Take that, Donna.	<p>

						As growth slows, companies are tempted to manipulate earnings<p>
By Gregory Millman<p>
Earnings. investors rely on no other number as much. It's the starting point for valuing a stock and has become the most important indicator of a company's short-term performance. Falling earnings can set off a stampede of selling. Rising earnings can send a stock soaring. Earnings momentum -- a strategy that says to buy stocks when the underlying corporate earnings are growing at a faster and faster rate -- is probably the most popular investment technique in today's market.<p>
But earnings are becoming an increasingly less reliable tool for investors as changes in executive compensation and accounting practices give corporate officials both a reason to bend the rules and greater leeway in doing so. "The informativeness of earnings has clearly gone down over the past three decades," says Baruch Lev, a professor at New York University's Stern School of Business. Add in the current pressure on corporate officers to keep earnings climbing even as the economy slows, and investors would be smart to put all earnings numbers under a microscope. "We're seeing a deterioration in the overall quality of earnings," observes Robert Olstein, who manages the <a name="FUND:OFALX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OFALX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Olstein Financial Alert Fund</b></a> in Purchase, New York.<p>
Some of what Olstein calls "deterioration" is tantamount to outright fraud. The greatest concentration of problems, says George Diacont, chief accountant for the Securities and Exchange Commission's Division of Enforcement, seems to be in the high-growth, high-technology companies, exactly the industry sector favored by earnings-momentum investors. The methods range from creating fictitious sales to keeping the books open a day or two after the end of a quarter to record additional revenues.<p>
But outright fraud is only a small part of the problem, according to Martin Fridson, chief high-yield strategist at Merrill Lynch. Most of the accounting used to massage earnings is legal and, indeed, conforms to accepted accounting practices. Nonetheless, says Fridson, the result is widespread distortion. He regularly sees financial reports from companies that have lengthened depreciation schedules to minimize write-offs for aging equipment or that force inventory on distributors and count those transactions as sales. "A prime candidate would be a company with an extended record of high earnings growth that is now going to find it more difficult to maintain that momentum. Those are the companies that will resort to accounting gimmickry," explains Fridson.<p>
The current problem with earnings extends far beyond high-tech high-fliers and companies that issue new stock. <a name="NYSE:KO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10359"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Coca-Cola</b></a>, for example, was able to make its earnings projections for the quarter ended September 30 only by incorporating extraordinary asset sales into operating revenues. <a name="NYSE:DIS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11603"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Disney</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:S"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11338"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sears</b></a> have both pursued aggressive accounting policies in recent years, according to Olstein.<p>
Why all of this monkeying around with earnings now? It's the result of two trends. First, many corporations have moved to a pay-for-performance system that ties managers' compensation to higher earnings. Says Fridson, "There is a direct interest on the part of management to have earnings go up. Their contract is tied to the number, no matter how phony it is, no matter how much trickery is involved in producing it." The SEC's Diacont agrees. "Any time you create an incentive for management to falsify the financial statements, you will see increases in falsification," he says. <p>
Second, the recent slowdown in corporate earnings has put pressure on executives to match the heady profits of the past few years. Earnings increases for the third quarter of 1996, for example, were the lowest since 1992. The result: more manipulation, predicts Fridson. "Analysts are already getting poised for this," he says. "At this point in the cycle, you really have to be on your toes."<p>
Yet investors are to blame as well. In their single-minded focus on earnings growth, they have been entirely too accepting of the accounting tricks used to deliver that growth. Fred Speece, a partner in the Minneapolis-based money-management firm Speece, Lewis and Thorson is more blunt, saying, "Investors have been ignoring quality of earnings."<p>
All this has led some experts to conclude that earnings reports are losing relevance as a measure of corporate performance. <p>
Part of the problem is with the earnings number itself. Accounting was designed for the days when most assets were tangible. Now the most important part of many businesses is intellectual. "The accounting system simply cannot deal with change," says New York University's Lev. For example, the common practice of drug and technology companies' expensing research and development -- that is, charging long-term research against current earnings -- makes future earnings look better because the expense of producing the income is not properly matched against the revenues. "In the early years of a project," says Lev, "because of all of this expensing of R and D, you get very low, sometimes even negative earnings. Then later, when those investments start to pay off, you get inflated earnings and an overstated picture of profitability." <p>
The quality of corporate profits can make a big difference to investors. In a recent study, Richard Sloan of the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business examined 30 years' worth of data on the differences between reported earnings and operating cash flow. Sloan found that, although it takes an average of three years for the market to catch on, the price of a stock with manipulated reported earnings will ultimately fall to the level predicted by that company's cash flow.<p>
Sloan came up with a handy rule of thumb that investors can use to determine if a company's earnings reflect financial reality or the CEO's fantasy. <p>
Sloan's quality-of-earnings ratio rates a company by first calculating the difference between reported earnings and operating cash flow -- the actual flows of cash in and out of the company unadjusted for such non-cash costs as depreciation of a building or equipment. He then adjusts the figures for a company's relative size by dividing this figure by the company's total assets. Companies with the smallest difference between reported earnings and cash flow are at the top of Sloan's list, while those with the widest differences are near the bottom. Historically, a portfolio that bought the stocks of the 10 percent of companies at the top of the quality-of-earnings ranking, and that sold short the stocks of the 10 percent of companies at the bottom of the ranking, produced a 10 percent annual return -- with virtually no market risk.<p>
Can investors use Sloan's study to select better investments? Absolutely. Obtain the latest quarterly earnings report from a company you're interested in, or retrieve the report electronically on the Internet from the Security and Exchange Commission's Edgar Database (<a HREF="http://www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/srch-edgar">www.sec.gov/cgi-bin/srch-edgar</A>?). Find the number for total net income on the income statement. Then go to the cash-flow statement, where you'll find a line for net cash used in operating activities. Subtract that number from the net-income figure to get cash earnings. Then divide the result by the company's total assets to get the earnings-quality ratio.<p>
Sloan advises investors to look for stocks that have a ratio near zero. Such a company is reporting earnings honestly, since it shows almost no difference between reported earnings and cash flow. The higher the ratio, the more likely it is that the company's reported earnings are giving a misleading picture of the enterprise. Sloan's study shows that a quality-of-earnings ratio of 0.15 is enough to put a company in the bottom 10 percent of all companies. Any company with a quality-of-earnings ratio of 0.20 or higher should be treated with extreme suspicion.<p>

						The cash that an employer puts into your 401(k) provides a remarkable cushion against market crashes. Even during the worst 5-, 10-, 15-, and 20-year markets in history, a 50 percent match would have ensured that an investor fully committed to stocks did better than an investor on the sidelines in safe three-month Treasury bills.<p>

						Do cable TV's copper wires offer investors a golden opportunity?<p>
By Paul Davies<p>
Scorned by consumers, vilified by regulators, and weakened by a massive debt load, the cable-TV industry was ill-equipped to face a frontal attack by fast-growing direct-broadcast satellite TV. No wonder Wall Street, smelling blood, has driven cable stocks down 23 percent over the past year, reducing cable-company shares to valuations virtually unseen in a decade. Now, however, prices are so low that the smart money is looking among cable stocks for bargains. <p>
"The fact of the matter is cable companies are not going out of business," says Mark Boyar, a New York money manager and principal of Mark Boyar & Co. "Yes, there is going to be more competition. And yes, they have to spend a lot of money to upgrade their systems. But when push comes to shove, cable is going to be on top. And with the stocks trading at ridiculously low levels, the patient investor can make a lot of money."<p>
It's not that cable companies don't have real problems. Their traditional markets are mature, cash flows don't cover interest payments at many companies, and upgrading to digital service is both pressing and expensive. It's just that the competition is not quite as formidable as many investors fear. <p>
Consider the threat from direct-broadcast satellite services -- the companies that deliver 200 channels over an 18-inch, $399 dish. Despite an initial surge in orders, customers are beginning to recognize satellite's limitations, including high cost and the lack of local programming. Worst of all for heavy TV users, each dish delivers only one program at a time, forcing two-TV homes to buy two dishes. Nor can satellite effectively compete in offering interactive services, such as Internet access or home banking. As a result, sales have slowed to the point that one retailer in Dallas offers the dish for one dollar if the user commits to a year's worth of programming at $400. <p>
As for the rivalry between cable companies and other telecom providers, "the competition is [also] somewhat overblown," says Tom Wolzien, an analyst at Sanford Bernstein & Co. in New York. The telephone companies (both local and long-distance) are distracted at the moment as they try to invade one another's turf.<p>
Cable's competitive advantage is simple: It offers vastly superior capacity and speed compared with its wired and wireless competitors. And by the end of this year, many companies will have begun implementing digital-system upgrades that add more channels through digital TV-set-top boxes, that provide Internet access using cable modems, and that pave the way for offering telephone service. About half of the 65 million cable subscribers should be connected to upgraded systems by 1998, according to a recent report by Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette. Time Warner plans to spend $4 billion between 1996 and 1999 to upgrade its equipment, while analysts estimate that TCI's cost to upgrade will be $10 billion. "They are not spending this kind of money on a hunch," says A'isha Ajayi, a professor of information, technology, and telecommunications at the Rochester Institute of Technology.<p>
So which stocks should an investor pick? The best bets are those companies that own both cable and non-cable assets, including satellite, wireless communications, and programming. <p>
<a name="NYSE:COX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43269"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cox Communications'</b></a> (NYSE: COX) aggressive equipment upgrade -- 36 percent of its system -- makes it the most attractive stock (and one of the most expensive) for investors who believe cable companies will profit from the rollout of new services and increased channel capacity. Part of the company's upgrade includes adding telephone switches; analysts estimate Cox can capture 20 percent of the telephone markets in which it operates. Unlike most other cable operators, Cox makes a profit, has a healthy balance sheet and an excellent customer-service record, and serves high-density areas, allowing the company to reach the most customers with the least expense.<p>
<a name="NASD:CMCSA"></a><b>Comcast</b>, the fourth-largest cable operator (Nasdaq: CMCSA) in the U.S., also owns stakes in QVC's home-shopping network; in Sprint Spectrum, a provider of personal communications services expected to debut in 1997; in the Teleport Communications Group, a telecommunications venture; and in professional basketball and hockey teams in Philadelphia. Growth in cash flow -- 42 percent in the first nine months of 1996 -- enabled the company to spend $300 million to upgrade systems and deliver new services as well as repurchase $186 million worth of shares. At $16.50 a share, Comcast is trading at 45 to 50 percent of its estimated intrinsic value, according to Mark Boyar. Value investor Michael Price purchased 617,100 shares during the third quarter of 1996.<p>
<a name="NASD:TCOMA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14891"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tele-Communication-TCI Group</b></a> (Nasdaq: TCOMA) is the riskiest -- and therefore the cheapest -- of these three stocks. CEO John Malone recently cut capital spending on existing systems from $2 billion to an estimated $750 million for 1997. Although this will slow the effort to upgrade the system to digital, the increase in cash flow should help TCI lower its $14.5 billion debt. Revenues will also benefit from TCI's 30 percent stake in Sprint Spectrum. In September, TCI began offering the @Home Network, which provides Internet access using a high-speed cable modem for $35 a month.<p>

						WHOSE INFLATION?
Those new inflation-indexed Treasury securities may carry more risk than investors realize. The principal value of the bonds will be adjusted upward with any climb in the consumer price index. But the Boskin commission recently concluded that the CPI overstates inflation and that the index should be recalculated. That would create an even wider gulf between the inflation index and the higher inflation experienced by retirees and parents: Medical costs have recently been rising at more than 4.5 percent a year, while educational costs have been increasing more than 5.5 percent annually. Investors still interested in the new bonds should look for a low-cost fund, such as the new American Century–Benham Treasury Inflation Protection Securities Fund (due out in March, 800-345-2021) or the Dreyfus Inflation Adjusted Securities Fund (800-645-6561).<p>
PLAYING THE SPREAD
Investors trading over-the-counter issues with big spreads -- the difference between the seller's asking price and the buyer's bid price -- have a new way to minimize their costs. Two times a day, discount broker Jack White will use POSIT, the automatic trade-matching system, to pair buyers and sellers -- and split the spread between them. Call 800-233-3411 for more information. <p>
BRIEFS
Michael Murphy, whose California Technology Stock Letter has consistently beaten the Wilshire 5000 Index, is taking over management of three <a name="FUND:MNTGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MNTGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Monitrend Funds</b></a>, renaming them Murphy Technology Fund, Murphy Biotechnology Fund, and Murphy New World Convertible Fund (415-726-8495)....Brian Posner, the highly successful manager of Fidelity's <a name="FUND:FEQTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FEQTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Equity-Income II Fund</b></a>, is leaving to join the <a HREF="http://www.wechsler.com/portfolio/warburg/warburg1.html">Warburg Pincus Fund group</A>. Posner's replacement is Bettina Doulton, manager of <a name="FUND:FPURX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FPURX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Puritan</b></a>....Beware the "teaser rates" on Michael Price's Mutual Series Funds (recently renamed the Franklin Mutual Series Funds). Class II shares charge a 1 percent front-end load and 0.25 percent 12b-1 fee for the first 13 months -- but the 12b-1 fee jumps to 1 percent after that.<p>

						After 30 years, the world has caught up to Value Line's original system<p>
By Michael Peltz<p>
At an age when most of his peers have headed to Florida to clip coupons, Samuel Eisenstadt remains in New York, researching cutting-edge computer technologies, such as neural networks and genetic algorithms. The 74-year-old statistician is seeking to improve the Value Line stock-ranking system, which he created more than 30 years ago under the direction of the investment-advisory firm's late founder, Arnold Bernhard. The system -- which has more than 100,000 subscribers but is a bible to many times more investors, who use its one-page reports when researching stocks -- has been slipping of late.<p>
As the 1980s began, a portfolio of the 100 stocks awarded the number-one ranking by the Value Line Investment Survey outperformed the Russell 1000 Index five out of six years, but in the past ten years it has beaten that index just three times, according to Mark Hulbert, publisher of The Hulbert Financial Digest. Although research chairman Eisenstadt maintains that Value Line should work in all markets, the system -- which, by looking at such factors as earnings surprises and price momentum, ranks 1,700 widely traded stocks on a scale of one to five, in terms of their expected 6-to-12-month performance -- has lagged in exactly the kind of momentum-driven market in which it should excel.<p>
"When it was first introduced, it was a bold, brilliant stroke, but the insights captured in the ranking system are no longer unique," says <a name="FUND:GPAFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GPAFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Guardian Park Avenue Fund</b></a> manager Charles Albers, who began his career at Value Line in the mid-1960s. A growth investor, Albers prefers the stock screens of Guardian's computer models. In fact, professional investors now have access to analytic tools that track the same factors Value Line uses to rank stocks. Eisenstadt admits the competition has caught up. "The system probably worked better in the early years," he says, "and we're looking at ways to improve it."<p>
Bernhard began research during the depression to develop what his daughter and current Value Line CEO Jean Bernhard Buttner calls "a rational approach to the evaluation of stocks." Bernhard initially performed the analysis by plotting company earnings by hand on a transparency and superimposing the transparency on a price chart to create a "value line." In 1946, Eisenstadt joined the firm as a proofreader and introduced Bernhard to statistical analysis, which enabled Value Line to consider multiple variables (dividends, book value, interest rates, price lags, market yields) to predict whether a stock was under- or overvalued. The system, however, was better at picking when to buy or sell a specific stock than at determining which stocks were the best to own. "Each stock had its own formula, but they were not necessarily comparable," says Eisenstadt. Then, in 1965, Eisenstadt fashioned one formula -- using the ten-year trend of relative earnings, price performance, and recent price and earnings momentums -- that worked across all stocks. (Earnings surprise, the degree to which earnings exceed or fall short of analysts' estimates, was added in 1968.)<p>
Part of Value Line's appeal has been its simplicity. "If you can count to five, you can use the system," says Buttner. The 100 stocks rated one for timeliness should outperform the 300 rated two, which should in turn do better than the 900 threes, 300 fours, and 100 fives. A portfolio of ones, however, tends to have much larger price swings than the overall market. "This greater volatility explains why Value Line's lead over the market shrinks when its gains are adjusted for risk," wrote Hulbert last fall. <p>
Eisenstadt says this is because the system favors stocks with dynamic earnings. It's also why the flagship firm's mutual fund, the Value Line Fund, doesn't simply mimic the Value Line ranking system, but actively selects holdings from issues ranked one or two (or occasionally even three).<p>
The decline in the system's performance is unlikely to mean that investors will begin to drop their Value Line subscriptions. Most subscribers don't use Value Line as a formal stock-picking system. "It's a valuable research tool," says David Dreman, manager of the Kemper-Dreman Funds, who worked as an analyst at Value Line in the mid-1960s. "It's a quick down and dirty on a company. You can't buy a stock on what they tell you, but you can dismiss one."<p>
Eisenstadt wouldn't entirely disagree. "Just get rid of the fours and fives from your portfolio and you'll do well," he says. "The system almost does better at signaling the poor stocks than at picking out the winners."<p>
But he's not satisfied with that answer either. Value Line hopes to recapture the success of the survey's early years with an expanded edition, introduced in March 1995, that ranks 1,800 more companies. "The inefficiencies, and the potential opportunities, are greater in the expanded survey," says Eisenstadt, because the companies tend to be smaller and not as widely followed. Unlike the original, the new survey doesn't include forecasts and comments from analysts. And since earnings revisions are not meaningful for many  small-company stocks, the new survey depends on price and earnings momentum, earnings acceleration, and relative cheapness to estimate performance.<p>
The initial results seem promising. According to Eisenstadt, a portfolio of the 100 stocks ranked one in the expanded survey was up 76 percent from inception through November 1996 (although Hulbert estimates commissions would cut that return by about half).<p>
Eisenstadt expects that fans of the original survey, even those who can't afford to buy all 100 stocks ranked one, will continue to use the system to build portfolios. Eisenstadt, who has tried unsuccessfully for years to reduce the number of top-ranked issues to a more manageable size, offers a simple compromise. Pick any 12 to 15 stocks from the group of one-ranked issues. "Unless you're really unlucky," he says, "your performance should match that of the larger group -- but only if they're selected totally at random. <p>
"I'd almost say throw darts at a list of the group ones," he adds, the twinkle in his eyes revealing, for him, the limits of scientific research.<p>

						His Heart Is in His Trees<p>
By Monica Corcoran<p>
When the second-largest landowner in America surveys his property, he sees trees. Douglas firs, sugar pines, and cedars, to name a few. "I don't think of land in terms of acres," says Archie Aldis "Red" Emmerson, 67, who just happens to own 1.2 million of them. "It's what those acres do for us." Grow plenty of trees for Sierra Pacific Industries, is what.<p>
SPI is the timber company Emmerson founded with his father, Curly, in 1949. The two Emmersons began by leasing a sawmill to cut Douglas firs. Today, SPI is the third-largest U.S. lumber producer and owns more land than any other timber company in California. Red's desire to own tree-producing land is the reason. "My father didn't believe in land," he says in his Douglas-fir-paneled corner office at SPI's headquarters in Anderson, California. "He was from the old school, and he didn't think that far ahead." In timber-industry lingo, "far ahead" means 40 to 50 years into the future, because trees don't grow overnight. <p>
The acreage didn't grow that fast either. "Buying land was always a priority, but I never had any money to do that," he says, recalling the leaner years. The company acquired its first tract of timberland in 1958: 2,500 acres dotted with Douglas firs in Cappel Creek, California. Emmerson liked its potential for reforestation. His largest purchase took place in 1987 when SPI bought 522,000 acres for $460 million. To finance the huge acquisition, he borrowed the money from a consortium of 11 banks. "I hocked my heart and soul to buy land," says Emmerson.<p>
Emmerson's willingness to shoulder onerous debt has paid off and even ensured his company's survival. In the past decade, as environmentalists have fought against timber interests and pressured the U.S. government to restrict logging, many smaller timber companies have been swallowed by larger ones or disappeared altogether, especially those that didn't own a lot of land. Because Emmerson does not depend on access to Uncle Sam's acres, he can be sure the next generation of Emmersons will be timber barons, too.<p>
"One of the main reasons for buying the land is my family," says Emmerson. His children own 68 percent of SPI. Emmerson's son Mark serves as a corporate director and a vice president of the company; his daughter and other son also hold positions within SPI. "I hope the family business will perpetuate," says Red. Like the trees.<p>

						The top 100 landowners -- the ranchers, heirs, politicians, and operators who can't get enough<p>
By William P. Barrett<p>
Some are rich, some are powerful, many are old. These are the 100 individuals and families who own the biggest chunks of the nation. Taken as a group, with number one owning 1.3 million acres and number 100 owning 95,000, they hold more than 1 percent of the country, a landmass the size of Kentucky.<p>
Most of America's biggest spreads are in the West. Here are the storied dynastic ranches owned by heirs of the Kings, Waggoners, and Burnetts. This is also where corporate chiefs like Ted Turner and Henry Singleton have staked their claims (together Turner and Singleton own nearly 3 percent of New Mexico) and where people like timber baron Red Emmerson and "Potato King" J. R. Simplot bought the land that helped them make their money and their mark. <p>
To these people, land has intrinsic meaning and merit. "I like land. I like to look at it," says one. "It's something you can count on," says another. "Whatever you own will be worth more in the future," says a third.<p>
But there's concern behind the confidence and contentment. It has to do with the future, with whether the next generation will keep these vast tracts intact or allow them to dissipate through squabbling or poor management. Within the next 10 to 20 years, many of the country's great holdings will pass to a new group of people, through inheritance or sale. What happens to much of the West, with its powerful hold on the American imagination, will be up to them.<p>
1. R. E. "TED" TURNER
Roswell, Georgia
1.3 million acres in New Mexico, Montana, Nebraska, Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina
Ted Turner, 58, has a taste for land that's as expansive as his public persona. Among his holdings: 1.15 million acres in New Mexico, amounting to 1.5 percent of the state. What drives his purchases? Turn to "Number One: In His Newest Field."<p>
2. ARCHIE ALDIS "RED" EMMERSON
Anderson, California
1.2 million acres in California
Sierra Pacific Industries was a small, family-run forest operation until the 1970s, when Red Emmerson began aggressively buying timberland. See "Number 2: His Heart Is in His Trees."<p>
3. HENRY E. SINGLETON
Beverly Hills, California
1.15 million acres in New Mexico and California
Henry Singleton -- wheeler-dealer, co-founder of Teledyne, trustee of Ronald Reagan's blind trust -- started buying cattle ranches across a 250-mile-long belt in central and southeastern New Mexico in the 1980s. Land specialists say he now owns about 1.4 percent of the state (1.1 million acres), plus a 45,000-acre spread in California's Salinas Valley.<p>
Singleton, 79, declined to comment, but he once told an Albuquerque newspaper: "I'm dedicated to the improvement of the land. I think everyone who owns property has the same feeling."<p>
4. PINGREE HEIRS
Bangor, Maine, and elsewhere
975,000 acres in Maine
The Pingree holdings date back to 1820, when Maine became a state. That's when Salem, Massachusetts, businessman David Pingree, correctly believing that his city would cease to be a major port, started purchasing vast tracts of softwoods and hardwoods as an investment hedge. Over the next 150 years, the Pingree holdings would top a million acres before being scaled back.<p>
There are now about 70 Pingree descendants. The holdings are overseen by two family entities, Pingree Associates and Seven Islands Land. Steve Schley, a sixth-generation Pingree and president of Pingree Associates, says timber is a slow but steady investment. "It's something you can count on," he says. "If the markets are terrible, you can store your product on the stump and wait a year."<p>
5. KING RANCH HEIRS
Kingsville, Texas, and elsewhere
860,000 acres in Texas, Florida, and Kentucky
Ownership of America's most storied ranch is shared by dozens of the descendants of steamboat captain Richard King, who began assembling the big spread in South Texas <p>
In 1853, paying just two cents an acre for his first 15,500 acres. The present, noncontiguous agricultural operation includes cattle, farming, oil and gas, and a visitor's center for the thousands of tourists and hunters the ranch attracts. Other family holdings include a 16,000-acre farm in Florida and a 680-acre horse ranch in Kentucky, plus some foreign operations.<p>
Says Jack Hunt, a non-descendant who is president of King Ranch Inc., "The family feels strongly about staying true to the ranches in South Texas."<p>
6. HUBER FAMILY
Rumson, New Jersey
800,000 acres in Maine, Tennessee, Kentucky, Missouri, and West Virginia
Based in Edison, New Jersey, the 113-year-old family-owned J. M. Huber Corporation (1995 revenues: $1.5 billion) is best known for a broad line of chemical and electronic products. But it's also a player in timberland. <p>
7. REED FAMILY
Seattle
770,000 acres in Washington, Oregon, and California
This century-old holding got its start in 1890 when Sol Simpson founded Simpson Timber amid the lush forests of the Northwest. Now called Simpson Investment, the organization has grown steadily over the years, using its cash flow to acquire more holdings, including some choice California redwoods. <p>
William Reed Jr., a great-grandson of the founder, ran the company for a quarter century, until his nephew Colin Moseley, 36, took over early last year. In 1987, all non-family shareholders were bought out.<p>
8. KENNETH W. FORD
Roseburg, Oregon
740,000 acres in Oregon and California
In 1935, young Kenneth Ford bought used machinery and some bargain-basement timberland at two dollars an acre and opened up a sawmill. Where possible, Ford cut trees on leased federal land, allowing trees on his own land to grow back. Today, his family-owned Roseburg Forest Products owns more than 1,000 square miles. Ford, 88, is still acquiring, although a deal to buy 600,000 acres from Weyerhaeuser Corporation fell apart last year. <p>
9. LYKES FAMILY
Tampa and elsewhere
640,000 acres in Florida and Texas
This Florida-based family is famous for its shipping operations, but the fortune actually began with land. In the 1870s, Howell T. Lykes gave up a career as a doctor to run cattle across 500 acres he had inherited in Florida. Eventually, he established a shipping line to transport the beef he produced to other countries. Lykes Brothers -- Howell's sons -- later expanded into citrus and other agricultural production. The Lykeses acquired the 265,000-acre 02 Ranch in far-west Texas from a distressed depression-era seller.<p>
The company is now owned by 200-plus descendants and headed by Thompson Lykes Rankin. Spokesperson Chris Ward wouldn't confirm land-holdings, but says, "I wouldn't be surprised" if the family acreage ranked within the top ten.<p>
10. DOLPH BRISCOE JR.
Uvalde, Texas
600,000 acres in Texas
During his two-term Texas governorship in the 1970s, Dolph Briscoe was routinely described as the Lone Star State's biggest individual landowner. Nothing much has changed. The Briscoe family began buying in the 1820s (one of Texas's 254 counties is named Briscoe), and Dolph steadily added to the 180,000-acre Catarina Ranch he had inherited from his father in 1954. Briscoe is credited with helping to rid Texas cattle herds of a perennial pest, the screwworm. Long retired from public life, Briscoe, 73, did not return phone calls. He works from his base in Uvalde, where he also owns a bank.<p>
11. IRVING FAMILY
Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada
550,000 acres in Maine
The Irving family of Saint John, New Brunswick, might be the continent's biggest private landowner. When billionaire family patriarch Kenneth Colin Irving died in 1992 at age 93, obituaries said the family business, Irving Corporation, owned four million acres of timberland. About 550,000 of those acres are across the border in Maine.<p>
Over 70 years, K.C. had built up a formidable conglomerate: oil, gas stations, media, shipyards, retail, manufacturing, and paper mills, to name a few. His sons -- James, Jack, and Arthur -- all in their 60s, now run the operation.<p>
12. ELECTRA WAGGONER BIGGS & ALBERT B. WHARTON III
Vernon, Texas
525,000 acres in Texas
In the 1870s, W. T. Waggoner started buying land at a dollar an acre near the Red River in Texas. "I don't aim to buy it all," he once commented, "just what joins me." By the time of his death in 1934, he had amassed the nation's largest non-leased ranch surrounded by a single fence.<p>
Ownership of the cattle-and-oil operation has fallen to two family branches. One is headed by Electra Waggoner Biggs, 84, a legendary beauty for whom the Buick Electra was named (manufacturing executives were taken with her first name), and the other by her cousin Albert Wharton, 49, whose Philadelphia ancestors endowed the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School. The two live in separate homes on the giant ranch and have feuded over its economic future, in what looks like a 50-50 standoff. Each declined to comment.<p>
13. EAST FAMILY
Zapata, Texas
500,000 acres in Texas
A century after the creation of the King Ranch, the Alice Kleberg East branch of the family decided to forgo horse breeding and foreign diversification to focus on cattle. In a division of the estate, East, a grandchild of Captain King of the King Ranch, was given the Santa Fe Ranch, which adjoins the original spread to the west. The land has been divided again but is still owned by East descendants.<p>
14. ROBERT EARL HOLDING
Salt Lake City
500,000 acres in Wyoming, Montana, Utah, Idaho, and other western states
Starting in 1952 with a 10 percent interest in a single gas station/motel in Little America, Wyoming, Robert Earl Holding has built up a diverse energy-land-and-recreation operation across the West. He is said to own 450,000 acres of ranchland in Wyoming and Montana, as well as Idaho's famous Sun Valley ski resort and the Snow Basin resort in Utah, which will be one of the sites for the Winter Olympics in 2002.<p>
According to his secretary, Holding, 69, "doesn't give interviews."<p>
15. O'CONNOR FAMILY
Victoria, Texas
375,000 acres in Texas and elsewhere
Thomas O'Connor had it both ways. After emigrating from Ireland to Texas in the 1830s, he obtained a Spanish land grant in South Texas around what is now Victoria. He then fought against Mexico in the Texas revolution and, while retaining his Spanish rights, won rights to even more acreage from the winning Texans. "Land does not blow away," O'Connor once commented. "Dollars do." He eventually established a 500,000-acre cattle ranch just north of the King Ranch and acquired another 200,000 acres in various other states.<p>
The big money, though, started rolling in during the 1930s when a gigantic oil field was discovered. Some of the land was sold off; the several branches of the O'Connor family later diversified into other endeavors, including banking. No one would comment.<p>
16. CLARENCE SCHARBAUER JR.
Midland, Texas
355,000 acres in Texas and New Mexico
In 1889, John Scharbauer moved from New York to West Texas to pursue a frontier life. He bought sheep, cattle, and lots of land. Some of the land lay in Texas's Permian Basin, which in 1935 became the site of one of the richest oil fields ever found in the United States.<p>
While pocketing the energy royalties of the still-producing field, grandson Clarence, 71, oversees the Scharbauer Cattle Company. He dabbles in horses and owned Alysheba, winner of the 1987 Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes. He didn't return our calls.<p>
17. ANNE BURNETT MARION
Fort Worth, Texas, and Santa Fe, New Mexico
350,000 acres in Texas
Anne Burnett Marion is the owner of one of Texas's most famous spreads, the 6666 Ranch, which is near the tiny panhandle town of Guthrie. Her great-grandfather Samuel Burk Burnett acquired the cattle ranch in the 1870s -- the winnings, legend has it, of a poker hand containing four sixes. A savvy businessman, Burnett later successfully lobbied for grazing rights on federal land by inviting President Theodore Roosevelt to go wolf hunting with him.<p>
The 6666 Ranch (or Four Sixes, as the locals call it) and some later acquisitions have remained intact due to several factors: the way Burnett, who died in 1922, structured his will; the discovery of oil; and a paucity of descendants. The present owner, Marion, 58, is a noted art collector and philanthropist. She has one child and is married to John Marion, a former chairman of Sotheby's. John Marion says of his wife, "Land is really in her blood."<p>
18. J. R. SIMPLOT
Boise, Idaho
310,000 acres in Idaho, California, Nevada, Washington, Oregon, and Utah
The "Potato King," as billionaire J. R. Simplot is known because of his huge frozen-french-fry operations, controls the giant 1.3-million-acre ZX Ranch near Paisley, Oregon -- mainly for cattle, not potatoes. But he owns only about 73,000 acres, with the rest leased from the federal government. That's typical of his holdings; overall, he leases an estimated 2.25 million acres from Uncle Sam.<p>
The 88-year-old Simplot was recently in Australia looking to buy a million acres there. His philosophy, as described by a spokesman: "Whatever you own will be worth more in the future."<p>
19. BASS FAMILY
Fort Worth, Texas
300,000 acres in Oklahoma, Texas, Nebraska, California, New Mexico, 
Kansas, Hawaii, and Colorado
With a rich father, Perry Bass, and his four rich sons -- Sid, Robert, Lee, and Edward -- it's hard to keep track of all that's owned by Fort Worth's $6 billion family. Among their holdings: an island off Texas, farms in the Midwest, California acreage, Hawaiian cattle spreads, and urban real estate. The Basses, who are notoriously closemouthed, would not comment.<p>
20. COLLINS FAMILY
Portland, Oregon, and elsewhere
300,000 acres in Pennsylvania, California, Oregon, and Washington
In 1855, railroad engineer Truman Collins dramatically changed careers, buying 320 acres of forest plus a sawmill near Kane, Pennsylvania. After his death in 1914, the family expanded Collins Pine Company to the West Coast. The result is a bicoastal timber operation that has drawn acclaim from environmentalists for its efforts to conserve its three major forests. Though the top operating officers of parent company Collins Holding are generally hired from the outside, the current chairperson is Maribeth Collins, the widow of Truman's grandson. Says company spokesman Wade Mosby, "We've replaced every tree we've ever cut."<p>
21. LEE FAMILY
San Mateo, New Mexico
300,000 acres in New Mexico
The tallest mountain in New Mexico south of Santa Fe is 11,301-foot-high Mount Taylor. A good chunk of it and the surrounding countryside has been owned for three generations by the Lee family. It's been a hardscrabble existence: some coal mining and cattle in a rocky area that gets only a few inches of rain a year. Says Harry Lee, "Three hundred thousand acres -- that's what we pay taxes on."<p>
22. REYNOLDS FAMILY
Fort Davis, Texas
300,000 acres in Texas
In 1880, William D. Reynolds was already a second-generation Texas rancher, working with various siblings and in-laws to build up a cattle spread -- first near Abilene and then, in search of cheaper land, in the scenic but arid Davis Mountains of West Texas. His descendants still own and operate the Reynolds Cattle Company.<p>
23. SUGG FAMILY
San Angelo, Texas
295,000 acres in Texas
After two decades of running cattle on leased land in Indian Territory (what is now Oklahoma), E. C. Sugg and his brothers relocated their operation to Texas in the early 1900s. And as luck would have it, oil was discovered on their new land.<p>
Today, nearly a century later, the acreage is still owned by Sugg descendants but is largely leased to other ranch operators. This extremely low profile family, however, has held on to the mineral royalties. "I don't think he's going to want to talk to you," said the wife of heir Calvin Sugg Jr. when we called. She was right.<p>
24. LANE FAMILY
Chicago and Tucumcari, New Mexico
290,000 acres in New Mexico
Named for the shape of an adjoining mountain, the Bell Ranch near Tucumcari has been a cattle operation since 1824 when the Mexican government awarded a 655,000-acre land grant to former army captain Pablo Montoya. Over the decades, financial distresses forced division of the spread into a half-dozen smaller sections.<p>
In 1970, the Chicago-area Lane family, using profits from its publicly traded General Binding (an office-supplies maker and seller), acquired nearly half the original land grant. Some members of the family live on the ranch, which is managed by an outside professional. The Lanes had no comment.<p>
25. COGDELL FAMILY
Tulia, Texas, and Floydada, Texas
285,000 acres in Texas
The son of a Methodist minister who moved to West Texas during the Civil War, David Muncy Cogdell quit school at age 12 to help collect debts for his father's side business -- running a general store. By age 19, Cogdell had bought the first of what would become a string of Texas panhandle ranches that stretches for 150 miles northeast and southeast of Lubbock. After Texaco discovered oil on his land, Cogdell became a philanthropist, endowing hospitals, churches, and colleges before his death in 1964.<p>
Today, sons Billy, 64, and D. M. junior, 74, have divided much of the large holdings. Why keep so much land? Says Billy, "They're not going to make any more of it."<p>
26. COLLIER FAMILY
Naples, Florida
280,000 acres in Florida and Arizona
Early in this century, Barron Gift Collier became rich by selling streetcar advertising. Then, in 1911, he started plowing money into Florida land, buying so much -- a million acres at one point -- that the county containing his home base of Naples was named after him.<p>
His descendants still have an estimated 275,000 acres of farm, ranch, and citrus land in Florida plus valuable acreage in downtown Phoenix. The family is involved in the lengthy process of giving the federal government 108,000 acres of environmentally sensitive wetlands in Florida as well as $35 million in exchange for more than 15 acres in Phoenix. <p>
27. JONES HEIRS
Corpus Christi, Texas
280,000 acres in Texas
Sitting largely unheralded in South Texas for a century have been the descendants of William Whitby Jones, a second-generation rancher who arrived after the Civil War and started buying ranchland. Today, the heirs have a spread midway between Corpus Christi and Laredo -- not too far west of the King Ranch. <p>
28. TRUE FAMILY
Casper, Wyoming
255,000 acres in Wyoming
About 255,000 acres of eastern and southeastern Wyoming are deeded in the name of True Ranches. That's the business run out of Casper by David True, who is a second-generation rancher. The family has oil interests as well. "Land ownership, I believe, is a good investment," True comments. "It certainly is something that is very tangible."<p>
29. WEBBER FAMILY
Bangor, Maine
250,000 acres in Maine
In the 1880s, John Prescott Webber became a land player in his native Maine when he acquired 30,000 acres of timberland from a defaulting borrower. He died in 1911 owning 200,000 acres. The next two generations doubled the holding. But his great-grandson G. Pierce Webber, who took the helm of Webber Timberlands in 1958, has had to sell off approximately 40 percent of the stake over the years to pay various estate taxes connected with the 40 Webber descendants.<p>
Webber, who turns 87 this month, is not optimistic that the next generation will keep the lands intact. "For me there's a sentimental value," he says. "But some would like to liquidate the whole damn thing."<p>
30. DAVID L. WALKER
Fort Pierce, Florida
245,000 acres in Nevada
The Winecup-Gamble Ranch in the northeastern corner of Nevada has changed hands a number of times since the days Bing Crosby owned a part of it. At one point during the early 1980s, a utility company acquired the cattle spread as a site for a coal-fuel electric power plant, but the company's plans were later scrapped. <p>
Since 1993, the owner has been David L. Walker, a citrus broker in Fort Pierce, Florida. Walker bought the ranch for $7 million with his proceeds from some small but well-situated acreage near Disney World. He declined to comment.<p>
31. ELLWOOD HEIRS
Colorado City, Texas; Chicago; and Waterford, Connecticut
240,000 acres in Texas and New Mexico
How to keep the damn cattle from running away? Barbed wire. Isaac Ellwood was a co-holder of the patent for barbed wire -- a factor that was as important in the development of the West as the railroads. He was also a landowner and bought his first ranch -- at a dollar an acre -- in 1889 near Colorado City, Texas, 220 miles west of Dallas. His holdings became known as the Spade Ranches, one of Texas's legendary cattle operations.<p>
Ellwood's far-flung descendants, with last names like Keeney, Chappell, and Bassham, still own the show, which embraces four ranches in Texas and one in eastern New Mexico near Tucumcari. "We feel an obligation for husbanding the land," says Frank Chappell, board chairman of the parent company, Renderbrook Spade. "And it's not too bad a commodity."<p>
32. LANGDALE FAMILY
Valdosta, Georgia
240,000 acres in Georgia
In the woody terrain of south Georgia near the Florida line, J. W. Langdale opened up a business in 1894, concentrating on pine lumber and pine products, such as turpentine. To ensure a constant supply of raw materials, he acquired a lot of timberland. Since then, the Langdales have diversified into banking and even car dealerships. <p>
33. GERALD LYDA SR.
San Antonio
235,000 acres in Texas and Oklahoma
A well-known general contractor in Texas, Gerald Lyda has been buying and selling ranches for decades. In 1985, he acquired the scenic Ladder Ranch near Truth or Consequences, New Mexico. He sold it in 1992 to Ted Turner, then bought the century-old 186,000-acre Elsinore Ranch near Fort Stockton, Texas. Lyda promptly renamed it La Escalera, Spanish for "the ladder."<p>
That deal, however, has landed the 74-year-old Lyda in U.S. tax court. The IRS claims -- improperly, he says -- that Lyda understated profits and overstated allowable expenses. The case is pending. In any event, says Lyda, "I've never lost a dollar on a piece of land."<p>
34. KOCH FAMILY
WICHITA, KANSAS
220,000 acres in Texas, Kansas, and Montana
With revenues topping $20 billion, Koch Industries is the country's second-largest privately owned business. In the 1920s, founder Fred Koch invented the thermal-cracking process to refine extra gas from crude oil. But he also got the company into the cattle business by buying ranches and leasing additional acreage. Its Matador Cattle subsidiary has become one of the country's largest beef producers. <p>
Fred died in 1967. His sons Charles and David run the enterprise. No one from the company would comment.<p>
35. JOHN IRWIN
New York
215,000 acres in Arizona and California 
The ORO Ranch, north of Prescott, Arizona, is one of those legendary spreads. It runs for hundreds of thousands of acres, an area so big that the cowboys use chuck wagons in the field because a network of roads would be too expensive to maintain. <p>
According to Arizona records, the ORORanch's deeded portion -- 165,000 or so acres -- belongs to John N. Irwin III, 42, a New York venture capitalist who is a managing director of Hillside Capital. His grandfather was Thomas Watson, the founder of IBM. In San Benito County, California, according to local officials, Irwin also owns two cattle ranches near Hollister that total 60,000 deeded acres. He did not return our calls.<p>
36. FORBES FAMILY
New York and New Jersey
205,000 acres in Colorado and Missouri
The late Malcolm Forbes Sr., the flamboyant proprietor of Forbes magazine, sure knew how to parlay his products. Starting in 1969, he acquired -- for about $22 an acre -- 256,000 acres around the historic Trinchera Ranch in southeastern Colorado. Over the years, he sold off a portion for $700 an acre through ads in his magazine. He used the same technique with a 12,800-acre parcel near Warsaw, Missouri. Landholdings, which include foreign properties, are held in the name of Forbes Inc., the company owned by his four sons and run by one of them, former presidential hopeful Steve.<p>
37. HEARST FAMILY
New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco
205,000 acres in California
Over a period of 50 years, newspaper baron William Randolph Hearst expanded a big family inheritance into vast wealth, then almost lost it all in the depression. He did, however, manage to hold on to much of his land, including his legendary California coastal retreat, San Simeon.<p>
After Hearst's death in 1951, San Simeon was given to the state of California, excluding the surrounding 80,000 acres. Other properties include acreage near Redding, California. It's all titled under the name of the New York City–based Hearst Corporation, which is owned by his descendants but controlled by non-family executives. According to historians, this was the old man's way of keeping the assets out of the hands of his five oft married sons. <p>
38. PHILIP ANSCHUTZ
Denver
200,000 acres in Wyoming, Utah, and Colorado
During the 1950s, oilman Fred Anschutz bought a 75,000-acre ranch straddling the Utah-Wyoming line. In 1978, it proved to be atop one of the country's largest gas fields. The profits allowed him and his son, Philip, who had taken over the operation, to retire debt and expand. Better known in recent years as a railroad tycoon, Anschutz fils, 56, appears to be selling mineral land and buying cattle-grazing land in Wyoming, including the 140,000-acre Bolton Ranch near Rawlins. The media-shy Anschutz, who wouldn't comment, is also a player in downtown-Denver real estate. <p>
39. LESTER CLARK
Breckenridge, Texas
200,000 acres in Texas and South Dakota
Lester Clark, a teacher turned oil-field worker, has built a fair-sized land empire through shrewd trading. Now 80, he is always buying and selling ranches. The former Texas state legislator sometimes picks up portions of a famous spread that are for sale due to financial distress or some other reason. "I move in and out depending on conditions," he says. "But I like land. I like to look at it."<p>
40. JOE FINLEY JR. 
Encinal, Texas
200,000 acres in Texas
Joe Finley owns the sprawling Callaghan Ranch in South Texas, which was originally a sheep ranch founded in the 1860s by a Civil War captain. Finley grew up on the ranch because his father was the ranch manager. <p>
Following World War II, a combination of financial problems and the deaths of two of the ranch's three owners eventually provided a buying opportunity. Finley and his father, who had switched into cattle because of coyote attacks on the sheep, purchased the spread for something like three dollars an acre. Finley had no comment.<p>
41. GARVEY FAMILY
Wichita, Kansas, and elsewhere
200,000 acres in Nevada
From a base in Wichita, entrepreneur Willard Garvey has put together real-estate and agricultural businesses under the umbrella of Garvey Industries. The company's 200,000-acre holding located north of Winnemucca, Nevada, folds nicely into almost two million additional acres leased from the federal government.<p>
42. KILLAM FAMILY
Laredo, Texas
200,000 acres in Texas
In 1920, after serving in the Oklahoma legislature, O. W. Killam moved to South Texas on a wildcatter's hunch about what lay under the fabled streets of Laredo. His hunch turned out to be prescient. Killam ushered in the area's first oil strike and the beginnings of a family land dynasty.<p>
The Killam family has since diversified into ranching, banking, and philanthropy (Texas A&M International University's new campus is on land that was donated by the Killam family). O. W.'s son, Radcliffe Killam, ran the bulk of the show for decades but has handed over the reins to David, one of his three children.<p>
43. GAGE FAMILY
San Antonio and Marathon, Texas
190,000 acres in Texas
Sometime before 1890, E. L. Gage and his brother A. S. Gage took up cattle ranching in the Big Bend area of West Texas. Within 15 years, A. S. had emerged as the dominant player, acquiring nearly 400,000 acres. According to tax records, his decendants still hold nearly half of that, and they continue to run cattle on the land, although the business office has been moved 300 miles east to San Antonio. <p>
44. JAMES G. BOSWELL II
Los Angeles
185,000 acres in California and Arizona
James G. Boswell left Georgia and headed west in the 1920s, settling in the tiny town of Corcoran in California's fertile San Joaquin Valley. Thanks partly to the shrewd acquisition of federally subsidized water, Boswell developed the world's largest cotton operation and a fair-sized cattle feedlot in Arizona, too. He married into the Chandler family, then as now the owners of the Los Angeles Times.<p>
Boswell died in 1952. Since then his nephew James II, now 74, and grandnephew, James W., 44, have expanded <p>
J. G. Boswell Company into a marvel of agribusiness. In 1995, the Boswells bought out their local farming arch-rival, Fred Sayler, adding 25,000 acres to the family homestead. The family declined to comment.<p>
45. YETTA & PHIlLIP BIDEGAIN
Tucumcari, New Mexico
180,000 acres in New Mexico
In 1947, the owners of two-thirds of the huge, historic eastern New Mexico land grant given a century earlier to Pablo Montoya (see the Lane family, number 24) decided to cash out. They created six cattle ranches and put them up for sale at seven dollars an acre. A 117,000-acre section in the southwestern corner, informally known as Mesa Rica Country, was bought by Dr. Thomas Hoover and his wife, Clara, who already owned the adjacent  spread, the T-4.<p>
The expanded T-4 is now owned by a family limited partnership headed by the Hoovers' daughter, Yetta Bidegain, and her college-sweetheart husband, Phillip. They live on the land, and their son, Phillip, now heads the cattle operation. "We are stewards of the land," says Yetta. "This land belongs to a superior being."<p>
46. JOHN HAMPTON
Portland, Oregon
180,000 acres in Oregon and Washington
Call it upstreaming. Lester Hampton was running a retail lumberyard in Tacoma when his supply was cut off because of World War II. So he decided to switch sides, buying a mill and, later, timber acreage.<p>
His son John, 70, has aggressively expanded the family business, which is now called Hampton Affiliates. In less than three years, he has more than doubled the acreage Hampton owns, sometimes paying $4,000 an acre -- pricey for timber.<p>
47. M. H. W. "MONTIE" RITCHIE
Clarendon, Texas
180,000 acres in Texas
In 1876, legendary cattleman Charles Goodnight established a sprawling ranch in the middle of Indian country, in Texas's majestic Palo Duro Canyon (Goodnight's story was the inspiration for Larry McMurtry's novel Lonesome Dove). It was named the JA Ranch, after Jerry Adair, a Colorado investor who had put up two-thirds of the money. Adair's heirs eventually came to own what at one point was a million-acre spread.<p>
What remains of that spread is now owned by Adair's English-born grandson, Montie Ritchie, who studied at Cambridge University, moved to the ranch in 1931 "looking for adventure," as he once put it, and never left. He didn't return our calls.<p>
48. BROADBENTFAMILY

170,000 acres in Wyoming, Utah, and California
Utah native Joseph Ray Broadbent learned ranching in the 1930s while working for a trade group in California, then started out on his own in the lamb-feeding business in California's Imperial Valley. From this developed Broadbent Brothers Sheep, which has extensive operations in three states. Broadbent died last year at age 86. His widow, Lorna, is president of the operation. Their son Ray Broadbent oversees the California end. The family declined to comment.<p>
49. EMMETT F. McCOY
San Marcos, Texas
170,000 acres in Texas
Emmett McCoy's day job is chief executive officer of McCoy Corporation, a successful 106-store chain of building-supplies stores. Starting in 1987, McCoy used some of his profits from McCoy Corporation to acquire cattle ranchland around Balmorhea, in far-west Texas near the scenic Davis Mountains. Acquisitions have been made in both his name and the name of McCoy Land & Cattle. Says the 73-year-old ex-roofer, "You can look at land -- you can't look at a stock."<p>
50. WILLIAMS FAMILY
Saint Louis
170,000 acres in Texas and Kansas
In 1883, three Saint Louis businessmen and three cattlemen from Texas incorporated as Pitchfork Land and Cattle and began operating a 100,000-acre spread east of Lubbock, Texas. One of the Missourians, Eugene Williams, was a shoe manufacturer who had reportedly bought into the project sight unseen. Over the years, the Pitchfork expanded at every opportunity -- no small task considering that neither oil nor gas was ever found under the ranch. The operation now includes ranches in Kansas. Technically, the Pitchfork's main office is still in Saint Louis and is overseen by retired banker Eugene Williams Jr., 72, grandson of the founder. <p>

						While the Dow sets new highs, closed-end funds sell at record discounts.<p>
By Joanmarie Kalter<p>
Everyone loves a bargain, so why are investors ignoring fire-sale prices on closed-end mutual funds? <p>
Big markdowns (when a fund's market price drops below the value of the assets it holds) currently exist even among the most attractive closed-end funds. One example: <a name="NYSE:GHS"></a><b>Global Health Sciences</b> (NYSE: GHS), a biomedical fund. It returned 67 percent in 1995, yet currently sells for a 23 percent discount to its net asset value, or NAV.<p>
The flood of new closed-end funds that came on the market from 1992 to 1994 -- nearly 230 of the 567 now in business -- undoubtedly is one reason for the bargain prices. Also, many investors who bought shares at initial public offerings didn't realize that they would start off underwater -- Wall Street takes about 6 percent off the top for underwriting an issue. Adding injury to insult, closed-end-fund returns were pitiful in 1994: Foreign funds experienced negative net returns, averaging 19.7 percent that year, and bond funds tumbled 13.5 percent, according to Morningstar, the mutual-fund research firm based in Chicago. <p>
In 1995, when the U.S. stock market exploded, says Donald Cassidy, closed-end analyst for New York–based Lipper Analytical Services, disgruntled investors gave up on closed-end funds to chase the red-hot returns that were available in open-end funds.<p>
Of course, all of this may mean that "it's a great time to buy closed-end funds," says Michael T. Porter, a fund analyst for Smith Barney. "They're selling at fantastic discounts to their intrinsic worth." Tricia Rothschild, an associate editor at Morningstar, adds, "When everyone is throwing up their hands on an investment is exactly when you should be looking at it."<p>
As a matter of fact, discounts in certain closed-end funds have become so compelling that they have attracted the vulture investing crowd. Take famed value investor Michael Price, who is credited with helping to persuade an undervalued Chase Manhattan Bank to merge with Chemical in 1995. According to Securities and Exchange Commission filings obtained through the CDA/Spectrum research database, Price has been snapping up substantial stakes in at least six closed-end funds: <a name="NYSE:OST"></a><b>Austria Fund</b> (NYSE: OST), <a name="NYSE:CEE"></a><b>Central European Equity Fund</b> (NYSE: CEE), <a name="NYSE:CLM"></a><b>Clemente Global Growth Fund</b> (NYSE: CLM), <a name="NYSE:BTO"></a><b>John Hancock Bank & Thrift Opportunity</b> (NYSE: BTO), <a name="NYSE:NAF"></a><b>New Age Media Fund</b> (NYSE: NAF), and <a name="NYSE:GF"></a><b>New Germany Fund</b> (NYSE: GF). Porter speculates that Price may wait for the discount to narrow or else try to force the managers of those funds to narrow the discount through share buybacks or by converting the funds to an open-end format, which would eliminate the discounts.<p>
To reap profits from closed-end funds, investors need to understand exactly how they differ from their more familiar open-end cousins. Like an open-end fund, a closed-end fund is a portfolio of stocks or bonds -- either concentrated in U.S. securities or invested around the world. But that's where the similarities end. Investors buy and sell shares in an open-end fund directly from the fund, which issues new shares as new money flows in. A closed-end fund, on the other hand, issues a fixed number of shares in an IPO. After that, investors buy and sell shares on the market (usually the New York Stock Exchange) just as if they were trading a company stock. Unlike an open-end fund, which is always sold at the net asset value of the stocks and bonds it owns, a closed-end fund may be priced higher than the NAV (a premium) if demand is strong. When investors shun a closed-end fund, its shares trade below the NAV (a discount). <p>
This creates some interesting possibilities for someone who likes to purchase a dollar's worth of assets on the cheap. Let's say an investor buys a closed-end fund that has posted some disappointing returns lately. With an NAV of $10 per share, that fund could be trading at $8 -- a 20 percent discount. If the investments in the fund perform well and the NAV increases, the fund's shares should rise in value (as long as the discount remains the same). But a fund that's doing well is also likely to attract other investors. This, in turn, should narrow the discount, as more investor money seeks a limited number of shares. Say the fund's NAV rises to $12 a share -- a 20 percent increase. And suppose the markdown also narrows so that a share sells for $11. In this case, an investor would reap the increase in net asset value and get a boost from the narrowing discount as well -- for a total return of three dollars on an initial eight-dollar investment, or 38 percent.<p>
Historically, that's how savvy investors have profited from closed-end funds. They buy an out-of-favor issue that's ready for growth, hoping to capture the increase in its net asset value and be doubly rewarded as its discount narrows. Even if things don't work out and the NAV stays flat, an investment in a closed-end fund could be profitable as long as the discount narrows.<p>
Seth Anderson, professor of finance at the University of North Florida, has found that closed-end funds trade in bands, rising and falling but trending back toward an average near their NAV over time. He says an investor can buy at a 20 percent discount, sell when the discount narrows to 10 percent or 15 percent, and, after commissions, reliably outperform the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index by two percentage points a year.<p>
Still, in today's market for closed-end funds, an investor can't buy just any fund that sells at a discount and expect to make money. But lately, the discounts have actually been getting wider rather than narrower. The <a name="NYSE:GCH"></a><b>Greater China Fund</b> (NYSE: GCH), for example, sold for a 3 percent discount at the end of 1995. Although its net asset value rose 16.6 percent in the first nine months of this year, the share price actually fell by half a percent because the discount widened to nearly 17 percent.<p>
Instead of looking for just any discount, investors should "find a fund that's selling at a bigger discount than it usually does," says Smith Barney's Porter. In fact, investors should concentrate on funds selling near their record discount. Within that group, look for funds with features that could cause the discount to shrink -- for example, a manager with a sterling track record. In some cases, great managers who run open-end funds (and charge a load) also run closed-end funds that sell at a discount. That's the case with the highly respected team at Templeton; its closed-end <a name="NYSE:TDF"></a><b>Templeton Dragon Fund</b> (NYSE: TDF), which invests in Asia, currently sells for a 19 percent markdown. Another choice is the <a name="NYSE:UKM"></a><b>United Kingdom Fund</b> (NYSE: UKM), which is managed by Mercury Asset Management. United Kingdom has outperformed its benchmark for the past five years and now sells for 14 percent off its NAV.<p>
Investors shouldn't have any trouble finding funds that are selling at historically wide discounts. If, for example, a fund usually sells at 15 percent below its NAV but now sells for 20 percent off, that fund might be a good buy -- as long as similar funds are not selling at even higher discounts, of course. For a list of funds that are currently trading in the bargain basement relative to past discounts, see "A Value Buyer's Shortlist," on page 124.<p>
According to Morningstar, the average domestic-stock fund today is trading at a discount of 10.9 percent --  compared with 5.8 percent at the end of 1992. Foreign funds are currently selling at an average discount of 12.2 percent and bond funds at 9.4 percent. "The number of funds trading at more than a 15 percent discount is as large a list as we've seen in the last ten years," says Adam Shapiro, the president of Advantage Capital Management in Philadelphia.<p>
Another potentially profitable strategy: Ride the coattails of predatory buyers like Michael Price and hope they succeed in forcing the discounts to narrow. Because closed-end funds are selling at such large discounts to their intrinsic values, Smith Barney's Porter says, "I think you're going to see a new wave of buyer, a hostile type of shareholder who will come in and say, 'I want to see this discount closed.' In fact, we may be seeing signs of it already in the Austria Fund and the <a name="NYSE:SHF"></a><b>Schroder Asian Growth Fund</b> (NYSE: SHF), which have provisions allowing them to buy back shares or ultimately go open-end."<p>
The prices and the net asset values of closed-end funds are printed on Saturdays in Barron's and on Mondays in The Wall Street Journal. To compare a fund's current discount to its historic discount, either call the fund directly or check out Morningstar's Principia for Closed-End Funds (800-735-0700), which is available on computer disk or CD-ROM. Another resource is the Miami-based Thomas J. Herzfeld Advisors phone service -- Herzfeld Closed-End Funds on Call (305-274-5333) -- which gives daily prices, approximate discount/premium data, and addresses and phone numbers for more than 250 closed-end funds.<p>

						PROCRASTINATION PAYS
Thinking of buying shares of a mutual fund before year-end? Think again. Most funds pay out the capital gains they realized during the year in November and December; this could leave you with a big tax bill. Call the fund company to find out the date you can buy into a fund ex dividend and move those gains into next year.<p>
GOOD TIMING
Now may be a good time to buy stock in time-share companies -- while other investors are still focused on the $5.5 billion industry's sleazy past, says Brian Thorkelson of the <a name="FUND:LUOGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LUOGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lutheran Brotherhood Opportunity Growth Fund</b></a>. An industry shakeout that favored well-capitalized and better-managed companies has benefited <a name="NYSE:FFD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10545"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fairfield Communities</b></a> (NYSE:FFD ) and <a name="NASD:SIGR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Signature Resorts</b></a> (Nasdaq: SIGR). Thorkelson says Fairfield's 1997 earnings are projected to reach $1.52 a share, but may rise as high as $1.75. Signature recently doubled its size with the purchase of Avcom International and could earn $1.15 a share in 1997.<p>
THE 9.5 PERCENT SOLUTION
Although the 30-year bond yields 7 percent or less, there's an A-rated closed-end fund that pays 9.5 percent. <a name="NYSE:CSP"></a><b>The American Strategic Income Portfolio III</b> (NYSE: CSP) sells at a 14.4 percent discount to net asset value (see "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701I07.html">Why Pay Retail?</A>" ). The portfolio has been cleaned up since derivatives caused losses in 1994, says Michael Brilley, head of fixed income for Sit Funds. It's invested in quality diversified residential mortgages.<p>
BRIEFS
A recent study from Ibbotson Associates found that most so-called enhanced-index funds add little value.

						At the other end of the extreme is CGM Realty -- a fund that hopes big risk equals big reward.<p>
By Paul Davies<p>
While Cohen and steers perfect a tried-and-true buy-and-hold strategy, a newcomer to equity real-estate investment trusts is standing conventional wisdom on its head. Kenneth Heebner, the 56-year-old manager best known for his high-octane <a name="FUND:LOMMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LOMMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CGM Mutual</b></a> and <a name="FUND:LOMCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LOMCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CGM Capital Development Funds</b></a>, seems determined to break every rule of real-estate investing to get outsize returns from equity REITs for shareholders in his <a name="FUND:CGMRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CGMRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CGM Realty Fund</b></a>.<p>
Timing is everything, says Heebner. Take his latest position in hotel REITs: "I would expect to be there for six months, but you can't be sure." And don't even think of diversification: Heebner maintains just a handful of stocks. "By selecting a shorter list of stocks, I can add more value. If I needed 150 stocks to hedge against my own poor judgment, I should be in a different business."<p>
But there's no arguing with success. Launched in May 1994, his CGM Realty Fund rose nearly 20 percent in 1995, putting it among the top-returning REIT funds. In the first nine months of this year, the fund has returned 19 percent.<p>
Riding with Heebner may not be for everyone. His funds are famous for their outstanding performance and daunting volatility. CGM Capital Development Fund, for example, was up 99 percent in 1991, but down 23 percent in 1994. "Four out of five years he will be up -- but that fifth year will be real ugly," says Lou Stanasolovich, president of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh. Yet, over 20 years, CGMCapital Development has produced an average annual return of 21 percent, six percentage points better than the average U.S. growth fund.<p>
In REITs, Heebner says he looks for high-growth prospects. "If I think the cash flow is going to grow very rapidly, I can have a high dividend three years from now -- versus one that yields 8 percent today but isn't going to grow." <p>
Critics abound. Cohen, for one, calls Heebner's high-risk investing style "irresponsible." Heebner's retort: "I guess [Cohen] hasn't seen my results."<p>

						Recruiting healthy seniors is one key to future HMO profits<p>
By Leland Montgomery<p>
After a decade of rapid growth, managed-health-care companies have been quarantined in the sickroom of late. The industry's symptoms include rising costs, flagging profits, and wobbly stock prices. <p>
But some relief may be in sight. The tonic: a big push by health-maintenance organizations to enroll the 37.5 million (and counting) senior and disabled citizens covered under Medicare. At the moment, only 4.5 million Medicare recipients are signed up with a managed-care provider; the rest use private doctors, who are reimbursed by the federal Medicare system. This leaves a vast market -- one HMOs have found they can tap by offering low deductibles and other incentives. In just the past two years, the number of Medicare recipients enrolled in HMOs has swelled 34 percent.<p>
The new strategy comes at a welcome time for investors with a stake in the industry's fortunes. According to a survey of more than 200 HMOs conducted by InterStudy Publications, a health-care-research firm based in Minneapolis, only 61 percent earned any money in 1995. That compares with 88 percent in 1994. The problem is that HMOs haven't been able to raise prices enough to keep pace with increases in the cost of care.<p>
HMOs, in fact, have become one another's worst enemies. For a time, these businesses were able to expand rapidly by siphoning off business from fee-for-service health-care providers. But as HMOs have grown, they've begun bumping up against one another in the battle for new (and even existing) customers. The result is a squeeze on profits.<p>
Seeking to maintain the growth rates the market has come to expect, some HMOs have also compounded their difficulties by purchasing the health-care operations of traditional insurance companies. This tactic, pursued with the idea of converting the acquired business over to the HMO model, has proved both cumbersome and expensive. <p>
Last year, for instance, United HealthCare, an HMO based in Minneapolis, paid $1.7 billion to buy the 4.6-million-member MetraHealth organization, a joint venture between Travelers Insurance and Metropolitan Life. Similarly, Healthsource, an HMO based in Hooksett, New Hampshire, shelled out $231 million for the 2.4-million-member health-care unit of Provident Life and Accident Insurance. Both of the acquiring companies were optimistic about driving down costs. But those hopes were quickly dashed in 1996, when expenses at the insurance-based plans quickly exceeded the acquirers' rosy forecasts. Healthsource saw its medical-loss ratio (which measures direct health-care costs as a percentage of premiums) rise from 76.6 percent in 1995 to 78.4 percent in the first quarter of 1996. As a result, its stock got pummeled, falling 75 percent in the following months. Reality caught up with United HealthCare in July, when expenses rose from 79.7 percent in 1995 to 84.8 percent in the second quarter of 1996. News of this caused its shares to fall 30 percent in a single day.<p>
Going after the Medicare market looks much more promising for the HMOs. The idea is far from new, but early attempts by HMOs to serve Medicare patients proved frustrating because of government restrictions and fluctuating reimbursement levels. By 1991, few HMOs offering Medicare plans were left. Only in the past few years has the Health Care Financing Administration offered rates attractive enough to draw the HMOs back into the business. <p>
Now companies like PacifiCare Health Systems, based in Cypress, California, and Oxford Health Plans, based in Norwalk, Connecticut, are among the faster growing HMOs, largely because of their emphasis on Medicare. "It's a tremendous opportunity for the HMOs," says Clifford Hewitt, a health-care analyst with the New York–based brokerage firm Sanford Bernstein & Co.<p>
Senior citizens do pose a challenge for HMOs. Few are inclined to give up a long-term relationship with a trusted family doctor, and many are skeptical that an impersonal HMO will provide high-quality care.<p>
But HMOs have economics on their side, because traditional Medicare requires both an annual deductible and a 20 percent co-payment. In contrast, efficient HMOs are finding that it is possible to offer plans with no deductibles and with per-visit charges as low as five dollars. Some include free vision and dental care. <p>
Even with these kinds of incentives, Medicare customers can be highly profitable, according to InterStudy. HMOs collect an average premium of $1,764 a year for non-Medicare patients, while the average Medicare customer brings in $5,280 a year. So while the profit margins for the two groups are required by law to be identical, the Medicare member still brings in three times as much raw profit as the non-Medicare member. Thus, as long as an HMO doesn't attract a disproportionately large number of the oldest (and thus costliest) Medicare clients, it can reap big profits. <p>
At least for the moment, Washington appears content with this arrangement, according to Jack Rosen, CEO of Continental Health Affiliates, a provider of home health-care services based in Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey. Rosen notes that, because the large profits are helping to convert Medicare recipients to lower-cost HMOs, the government still saves money. "If you asked the people at Health and Human Services," says Rosen, "their response would be: 'We need to allow enough profit so that, as the older, sicker population signs up, there will be enough incentive for HMOs to serve them.'" <p>
<img src="/imgs/GRAPH1127b.GIF" width=475 height=210><p>
Not every HMO will succeed, however. "We've seen a huge increase in the number of providers," says Craig Schub, head of marketing for PacifiCare Health Systems. "But there are a lot of risks there that aren't immediately apparent." That's why investors should focus on companies experienced at controlling costs.<p>
One company to look at: <a name="NASD:PHSY"></a><b>PacifiCare</b> (Nasdaq: PHSYB). Already the largest and most experienced Medicare HMO in the country, PacifiCare is in the process of acquiring <a name="NASD:FHPC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13348"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>FHP International</b></a> (Nasdaq: FHPC), a California HMO  with a large Medicare membership. The transaction should enable PacifiCare to achieve both greater efficiency and increased marketing clout in its primary base of California, Oregon, and Washington. The company is also slated to receive a 6 percent rate increase in Medicare premiums covering its operations in southern California in 1997. <p>
Another front-runner is <a name="NYSE:UNH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15007"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>United HealthCare</b></a> (NYSE: UNH), which recently leaped aggressively into the market by winning a coveted $4-billion-a-year contract with the American Association of Retired Persons to insure approximately 5.7 million of AARP's 33 million members. Despite its recent problems with the MetraHealth operation, United historically has been one of the most profitable HMOs in the nation, and analysts are expecting it to regain that status. Eleanor Kerns, an analyst at Baltimore-based broker Alex. Brown, also believes that United has a good chance of raising its commercial rates in January, when nearly half of its contracts are up for renewal. <p>
<a name="NYSE:AET"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10039"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Aetna</b></a> (NYSE: AET), which sold off its property-casualty business last year to focus on health care, may be the company with the most turnaround potential. Analysts admire the efforts initiated by Aetna's management to transform the old-style health insurer into a cutting-edge HMO. To do this, Aetna bought U.S. Healthcare, one of the most profitable HMOs, and is seeking to apply U.S. Healthcare's more aggressive culture and business approach to managing the 12 million members in Aetna's HMO plans.<p>
In the short term, HMOs may continue to report disappointing earnings. But because Wall Street has battered virtually the entire industry, this may be a good time for investors to snap up shares of industry leaders on the cheap.<p>

						Can hard work and experience keep Cohen and Steers at the top of the heap?<p>
By Paul Davies<p>
Martin Cohen gleefully recalls the moment three years ago when a jealous investor accused him of practicing "voodoo real estate." At the time, real-estate prices were still tumbling in the wake of the go-go 1980s. Yet the fund run by Cohen and partner Robert Steers, which buys real-estate investment trusts, was surging ahead at a rate of 15 to 20 percent a year. "I don't understand it," the rival investor said. "I can't believe the returns you're getting. This must be a Ponzi scheme." <p>
Cohen and Steers, however, are hardly witch doctors or bunco artists. During the past five years, they've consistently outperformed their peers by displaying a better understanding of the market's dynamics than anyone else. Since its inception in 1991, their open-end mutual fund, Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, has bested all its competition and even beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index -- by an average of 1.5 percentage points a year. This year, the fund has continued its surge, returning 17.1 percent through mid-October, compared with the S&P 500's 15.4 percent.<p>
The success enjoyed by Cohen and Steers also parallels the resurgence of REITs as investments. As a class, REITs -- basically, listed securities that pool investors' money to buy property -- have done even better than stocks during the past five years, earning an average annual return of 13.8 percent versus 13.6 percent for the S&P 500. The subgroup of equity REITs -- those that invest in property as opposed to those that hold mortgages -- have also been extremely attractive as income investments. In the past ten years, they've paid an average annual yield of 7.8 percent, edging out both the 7.7 percent yield on ten-year Treasury bonds and the average 6.95 percent yield offered by the stocks that compose the Dow Jones Utilities Average. "I keep telling everybody, 'It doesn't get any better than this,'" says Cohen.<p>
The two partners rely mostly on hard work, discipline, and their uncanny talent for spotting new trends. "Cohen and Steers really understand real estate," says Robert Frank, director of research for the Baltimore-based brokerage firm Legg Mason. "They were in this business early. They know where all of the bodies are buried, and they have a good knack for picking stocks." <p>
Investors with long memories should be forgiven any lingering skepticism about REITs. In the 1970s, most REITs were run by "out-and-out crooks," says Lou Stanasolovich, the president of Legend Financial Advisors in Pittsburgh. Cebra Graves, an equity-fund analyst with Chicago-based Morningstar, notes that REITs were "badly structured in the '70s, and there were lots of hucksters running the funds. Then in the late '80s, real estate collapsed." Cohen and Steers began managing real-estate investments together in the 1970s, first at Citibank and then at National Securities & Research. By the time they established their own firm in 1986, many of the players in the field had gone broke or were in the process of doing so.<p>
Exercising the strict discipline necessary to succeed amid this troubled environment, Cohen and Steers focused on fundamentals, not fads. The selection process they developed then and have since refined is "90 percent science and 10 percent art," explains Cohen, 47, the president of the firm. (Steers, 43, serves as chairman.) <p>
Like other real-estate analysts, the two pore over appraisals and perform on-site surveys when evaluating the properties held by REITs. But success, says Cohen, a Brooklyn native who has an MBA from New York University, also involves picking the right sector of the market in which to target their investments. "You have to be early," he says. The fund's big move into retail REITs last fall -- shopping centers and strip malls -- is a typical example of how such a sector-oriented approach can pay off.<p>
"The world was totally gloomy about retail," recalls Cohen. "All the major retailers were struggling. Kmart was rumored to be going bankrupt, and even Wal-Mart was struggling to post any growth in same-store sales. Our analyst who follows retail companies was despondent.<p>
"But," he says with a grin, "they were the cheapest stocks in the entire industry. You were getting 8 to 9 percent dividend yields -- far above yields in the private real-estate market -- at a price-to-earnings ratio of only ten. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve had loosened monetary policy that July, and there's anywhere from a 9-month to a 15-month lag between a Fed action and its effect on the economy. We decided to overweight the sector." With retail REITs up over 14 percent in 1996, the gambit has already paid off handsomely for the fund.<p>
Cohen and Steers constantly tinker with the fund's weighting in different sectors, such as offices, apartments, and shopping centers. Yet they still manage to maintain a low portfolio turnover of 23 percent a year, thereby helping to minimize their expenses.<p>
"Marty's great strength is his ability to be a pure thinker," says Steers, who lives in Rye, New York, and whose hobby is playing ice hockey. "He is constantly coming up with unique ways to look at the industry."<p>
Recently, the fund has reduced its holdings in the retail arena -- to 30 percent of its portfolio (which reflects a normal market weighting) from its onetime high of 45 percent. They used the proceeds from selling retail REITs to up their stake in office REITs (to a weighting double that of the industry index). <p>
"We like offices because there is no new construction. Rents are rising and will continue to do so irrespective of the economy," Cohen says, adding that offices also offer a layer of protection that other real estate can't. "They will do well in a recession because, with long leases, the rents are locked in." Steers agrees and adds, "The [office sector] valuations are probably fair, but the growth prospects looking out three to five years are so solid in our view, and there is so little risk associated with them, that it makes our holdings worth keeping."<p>
Steers generally focuses more of his efforts on picking which individual REIT stocks are best for the fund to buy. While the 16-person firm operates out of modest offices in midtown Manhattan, they spend lots of time evaluating the major properties of the REITs the fund owns. The firm also maintains close ties to property managers and developers. <p>
When selecting property, Cohen and Steers look for strong management and well-structured deals. Contrary to popular belief, good real estate has less to do with "location, location, location" and more to do with "people and money," Cohen says. "To me, a class-A property is one that flows cash like crazy."<p>
That thinking is what prompted Cohen and Steers to dump their holdings in the Rockefeller Center Properties REIT two years before financial problems sent Rockefeller Center into bankruptcy. The financial structure of the deal that formed the REIT, Cohen says, was designed "to make money for the Rockefeller family but not for investors." The firm sold its holdings at $18 a share -- before they plummeted to as low as $4 a share in 1994. <p>
Cohen insists that their style isn't overly risky: "I hope we are criticized for being too conservative." <p>
The industry, too, has changed radically since its troubled early years. Today's property managers, argues Cohen, are interested more in increasing shareholder value than in merely obtaining higher management fees. And for investors worried that the bull market is nearing its end, REITs are an attractive defensive play because they often behave differently from stocks or bonds. Over the past ten years, the returns on equity REITs have correlated with the S&P 500's performance only 65 percent of the time, according to accounting firm Ernst & Young. When stocks took a beating in July, for example, REITs were up 5 percent. <p>
As REITs have worked their way back as credible mainstream investments, the amount of assets managed by Cohen and Steers has ballooned -- to $2.9 billion of the $61.6 billion invested in all equity REITs. Their flagship fund, Cohen & Steers Realty Shares, manages $1.4 billion.<p>
Fortunately for Cohen and Steers, the REIT market has grown along with the size of their fund. Since 1991, the total market capitalization of publicly traded REITs has increased 160 percent to more than $100 billion, according to the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts, a nonprofit industry association based in Washington, D.C. Overall, there are now more than 300 REITs. One reason for this revival: REITs can provide higher income to investors than other equity investments. Unlike corporate profits, which are first taxed and then paid out as dividends, REITs are not taxed as long as they pay out a minimum of 95 percent of their rental income each year. (These dividends are taxable income to REIT investors.) <p>
Despite its grown-up appearance, however, trading REITs is still a game suited more to small, nimble funds than large institutions. The average daily trading volume for the top 200 equity REITs is a mere 54,000 shares a day, but the normal-sized position for a fund like Cohen & Steers Realty Shares is ten times that amount. As a result, trading in and out of sectors, as is Cohen's preferred method, has to be accomplished over several weeks to avoid jostling share prices. <p>
Ken Gregory, publisher of No-Load Fund Analyst, worries that the burgeoning size of Cohen and Steers's fund could eventually hamper the ability of its two managers to invest in some of the smaller sectors of the REIT industry. The fund's largest shareholder, Kaspick & Company, a Palo Alto, California, asset-management firm for colleges and universities, has also shown some concern. It is considering shifting some of its investments into other REIT funds. "This is nothing against Cohen and Steers, but we like to be broadly diversified in every asset class and by portfolio-manager styles," says managing director Scott Kaspick. <p>

Cohen and Steers are also facing more and more competition. Since the end of 1991, the number of funds investing in REITs has grown from 6 to 51, according to Morningstar. Many of these funds are small enough to navigate the market more nimbly. They include <a name="FUND:CREEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CREEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Columbia Real Estate Equity</b></a> ($30 million in assets), <a name="FUND:Crabbe"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/Crabbe"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Crabbe Huson Real Estate Investment</b></a> ($14 million), <a name="FUND:LLREX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LLREX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Longleaf Partners Realty</b></a> ($41 million), and <a name="FUND:CGMRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CGMRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>CGM Realty</b></a> ($86 million). In fact, CGM, which tends to dart in and out of thinly traded REITs (see "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701I04.html">The Call of the Wild</A>") has lately outperformed Cohen & Steers by a solid margin. <p>
"You'll see a more competitive environment going forward," says Cohen. Yet he insists that the size of the firm can also be an advantage. "Go to almost every one of our competitors," he says, "and you'll see, at most, one manager and an analyst trying to cover 300 REIT issues. We have an investment staff of eight -- we simply start out with a better chance of success."<p>

						Egypt, the linchpin of ancient empires, is the key to the Middle East and its oil<p>
By Walter Russell Mead<p>
The most important country at President Clinton's October summit on the Middle East was the one that didn't come. Egypt, the largest and strongest Arab nation, was the first to make peace with Israel. As long as the Egyptian army stays in its barracks, Israel faces no serious military challenge to its security. And as long as Egypt gives political cover to the Saudis and Kuwaitis, oil will flow from the Persian Gulf to gas pumps in Cleveland and Atlanta. Congress knows Egypt's importance: Egypt is, after Israel, the largest single recipient of U.S. foreign aid.<p>
Negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis are Egypt's great chance to escape its own poverty. Peace in the Middle East can bring the billions from private investors necessary to create jobs for the millions who live in Cairo's slums. It will keep a stream of tourists climbing the pyramids, booking hotel rooms, and hiring guides. It could make the land bloom, just as the summer floods that washed down the Nile for millennia turned the desert green.<p>
But peace is a fragile dream in the Middle East. In 1995, an Israeli extremist murdered Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin for making peace with the Palestinians. In 1981, Muslim fanatics assassinated Egyptian president Anwar Sadat for making peace with the Israelis. Today in Hebron, Jewish settlers proclaim it a holy duty to drive all Arabs out of the land God promised to the Jews. In Cairo, terrorist groups wage a campaign to build a revolutionary Islamic state.<p>
Time is not on the side of the peacemakers. Egypt's population is projected to double to 120 million by the year 2026. Only a massive influx of American foreign aid -- $2.2 billion in 1995 -- has kept inflation under control and allowed the country to invest in some of the infrastructure its exploding population requires. Unfortunately, the U.S. now looks set to cut back on its foreign aid, even to major recipients like Egypt.<p>
Egypt's economy must grow at 7 percent a year -- the kind of growth produced by the economic miracles of East Asia -- simply to keep living standards from falling, and it must create approximately 500,000 new jobs to keep unemployment stable. With per-capita gross domestic product at a miserable $2,400 a year, there isn't much room for error.<p>
Unfortunately, after a trip to the country, I have to conclude that the best-intentioned efforts of U.S. and other international economists and planners aren't working very well. We have encouraged the Egyptian government to apply the same economic cookie cutter -- privatize government enterprises, reduce inefficient workforces, bring in international capital -- that experts have applied from Buenos Aires to Moscow. Such a program will not work in Egypt.<p>
This does not mean that I've returned a total pessimist. Egypt has muddled through for centuries, and the country has strengths that aren't fully appreciated in the West. In our fixation with Iran, where a radical Islamic regime overthrew an American ally and turned the country from one of America's most reliable friends to one of its most bitter foes, we tend to ignore the unique character of Egypt's Islamic tradition -- and the way that it is shaping a specifically Egyptian response to 20th-century capitalism.<p>
The streets of Cairo may be as close as human beings can come to creating absolute chaos. In and around the great Khan al-Khalili bazaar, the medieval streets are narrow and twisted. But that doesn't stop taxis, cars, and delivery vans from trying to make their way past mounds of exotic, sharp-smelling spices, heaps of beans and rice, piles of tourist bric-a-brac (tiny pyramids, sphinx figurines, reproductions of ancient inscriptions on papyrus, hand-carved chess sets, and, of course, T-shirts), crowds of shopkeepers, heavily burdened laborers, and stunned, bewildered tourists. Trucks, pedestrians, and bicycles try to thread through the camel market, where camels are sold for food as well as transportation. In other parts of the city, great concrete overpasses try to move the traffic over the crowded ancient streets, but nothing affects the constant congestion of this dust- and smog-choked city of almost seven million.<p>
Nobody thinks much about lanes; Egyptian drivers seek open space either in their own lane or on the opposite side of the street. Car horns -- what locals call the Egyptian brake pedal -- blare constantly. Obeying traffic lights is optional.<p>
You could, I suppose, argue that this is the triumph of pure laissez-faire. Without all those government regulations, every driver uses private initiative to maximize his speed. The result, theory tells us, is that the invisible hand guides Cairo's traffic better than policemen and stop signs ever could.<p>
I had had quite enough of watching the invisible hand by the time I arrived at the Finance Ministry. But the minister's office was cool, quiet, and civilized. His secretary brought me a cup of hot, sweet coffee -- and didn't make a sound as she carried it over the lush Oriental carpet. I sank back into my comfortably upholstered chair and sighed with contentment. By the time the eloquent finance minister, Mohieddin Elghareeb, began to explain government policy, I was ready to consider the possibility that Western economic theory wasn't laughably irrelevant.<p>
American diplomats and Egyptian leaders think that the country's problems are economic and demographic. Egypt's population is growing at 2.3 percent a year -- a horrendous problem for a country where 95 percent of the land is uninhabitable. "We have two basic problems," Elghareeb explained to me. "First, we need to attract more investment. Our savings rate is too low, and too many Egyptians send their savings abroad." Like rich Latin Americans, who spend their money and often educate their children overseas, rich Egyptians have been famous for decades for their spending sprees in the casinos and fleshpots of Europe.<p>
"In 1995," he continued, "we made some progress in bringing Egyptian capital back into the country, but we have not yet attracted enough foreign money." He said that Egypt needs to double or triple foreign investment from the 1993 level of about $453 million and pointed to the success of Malaysia, which, with a much smaller population, attracted almost ten times that amount.<p>
"The second problem," Elghareeb told me, "is the legacy of the past." State socialism in the 1950s and 1960s has left the Egyptian economy crippled and driven some of the most energetic and creative businesspeople out of the country. Since the mid-1980s, the Egyptian government has been laying the foundation for economic reform. The role of government planning in the economy has been scaled back: Regulations on foreign-capital investment have been liberalized, the banking sector has been opened up, and many controls over prices have been abolished. Key industries such as tourism have benefited the most from liberalization, and the foreign exchange that tourists bring to Egypt has become an engine of growth.<p>
Now the government is looking to privatize some of the industries that former president Gamal Nasser nationalized in the 1950s and 1960s. Politicians have stuffed state industries with their relatives, in-laws, and old friends from the village. Turn these industrial turkeys over to private industry, figure Egypt's strategists, and government spending will shrink, productivity will rise, and foreign investment will pour in.<p>
It won't work. Don't take my word for it -- just read the centuries-old history of Egypt as a "developing" country evident in the buildings of Cairo. For example, the 12th-century Citadel, originally built by Saladin, the famously chivalrous Islamic ruler who waged a jihad against the Crusaders, rises above the graveyards and housing developments of the eastern part of the city. By the time Napoleon's army occupied Egypt in 1798, much of the Citadel had fallen into decay, but it was extensively repaired and rebuilt by the great Muhammad Ali, the first of Egypt's modernizing rulers.<p>
Ali is a key figure in Egyptian and world history. He was one of the first rulers of a non-Western country to understand that, to survive, his country had to import ideas and technology from the West. As I wandered through his carefully preserved palace, I saw the heavy, elaborate wood furniture he imported from France, and I marveled at the tapestries, clocks, and other Western novelties he introduced.<p>
The three-year French occupation opened a period in which Britain and France competed for influence and economic control. At the opening of the Suez Canal 127 years ago, the empress Eugénie of France and the Prince of Wales attended a glittering series of receptions and balls, capped by a performance of Verdi's Aida, which had been commissioned for the occasion.<p>
Since Napoleon's time, the  Egyptian ruling elite -- headed at times by khedives, kings, or presidents -- has tried to do two things: adopt enough Western technology and techniques to strengthen Egypt against outsiders, and spread enough money around domestically to keep everybody happy. Over and over again, Egypt's relationship with the West concentrated power and money in the hands of small, privileged groups of elites -- even as those elites changed. Government officials and members of the aristocracy learned foreign languages, studied in foreign schools, and acted as intermediaries between foreign investors and governments and the Egyptian economy. Modern Egyptian politics has revolved around a struggle between the "ins" at any given moment -- the people with access to Western capital and connections -- and a powerless majority. Nationalism has been the rallying cry of the impoverished, as have socialism and Islam.<p>
Egypt's dilemma today isn't new -- centuries of contact with the developed West have thoroughly defined the problem. Opening the country to foreign investment tends to concentrate wealth. Commercial agriculture pushes peasants off the land and into the cities. A drive for economic efficiency reduces employment opportunities in the short run. The biggest danger, of course, is that economic reform will do just enough to loosen the repression that keeps the lid on in Egypt, but not enough to prevent the rise of some radical political regime. Today, we call that the Iran scenario. In the 1950s, it produced the radical pan-Arab regime of Nasser.<p>
Cairo, like all big cities in the developing world, is a magnet for the ambitious, who want a better future than their rural villages can offer, and for the desperate, who cannot earn a living from the land. I wanted to see the place where all these people had come from. A driver I met in Cairo came from a large family headed by a lay Muslim religious leader in a village outside of Cairo. It was a chance to see rural Egypt and make my first contact with the country's Islamic traditions.<p>
As my Mercedes passed the last of Cairo's straggling cement-block suburbs and reached the rich farm country south of the city, the land turned shockingly green. In the village itself, scores of children flocked around our car as we slowly negotiated the narrow dirt road that ran between tightly packed two- and three-story houses, shops, and mosques. My guide, born and raised in the village, was eager to show me the glories of the place. Our parade went past cow barns and thatch-roof donkey stalls that looked like something out of a Christmas manger scene. I admired the ancient rusty and complicated irrigation pumps and the intricate network of channels through the fields. The pump that brings Nile water up to the farmland is now electrified, and chemical fertilizers are used in the fields to grow new strains of crops. But the labor in the fields hasn't changed much from the days when Cleopatra passed by in her barge.<p>
My guide invited me into the spotlessly clean (the floors were all dirt, but they had been rigorously swept) though spartan home. The kitchen and fireplace were outside, in a courtyard behind the house. His mother was baking bread over burning dung in a traditional brick oven. His father, who appeared to be in his mid-60s, offered me tea as we sat on the low wooden chairs and iron-framed cots in the largest room in the house. I tried not to think about how dangerous the water must be and offered cigarettes all around, smoking one myself to be sociable -- my sixth in 20 years.<p>
The problems the village faces, he said, are simple. Taxes are too high, and the young people can't find work, so they leave for the city.<p>
On the other hand, because a high-ranking government official was born in the village, it has been able to get electricity. According to my host, the people of the village are extremely pious and have built dozens of mosques.<p>
At this point, we were joined by the bearded fortysomething muezzin -- a Muslim crier who calls the hour of daily prayers -- of one of the mosques, and the discussion turned to religion. We talked about how life without God isn't worth living, how all of us must look to God's mercy on Judgment Day, and how important it is to raise children with a strong religious faith. The sunset call to prayer sounded, but with exquisite courtesy, my host and his friends continued our conversation. They wanted to know how Americans felt about God and Egypt and were happy to hear that, in general, we have a positive impression of both. A few more cigarettes and glasses of hot, sweet tea and it was time to go.<p>
As we wandered the dirt roads around the village searching for Cairo in the moonlight, I had plenty of time to think about the implications of what I'd seen in city and town for the plans of the bureaucrats. Consider privatization, for example. Where were the people who were leaving the village going to find jobs? Mass layoffs in privatized state firms would destabilize Egypt. But from the government's perspective, the starving peasant who would no longer find work as a tea boy in an Egyptian office, the underemployed assembly worker, and the day laborer aren't the biggest problems. The unemployed university graduate, a potential professional revolutionary, is much more dangerous -- which makes reducing the bloated ranks of middle management in the state sector politically explosive. <p>
The Egyptian government's approach to these problems combines a modicum of economic liberalization and tourism promotion with political crackdowns. Economic liberalization is intended to stimulate investment but cannot be permitted to cause mass layoffs. The political crackdown aims to crush the more violent opposition. But one policy inevitably contaminates the other. Take the telecom industry. One of the most effective methods anywhere in the world for opening up an economy, reducing costs, and bringing money into government coffers for social programs is to privatize the telecommunications system. In Chile and Argentina, telephone privatization was a major element in economic-reform programs. This would, in theory, work in Egypt, but politics gets in the way. As one cabinet minister told me, Egypt can't privatize its phone system because its security forces depend on wiretaps for the suppression of terrorism.<p>
I wondered how foreign investors felt about this mixture of economic reform and political constraint. From their point of view, the whole world is begging for investment. I could imagine them asking, Why should we get ourselves tangled up in Egypt's political problems? I thought a visit to the stock exchange would give me a quick read on investor attitudes.<p>
Even the grit and grime that blows in from the desert to coat the buildings and surfaces in Cairo can't hide the elegance and solidity of the 84-year-old stock-exchange building, a reminder of the time when Egypt was one of the world's favorite emerging markets. Briefly after World War II, the Cairo Stock Exchange was actually the third largest in the world.<p>
But then came the revolution of 1952 and 40 years of Arab socialism. The best companies were nationalized and key industries brought under state control; the stock exchange became a sleepy place, with few shares traded and little money made or lost.<p>
Now Egypt wants to wake up the stock market. Government-owned companies are being spun off and sold to private investors through stock offerings: The number of shares has grown from 76 million in 1981 to almost 500 million today, and the number of companies registered on the exchange went from 63 in 1981 to about 700 in 1994.<p>
But all this hasn't restored the stock market to its old glory. Inside the imposing building, more traders seemed to be playing video games than trading securities. The office of the president is a dusty, badly maintained room; his secretary has a desk that would have been at home in a thrift shop.<p>
But like stock-exchange officials everywhere, those on the Cairo exchange were optimistic. I could see their point. Investors might or might not make money on the deals as privatization continued, but investment houses certainly would. <p>
The director was enthusiastic for another reason as well -- one that I admit I hadn't considered. Privatization would actually make Egypt's economy more acceptable to Islamic fundamentalists, he felt. The Koran condemns lending money at interest -- commercial banking -- but praises ventures in which the partners put up shares in equity and participate in the division of profits and losses. In other words, investment banking and stock markets are, when properly administered, very Islamic. The Prophet Muhammad came from a merchant family, and Mecca was the most developed trading city of its region during the Prophet's lifetime. Islam is not necessarily an anti-business ideology.<p>
Anyone who wants to begin to understand Egypt needs to study not just Islam in general but the Egyptian tradition of that religion. The 14th-century Sultan Hasan Mosque, widely considered the greatest Egyptian architectural achievement of its time, is a good place to start. Part house of worship, part house of study, the Sultan Hasan Mosque has a cool courtyard that is an oasis from the noise, heat, and dust of the city. Flanking its distinctive mihrab -- the recess in a mosque's walls that indicates the direction of Mecca -- are four serene halls, each built for the use of one of the four principal schools of orthodox Sunni Muslim thought: the Hanafi, the Shafii, the Maliki, and the Hanbali. Egypt's traditional tolerance is the theme of the Sultan Hasan Mosque, where the four great halls stand for peaceable coexistence among rival theologies. It's as if Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome had four chapels: for Roman Catholics, Lutherans, Presbyterians, and Baptists.<p>
Most Egyptians are Sunnis, not Shiites, and for most of Muslim history Egypt has been a center of scholarship and high Islamic culture. This counts. Unlike the chip-on-their-shoulders Shiites who currently run Iran and think history went horribly wrong soon after the death of the Prophet, Egypt's Islamic theologians have a tradition of subtle and sophisticated attempts to relate Islam to the wider world.<p>
Ibn Khaldun, a 14th-century scholar who spent much of his life in Cairo and one of the world's great historians, typifies the thoughtful, rational approach to Islam that runs like a river through Egyptian culture. In a controversy over whether doctors should rely on medical science or on religious traditions to treat their patients, Ibn Khaldun wrote: "The Prophet (peace be upon him) was sent to teach us the religious law, not medicine or any other ordinary matter." The Koran, in other words, is a guide to religion, but observation and scientific study are necessary to understanding the world around us.<p>
More recently, Muhammad 'Abduh (1849–1905) worked to reconcile Islamic faith with Western ideas. For 'Abduh, the Koran lays out the guiding principles of life, but these must be adopted to special circumstances before they are codified into laws. Islamic societies, he taught, should not be restricted by traditional interpretations of shari'a -- Islamic law. Instead, shari'a must be constantly updated to fit the circumstances in which Muslims live.<p>
While 'Abduh remains a controversial figure, the belief that shari'a and the modern world do not have to be at war with each other is a key idea throughout much of the Islamic world and especially in Egypt. Most of the Egyptians that I talked with do not want to do away with traditional Muslim laws and customs altogether, but neither do they favor narrow interpretations of shari'a that leave no room for the realities of the contemporary world.<p>
The effort to reconcile religion with the modern world is not just an Islamic problem, of course. When ultra-Orthodox Jews stone cars in Jerusalem's streets on the Sabbath, or when Christian fundamentalists seek to block the study of evolution in American public schools, I see parallels to Egypt's struggles with the meaning of Islam. All three great faiths of the family of Abraham took shape before the birth of modern science, and all have struggled and still do struggle to adjust to it.<p>
It is by no means certain that Egypt's traditional brand of cosmopolitan and tolerant Islam will win out. The radical and violent wing of Islamist opposition in Egypt includes two main groups: the Gamaat Islamiya and the Jihad. These groups have roots in Egypt's poorest region -- the south -- and they attract substantial support at the lower end of the social scale. In southern Egypt and among the slums of Cairo, a combination of poverty, suspicion of government, and alienation from Egypt's traditionally moderate Muslim establishment have produced a violent movement responsible for 920 deaths since 1992. Most of the victims have been Egyptian, and the causes often have as much to do with local feuds as with abstract ideologies, but there is no doubt that Egypt is the unwilling host to murderous campaigns of terror aimed at revolutionary social change under the banner of Islam.<p>
Egypt has another type of Islamic opposition grouped largely around the Muslim Brotherhood, which includes many of the well educated but underemployed or unemployed. It was founded in 1928 and declared illegal in 1954. Driven underground, the Brotherhood did not disappear, and despite recurring crackdowns, it has gradually reinserted itself into Egyptian politics. It is committed to bringing Egypt's laws into conformity with its interpretation of Muslim legal norms, but this does not necessarily mean the violent overthrow of the government. Many Egyptians both inside and outside the government hope that economic progress plus political liberalization will lead to the integration of the Brotherhood into "normal" politics.<p>
Before I visited Egypt, like most Westerners I assumed that radical Islamism in Egypt would be the voice of economic protest against the regime. In part, that's true. But the picture is much more complicated. Some of the government's most unpopular reforms -- a land reform, for example, that shortened rural leases, forcing peasants to pay higher rents for their plots -- have actually been backed by some of Egypt's most conservative Islamic groups. The indefinitely long leases that Nasser's socialism introduced, said the sheikhs of Islam, were contrary to Koranic practice.<p>
How do these forces balance out? Egypt could go the way of Iran. Economic misery could increase the size of the small but well-financed Islamic extremist groups.<p>
But I don't believe that has to happen. To an extraordinary degree for a developing country, Egypt's Western-educated officials and traditional Islamic leaders aren't locked into knee-jerk opposition. Intellectuals from both camps operate within a centuries-old debate about how to accommodate Western science and economics to Islamic thought and religion. Unless the current regime of Hosni Mubarak tightens the screws of repression too forcefully (either through miscalculation or out of economic necessity), it is hard to imagine a replay of Iran, where the Shah and his Western-educated government were disdainfully distant from the country's religious powers. <p>
Once, Egypt was the greatest power and center of civilization west of China. It was the breadbasket of the Roman Empire, the source of the grain with which the Caesars fed their people. Its conquest by the warriors of Islam established the new religion as a world power; the defeat of the Crusaders here signaled the end of their dream of rebuilding Christian kingdoms in the Muslim Near East.<p>
Today, Egypt is as important to the U.S. as it ever was to any of our imperial predecessors. It is in our self-interest to create an economic miracle on the shores of the Nile, and for that we need peace in the Middle East. A real peace between Israel and the Arab world could unleash forces of economic growth and investment in the Middle East that could transform the economic condition of millions of ordinary Egyptians. Anything less is unlikely to be enough.<p>

Investors have no business holding cash. At least that's Wall Street's current mantra, learned by rote during a decade-long market rally. But there are good reasons to have some ready money (90-day Treasurys, money-market funds, and the like) in your portfolio.<p>
The most important: diversification. Stocks and bonds often move together -- both markets frequently slump when interest rates spike higher. And even some individual international markets and some specific international stocks zig and zag with the U.S. market. That leaves cash as one of the few mainstream investments that provide reliable diversification.<p>
Sure, cash offers lower long-term returns -- but not as much as some investors fear. According to data provided by Ibbotson Associates, since 1950 a portfolio of large-company stocks that matched the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index delivered annual returns of 12.5 percent. By contrast, a portfolio composed of 80 percent large-company stocks and 20 percent cash gained 11.2 percent.<p>
And in exchange for giving up some return, an investor was rewarded with lower risk. The portfolio with cash was 21 percent less volatile. <p>
The results were similar for two small-company stock portfolios -- one all stocks and one with a 20 percent stake in cash. The cash portion reduced returns modestly, from 15 percent to 13.3 percent -- but it also reduced the investor's risk (as measured by standard deviation) from 22.4 percent to 17.5 percent. <p>
An investor who holds cash as part of a portfolio can create new combinations of risk and reward. Note that the portfolio composed of 80 percent small-company stocks and 20 percent cash not only outperforms the cashless large-stock portfolio (a 13.3 percent return versus a 12.5 percent return) but does so with less risk than the cashfree small-stock portfolio and only slightly more risk than the cashfree large-stock portfolio (a standard deviation of 17.5 percent versus 15.7 percent).<p>
True, a genuine long-term investor with the stomach to withstand market gyrations doesn't need cash to smooth out those bumps. He could hold a portfolio of small-company stocks through thick and thin and reap the higher returns that come with the added volatility. But even such a paragon of patience might want to hold cash to take advantage of bargains when they appear -- in a general market downturn, say, or when a sector crashes, as technology stocks did this summer. <p>
In the race to keep pace with the market quarter in and quarter out, professional investors often don't have the luxury of holding cash. Individual investors who worry more about meeting long-term goals than about falling behind an index month to month can afford to be more flexible.<p>

Professional money managers are quick to scoff at market timers, who shift large sums of money from stocks to cash when they think a market downturn is due. But the scoffers themselves often engage in more subtle and insidious forms of investment timing designed to improve their job security -- often at the expense of their portfolios' long-term returns.<p>
Most of the timing behavior revolves around quarterly performance evaluations. Just as an unscrupulous chemistry student will falsify his lab book near semester's end, managers spend considerable energy touching up their portfolios before they disclose them to clients. <p>
The most common ploy is to dump shares of a stock that has inflicted losses on the portfolio. "When December approaches, you might want to blow out of a bad stock you'll soon have to show clients you're holding," says Samuel Hayes, Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking at Harvard Business School.<p>
Such late-year selling used to result in a January rebound for stock prices as managers moved in to snap up bargains among the discarded shares -- the so-called January effect. But the calendar has moved up: "The selling starts earlier now -- in September or early October," says Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York. "Most of the dumping is over by late October, because all the guys who window-dress are trying to beat the other guys to the trade. That's why you see the January effect in early December now."<p>
Another reason for the hurry: Clients now closely watch trades that occur near the end of the reporting period, and if managers sell in the middle of the quarter, clients aren't as likely to notice the transaction.<p>
If the anecdotal evidence is unconvincing, consider a 1991 study by Josef Lakonishok and three of his colleagues at the University of Illinois that confirmed the tendency among managers to sell laggards near the end of the year. They found that during the first three quarters of the year the average fund sells 32 percent more of its big losers (relative to its holdings of those losers) than it sells of all stocks. That percentage rises to 42 percent in the fourth quarter. <p>
Other kinds of even more dubious timing take place at the end of a reporting period. Example: At the end of a quarter, a manager might buy 5,000 or so shares of a thinly traded stock that's already in his or her portfolio. That action alone might be enough to temporarily boost its price. <p>
Finally, Metz notes that timing issues play out differently in different market sectors. For example, if you run a small-company fund, you can keep some losers in your portfolio -- because nobody will recognize their names. Large-company and balanced funds, on the other hand, have to be especially careful about holding losers near quarter's end. "People invest in those funds because they want to limit their risk," says Metz. "They won't tolerate it if you own cats and dogs."

Before you start feeling too sorry for the pros, please remember that their sheer size and financial resources do give them the edge in a few areas. And because of those advantages, they can profitably pursue strategies -- most involving short-term trading opportunities -- that individual investors can't. The pros have most of us beat hands down in the following areas:<p>
Access to hot IPO's. Most of the gains in initial public offerings come right out of the box, and the pros know that. That's why they line up -- in order of size and financial clout -- to snap up the most exciting offerings while they're still hot. Brokers use the shares to reward their biggest clients, leaving most individual investors out in the cold. <p>
Trading costs. Portfolio managers can trade at so-called crossing networks, which arrange transfers between large-scale buyers and sellers at a reduced cost: around four to six cents a share on a 100,000-share transaction. That compares with 30 to 35 cents a share if you're trading 100 shares of a $30 stock on your own. The crossing networks also let the pros buy at the median between the bid and asked quotes. Individual investors often pay the higher quote when they buy and receive the lower when they sell. <p>
Information. Every investor is supposed to have the same access to information about public companies, but that isn't how it works. "An analyst's most recent report may say a company will earn $3 -- but as the announcement gets nearer, he may 'whisper' to money managers that he thinks earnings could be closer to $2.90," says Dan Cardell of Weiss, Peck & Greer in Chicago. "There won't be a surprise on the institutional side, but there will be a surprise for individual investors."<p>
Help. Most pros are backed up by traders who can sit in front of their screens all day watching for short-term opportunities. Even money managers who take a long-term approach to investing use that information to make quick buy and sell decisions. Say a company's share price takes a temporary dip for no apparent reason. The trader can quickly phone analysts, who will call up information about the firm and report back to the manager with a buy or sell recommendation. All this happens before you even know the stock has taken a hit. That's one reason an investor like Michael Price of Mutual Shares -- hardly a day trader -- sits in the same room as his trading staff.<p>
That said, immediate access to information tends to encourage short-term trading and second-guessing. Fact is, the pros often abuse their resources -- and given the chance, individual investors would probably do even more damage to their own portfolios with these tools. Maybe we're better off sipping our coffee over The Wall Street Journal. <p>

						Wall Street's money managers earn millions working for America's biggest investors -- which is exactly why you can beat them at their own game<p>
By Clint Willis<p>
When Pensions & Investments magazine ranked the 250 largest money-management firms last spring, the smallest firm on the list, Brandywine Asset Management, oversaw $4.7 billion in assets. The biggest, <A HREF="http://personal.fidelity.com/funds/fund_data/fund_data.html">Fidelity Investments</A>, controlled $431.3 billion. The fees for managing all this money pay for a lot of information and people. Fidelity, for example, claims a research and trading staff of 323.
How can a small investor like you even hope to compete with these titans? <p>
Actually, it's pretty easy. <p>
The reason is that professional money managers at the big investment firms are handicapped when it comes to achieving the highest possible returns. They have to worry about keeping their jobs. And keeping their jobs isn't about maximizing performance. It's about meeting the varied demands of pension trustees, 401(k) sponsors, shareholders, and other clients. <p>
Money managers at the big firms must put huge sums to work every day, yet they can buy only readily saleable assets (in case a big customer wants its money back). They must avoid hard-to-explain investments (no matter how attractive). And they need to steer clear of anything that might cause a short-term surprise (even when the long-term prospects are solid and bright). These requirements mean constant compromises that can reduce the potential for maximum returns.<p>
To keep their jobs, professional money managers typically invest in assets that are popular with other money managers, that get good press, and that are easily explained to folks who know just enough about stock picking to be dangerous. In other words, the pros end up buying expensive investments and shunning cheap ones. <p>
Is it any wonder, then, that 80 percent of these highly paid professionals underperformed the market during the past decade? There are exceptions -- Warren Buffett comes to mind, as well as...hmm....<p>
Of course, the important thing to remember in all of this is that your situation as an individual investor is quite different. As someone with no clients to please and no policy guidelines to meet, you have a huge advantage: You can choose the best investments you can find and hold them until they fulfill the expectations that led you to buy them in the first place.<p>
The good news doesn't stop there. The so-called amateur investor who studies the institutional biases of the professionals -- such as when the big guys overpay and what investments they won't touch -- can use this knowledge to beat the giant institutions at their own game. <p>
Before you can chop down the beanstalk, though, you have to know something about how the big guys really operate. But don't fret -- we're here to help.<p>
We discussed our thesis with 50 money managers, analysts, academics, and investment consultants. We asked each one to tell us about the constraints that hem in even the savviest of pros. Our plan from there was fairly straightforward: Develop a list of these handicaps and then turn them topsy-turvy -- convert the pros' nightmares into positive strategies that individual investors can easily adopt. Along the way, we also inquired about specific investments the pros would dearly love to own but, for one reason or another, just can't (more on this later).<p>
The first thing the experts told us (which we'll call Constraint Number One) is that most money managers have such huge sums to invest that they can't bother with really small companies. As a rule, major institutions won't look at a company with a market capitalization (stock price times number of shares outstanding) of less than $500 million. Lance James, a portfolio manager with mutual fund <a name="FUND:BAETX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BAETX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Babson Enterprise II</b></a>, explains: "You have so much money to put to work that in order to buy a meaningful position you have to buy a significant percentage of the outstanding stock -- which could knock the price up [in a small-company stock] before you even finish buying." <p>
Constraint Number Two: The pros are obsessed with the short term, because their clients are. "When I was running pension money, we'd sit down quarterly with a client who had a stack of papers ranking each of my holdings by performance," recalls Michael Murphy, chief investment officer at Murphy Investment Management in Half Moon Bay, California. "It was really painful. When they saw a loser, they'd say, 'Why do you own this?' And when they saw a loser you'd defended the last quarter, they'd say, 'Why do you still own this?' Rather than explain yourself, you might just sell the thing and take a loss."<p>
Some managers respond to this pressure by buying the stocks or sectors that are hot now -- hoping they'll stay that way at least through the end of the quarter. "When <a name="NYSE:MRK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merck</b></a> was selling at 10 times earnings in the '70s, no one was interested," says Jim Crabbe, co-founder of Crabbe Huson Group, a money-management firm in Portland, Oregon. "Now that it's at 40 times earnings, everyone wants it in their portfolios." <p>
Bill Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital, a money-management firm in Seattle, adds: "It's like a beauty pageant where you're not trying to find the prettiest contestant -- instead, you're trying to find the one that the judges think is the prettiest."<p>
Other managers try to cope with short-term pressures by sticking close to the indexes. "You won't be criticized if the index goes down and you're invested in the index," says Michael Metz, chief investment strategist at Oppenheimer & Co. in New York City. "If you make picks that go against the benchmark, you'd better be right."<p>
In short, the pros can't afford to overweight anything that isn't already hot -- or about to be. International stocks look cheap? Tell it to your pen pal. "Owning too much international is what we call a CLM -- a career-limiting move," says Dan Cardell, director of quantitative strategies at Weiss, Peck & Greer in Chicago. "It might even be a CEM: a career-eliminating move." <p>
Constraint Number Three for the pros: Cash is trash. Holding cash (90-day Treasurys or commercial paper) means being out of the stock market -- these days an even bigger sin than being wrong. Can't find enough bargains right now? Better put your money to work anyway.<p>
Oh, sure, money managers give lip service to the notion that they'll "take advantage of downturns in the market by purchasing shares at attractive valuations." They use exactly those words all the time in their quarterly reports to shareholders. But, says Bill Fleckenstein, "I don't know how that's possible. The fact is that money managers cannot hold cash because they might fall behind in a bull market -- grounds for dismissal. At my old job at a money-management firm, we all got tremendous pressure about it. I got letters from clients telling me not to hold more than a certain percentage in cash. One client got on me at every single meeting if I held any cash at all."<p>
Appearances also count for a great deal among the pros, a problem we'll call Constraint Number Four. "Being an institutional manager is like living in a small town," says Samuel Hayes, the Jacob H. Schiff Professor of Investment Banking at Harvard Business School. "You're under constant scrutiny. You can't just follow your convictions; you have to worry about how your actions will be perceived." <p>
This situation leads to some bizarre behavior. A 1992 study by three professors found that, as a group, stocks with terrible five-year performance records returned an astonishingly high 13 percent in the month of January. <p>
Why? Because money managers tended to dump their riskiest holdings in December and buy blue chips. "Managers will always move toward the benchmark near the end of the year," says Cardell. "They start heading toward the <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>GM</b></a>s and <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T</b></a>s and <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>s." This helps to lock in the returns they've earned over the course of the year and prevents nasty last-minute surprises from blowing their year-end bonuses. In January, the managers were free to sell the blue chips and look for bargains -- so bargain stocks regained support. This is called the January effect, and since 1992 it has crept into December.<p>
Almost nobody wants to own an individual stock that's been trashed in the press. The stock has become a "loser." You own it? Then you're a loser, too. There's a bias now toward what money pros call quality stocks, says Paul Greenwood, senior research analyst at Frank Russell Co., an investment-consulting firm in Tacoma. These are the dependable stocks with big names. "You can't go before a committee and say, 'Last quarter, two of my holdings went bankrupt,'" Greenwood says. "As a result, very few money managers are true contrarians -- people who buy really down-and-out ugly companies."<p>
"It can get mean, even among clients who are very long-term oriented," adds Babson's James. "Usually, you're at these meetings with a marketing guy from your firm. Later, he asks, 'Why didn't you just dump the thing so we wouldn't have to go through that? Let's not do that again.'" <p>
The final handicap on our list -- Constraint Number Five -- is time. The typical money manager must juggle a portfolio loaded with scores or even hundreds of stocks that fit his fund's style and other strictures -- all the while dealing with bosses and clients. "Because a money manager's time is so short, he has to depend on other sources to filter ideas," says Marc Robins, editor of The Red Chip Review, a Portland, Oregon, newsletter that tracks small companies. "When I was a money manager, I didn't have time to talk to companies, which is how you really find the best stocks." <p>
Time constraints encourage the trend toward closet indexing. Stocks, bonds, and other securities that compose a benchmark index -- the yardstick by which a manager's performance is measured, such as the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, the Lehman Brothers Aggregate Bond index, or the Morgan Stanley European and Far East index -- become an easy default pick when the manager doesn't have time to come up with better ideas. <p>
Analysts are another cop-out. The very best analysts' reports contain new information or insights about a company, forcing people to rethink their stand on the stock. But reports of such quality are rare because few analysts are willing to venture out on a limb. An analyst who dumps on a company makes it less likely that company will hire his investment-banking department to do its next stock issue. Just as bad, the company might not answer his phone calls when it comes time to update earnings estimates.<p>
That's why so many analysts' reports tend to use very similar numbers and look very much alike. "Analysts feel safety in numbers," says Keith Wibel, president of Foothills Asset Management in Tempe, Arizona. "It's better to be wrong conventionally than right unconventionally." <p>
When a company announces financial results that are higher or lower than the hallowed consensus, the analyst pack rushes to change its estimates -- without giving much thought to what has actually changed. "There's a lot of overreaction," says Andy Ratkai, president of Praxis Advisory Group, a money-management firm in Inglewood, Colorado. "After a negative surprise, analysts tend to reduce their estimates too dramatically -- and the reverse happens after a positive surprise."<p>
Money managers don't necessarily believe analysts' buy recommendations. They may even have their doubts about the earnings estimates analysts grind out every quarter. But watch how quickly managers move to sell a stock when a company falls short of those projections.<p>
Feeling thankful you never considered a job as a professional money manager? You should. More importantly, you should also be feeling a little bit better about your own chances of operating successfully in the market -- right alongside this herd of hobbled equines. Instead of having to worry about clients or quarterly results, you're in the enviable position of being able to focus on what really matters.<p>
We'll outline eight ways to go about this -- each a discrete strategy investors can use to beat the pros. In the process, we'll also reveal 15 specific investment opportunities. You can take these picks either as recommended buys or simply as examples of the kind of deals that are out there for the plucking. But know this: There are plenty more where these came from -- and the guy who runs your pension money probably can't touch them.<p>
Strategy 1: Buy Small<p>
This is so obvious it's embarrassing -- yet almost no one does it. "Even if microcaps are the next big thing, you can't run a billion-dollar microcap fund," says Frank Russell's Greenwood. <p>
Too bad. James O'Shaughnessy's book What Works on Wall Street points out that stocks with market capitalizations under $25 million delivered 20.4 percent annual returns from 1951 through 1994, versus around 11 percent for larger issues. According to Ibbotson Associates, shares of firms with market caps between $86 million and $171 million have gained 15 percent annually since 1950.<p>
Choosing truly small stocks for your portfolio will require some sleuthing on your part (see "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9609C01.html">Going Small</A>" in the September 1996 issue). Hold out for companies with reasonably strong finances and a solid market niche that can't easily be stolen away by larger firms. Also focus on firms with low institutional ownership -- say 15 to 20 percent or less of a firm's shares -- but be aware that such neglect isn't always a plus. "Some neglected companies will always be neglected, and for good reason," says Cardell of Weiss, Peck & Greer. "What you want is a company with low but growing institutional ownership." <p>
Also check out which institutions hold the shares. You can do that by subscribing to Thomson MarketEdge (<A HREF="http://www.marketedge.com">http://www.marketedge.com</A>); the basic monthly fee is around eight dollars. If the shares are owned by managers you admire, then at least you know you're in good company.<p>
Marc Robins of The Red Chip Review likes <a name="NASD:NZYM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46270"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Synthetech</b></a> (Nasdaq: NZYM), which recently traded at $7.75 a share. This small biotech firm -- its recent market capitalization was just $107 million -- is the world's leading provider of peptide building blocks, which have fewer side effects than amino acids and proteins in treating diseases. "I'd say 198 of the 200 big pharmaceutical companies in the world want this technology," says Robins. <p>
Unlike most biotech companies, Synthetech is profitable -- it's earned money every year since 1991. It has no debt, and cash flow is sufficient to finance a doubling of the company's production facilities this year. Institutional investors own only 9 percent of the stock -- but that will likely change as the company's market cap increases. <p>
For similar reasons, Dick Perkins Jr. of Perkins Capital Management has his eye on <a name="NASD:BAGL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47192"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>BAB Holdings</b></a> (Nasdaq: BAGL), a bagel franchiser. BAB's strategy of targeting small towns has helped it open 70 stores in two years. A pair of acquisitions will boost that number to 360 by the end of 1997, making BAB, with a market cap of just $57 million, one of the three biggest players in a fragmented industry. And a recent agreement with the Mrs. Field's cookie chain will get BAB's bagels into hundreds more stores. "People aren't impressed by restaurant stocks, but I think this is going to be a big company," says Perkins. The stock recently sold at $8.13 a share.<p>
If you don't have the time or money to put together a diversified portfolio of small fry, consider a fund that will do it for you. Only a few equity funds -- 12 to be precise -- have median market caps below $100 million. One long-term pick: Dick Perkins's <a name="FUND:POFDX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/POFDX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Perkins Opportunity Fund</b></a> (800-366-8361; $2,500 minimum; 4.75 percent load), which invests in small companies in the health, technology, and services industries. Many of the fund's holdings are shares of companies in the upper Midwest. It has gained 34 percent annually since its inception in 1993.<p>
Another choice: <a name="FUND:HRSMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRSMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Small Cap Contrarian Fund</b></a> (800-432-7856; $1,000 minimum; no load), run by William Nasgovitz, who built his reputation racking up 22 percent annual gains over five years at the fund's older sibling, <a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value</b></a>, which is closed to new investors. The new fund gained 36.9 percent during its first 12 months (through April 1996), and its portfolio recently had an average market cap of only $89 million.<p>
Strategy 2: Buy what's out of style<p>
"Find the companies in a down-and-out industry with the ability to improve profit margins and earnings," says Babson's Lance James. <p>
Take retail stocks, which trailed the market for each year from 1993 through 1995. "No one wanted them, so valuations were low," says James. "The number of stores was shrinking. That told me competition was going to decline, and profit margins would grow from their depressed levels." The retail group climbed 18.2 percent for the year through September, compared with 13.5 percent for the S&P 500. <p>
Some retail stocks still look good, but you'll make more money if you find an industry that hasn't yet turned the corner. The mail-order business, for example, has been battered for the past 18 months, with some stocks falling 70 percent or more. Rising paper and postage costs, too many catalogs, and a poor retail environment account for the slump. But Mark Boyar, a respected New York value investor, reckons that, as shopping via the Internet and cable grows, Internet and cable companies will buy mail-order firms in order to control the distribution of products sold in cyberspace. <p>
One pick: <a name="NASD:SPGLA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14773"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Spiegel </b></a>(Nasdaq: SPGLA), which recently traded at $7.25. Boyar calculates that if you bought the entire company you'd get a firm with $3 billion in sales for less than $1 billion -- a tiny price-to-sales ratio of 0.3. German mail-order giant Otto-Versand owns 80 percent of Spiegel and is working to increase Spiegel's sales in Europe, where mail-order retailing is in its infancy. Boyar figures the company could earn around $1 a share in 1997 and trade at $18 to $22.<p>
Strategy 3: Do hold cash <p>
"As a money manager, you've got to invest cash as it comes in," says Lance James. "But individuals can act like Warren Buffett: They get to pick their shots."<p>
This is an especially good time to have some extra dough around. "At some point in the next two years, investors who have cash on hand will have their best buying opportunity in ten years," says James Stack, president of InvesTech in Whitefish, Montana. Other managers stress that short-term market moves are unpredictable, but they recommend holding a 10 to 20 percent stake in cash to snap up bargains when they appear.<p>
Or find one of the rare managers who will do it for you.<p>
SoGen International (800-334-2143; $1,000 minimum; 3.75 percent load) invests in out-of-favor sectors of the world's financial markets. The portfolio recently included a 21.9 percent stake in domestic stocks, 33.7 percent in foreign stocks, and more than 15 percent in dollar-denominated bonds. And manager Jean-Marie Eveillard makes a point of holding a big chunk in cash, as much as 35 percent of fund assets and never less than 10 percent. "When Napoleon went into battle, he didn't send all of his troops," he says in his too-French-to-be-true accent.<p>
James Craig typically keeps 10 percent of his <A HREF="http://www.janusfunds.com/cgi-bin/genobject">Janus Fund</A>'s assets in cash. "I keep cash to take advantage of the opportunities fear creates," he says. "I've gotten flak about it in the past, and I just say, 'If you don't like it, get another fund.'"<p>
Strategy 4: Buy what they can't<p>
Often, managers' investment policies restrict them from investing in the securities of bankrupt or otherwise financially troubled companies. As a result, sophisticated investors can often buy a chunk of a struggling firm's debt for considerably less than it will be worth when the company reorganizes. <p>
Marty Whitman's <a name="FUND:TAVFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TAVFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Third Avenue Value Fund</b></a> (800-443-1021; $1,000 minimum; no load) can hold up to 15 percent of its assets in non-marketable securities -- an absolute no-no for most mutual funds, pensions, and other pooled accounts. "Whatever you do, don't buy a troubled company's common stock," he advises, because stockholders have a relatively weak claim to the assets of a bankrupt company. <p>
Instead, Whitman buys senior secured debt -- securities that give him strong claim to a firm's assets in a reorganization. In 1992, for example, he purchased senior secured debt issued by Eljer Industries, a plumbing company that some investors worried was about to file for bankruptcy. Whitman figured he'd recover his investment whether that happened or not. Eljer avoided bankruptcy, and the debt has paid Whitman a yield of 16.4 percent, along with a 15 percent capital gain -- for a total return of more than 20 percent annually.<p>
Michael Price's Mutual Shares (800-553-3014; $5,000 minimum; 4.75 percent load) is another way to invest in unloved securities. The fund typically invests 40 percent or so of its portfolio in securities of bankrupt companies and other special situations. (See "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9701I07.html">Why Pay Retail?</A>")<p>
Too risky? Price notes that prices of securities backed by bankrupt firms generally move according to the progress of the issuers' reorganizations -- which typically have little to do with broad stock-market movements. Thus, these seemingly high-risk issues can reduce stock-market risk through diversification without sacrificing growth potential. That helps explain why both Whitman's and Price's funds have outgained more traditional funds while remaining less volatile than the typical equity fund. <p>
Strategy 5: Buy embarrassing stocks <p>
The hardest stocks for professional money managers to buy are shares of companies that have endured well-publicized disasters -- lawsuits, accidents, financial stress, and the like. As a result, these stocks often represent great values.<p>
Before you buy such a stock, you need to understand why it is likely to recover. In the case of <a name="NASD:VJET"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42104"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Valujet</b></a>, which plummeted from more than $17 a share to $6.50 after the discount airline's Flight 592 crashed in the Everglades last May, it's possible that the company may not ultimately survive Federal Aviation Administration scrutiny. Thus, many smart investors have stayed clear of the stock.<p>
George Putnam, editor of The Turnaround Letter in Boston, likes <a name="AMEX:TWA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>TWA</b></a> (ASE: TWA), which declared bankruptcy in 1993, reduced its debt, modified its operations -- and then went bankrupt again in 1995. "This time they drastically changed their operating plan, shifting to regions where they have a competitive advantage," Putnam says.<p>
After the firm emerged from its second bout with the banks, shares rose from $6 to $22 -- and then plummeted to $9.50 after TWA Flight 800 went down over Long Island last July. (It recently traded at $9.) No one blamed the airline for the tragedy, but this is a stock that would take some explaining to a pension trustee. "Cash flow is up, demand is up, and costs are down," says Putnam. "I can easily see this stock in the low $20s again" within the next few years.<p>
Jim Crabbe recently held shares of <a name="NYSE:FLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10587"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fleming</b></a> (NYSE: FLM), a food distributor that caters to small supermarket chains. Low inflation has crimped the firm's ability to raise prices. Worse, a supermarket chain in Texas filed a lawsuit that alleged Fleming had overcharged it. A judge awarded the chain $211 million, and Fleming's stock fell to $11.50 last April, down from its peak of $40 in May 1991. <p>
Wall Street worried that other customers would sue as well. But the ruling has since been thrown out, and the company has rewritten almost 90 percent of its contracts to reduce the risk of future litigation. The firm's profit margins are increasing, along with its market share. Crabbe figures earnings could climb 40 percent, to $1.50 a share in 1997, and thinks the stock, which recently sold at $17.75, could go as high as the mid-$20s within 12 months.<p>
Strategy 6: Buy orphaned stocks <p>
Money managers often dump a perfectly good stock for reasons that have nothing to do with its fundamentals. <p>
Take spin-offs, which are born when a company decides to divest itself of one or more divisions that don't fit with its long-term plan. Often, the firm simply distributes shares in the spin-off to its own shareholders -- and many of those shareholders immediately dump them. <p>
Why? For starters, spin-offs usually have small market capitalizations, so the size constraint kicks in. Further, there's often little information about the spin-off: Why would beverage analysts follow Anheuser-Busch's bakery operation, Earthgrains, which it spun off in March? They don't know baking, and Earthgrains isn't likely to be throwing around big investment-banking fees. <p>
What's more, spin-offs don't usually make the index that includes their parents -- the S&P 500, say, or the Dow. In that case, indexers have to dump them. If a growth company spins off a value stock, strict growth managers have to drop it as well. "There's tremendous selling pressure on these stocks," concludes Peter Doyle, an analyst with the newsletter The Spin-off Report.<p>
Guess what: Spin-offs often turn out to be better investments than their parents (see Peter Lynch's column "<A HREF="http://www.worth.com/articles/Z9508E01.html">Free at Last</A>" in the July/August 1995 issue). The spin-off's new management often consists of employees who are getting  their first shot at running the show, and typically, they have strong financial incentives tied to performance. A study by Horizon Asset Management, an investment-management firm in New York City, found that spin-offs generate 77 percent better returns in the first three years than other companies in their industry -- and their shares are less volatile.<p>
Doyle advises investors to buy spin-offs that are selling at low price-to-earnings ratios compared with the stocks of similar firms. His recent picks include <a name="NYSE:TUP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=48028"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Tupperware</b></a> (NYSE: TUP), which Premark International spun off in May. Approximately 85 percent of Tupperware's sales are overseas -- increasingly in India and China, where the company's door-to-door distribution system is an advantage over competitors like <a name="NYSE:RBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rubbermaid</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:MMM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11003"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing</b></a>. The stock, which was recently priced at $48.38 a share, traded at 17 times expected 1996 earnings, versus around 21 times expected 1996 earnings for comparable stocks. <p>
Strategy 7: Buy the business, not the earnings estimates<p>
When an analyst lowers the earnings estimates on a stock, most money managers sell it. No excuses. "When it comes to earnings, there's a tremendous herd instinct in this business," says one pro, who asks not to be named. "We'd all rather be wrong together than wrong alone. That's why we'll dump a stock that has even a small earnings shortfall -- and companies that haven't seen a significant fundamental shift will drop 10 percent or more."<p>
That manager warns against buying right after such a decline. Instead, take it as a cue to look more closely at the company. Focus on fundamentals (especially sales growth) that will drive future earnings. Jim Crabbe likes <a name="NYSE:HHC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10746"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Horizon/CMS Healthcare</b></a> (NYSE: HHC), which provides nursing-home care and other medical services. Thanks partly to a botched acquisition attempt in January 1995, the company lost 56 cents a share in the quarter ended in August 1995 -- a huge decline from its 27-cent profit a year earlier. The stock declined from a high of $28 to $9.75 in July before recovering slightly. It recently traded at $11.13.<p>
But Crabbe thinks earnings will rebound sharply as Horizon makes other acquisitions, boosting revenues and profits. "They remain one of the best low-cost-care providers in the country," he says. "At this price, I would not be surprised if someone acquired them." He figures the stock could hit $17 to $20 in the next 12 months. <p>
Initial public offerings that have plummeted from their peaks are another place to hunt -- carefully -- for value. Typically, the momentum buyers have moved on to the latest hot issues, without realizing that (for once) they actually owned shares in a real company. Look for a firm with a two- to three-year history of profits from its operations and a p/e ratio below its expected earnings growth rate.<p>
Ryan Jacob, director of research at The IPO Value Monitor, likes <a name="NASD:DOCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=51636"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DecisionOne Holdings</b></a> (Nasdaq: DOCI), which went public in April at $18 a share. Its stock price, recently $15.50, peaked at $30 before falling 47 percent when technology stocks plunged last June. The firm provides support services for more than 15,000 computer and other technology products made by almost 1,000 manufacturers: It'll send someone to fix your <a name="NYSE:CPQ"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10381"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Compaq</b></a> computer, <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> printer, and <a name="NASD:USRX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15388"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>U.S. Robotics</b></a> modem. Some 85 percent of the firm's $540 million in revenue comes from long-term contracts, and Jacob projects 20 percent annual earnings growth over the next several years.<p>
Strategy 8: Invest with independent money managers <p>
Go with investment pros who run their own shows, says Craig Litman of Litman/Gregory & Co., an investment-research firm in Larkspur, California. "We like money managers who are principals of their own firms," he says, "guys who can afford to be independent thinkers." Litman cites Shelby Davis of Selected American Shares (800-243-1575; $1,000 minimum; no load) and Foster Friess of Brandywine (800-656-3017; $25,000 minimum; no load). <p>
Independents are stubborn, and their funds occasionally trail the market for months, or even years. If that bothers you, they don't care. And that's why you should hire them.<p>
Then again, none of them is perfect. What you really want is a money manager who identifies totally with your interests. One who can buy small stocks, hold offbeat investments of every stripe, completely ignore quarterly rankings -- basically do whatever he or she feels like doing. <p>
Yes, there are some arenas where attempting to compete with the professionals doesn't make a whole lot of sense (a pro-hockey rink, for example). But investing in stocks and bonds is different -- so long as you know how to play the game. This is one field where even the mightiest players have no better odds of success than the little guy who does his homework. This arena is big enough for everyone.<p>

						Good news on limited-liability companies -- but watch your step<p>
By Roy Furchgott<p>
Limited-liability companies have been a boon for investors who want the tax advantages of a partnership and the liability protection of a corporation. Family businesses, owners of rental properties, and professionals with their own practices have discovered the benefits of these vehicles. Thanks to proposed tax regulations, they'll soon be a lot easier to set up. <p>
But just because it's easier doesn't mean you should sign on the line. LLC laws (and laws for limited-liability partnerships, which are substantially the same) may not always offer the protection they were designed to provide. "Limited-liability companies are different state to state," says Carl Polsky, an accounting professor at the Wharton School of Business. "Somebody might sue you in another state, and you might be liable." Polsky says it could require a huge court case just to determine which state's rules will be heard in a suit.<p>
Wyoming introduced the concept of LLCs in 1977, but they didn't take off until 1988, when the IRS ruled that an LLC would get the tax treatment of a partnership -- which is preferable to that of a corporation -- if it passed a four-point test. The test identified four key characteristics of a corporation (such as transferability of interest in the company) that would endanger an LLC's status. The IRS is expected to approve a rule by 1997 that would do away with the test and allow LLC owners to decide their status on their own. "You just check the box if you are a corporation or a partnership, and that's it," says Mark Luscombe, a tax analyst at tax-law publisher CCH.<p>
There may also be good news ahead on the interstate front. The National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Law have proposed a standard for LLCs that would apply throughout the U.S. Not all states have accepted the standard, though several have made liability law compatible in other ways. But LLCs aren't out of the legal woods yet. "There is some uncertainty," says Larry Ribstein, a professor and LLC authority at George Mason University School of Law. "For example, we don't know how LLCs will be treated under bankruptcy law, securities law, employment-discrimination law, or workers' comp." One issue: Of the LLC "members," as owners are called, who is employer and who is employee?<p>
In the meantime, there are other options. Baltimore-based financial planner Patrick Horan suggests forming a limited partnership with a corporation as the general partner. Though complex, it provides the advantages of an LLC -- without the legal questions.<p>

						Owning a wall full of books about money isn't the same thing as having a first-rate investment library. Check out these classic texts.<p>
By Fredric Smoler<p>
You've got money in the markets, and, of course, you're skimming the financial press, when suddenly it occurs to you: Despite the conventional wisdom of your friends and the musings of journalists, there are serious gaps in your knowledge. Too much of what you've come across, you realize, is designed to make you wealthy, and too little is intended to make you smart. So you decide to read a few good books.<p>
Yet it turns out that the local chain store's financial section is a wall full of books, each claiming that if you read only one book about investing this should be the one -- and you know instinctively that books that boast like this are fish wrap. A knotty problem, not least because you suspect that one major alternative -- putting complete trust in the expertise and disinterestedness of a broker during a boom -- may not be the smartest thing you have ever done.<p>
The annotated list that follows is an attempt to loosen this knot by outlining the core of an investor's library. It's based on the premise that most people who lose money on their investments are neither peculiarly unlucky nor particularly stupid; in fact, most people who manage their own investments are smarter than average, though almost all active investors who trade for a profit will not make as much money in the long run as they should. When you think about this, it seems odd, because people whose investments simply track the Dow Jones Industrial Average or the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index make money -- over the long haul, they make a lot. So it seems that intelligent people confronting the markets are simply prone to a few intellectual mistakes, have a certain amount of misinformation, or succumb to psychological pitfalls.<p>
The books I've chosen address these human failings. It's a selective list, of course, and as an academic I have my biases. There are, for example, no mass-market how-to titles; I'd prefer that readers delve deeper into the foundations that underlie the practice of investing. Because the psychology of investing is where so many people come a cropper, a number of these selections explore this problem. And because a knowledge of financial history is invaluable when it comes to fighting one's irrationality -- or the pseudo-rationality that seems to make so much sense -- several are historical. Some convey a general sense of how investment strategies fare in the markets over a longish span of time -- the span an investor should be concerned with. There are general and specialized reference works, too, because finance includes both a technical vocabulary and terms of art, and something you think you understand but don't can cost you a lot of money. Finally, there are a couple of novels thrown in.<p>
These subjects overlap a great deal, and the categories are necessarily  loose. "Market Mechanics," for one, here means how the markets actually behave, which is part history, part psychology, and part technical explanation, so titles in this category could have perhaps been placed in another. Be advised that these books are mostly skeptical and rather conservative. They argue (and, I think, demonstrate) that, while prudence and discipline do pretty well in the long run, there are many more interesting, dramatic, and intellectually attractive approaches -- all of which will eventually bankrupt you. In short, these works are most valuable for people who are not specialists in economic history and who are living through an intoxicating bull market. Which is to say, you.<p>
MARKET MECHANICS
Start with Benjamin Graham's "The Intelligent Investor." It never grows old and is the one classic almost everyone has heard of -- which may be why it has never gone out of print when most investment primers are on the remainder tables before a year is out.
For most of us, the arcana of investing are far more compelling than any practical advice or commonsense approach, perhaps because the urge to make a killing leads us into a subliminal conviction that there is some swift and subtle technique that, once mastered, will make us obscenely rich immediately. An investor who has Lawrence G. McMillan's "Options as a Strategic Investment" (see below) on his shelves will strike most of us as enviably sophisticated, while a man with a copy of Graham by his bedside will seem at best pleasantly old-fashioned, and more likely timid and stodgy. Foolish impressions: Graham averaged a 17 percent annual rate of return over a career that began before the 1929 crash and continued through the Great Depression, and The Wall Street Journal has described him as one of the greatest investors of all time. On the other hand, men who master the most technical approaches and trade for a profit are, as Graham repeatedly points out, doomed to die broke if they persist in their folly long enough.<p>
Graham -- a hugely talented man who, a month before graduating from Columbia University in 1914, was offered teaching appointments in its mathematics, English, and philosophy departments -- distinguishes sharply between the speculator, defined as a man who trades for a profit, and the investor, who buys and generally holds, seeking to accumulate wealth patiently. The investor does this with a scrupulous attention to what Graham insists are underlying values, and he moves from overpriced to underpriced sectors of the markets more to escape risk than to chase super profits. His approach sounds old-fashioned, seems to confuse moral and economic categories, and deploys terms a modern economist would reject out of hand, but only one thing can be said for it: It works.<p>
Charles P. Kindleberger, the most famous chronicler of the Great Depression and the author of "Manias, Panics, and Crashes" and "The World in Depression," knows that financial crises are perennial and have a standard anatomy; he is also keenly aware of the limitations of regulatory authorities. For those young enough to "know" that nothing can go disastrously wrong for long in modern financial markets, for those who believe that financial crises can be contained within their own sector and are of necessarily limited duration, and for those who think anyone fathoms the links of the world economy, money spent on Kindleberger's books may be the best investment they could ever make.<p>
The stuff of financial history need not be all that old to offer immense value, as James P. O'Shaughnessy's "What Works on Wall Street" shows. O'Shaughnessy was the first outsider given complete access to S&P's Compustat, the largest, most comprehensive database of U.S. stock-market information available. There are only 44 years of financial history -- from 1950 to 1994 -- but that's enough to destroy lots of conventional wisdom. Against this longitudinal data, O'Shaughnessy tests popular investment strategies and the conventional wisdom on price-to-earnings and price-to-book ratios, small-company versus large-company stocks, cash flow, one- and five-year earnings-per-share ratios, return on equity -- indeed, most of the formulas investors have come up with for determining value.<p>
O'Shaughnessy finds there's a tendency to irrationality even among the most skillful investors: Individuals invent intricate patterns that at first only they can see but that, once seen, become immensely persuasive. But the failure of money managers to see through and beat market indexes does not mean random-walk theories win the day either. O'Shaughnessy argues that the portfolios studied by random-walk academics are inconsistently managed or run by more than one adviser and so never reflect the true possibilities of rational analysis. By testing test investors' intuitions against the universe of U.S. stocks over nearly 50 years, he demonstrates that the disciplined use of statistical evidence is possible -- or at least technically possible, if psychologically improbable.<p>
For a generous dose of drollery with your economic wisdom, you won't go wrong with Martin S. Fridson's "Investment Illusions: A Savvy Wall Street Pro Explodes Popular Misconceptions About the Markets." Fridson's is the most immediately engaging book on my list. His simple demonstration of the utility of probability theory in assessing financial journalism (say, the tendency to select some flavor-of-the-month fund manager) is as valuable as most investment guides. He is devastating, and very funny, in critiquing what passes for sophistication among many investors.<p>
If Graham's sobriety is palatable, look for Richard Brealey's "An Introduction to Risk and Return from Common Stocks." For a more specifically historical perspective, consider John D. Brown's "101 Years on Wall Street: An Investor's Almanac." Both of these books may be out of print by now, but they're worth grabbing if you find them in a used-book store. One book that repeated generations are rediscovering is Edwin Lefèvre's classic, "Reminiscences of a Stock Operator."<p>
PSYCHOLOGY
Since the financial markets include vast numbers of people in an amazing variety of institutions and subcultures and since these multitudes are often invoked by the optimistic as proof of the markets' infallibility, a little knowledge about how large numbers of people behave when money is at stake can be helpful. Charles Mackay's "Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds" remains the classic account of this subject. Tulipomania and the South Sea bubble never grow old. The great and recurring illusion of the markets is that there's something new under the sun -- that the rules are changing in fundamental and beneficent ways and that the skill, sophistication, and psychology of one's own generation of financial wizards make financial history a matter of purely antiquarian interest. Believing this can easily be the most expensive mistake you'll make; on the other hand, Mackay's book -- simultaneously funny and grimly sobering -- is often on remainder tables. You'll never learn cheaper.<p>
If you enjoy Charles Mackay, consider another classic work often mentioned in the same breath, Gustave Le Bon's "The Crowd: A Study of the Popular Mind" Take a look, too, at Henry Harper's "The Psychology of Speculation." And though drabber in tone than Fridson's work, Martin J. Pring's "Investment Psychology Explained" is worth checking out.<p>
TECHNICAL ANALYSIS
In the words of a great investor, never buy anything you don't understand. If you work your way through Lawrence G. McMillan's "Options as a Strategic Investment" (it assumes some sophistication and mathematical training but may usefully be read without either of these), you will be able to honor this rule while buying a butterfly spread, trading LEAPS and CAPS, and talking knowledgeably about the gamma of the gamma. In other words, if you're going anywhere near options, McMillan is a must-read. Whether in fact you ought to do any of these things is another question, one that Graham addressed many years earlier.<p>
Other valuable volumes with narrower foci and more practical approaches are Martin J. Pring's "Technical Analysis Explained," Stephen J. Brown and Mark Kritzman's "Quantitative Methods for Financial Analysis," and Frank Fabozzi and Frank Zarb's "Handbook of Financial Markets: Securities, Options, and Futures." And if you ignore the sobrieties celebrated in these books, you will eventually need every bit of comic relief you can lay your hands on (see Fridson above).<p>
PERIODICALS
Should you subscribe to journals? If you are determined to read what the pros read, consider getting The Journal of Portfolio Management, Institutional Investor, The Journal of Financial Economics, and Financial Analysts Journal. The danger of actually reading these publications is that they may delude you into thinking you are not an amateur -- which you are. Your strategy as an investor should be to avoid market timing, since in the long run market timers almost always fail. However, unless you're a pure chartist, you are going to need some sense of where the world is heading, whether you are going to be a value investor or a market timer. Since television is profoundly inefficient -- fatuities at 100 words a minute -- and news radio scarcely better, you'll need to read something, and it had better be The Economist. Competing mass-market weeklies are hopelessly outclassed: The Economist is lively, intelligent, global in its coverage, economic in its orientation, and shrewd about politics. It has its own sane politics -- deregulation and free trade -- but it is almost perfectly free of ideological cant (which cannot be said of The Wall Street Journal). It publishes regular reports on developments in economics that are relevant to investors; it has periodic special sections on regional developments; and its technology coverage is excellent. Even if you read specialist publications, you will want The Economist for the many areas in which you are going to remain a generalist.<p>
REFERENCE
Whether you're reading The Economist or one of the aforementioned books, you're bound to encounter unfamiliar terms. Don't know what a "contango" is? Look it up in Barron's Dictionary of Finance and Investment Terms, a handy, compact guide. For a general reference work, more essayistic in style, consider Palgraves, which is essentially a specialized encyclopedia. There are now several New Palgraves, including one for economics and one for finance (with considerable overlaps in coverage between them), though some folks prefer the older editions. Still, this is a major work and, if money is no object, well worth owning. <p>
When Sidney Homer arrived at Salomon Brothers in 1961, he organized the first in-depth research department devoted strictly to fixed-income markets. After looking in vain for anything dispositive on the subject of interest rates -- even though it's an ancient subject and interest rates are demonstrably older than money itself -- Homer filled the absence himself and in 1963 published A History of Interest Rates. The book, which has been revised many times, most recently by Richard Sylla, is more than a lengthy data series going all the way back to ancient Sumer; it's an attempt to understand interest rates in the multiple dimensions of time, space, quality of loans, marketability, size of loans, redemption terms, tax status, class of debtor, class of creditor, and a complex legal history. How do we stack up? If, as a fin de siècle economist observed, a country's cultural level is inversely proportional to its free-market rate of interest, not very well -- although perhaps it is some comfort that in this decade Argentine banks at one point offered depositors 1,000 percent a month. Homer and Sylla provide an invaluable frame of reference for investors who need a broad and textured sense of the determinants at work in the credit markets.<p>
FICTION
Lots of fiction has treated the topic of money, but the list of great novels written about investing is small. William Gaddis's "JR," one of the finest postwar American novels and a viciously funny high-modernist triumph composed almost entirely of dialogue, is surely at the top of the list. (Honorable mentions must include Theodore Dreiser's "The Financier" and "The Titan" and Louis Auchincloss's "The Embezzler.") Gaddis's book belongs in any investor's library: JR is an 11-year-old who, using his hapless music teacher as a front, pyramids a class project's share of stock into a highly leveraged sham conglomerate nominally worth hundreds of millions. The novel resonates with the later rise and fall of James Ling and the hideous efflorescence of tax-avoidance-driven investing since muted by the 1986 code revisions, but JR's comic brilliance is undimmed by the passing of the fads it mocks so savagely.<p>

						New Year's resolutions are hard to follow through on, but some of America's best financial planners have come up with ten that are well worth the willpower<p>
By Paul Davies<p>
1. Investor, Know Thyself: David Diesslin
The first step in investment planning is to determine exactly where you stand now, yet most people in the U.S. can't estimate their net worth within 5 percent, says David Diesslin of Diesslin & Associates in Fort Worth, Texas. To arrive at a dollar figure, add all your assets -- cash, IRA, mutual funds, stocks, real estate, cars, and collections like art or coins -- then subtract liabilities, like a home loan, car loans and leases, and investment liabilities, such as a margin loan with your broker. Don't forget to factor in deferred-income taxes on stocks and compensation packages; these are liabilities, too. <p>
This exercise will help you decide how fast you need your wealth to grow to meet whatever your long-term financial target is -- a retirement home, four years of tuition, start-up money for a business. By knowing your goal, you can determine if your savings and investment strategies are too conservative to get you where you're trying to go or riskier than necessary. Setting a bottom line "forces you to be proactive," Diesslin says. <p>
2. Reduce Your Tax Withholding: Kathleen Stepp
The goal for most taxpayers is to get a refund on April 15 rather than owe the government. In reality, it's better to reduce your withholding and invest the money rather than let Uncle Sam hold on to it, says Kathleen Stepp, president of Stepp & Garrett in Overland Park, Kansas. "Most people think they win if they get a big refund, when they've really lost," says Stepp.<p>
Consider a taxpayer who receives a $2,400 refund from the federal government. The taxpayer would do better to reduce withholding and invest the $200 a month over 12 months at 8 percent. By the next April, the investment would be worth $2,557, or $157 more than the tax refund. Even after paying 33 percent in tax on the $157, the gain would be $105. "Most people would jump at the chance to keep $100 rather than give it to Uncle Sam," Stepp says.<p>
3. Put Your Trust in Real Estate: Carol Wilson
Real estate has been a tough sell in recent years, but now that the stock market may be overvalued, it might be the time to consider it again, says Carol Wilson of Wilson Financial Advisors in Salt Lake City.<p>
Wilson recommends that investors place 10 percent of their portfolio in real-estate investment trusts, which are basically listed securities that pool investors' money to buy property. She likes REITs because they can be bought and sold like stocks. Through October, REITs outperformed the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index for the past five years, earning an average annual return of 13.8 percent, versus 13.6 percent for the S&P. In addition, REITs are an excellent hedge against stocks. "I use REITs as a bond substitute," Wilson says.<p>
Wilson likes the two largest REIT mutual funds, Cohen & Steers Realty Shares and Fidelity Real Estate Investment, which have been among the industry leaders over the past five years. Some smaller funds -- such as Columbia Real Estate Equity, Crabbe Huson Real Estate Investment, Longleaf Realty, and CGM Realty -- have been posting impressive returns, but Wilson avoids funds that have not been around for at least five years. One safe bet, however, is the Vanguard REIT Index Portfolio, which started in May.<p>
4. Review Your Asset Allocation: Wayne Starr
The start of a new year is always a good time to review your portfolio's asset allocation, says Wayne Starr, a certified financial planner at Neill & Associates in Kansas City, Missouri. Each investor's asset allocation varies according to age, financial goals, and taste for risk, but a conservative split would be 60 percent in a basket of equities and 40 percent in a combination of short- and long-term bonds and cash. An aggressive 25-year-old investor may want 100 percent of her investments in stocks, while a conservative investor in his 70s may want 70 percent in fixed income. <p>
A well-balanced portfolio can get out of balance in a year's time, especially in a year with a strong equity market like 1996. Your stock investments may have increased from 60 to 80 percent of your portfolio, while your bonds dropped from 40 to 20 percent. If so, consider selling some stocks to get back to your desired allocation.<p>
Starr says investors might also consider tactical shifts to take advantage of political and economic changes. He is urging his clients to consider natural-resource commodities, particularly oil and gas. Fears of a recession or inflation could send commodity prices climbing. Three funds that provide excellent exposure to commodities are the <a name="FUND:PRNEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRNEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price New Era Fund</b></a>, the <a name="FUND:RSNRX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RSNRX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Robertson Stephens Global Natural Resources Fund</b></a>, and the <a name="FUND:VGENX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VGENX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard Specialized Energy Fund</b></a>.<p>
5. Give the Gift That Keeps on Giving: Mary P. Merrill
Many investors are unnecessarily wary of charitable trusts, says Mary P. Merrill of M. P. Merrill & Associates in Madison, Wisconsin. "People will give old coats to Goodwill, but they have to be confident they are not going to run out of money before they consider charitable trusts," she says. But you don't have to be rich to enjoy the tax benefits of charitable giving.<p>
There are three basic kinds of charitable trusts, each of which pays off in a different way. A charitable-remainder annuity trust provides a guaranteed fixed annuity, which is a percentage of the value of the trust's assets at the time of the donation. By comparison, a charitable-remainder unitrust provides annual income payments that are a percentage of the value of the trust's assets; the annuity varies since the trust's assets are revalued each year. A third option is a pooled-income fund, which pools gifts with those of other donors. The donor is paid income depending on the fund's earnings performance.<p>
As an example, consider a couple in their late 50s who donate $100,000 in equities to charity. They avoid the capital-gains tax, and by donating the stocks through a charitable-remainder annuity that pays 7 percent, the couple will receive annual income of $7,000 for the rest of their lives. <p>
6. Stay Current in Estate Planning: Patricia F. Raskob
Estate documents deserve a thorough review once a year, says Patricia F. Raskob of Raskob/Kambourian Financial Advisors in Tucson, Arizona. Raskob recommends reviewing your will and life-insurance beneficiary designations every January. In addition, estate documents should be updated following any major life event, such as a birth, death, or divorce.<p>
Living wills and health-care powers of attorney should be reviewed annually as well. Banks and doctors prefer the updating to ensure that clients haven't changed their minds. Raskob says that another will option worth considering is a gift clause, which allows for your assets to be given to your heirs in the event you become incapacitated. Without one, there's no guarantee that your wishes will be followed.<p>
7. Get in the Market: Victoria F. Collins
In a perfect world, all investors would buy at the bottom of the stock market and sell at the top, says Victoria F. Collins of Keller, Coad & Collins in Irvine, California. But it's very difficult to time the market on a regular basis. Of 90 market-timing strategies touted in newsletters, only 3 outperformed the market over the past five years, according to Mark Hulbert of Hulbert Financial Digest in Alexandria, Virginia. "If so-called experts can't do it, no wonder it's frustrating for individual investors," says Collins.<p>
The important thing is to be in the market. Collins tells of a former client  who was made anxious by the Dow's reaching 3000 in 1991. The client sold $100,000 in stocks and put his money in certificates of deposit. The Dow has doubled since then. Had the investor left $100,000 in an S&P 500 index fund, he would have more than doubled his investment to $201,407 through August. The $100,000 in CDs has grown to only $124,136.<p>
8. Hedge Your Bets Against Inflation: Peggy Ruhlin
The Treasury department plans to issue new inflation-indexed bonds in January. The interest rate paid will be set by auction, as with regular Treasury bonds, but the principal will increase along with the consumer price index, and interest is earned on the adjusted principal. <p>
Investors may want to shift the traditional bond portion of their portfolio to inflation-indexed bonds, but they shouldn't sell equities to do so, says Peggy Ruhlin of Budros & Ruhlin in Columbus, Ohio. "Nobody in a million years should consider selling stocks and putting the money into these things," she says. "These bonds will be a crummy investment if inflation stays low." The advantage of the new bonds is that they don't lose value if inflation spikes up -- the principal increase covers that. But they'll carry lower coupon rates than regular bonds. If inflation is low and the adjustment never comes into play, you'll wish you hadn't got fancy. <p>
9. Embrace Cultural Diversity: Alan Weiss
With the U.S. stock market seemingly overvalued, investors should look for opportunities overseas, says Alan Weiss, president of Regent Retirement Planning in North Haven, Connecticut. Europe is beginning to rebound, and emerging markets offer increased opportunities. "There is no time in our history when it has been easier to conduct business on a global basis," Weiss says.<p>
Weiss recommends that growth investors put 30 percent of their portfolio in foreign and emerging-markets stock funds. This diversification provides a hedge against downturns in the U.S. market. He suggests putting 20 percent in a large-company foreign fund, such as the <a name="FUND:
         VWIGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Vanguard International Growth Fund</b></a> or Ivy International A, and 10 percent in a small-company emerging-markets fund, such as <a name="FUND:CNTAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CNTAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Colonial Newport Tiger A</b></a> or <a name="FUND:TEDMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TEDMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Templeton Developing Markets</b></a>.<p>
10. Know Your Mutual Fund -- Again: Frank Butterfield
Investors can spend months shopping for the right mutual fund. But after choosing one, they often send in their money and never think about the fund again. This is a mistake, says Frank Butterfield of Homrich & Berg in Atlanta. "Several things can happen to a great fund after you buy it," he says. "The manager who built the track record can depart. The assets can balloon and cause the manager to dilute his or her investment ideas. The style of the fund can change."<p>
Butterfield points to the <a name="FUND:GSCQX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GSCQX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Govett Small Companies Fund</b></a>. Under Garrett Van Wagoner, its average return for the three years ended December 1995 was 52.1 percent. Then Van Wagoner left, and through the first nine months of 1996, the fund returned 1.47 percent under Jeff Bernstein. "The new manager could not find Van Wagoner's shoes, let alone fill them," says Butterfield. He urges investors to read their funds' quarterly reports and watch for shifts in the amount of assets and the number and types of stocks.<p>

						By Ted C. Fishman<p>
The battle between the browsers -- software programs that make World Wide Web access possible -- is much like presidential politics this year: two big opponents duking it out with claims and counterclaims of superiority, but with few real differences of substance to separate them. <p>
Both <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a>'s Navigator 3.0 (available as shareware for $49
for Windows and Macintosh) and <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a>'s Internet Explorer 3.0 (free for Windows 95 and Windows NT only) display the Web in all its multimediated, interactive glory; both make E-mail painless and offer connections to Internet newsgroups. Each is easily acquired (at <a HREF="http://www.netscape.com">www.netscape.com</A>
 and <a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com">www.microsoft.com</A>
, for those already connected), easily installed, and easily mastered. Last summer's bugs have been fixed. Both help users edit and organize the chaos of 10,000-plus newsgroups, the Internet's equivalent of cocktail-party chatter. And neither program will affect what users see -- of the hundreds of thousands of Web pages out there, only a handful will look different in these two browser programs.<p>
In short, although the stakes are great for the firms struggling to control the market, selecting a browser may be the most risk-free computing decision you'll ever have to make. But since you still have to choose -- keeping both browsers on a system is a good way to compare them, but in the long run it invites confusion and double work thanks to the functions that archive personal information -- there are reasons to prefer one to the other.<p>
**Navigator's advantages over Microsoft**<p>
In spite of cleaner and more elegant graphics from Microsoft that evoke modern book design -- Navigator is still gray and hogs too much of the computer screen -- Netscape's is the better product.<p>
Right now, Internet Explorer 3.0 runs only on Windows 95 or Windows NT, whereas Netscape, the dominant choice of all browser users, works on many more computer systems. Also, Navigator takes a fraction of the hard drive needed to install Explorer, which requires 25 megabytes of a hard drive to set things up (the memory needed shrinks afterward).<p>
Explorer does have advantages, maybe the most significant being that many of the biggest Internet providers, such as AT&T Worldnet, Netcom, and America Online, have deals with Microsoft to offer Explorer as the default browser, making the program a natural choice for those who sign up with them. Explorer is always free, too; Navigator, when not given away by an Internet provider, is free for 90 days, after which Netscape requests (though in truth it doesn't expect) a onetime charge of $49.<p>
**Navigator is better at moving Web content through E-mail.**<p>
But Navigator is clearly better when it comes to moving Web content over the Internet via E-mail. Navigator allows users to send and display E-mail that incorporates materials formatted in HTML, the coding language in which Web pages are written. HTML makes possible the blending of text, graphics, sound, and the "hot links" that move users from site to site. This means that if someone sends you an audio file -- a recording of a press conference, let's say -- you can hear it by merely clicking a button inside the E-mail application. <p>
Or imagine you want to coordinate travel plans with a friend: You can call up a hotel's Web site and send that page directly to the friend as E-mail. The hot links are immediately accessible, too. Several media groups are taking advantage of this feature to disseminate news and entertainment. The New York Times, for example, can send its World Wide Web version as E-mail, permitting subscribers to retrieve the online paper and read it offline without racking up phone charges.<p>
**User-friendliness can also be the curse of these programs.**<p>
What now makes Explorer and Navigator so attractive, especially the latter, is that they integrate into one package all sorts of capabilities that formerly required a piecemeal collection of arcane programs. (An example is the browsers' incorporation of "phone" packages, which allow users to communicate long-distance at local rates over Internet connections -- though in neither program is this feature easy to configure, nor does either yet offer great sound or smooth two-way conversation.) <p>
This, in turn, can't help but hasten the Internet's destiny, which is to move everything -- from movies to money -- onto a person's desk. Alas, such user-friendliness is also the curse of these programs: One problem they help create but can't solve is increased Internet traffic and, therefore, more bottlenecks. Indeed, in the few days after each new browser was released, heavy use nearly ground the companies' sites to a halt.<p>

						Investors won't pick winners in a global economy if they study only U.S. stocks<p>
By Paul Davies<p>
A U.S consumer trying to find the best buy in a car or a cellular phone would kick the tires on U.S. <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fords </b></a>and Japanese <a name="NYSE:"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46940"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hondas</b></a> and flip open phones by America's <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> and Finland's <a name="NYSE:NOK/A"></a><b>Nokia</b>. Why should investors be any less global when they buy stocks?<p>
Only an estimated 29 percent of U.S. mutual-fund shareholders currently own an international or global fund, and when it comes to choosing individual stocks, U.S. investors remain chauvinists. Often investors trying to cash in on a global trend begin and end their analyses with companies based in the United States.<p>
But that kind of thinking can mean settling for second best when it comes to capitalizing on a trend or industry turnaround in today's global economy. For example, according to Standard & Poor's Compustat, over the past ten years, the big three automobile stocks, ranked by virtue of their total return to investors, were not <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, Ford, and <a name="NYSE:"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46940"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Chrysler</b></a> but Ford (262 percent cumulative return), <a name="NASD:TOYOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41889"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toyota</b></a> (244 percent), and Chrysler (240 percent).<p>
Right now, the cellular-phone industry offers a classic case study of the dangers of thinking domestically when investing in a global market. Dataquest, a technology research firm in San Jose, California, projects that through the year 2000 the number of cellular subscribers will grow by more than 20 percent in the U.S. and Europe and by 57 percent in East Asia. U.S. investors who want to play this trend by buying shares in a maker of cellular-phone handsets but who are determined to keep their heads stuck in U.S. sands are limited to one stock, Motorola. A global analysis, however, would put Sweden's <a name="NASD:ERICY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41776"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ericsson</b></a> and Finland's Nokia at the top of the list of companies currently best positioned to take advantage of the global boom.<p>
**Look for international companies with the best mix of competitive advantages.**<p>
Picking winners and losers from a worldwide list may seem daunting, but it's no more difficult than analyzing a purely domestic industry. Just look for the company with the best mix of competitive advantages.<p>
For example, in the auto industry, manufacturers interested in  competing globally must do three things: make cars as efficiently as they can, bring out new models faster than their competitors, and build the best-quality cars for the money. The one automaker preeminent in these three areas, according to industry sage Maryann N. Keller, managing director at New York–based institutional brokerage Furman Selz, is Toyota. "No one else even comes close," says Keller.<p>
According to auto-industry consultants Harbour and Associates, while General Motors takes an average of 29 hours building each car and Ford 25 hours, Toyota's average car is built in only 20. And while it takes GM approximately 40 months to bring a new car model to market, Ford does the same in 31 months and Toyota in just 30.<p>
Nor does all this efficiency come at the expense of quality. Of the top three models picked by J. D. Power and Associates' 1996 quality study in 11 product categories, Toyota made the cut in 9 categories, while GM earned a place in 6 and Ford in only 3.<p>
**Motorola dominated the U.S. cellular-phone market for years -- but the market is evolving.**<p>
A similar checklist of competitive factors for the cellular-phone industry needn't be any longer, even though the industry is much more dynamic than the automotive sector. The number of cellular-phone users in the U.S. alone climbed from 1 million in 1987 to 33 million last year, according to the Cellular Telecommunications Industry Association in Washington, D.C. The world cellular population is expected to grow from 68 million subscribers today to over 251 million by the year 2000, according to Dataquest.<p>
For years, Motorola dominated the U.S. cellular-phone business with handsets that were sturdy, functional, and -- thanks to an aggressive cost-cutting strategy -- lower in price than competing phones. Consider that 11 years after its introduction the ubiquitous dark-gray Motorola DPC 550 -- the original "flip-phone" -- remains the most popular handset sold in the U.S. <p>
But the cellular world has changed. Motorola's low-cost, high-volume approach left a hole in the marketplace big enough for a competitor to drive through. And two competitors -- Oy Nokia (NYSE: NOK.A) and L. M. Ericsson (Nasdaq: ERICY) -- did just that. The two used their competitive strengths to outmaneuver the established industry leader in the same way that Toyota outmaneuvered General Motors and Ford.<p>
For years, Motorola set the technological pace, and it remains an industry leader with a world-market share of 30 percent, followed by Nokia's 24 percent and Ericsson's 10 percent. But while Motorola was focusing on the U.S. market and following its aggressive low-cost strategy, Nokia and Ericsson were building handsets and cellular systems for the global industry. Taking advantage of Motorola's reliance on older models and its concentration on the U.S. market, Nokia and Ericsson aimed at the global "sweet spot" by producing phones with more features. The result was huge sales to a worldwide audience.<p>
**Nokia slipped into the cellular market by developing more advanced telephones.**<p>
Nokia let Motorola continue to dominate the low end of the market, while it developed advanced telephones that appealed to users at the high end. The top-of-the-line phones -- like Nokia's hugely popular 2100 model, which sells for about $550 yet costs only $234 to make -- feature much higher profit margins than the low-end models that are given away by service providers in an effort to drum up additional business. The newest models, some of which weigh as little as three ounces -- compared with six to nine ounces for most phones -- sell for more than $1,000 and boast even higher margins.<p>
Those feature-laden products appealed to customers in Europe and Asia, helping Nokia and Ericsson to build market share outside the U.S. and thus spread their research-and-development costs over many markets, giving them a decisive cost advantage. Nokia was the biggest winner in this race, rising to second-place status in an astounding three years.<p>
Nokia owes much of its current success to its prowess in getting new products to market fast, enabling the company to alter new phone models quickly for constantly shifting consumer tastes. While the industry average for rolling out new phones is three to four years, Nokia can introduce a new product in 18 months. <p>
**Ericsson took the lead last fall when new technology failed to take off for Nokia.**<p>
But the marketing-savvy company stumbled badly last year on the technology front -- as did Motorola -- letting Ericsson grab the initiative. While the old analog system for sending phone calls still dominates in the U.S., four out of five European phones are based on newer digital technology, which can carry three times as many calls as analog, with better quality to boot. As digital was introduced to the U.S. over the past year, the price of analog phones plummeted 40 percent, causing massive headaches for all three manufacturers. At the same time, Nokia cost itself a lot of money when it bet last fall that digital would become an overnight hit -- when it didn't, the company was forced to offer big discounts on loads of unsold digital handsets. <p>
"They dropped the ball there," says Ajay Diwan, wireless-equipment analyst for Goldman Sachs. "They really misjudged U.S. market demand."<p>
**The industry is split between two competing technologies: TDMA and CDMA.**<p>
A battle between two competing digital standards -- a proven technology called TDMA (time division multiple access) and a promising but experimental one called CDMA (code division multiple access) -- makes judging the growth rate for digital phones extremely tricky. With a single standard yet to emerge, many cell-phone makers are jockeying for position. Motorola and <a name="NYSE:LU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46656"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lucent</b></a>, the <a name="NYSE:T"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10103"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AT&T </b></a>spin-off, have invested billions in CDMA, while Ericsson is banking on TDMA. Because CDMA is proving far more difficult and expensive to implement than initially thought, Ericsson seems to have made the smart choice, at least for the next few years.<p>
"For a while, everyone was saying, 'Where's Ericsson?'" says Albert Lin, an industry analyst with New York– based institutional broker Cowen & Co. "Now it seems like they have emerged almost overnight." Credit the company's research-and-development budget: In 1995, Ericsson spent nearly 20 percent of sales on R&D, versus Motorola's 9 percent and Nokia's 6 percent.<p>
**While Ericsson retains top position in the field, Japanese firms are edging in on the market.**<p>
Ericsson is well positioned to put that research edge to work when the industry makes its next great technology leap into the mass-market personal-communications services business. Dataquest estimates that the market for PCS handsets will be $3 billion a year by 1998 in the U.S. alone. Ericsson has a commanding lead in both PCS handsets and the underlying infrastructure that provides the service; this should let the company win far more business than either Motorola or Nokia.<p>
If only Ericsson can keep the field to itself. With stakes this high, the market is also attracting the Japanese electronic giants <a name="NYSE:SNE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41885"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sony</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41873"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Matsushita</b></a> (the maker of Panasonic phone equipment), and <a name="NYSE:NIPNY"></a><b>NEC</b> -- each of which has approximately a 3 percent share of the market currently -- as well as Dutch-based <a name="NYSE:PHG"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41823"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philips</b></a> and <a name="NYSE:ALA"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41751"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Alcatel Alsthom</b></a> of France.<p>
Even with all these new players flooding the field, investors in the industry's next stage should be able to apply the same kind of analysis that has shown Ericsson to be the cellular-phone market's current leader. Look for the company best able to get the technology and features sought by consumers quickly to market. Look for the cost-efficient producers who can use their marketing and technological savvy to keep their profit margins higher than those of their competitors. Thinking globally isn't as hard as it looks -- and it's a whole lot more profitable than the alternative.<p>

						Simply put, government-bond-fund managers can't beat a five-year treasury<p>
By Scott Burns<p>
Let's be blunt: government-securities mutual funds don't deserve to exist. <p>
Of the 634 funds (with nearly $130 billion in assets) dedicated to investing in the various types of United States government securities, all but a handful have been a disappointment -- sometimes a bitter disappointment -- to their shareholders. Thousands of investors, many of them retirees, fled the meager yields of bank CDs only to discover that government-bond funds themselves produced low yields and often took a bite out of an investor's capital as well. These investors would have done better if they had simply bought Treasury bills, notes, and bonds and held them to maturity. In this part of the fixed-income market, coughing up fees for active management almost never pays off. <p>
Except for the fund managers, that is. These same funds have provided very nice revenues to their management companies and generated millions in marketing fees for their sales forces. <p>
To see just how miserably the government funds have performed as a group, compare them with passive indexes for the same pool of securities. In the five-year period ended July 31, for instance, the average government mortgage fund provided an annualized return of 6.16 percent, according to data from Morningstar, while the Lehman Brothers mortgage-backed-securities index returned 7.46 percent. That's quite a gap.<p>
Similarly, funds categorized as Government General by Morningstar returned 6.52 percent annually during the period while the Lehman Brothers Government Index returned 8.01 percent. The figures in the table on page 136 show that a performance gap existed for every major time period from 1 to 15 years. <p>
What we are talking about here is a massive failure to deliver the goods.<p>
Let's turn these bloodless figures into the actual results investors experienced. Suppose, for example, that you had invested $10,000 in Putnam U.S. Government Income A shares five years ago in August. This fund, sold through many brokerage houses, has $2.6 billion in assets and is one of the ten largest government funds. <p>
If you were retired and instructed the fund to send you all interest income but to reinvest any capital gains, your $9,525 investment (after the commission) would have declined in value to $8,979, and you would have received some $3,372 in interest income.<p>
An investment in a simple five-year Treasury at the same time would have produced a 7.43 percent yield, creating $3,715 in interest income. It also would have returned your original $10,000 at maturity. You could, in other words, have had more income, less risk, a real guarantee that your original principal would be returned, and no sales charge. Somehow, during a period when interest rates declined -- which sent the prices of bonds up -- the actively managed fund lost more than a tenth of this investor's principal and paid less in interest, too.<p>
The point here is not to pillory Putnam U.S. Government Income (among large funds, Federated Fund for U.S. Government Securities A shares and Colonial U.S. Government A shares did worse). While one or two of the funds beat the five-year Treasury, they are the exceptions that prove the rule. The real point is that this entire mutual-fund category can't cut the mustard. As they say in Texas: They ain't worth shooting.<p>
Kind of a broad-brush statement, you say? Let's see.<p>
To test the idea, I assembled a list of the 20 largest government-securities funds as a portfolio -- since the 25 largest government funds account for half the assets in the category, the sample is representative of what most fund shareholders experienced. Then I examined their performance in every five-year span since January 1988 -- a total of 44 60-month time periods. Treating the group as a portfolio and counting anything that exceeded the original $10,000 investment as a return on investment -- just like investing in a CD -- I calculated the average performance in each of those time periods and compared it with that of a simple five-year Treasury obligation purchased at the same time.<p>
Guess what?<p>
The five-year Treasury beat the average in 34 of the 44 time periods. Averaging all 44 time periods, I found that a $10,000 investment in a five-year Treasury would have produced $442 more in income, even though interest rates, when averaged, fell a whopping 2.23 percentage points during the study. <p>
At best, the $10,000 Treasury investment outperformed the average fund by $1,142 (between January 1990 and December 1994). At worst, the Treasury bond lagged the index of funds by $337 (between September 1988 and August 1993). <p>
Although the past three years have sent interest rates on a roller-coaster ride, surprisingly there wasn't a single five-year period during which interest rates hadn't declined. If bond-fund managers can't beat a simple Treasury purchase in periods of declining interest rates, how will they do if interest rates actually climb? In that environment, buying a five-year Treasury and holding it to maturity -- which produces slightly less income but guarantees a return of principal -- will look just that much better.<p>
How difficult is it to buy a U.S. Treasury with a five-year maturity? Not very. The Treasury auctions five-year notes each month, and you can participate -- at no cost -- through the Treasury Direct program (202-874-4000) or through a broker-dealer for  about $50. The minimum purchase amount is $1,000 -- which is less than for many mutual funds. So what are you waiting for?<p>
<center><strong>EVEN THE BEST BARELY CUT IT</strong></center>
<img src="/imgs/9611I02-chart1.gif" width=475 height=210><p>
Among the largest government-bond funds, only two of the ten best performers beat a humble five-year Treasury note. A version of this table listing the 20 biggest funds is updated monthly on the World Wide Web at <a HREF="http://www.scottburns.com.">www.scottburns.com.</A><p>
<center><strong>GOVERNMENT FUNDS FAIL TO MEASURE UP</strong></center>
<img src="/imgs/9611I02-chart2.gif" width=475 height=210><p>
Over all time periods, actively managed government funds -- whether they specialize in mortgage-backed securities or invest in the full range of government issues -- fail to beat the passive indexes. An investor is better off buying and holding a Treasury.

						Our picks for 401(k) portfolios limited to one fund family<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
Wait a minute, you say. My 401(k) plan limits me to funds from one family. Can I still build a diversified portfolio?<p>
Well, pretty close, though it may take some juggling. The 401(k) plans are offering more fund choices in their menus, and the biggest names now almost routinely offer lots of options. But none of the families below offers funds that are open to new investors in all five categories. For example, none offers an open small-cap value fund. It will also take creativity to add the right global mix to several of these menus. Here are our recommendations for four single-family portfolios. The asset classes are indicated in parentheses; all returns are average annual figures.<p>
**<A HREF="http://personal.fidelity.com/funds/fund_data/fund_data.html">Fidelity</A>**<p>
Fidelity. Worldwide (GLO), $$$$, 12.2 percent five-year return, low risk; Low-Priced Stock (SCG), $$$$$, 19.3 percent five-year return, low risk; Contrafund (LCG), $$$$, 17.5 percent five-year return, high risk; Equity-Income II (LCV), $$$$, 16.2 percent five-year return, moderate risk. <p>
**<A HREF="http://www.troweprice.com/">T. Rowe Price</A>**<p>
T. Rowe Price. For GLO, combine equal amounts New Asia ($$$$$, 12.7 percent five-year return, moderate risk) and European Stock ($$$$, 12.4 percent five-year return, low risk); Over-the-Counter Securities (SCG), $$$$, 17.1 percent five-year return, low risk; Growth Stock (LCG), $$$$$, 14.0 percent five-year return, low risk; Capital Appreciation (LCV), $$$, 12.5 percent five-year return, low risk.<p>
**<A HREF="http://www.putnaminv.com/">Putnam</A>**<p>
Putnam. For GLO, combine equal amounts Europe Growth A ($$$$, 14.2 percent five-year return, moderate risk) and Asia Pacific Growth A ($$$, 12.37 percent five-year return, high risk); New Opportunities A (SCG), $$$$, 26.2 percent five-year return, high risk; Vista A (LCG), $$$, 18.2 percent five-year return, high risk; for LCV, use Equity Income A (an LCG fund moving toward LCV), $$$, 13.4 percent five-year return, moderate risk.<p>

						By Jim Jubak<p>
Diversifying a portfolio by investing in different asset classes not only can reduce risk but also has been shown to enhance performance. What's an asset class? Actually, it's just a useful abstraction -- a way of describing a group of investments with similar performance characteristics. To build an effective portfolio, we divided the universe of qualified equity funds (those with five years of history and assets of $50 million) into the five asset classes shown below. Our system features minimal overlap but broad reach. Each category also offers a different level of risk, as measured by standard deviation over the past three years. (Standard deviation is a measure of the variation of a fund's performance over time.) Risk decreases as you go from the top of the list (global funds) to the bottom (large-cap value). In addition, the classes have different performance characteristics in relation to one another and to the market as a whole.<p>
Global Funds. 
<img src="/imgs/WP1028A.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
These 116 funds all have at least 40 percent of their assets overseas. Of our five categories, this one shows the greatest standard deviation and therefore the highest risk. The funds in this category are the least likely to track the U.S. market -- making them a key element in a diversified portfolio. This class is most likely to be overlooked or underweighted.<p>
Small-cap Growth Funds. 
<img src="/imgs/WP1028B.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
These 114 funds try to buy the stock of small companies soon to become big companies. Earnings of the companies in these portfolios are growing at 28.8 percent annually. These risky funds show the highest beta, the highest price-to-earnings ratio, and the highest standard deviation among our four domestic categories.<p>
Large-cap Growth Funds. 
<img src="/imgs/WP1028C.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
These 396 funds seek big companies that are still growing rapidly. The companies in these funds average an annual earnings growth rate of 20.8 percent. Big companies tend to grow more slowly than small ones, but they're also less risky: The price-to-earnings ratio averages 23.2 and the standard deviation 10.3.<p>
Small-cap Value Funds. 
<img src="/imgs/WP1028D.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
The managers of the 19 funds in this group try to limit their risk and maximize their gains by purchasing the stocks of smaller companies at bargain prices. On average, they pay less than twice book value for a company's shares. The category's beta is just 0.63, far below the beta of 1.0 for the market as a whole. <p>
Large-cap Value Funds. 
<img src="/imgs/WP1028E.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
The managers of the 74 funds in this group try to spot the stocks of big companies that, for one reason or another, may be sharply undervalued by the market. The average price-to-book ratio of a stock in these portfolios is 2.5. With a standard deviation of just 8.9 and a beta of 0.79, these funds are extremely low risk. <p>

						If you've taken our advice, you've prospered.<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
We developed our system for picking mutual funds two years ago, choosing the first set of five recommended funds in our November 1994 issue and our second set of five in November 1995. We've continued to refine and improve the system since then, but the underlying methodology is essentially unchanged.<p>
So how have our earlier picks fared? And should readers who followed our advice in 1994 or 1995 jettison any of the funds they bought then in favor of the latest crop?<p>
The short answer to both questions: We're reasonably content with our earlier selections. Seven of the ten look as solid to us today as when we picked them. We're somewhat concerned about two of our other past choices. And in a third case, we have definitely concluded that investors should abandon ship in an orderly fashion.<p>
<img src="/imgs/CH360240.PICT.gif" width=360 height=240><p>
So far, we haven't picked the same fund twice to appear in our top five, but that generally has little to do with the performance of any of our picks. For example, two of our top five funds from last year, <a name="FUND:PRNHX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRNHX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price New Horizons</b></a> and <a name="FUND:PRSVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PRSVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value</b></a>, are now closed to new investors. Their 12-month returns as of August 31, 1996, were 22.04 percent and 17.09 percent, respectively -- both well above the performance of their benchmarks (the Russell 2000 Growth and Russell 2000 Value indexes). <a name="FUND:HRTVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HRTVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Heartland Value</b></a>, a 1994 top pick, also remains closed. Heartland matched its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Value index, during our most recent 12-month measurement period, earning a 12.12 percent return.<p>
It doesn't surprise us a bit that Mutual Beacon and Mutual Qualified, our top picks in the large-cap-value category in 1994 and 1995, respectively, earn $$$$$ ratings again this year. Neither, however, was selected for one of our top five spots this time around. Portfolio manager Michael Price recently sold the fund's parent company to the Franklin Templeton Group, which, in turn, will impose a 4.5 percent sales charge on new investors beginning October 25. That was all we needed to hear -- even considering Beacon's 12-month return of 14.86 percent and Qualified's 13.87 percent. Respectable, yes, but not enough to justify an exorbitant sales charge.<p>
Last November, we were worried about the performance of <a name="FUND:WIETX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WIETX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus International Equity Fund Common Shares</b></a>, our 1994 choice for best global fund. This year, we're pleased to say that Warburg has proved the danger of putting too much weight on one-year returns. Although the fund trailed its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley EAFE index, in our 1995 ratings, it bounced back smartly in our most recent rating period, returning 9.87 percent. That handily beat the EAFE. Meanwhile, our 1995 global pick, <a name="FUND:FWWGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FWWGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Founders Worldwide Growth</b></a>, did even better, returning 11.44 percent. Our top global choice this year, though, outflanked these two because it is better suited to our new asset-allocation model.<p>
We do think that the performances of two funds from the 1994 and 1995 group bear continued close scrutiny. Spiros Segalas's <a name="FUND:HACAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/HACAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Harbor Capital Appreciation</b></a>, a 1995 pick, returned just 7.77 percent during the latest 12-month period -- the result of last summer's rout in technology stocks. Segalas has shown an ability to ride out such short-term volatility before, so we think investors should hang on. <p>
We also aren't jumping for joy over the fact that <a name="FUND:WAAEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WAAEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wasatch Aggressive Equity</b></a>, a 1994 pick, returned just 3.21 percent for the recent 12-month period, about six percentage points below its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth Index. It looks to us as though portfolio manager Samuel S. Stewart Jr. took just enough risk to get clobbered last summer but wasn't aggressive enough to have built up a cushion in the momentum-driven market of 1995 and early 1996. We think this fund is worth sticking with, however, especially since it's now closed to new investors.<p>
The one fund pick we'd definitely like to have back is <a name="FUND:FDEQX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FDEQX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Disciplined Equity</b></a>, our 1994 choice for best large-cap growth fund. This year, it dropped to a $$$ rating and returned just 6.46 percent during the most recent 12 months. That's well below its five-year average annual performance of 13.89 percent.<p>
What frightens us now is that manager Brad Lewis seems to have revised the elaborate software model he uses to pick stocks. Our worry is that Lewis may be giving too much weight to the kinds of stocks that have been winners lately, rather than sticking with the style that earned him his early success. That on top of a big drop in the fund's predictor rating in 1995 means the fund just doesn't have the consistency we require for inclusion in our model portfolio.<p>

						How to shape a portfolio that suits you and your life<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
The Worth Portfolio (see below) provides a good starting point. But investors also can create portfolios of their own design to better address a specific objective, to balance another investment, or even to suit their own temperament.<p>
To illustrate how to do this, we asked Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Florida, to build four asset-allocation models to our specifications: one for an investor who intends to withdraw funds within a few years; one for the owner of a small business; one for an individual who owns a substantial number of his or her employer's shares; and one for someone willing to take on added risk. Ibbotson Associates, the Chicago investment-research firm, provided us with a fifth model, one including bonds and cash, for investors, such as retirees, who want or need a much greater measure of safety. (These models, by the way, can work equally well for investors who buy individual stocks.)<p>
Note that, even accounting for such differences, none of the five models gives less than 15 percent of the pie to international equities -- an asset class still neglected by U.S. investors and probably the simplest way anyone can improve returns and reduce risk. Also note that increasing the slice of a portfolio devoted to small-cap stocks can boost performance. Ibbotson's research shows that small-cap stocks have returned an average of about 12.5 percent annually from 1926 to 1995, two percentage points above the return of large-cap issues.<p>
Recent academic research has shown that investors who buy value stocks -- those downtrodden issues no one seems to want -- will earn better returns than those who chase stocks in the more glamorous growth category. Our custom portfolios therefore place more emphasis on the value style of investing. <p>
Evensky's single biggest allocation adjustment comes in the portfolio designed for a small-business owner. This suggests how important it can be to take a holistic view of your investments, including all the assets you own, not just your stock or mutual-fund portfolio.<p>
**The Worth Portfolio**<p>
The Worth Portfolio
This basic yet effective model is a good starting point for any investor. It's specifically designed for a 45-year-old who plans to remain invested for at least 20 years. It offers moderate risk and can be built with mutual funds, stocks, or a combination of both.
30%     Large-Cap Value<br>
22%     Global<br>
20%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
15%     Small-Cap Value<br>
13%     Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
**The Parent**<p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029B.gif" width=352 height=240>
30%     Large-Cap Value<br>
29%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
18%     Global<br>
12%     Small-Cap Value<br>
11%     Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
Won't be long before the kids head off to college? Even determined long-term investors often have short-term goals. The asset-allocation model above takes this into account by reducing the portfolio's overall risk exposure. It moves funds out of more-volatile international equities and also reduces the total investment in small-cap stocks. It increases safety by upping the percentage devoted to the more stable large-cap growth arena.<p>
**The Valued Employee**<p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029D.gif" width=352 height=240>
30%     Large-Cap Value<br>
25%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
21%     Global<br>
15%     Small-Cap Value<br>
9%      Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
Grants of stock have become a popular way for companies to reward their most valued employees. But don't forget to include this asset when figuring your overall investment strategy. Consider where your employer's stock might fall in our asset-allocation scheme and reduce your exposure in that area. A worker at a high-tech company, for example, might want to cut back holdings in small-cap growth stocks, as shown above.<p>
**The Entrepreneur**<p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029E.gif" width=352 height=240>
45%     Large-Cap Value<br>
28%     Global<br>
27%     Large-Cap Growth<br><p>
We're living in a time when layoffs and early retirement are turning more and more of us into middle-aged entrepreneurs. If a substantial portion of your net worth is now tied up in a small business, allocating your investments along the lines shown above may represent an effective strategy. This portfolio is designed for an investor whose business-related equity and investment portfolio are roughly equal in size.<p>
**The Cautious Investor**<p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029C.gif" width=352 height=240>
40%     Short-Term Bonds<br>
15%     Large-Cap Value<br>
15%     Global<br>
10%     Cash<br>
8%      Large-Cap Growth<br>
5%      Intermediate-Term Bonds<br>
5%      Small-Cap Value<br>
2%      Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
There is a strong argument to be made for an all-equity portfolio. History says it is the best way to reap the biggest long-run gains. Still, many investors prefer a safer, if less lucrative, route. This model, designed by Ibbotson Associates, adds cash and short-term and intermediate -- but not long-term -- bonds to the mix for an investor who desires current income, liquidity, or just a better night's sleep.<p>
**The Optimist**<p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029A.gif" width=352 height=240>
28%     Global<br>
27%     Small-Cap Value<br>
20%     Large-Cap Value<br>
14%     Small-Cap Growth<br>
11%     Large-Cap Growth<br><p>
Willing to accept more pain for more gain? For the aggressive investor intent on maximizing return -- and ready to ride out near-term dips, potholes, and craters -- the above model de-emphasizes humdrum blue chips and sharply increases the percentage of assets invested in both foreign issues and small stocks. This approach may make the most sense for investors with extremely long time horizons, such as people in their 20s or early 30s.<p>

						Rated: 719 equity funds. Picked: the best five. Built: a series of model portfolios. All to suit your real-world finances.<p>
By Jim Jubak<p>
The ideal mutual-fund selection system would do four important things. It would offer a rational, defensible system for identifying which among the best-performing equity funds are likely to maintain a stellar record. It would enable investors to build a portfolio of such funds based on an effective asset-allocation model -- one that would improve returns and reduce risk. It would allow investors to customize their portfolios to suit their specific needs and objectives. And it would provide a framework that would easily accommodate people who own other investments, such as a portfolio of individual stocks or employee stock options.<p>
Such a system is exactly what we set out to construct this year as part of our annual review of mutual-fund performance. In the tables following this story, you'll find our usual dollar-sign ratings for more than 700 funds -- from $$$$$ for the best to a single $ for the worst. Along the way, we'll also reveal our top fund in each of five categories. <p>
We'll also explain how readers can take advantage of our methods to make the best choices in assembling a truly personal investment portfolio.<p>
As a guide, we've developed a basic portfolio model to meet the needs of the typical long-term investor -- plus five additional portfolios modified to fit life as Americans really live it. Investors need to send children to college, they own small businesses, they receive compensation in the form of company stock. Some of us can stand to be aggressive with our investments; others need steady current income or just don't have the stomach for a wild ride. All these factors change the way an investor should allocate investments in their portfolios. We've also included advice on how to assemble the best portfolio within the limitations of the typical 401(k) plan.<p>
Our models use the five fundamental asset classes we introduced two years ago: large-capitalization growth, large-cap value, small-cap growth, small-cap value, and global. Together, these groups not only cover the widest possible range of proven investing strategies but also offer the best-known combination for enhancing return while limiting risk. These categories also allow investors who own individual stocks to calculate their exposure in each group -- and to adjust their overall holdings of funds and stocks accordingly.<p>
This general approach, derived from modern portfolio theory and most commonly referred to as asset allocation, has recently become the hot trend in the financial-services industry. One by one, the biggest mutual-fund families -- those that have garnered the lion's share of the 401(k) business -- have begun shifting their marketing campaigns away from the cult of the superstar fund manager. The new emphasis, promoted in the educational programs that are offered through employers to 401(k) participants, is on providing investors with a selection of funds that can be clearly distinguished from one another, that offer clear and consistent styles, and that can be easily combined in a portfolio that is relatively stable.<p>
Brokerage companies, along with the rapidly growing financial-adviser industry, are preaching the gospel, too. What are they offering to justify their fees? Basically, it boils down to asset allocation. <p>
Why Asset Allocation Works<p>
Asset allocation actually seems a strange tool to seize upon as a marketing edge because it isn't all that complicated to execute once you understand the basic principles. It's based on research, begun in the 1950s, that shows how an investor who combines assets with different characteristics in a portfolio can achieve optimal results over the long term.<p>
Asset allocation, for example, lies behind the oft repeated recommendation to blend international equities with domestic stocks to increase performance and lower risk. At first blush, that might seem a mistake. By themselves, foreign stocks are historically riskier than U.S. equities. Yet when an investor adds a mix of international equities to a domestic-stock portfolio, overall risk does decline. According to calculations by Bankers Trust Global Investment Management, for example, from 1971 through 1995, a portfolio of 60 percent U.S. stocks and 40 percent non-U.S. stocks returned about one percentage point more annually and had a standard deviation about 2.5 percentage points lower than a portfolio of 100 percent U.S. stocks. (Standard deviation is a commonly accepted way to measure risk.)<p>
It's actually not the risk level of each asset class that's important; it's how the asset classes work together. Asset allocation reduces risk because some investment classes zig when others zag. Markets that move in the same direction most of the time are said to be highly correlated. There's not much point in building a portfolio around two highly correlated assets. But putting together two assets with a low correlation can give a portfolio quite a pop.<p>
Nor do investors have to go overseas to find assets with low correlations. Inside the U.S. market, different segments move out of step at times. For example, in 1977, the large-company stocks of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index lost about 7 percent. Small-company stocks, on the other hand, climbed 25 percent. Value and growth stocks also move out of step as they respond differently to the cycles of economic growth.<p>
The needs and goals of an investor dictate which combination of asset classes is most appropriate. The goal of good asset allocation is to get the most return for the acceptable risk in each situation.<p>
To see how this works, look at the model portfolios "The Optimist" and "The Cautious Investor." Each lies along what is called the efficient frontier, a theoretical line that shows the amount of return an investor should aim for at any given level of risk (and vice versa). Badly designed portfolios diverge from this line either by taking on more risk than they need to or by returning less than they should for the risk they take. Well-designed portfolios are those that show the best trade-off between risk and reward.<p>
For example, our Optimist portfolio is projected to return a compounded 13.4 percent a year, according to historical returns for equities as calculated by Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago investment-research firm. (This, like all financial calculations, assumes that the future will resemble the past.) But this portfolio's standard deviation is 17.9 percent -- which means that about two-thirds of the time its return will fall between 31.3 percent and negative 4.5 percent. Quite a ride.<p>
Our Cautious portfolio, on the other hand, is projected to return an average annual 12.1 percent with a standard deviation of 7.3 percent. Two-thirds of the time, this portfolio's return will fall between 4.8 percent and 19.4 percent. That's certainly a lot less risk -- but look at the difference in return. Over 20 years, $10,000 in the Optimist portfolio would grow to $123,669. In the Cautious portfolio it would reach just $98,200. Is one of these models better than the other? Not at all. But one is certainly more appropriate for a given investor.<p>
Asset allocation can get pretty arcane at this point, as investors try to determine whether to carry, say, 23 percent or 24 percent of their portfolio in small-cap value stocks. This kind of precise optimization -- along with constant updates -- is what the institutions and advisers are peddling. We believe, though, that this degree of accuracy is best suited to institutional investors who can afford to fine-tune a portfolio daily. Most individual investors can do very well with the kind of basic allocation shown below and the modifications shown in the box on pages 102 and 103.<p>
Having made the fundamental decisions about asset allocation, the investor should then identify an investment vehicle or vehicles for each asset class. In the case of a fund portfolio, an investor needs to be able to select a mutual fund that invests effectively in each category. Buying a fund that wanders all over the block, investing in small caps one minute and in Dow Jones Industrials the next, would subvert an investor's model. Fidelity's popular Magellan Fund, for instance, altered its investing strategy so drastically in the past year that we had to move it from our large-cap-growth category into large-cap value. Funds that do this force asset-allocation investors to keep readjusting their portfolios to bring them back into balance.<p>
This is one reason many people favor funds tied to certain stock-market indexes. By definition, these funds must remain consistent in the way they invest. Index funds make a lot of sense for another reason, too: They outperform most active fund managers. By buying an index fund, an investor gets stylistic consistency and returns that are likely to beat as many as three-quarters of all managers.<p>
But index funds also have drawbacks. They work best in efficient sectors of the market like large-cap growth, where the Vanguard Index 500 fund earns $$$$ in our ratings. The fund's five-year average annual return of 13.44 percent ranks it above the 75th percentile in the range of returns of all funds in this category.<p>
In the less efficient category of small-cap growth, the Vanguard Index Small Cap Stock fund doesn't do quite as well. It still earns a $$$$ rating, but its 15.53 percent average annual five-year return puts it in only the 61st percentile in its category. What's more, there are no index funds at all in the small-cap- and large-cap-value categories. Nor does any broad-based index fund appear on our global list. <p>
We use actively managed funds in our system because we believe we can identify managers who have demonstrated substantial expertise in choosing stocks in specific segments of the market -- enough to give them an edge over an index, where one exists -- and who are willing to stick to their guns even when their particular style may be out of favor with the broader market. <p>
How We Pick the Best Funds<p>
Each year, we search for such mutual-funds managers by dividing the universe of funds into our five asset classes. We start with recent data provided by Morningstar in Chicago but rely on our own research to fill holes in the numbers and to verify the accuracy of the information. We look only at equity mutual funds with track records of at least five years and assets of at least $50 million. Sector funds -- those that invest only in a specific industry -- don't fit our definition of an asset class, so we do not include them. This year, 719 equity funds meet our minimum requirements.<p>
Next, we split out the global and international funds (this year there were 116), giving us one of our five asset categories. Domestic funds are then divided into four groups through a two-step process.<p>
First, we divide the funds on the basis of whether they invest primarily in small- or large-cap stocks. ("Cap" here refers to the median market capitalization of the stocks in the fund's portfolio.) We designate a fund as large cap if its median market capitalization is more than $1.8 billion. Small-cap funds fall below that level.<p>
Second, with the help of index analyst Kevin Maloney at Frank Russell Co. in Tacoma, Washington, we classify domestic funds based on whether they are more apt to buy stocks for their growth potential or for their instrinsic value. To do this, we look at the median price-to-book ratio (the relationship between the price of a stock and its underlying asset value) for the stocks in each fund's portfolio. Among large-cap funds, a median price-to-book ratio above 2.96 puts a fund into our growth category; anything below that goes into value. For small-cap funds, we use a median price-to-book ratio of 2.23 as the dividing line.<p>
These two steps do most of our work for us. To double-check our choices, we go back through the funds, looking at such things as the average price-to-earnings ratio and the average growth rate of the stocks they hold. In many cases, we also look at a fund's top stock holdings -- all this to make sure we place each fund in the appropriate investing category. <p>
The five categories give us the building blocks of an effective, diversified portfolio that balances large-cap funds against small-cap, value against growth, and domestic funds against those that invest around the world.<p>
But we also want to know which funds in each asset category do a good job and which are no better than mediocre. So we rate each for return, risk, and predictability.<p>
We score for return (total investment return minus the effect of sales charges) by comparing each fund's performance against that of its peers during the past five years. Our tables list this score for each fund as well as its raw one-, three-, and five-year results. (We treat global funds a little differently, dividing the category into two peer groups for the purpose of scoring -- one for funds with more than 75 percent of their assets outside the U.S. and one for funds with at least 40 percent overseas.)<p>
To calculate risk, we focus on three measures: standard deviation (which shows the degree of variance in a fund's performance over time); beta (a measure of a fund's volatility in relation to the entire stock market); and turnover (the percentage of stocks in a fund's portfolio that are bought and sold over the course of a year). We give each fund a high-, medium-, or low-risk rating based on how it stacks up against its peers for each of the three measures.<p>
Our predictor rating, a feature found in no other fund-ranking system, assesses how likely a fund is to repeat its past performance. To arrive at this score, we check the tenure of a fund's manager during the five-year study period, look at the rate of growth in a fund's assets since 1993, and compare current ratios such as beta and price-to-book with the same measures three years ago. In each case, we check for big changes that could signal shifts in a fund's style.<p>
Our final overall rating, expressed by dollar signs, rates each fund based on its level of return, risk, and predictability. Only funds with scores in the top 5 percent of their peer group earn our highest $$$$$ rating. <p>
An investor wouldn't go wrong using any of our $$$$$ funds to construct a portfolio. Some suggestions on how to do this can be found in the box on pages 102 and 103.<p>
To identify our favorite in each category, Worth editors take a close look at each of the top scorers. At this point, the process does become somewhat subjective. What do we know about the manager? What do we think of his or her overall strategy? Do we agree with his or her top stock picks? Do we have reason to believe that this fund will continue to perform in the future as it has in the past? <p>
We selected the five funds that appear in the profiles below. As you read about these funds, you'll note that each has a clear, distinct investing style, one that its manager has stuck with over the years and one that has served it exceedingly well. Each fund has been on top of its game for some time, and we see no reason why it shouldn't stay there in the years ahead. <p>
Best Small-Cap Growth Fund<p>
ACORN
We like Acorn because we like senior manager Ralph Wanger and the way he picks stocks. He's a classic small-cap investor who uses a disciplined, beat-the-bushes approach to uncover small companies that stand a chance of one day becoming large companies. His objective is to find small companies that he can hold over the long term. (The annual turnover rate of the 350-odd stocks in Acorn's portfolio is a skimpy 29 percent.) <p>
Wanger has a couple of firm rules about stock picking. First, stay away from short-term investing because it costs shareholders money when a fund realizes capital gains and because trading costs on small-company stocks can push up expenses.<p>
The second Wanger rule: Pay for growth, but don't overpay. The average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in Acorn's portfolio is 25.6 -- not low but well within reason for a fund focusing on small growth stocks.<p>
Wanger does fundamental research on each company he owns and also insists that he or one of his researchers personally interview the company's executives, suppliers, and competitors. "That's very basic," he says. "We always check on a company ourselves." Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, has become a Wanger favorite. So has Carnival Cruise Lines. "The company has to have some sort of theme or a niche that allows you to think they will have a special franchise," says Wanger. <p>
Investors who own Acorn can expect consistency -- in the types of companies in the fund's portfolio and in the manager's style, for Wanger has run Acorn essentially the same way for 26 years. "We've traditionally been a small-cap fund," he says. "We try to stay in more secondary companies, where we think there is more value." <p>
Since mid-1995, Wanger and his longtime partner, Chuck McQuaid, have been sharing their favorite investment ideas in this magazine's regular "What They're Buying Now" column. Worth readers who own this fund can follow along as the pair seeks out new prospects. Wanger also plans to share his long experience next year in a book he's titled A Zebra in Lion Country. "Zebras are good-looking and agile," Wanger says, explaining the title, "but they have to be careful not to get eaten by the lions." <p>
Best Small-Cap Value Fund<p>
<a HREF="http://mjwhitman.com/third.htm">THIRD AVENUE VALUE</A>
Third Avenue Value may well be the best of the so-called vulture funds. Manager Marty Whitman's mission is about as clear as it gets: to identify assets he can buy for 50 cents on the dollar -- with little or no risk. "We want 'em safe and cheap," says Whitman.<p>
The emphasis on safety is critical because, as Whitman explains in his latest report to shareholders, "every security in which TAVF invests has something wrong [with it]." So, once he and his team of researchers identify an opportunity, they generally spend far more time analyzing the ways it might turn sour than the ways it might soar.<p>
Cautious and yet aggressive at the same time, Whitman's approach has produced an average annual return of 15.97 percent since 1991. Throughout this five-year period, the fund's risk level -- as measured by its standard deviation -- has stayed in the bottom quarter of the industry.<p>
A recent Whitman coup: At the end of last year, Third Avenue began investing in Kmart debentures. They were available at 74 cents on the dollar, partly because rumors were circulating that the big retailer might soon be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Whitman's analysis, however, showed that the credits would not only yield 18 percent annually to maturity but hold their full dollar value even in the event of a bankruptcy.<p>
Third Avenue's most recent plays involve companies that supply equipment to semiconductor manufacturers. "All these companies -- the Silicon Valley Group, for example -- have cash flow far in excess of total liabilities," he says. "All are selling at 6 or 7 times their latest 12-month earnings, while the overall market's at about 19 times earnings."<p>
Of course, as with all technology stocks, these companies carry the added risk that their products could suddenly become outmoded. Whitman hedges by "buying across the entire manufacturing process," he explains. "We figured that out of the eight stocks we picked two might go sour, but six will be big winners."<p>
Whitman wouldn't deign to refer to this strategy as diversification. "Diversification is a poor surrogate for knowledge," he declares. In this case, he's banking on semiconductor chips' continuing to be in heavy demand over the next two to five years, as applications increasingly move from computers to more mainstream uses, such as credit cards, telephones, and automobiles.<p>
Whitman's objective is to earn an annual return of 20 percent, and by mid-September he was only halfway there. Patience, however, is critical when it comes to owning Third Avenue. Whitman's plays can take time to develop, but there's no one with a better reputation for turning 50 cents into a dollar.<p>
Best Large-Cap Growth Fund<p>
<a name="FUND:OAKMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OAKMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>OAKMARK</b></a>
Robert Sanborn isn't what you would call his own best salesman. He scoffs at the importance of past performance in picking a fund -- though Oakmark, which he co-founded in 1991 and manages, has returned a remarkable 27.1 percent annually over the past five years. <p>
Sanborn buys a stock only when he'd like to own the whole company -- the Warren Buffett approach to investing. He also puts the bulk of his fund's portfolio (over 70 percent) into a short list of 20 big-company stocks. <p>
Oakmark takes a position in a company when it's selling at 60 percent or less of what Sanborn calculates as the price a rational buyer would pay for it as a whole, i.e., its takeover value. That strategy has spread Oakmark's portfolio across the economy, with some concentration in financial and consumer stocks. Current favorites include <a name="NYSE:MO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11179"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Philip Morris</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BDK"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10214"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Black & Decker</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:BUD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Anheuser-Busch</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:MEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10983"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mellon Bank</b></a>, and <a name="NYSE:FUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15687"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First USA</b></a>. These companies are "all very high-quality, high-return, high-barrier-to-entry businesses with dominant market positions, very loyal end-users, and tremendous international opportunities," Sanborn wrote in a recent shareholder report.<p>
Sanborn makes a point of not having an opinion on the short-term prospects for the market. "I really don't," he says. "At today's valuations levels, I think people should be buying the fund for five years at least and should be able to tolerate a 20 percent decline in their investment value without affecting their lifestyle."<p>
Sanborn and his staff pick stocks one by one. It's a bottom-up process that involves seven analysts, each of whom comes up with ideas that then must compete against those of the other analysts. For a stock to make it into the portfolio, it has to oust one of Oakmark's current top 20 stocks. Turnover this year is below the fund's historically low 18 percent rate.<p>
Best Large-Cap Value Fund<p>
<a name="FUND:DODGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DODGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DODGE & COX STOCK</b></a>
Dodge & Cox Stock is kept on the straight and narrow in two ways: It adheres to a strict investment philosophy, and it's run by an eight-person committee whose newest member joined 12 years ago. The fund itself dates back to 1965. "We all started at Dodge & Cox in a research capacity," says Ken Olivier, a committee member and senior vice president of the San Francisco–based fund.<p>
Team members say that an emphasis on research, combined with the group dynamic, helps maintain the fund's focus. "It really gives us the persistence to stick with companies," says Olivier. "Too often you buy a stock and it doesn't immediately perform. If a stock's not working, but we're still convinced on the fundamentals, we'll even add to our position in small increments." That's reflected in the fund's turnover rate -- a minuscule 13 percent. Says John Gunn, the fund's president and chief operating officer, "We're enormously persistent. We try to distinguish that from stubborn."<p>
An example: Back in 1989, Dodge & Cox took a hefty position in <a name="NYSE:CCI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10345"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Citicorp</b></a> at about $30 a share. Then, says Gunn, "we got caught by the real-estate debacle." The stock dropped to $10 a share. "We looked at it and compared the assets and holdings. We looked at past bank debacles and knew we were looking at a lot of quarters without earnings." Still, Dodge & Cox stuck with its pick. Today, Citicorp is trading at around $87 a share.<p>
At first glance, this fund looks a lot like a Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index fund in disguise. More than 95 percent of its 85 stock holdings, in fact, are included in the index. But there are differences. For one, the average price-to-book ratio of the Dodge & Cox portfolio is close to half that of the S&P 500. For another, the fund has consistently outperformed the S&P 500, returning an average 15.33 percent annually for the past five years, compared with 13.58 for the index.<p>
Dodge & Cox's success also stems from serious cost-consciousness. The fund doesn't advertise, and it often achieves a portfolio turnover rate as low as 10 percent. "In running our firm, one of the goals is to keep expenses as low as possible," says Olivier. "Go back to 1986–1990. Our ratio of expenses to average net assets was in the range of 65 to 69 cents per $100 of assets. Last year we were at 60 cents."<p>
Best Global Fund<p>
<a name="FUND:USIFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/USIFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USAA INTERNATIONAL</b></a>
You don't get where David Peebles has gotten by shying away from the unfamiliar. "The thing I like most about the fund is we're not dealing in efficient markets," says Peebles, manager of USAA International. "I don't find it as interesting to make a decision on buying or selling two or three stocks in an industry where everything is known about the company and everybody has the same information, like choosing between <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a> versus <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a>. The global market isn't efficient yet, because the information is not well-known. So you have greater odds of making a lot more money by selecting the right stock."<p>
What does that say about risk? "I think that being diversified in 40 countries, with over 150 stocks in the fund, the fund has relatively low risk," he says. "Because we have so many stocks, we have no real big bets in any one stock, so we've spread the risk out. Because it's low risk we tend to have good performance in down markets."<p>
Peebles and his two portfolio managers, Travis Selmier and Al Sebastian, begin their company analysis with country analysis: They give great consideration to a country's macroeconomic factors and government policies. Then they get down to some very basic stuff. "If you're working in one market, like the U.S., you can develop one style and be pretty successful," Peebles says. "But when you're working in 40 countries, all of which are in various stages of development, you can't rely on a single style. So you not only have to look at things like standard ratios -- p/e, cash flow, book value -- but you have to look at them in relation to, say, accounting principles of various countries." <p>
Twice a year Peebles, Selmier, Sebastian, and the fund's three analysts each make a two-week overseas trip, stopping in as many as five countries apiece. They visit targeted companies and talk to management and also drop in on central-bank officials and meet with analysts and researchers at local brokerages. All this work has produced average annual returns of 13.01 percent for the past five years, which puts USAA International among the top 10 percent of funds in our global category.<p>

Perched on the edge of his bed, Arthur Bochner bounces excitedly as he discusses his portfolio. "Last week, I hit $100,000, if you count the maturity of my bonds," he says. "It's pretty wild."<p>
But for this 14-year-old, who stashes *Disney coupons in his bedroom safe and scans the Net for prospective buys, investing is elementary. He bought his first stock at age nine. That was two years before he co-wrote (with his mom, a stockbroker and financial planner) The Totally Awesome Money Book for Kids and Their Parents.<p>
"I was in Venezuela on a country road, and all of a sudden I saw a *Blockbuster," Bochner recalls of his very first investment insight. "There was nothing else there." Returning home to South Orange, New Jersey, Bochner bought 100 Blockbuster shares at $17 each. A few months later, he unloaded the shares at $30 apiece. "I was, like, wow!" he says.<p>
Bochner grabs his latest brokerage statement from a shelf lined with chess trophies -- he's ranked eighth in his age-group nationwide -- and reads off some of his current holdings. "*Kyocera is a Japanese company that makes ceramic housings for computer chips," he explains. "It's very volatile because you're investing in the yen." He's got *British Petroleum, because "there's one down the street and I like to stick close to home," and *Mark Twain Bancshares, which sells CDs in foreign currencies.<p>
As an investor, Bochner's got a bundle of confidence. "I'd like to take more risks," he says. "Maybe do puts and calls." As a teenager, though, he's no stranger to adolescent angst. He just started high school. "That's  scary," he says with a nervous bounce.<p>

						10 STOCKS TO AVOID:
Michael Murphy began his newsletter for short-sellers, Overpriced Stock Service, in 1983, when he was struck by glaring discrepancies in the quality of technology companies going public. "There were a lot of junky stocks, and I thought there ought to be a newsletter warning people," he says. Murphy, 54, predicted the breakdown in oil prices in the 1980s and made money shorting savings-and-loans before the industry’s collapse. To identify stocks to short, he looks for companies flashing such danger signs as low cash flow, insider selling, and ballooning inventories. His average short position lasts seven months. Murphy sees little joy at Toys "R" Us this holiday season: The Federal Trade Commission is investigating the company for pressuring toy manufacturers not to sell to less expensive warehouse chains. A bet on an inferior cellular-phone technology could be the downfall of Qualcomm, a stock Murphy has shorted in his own fund. Terms of the partnership between International Paper and IP Timberlands, which harvests timber for paper, will shift in three years and sharply reduce the dividend to shareholders. And Evergreen Media has doubled its debt acquiring radio stations, where growth, says Murphy, will be slow at best. <p>

10 TO CONSIDER: 
Helen Young Hayes is first and foremost a stock picker. "At Janus, we build portfolios stock by stock," says Hayes, who runs the firm’s $3.7 billion <a name="FUND:JAWWX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAWWX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Worldwide Fund</b></a> and $484.8 million <a name="FUND:JAOSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JAOSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Overseas Fund</b></a>, up 22.3 percent and 23.3 percent, respectively, for the 12-month period ended July 31. (Compare that with 9.3 percent and 3.8 percent increases for the Morgan Stanley Capital International World and EAFE indexes.) Hayes -- part of a nine-person international investment team that seeks to identify companies with the potential for strong earnings growth -- argues that Janus’s rigorous bottom-up investment approach "works even better outside the U.S. because the markets are less efficient." Pharmaceutical giants Glaxo Wellcome and SmithKline Beecham, for example, are cheap compared with such U.S. drug companies as Merck. Hayes also likes U.K. pest-control company Rentokil Group and Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer. Although their American depositary receipts are thinly traded on the pink sheets, she says, "I could imagine owning them for ten years." She also advises investors in Grupo Casa Autrey, Grupo Televisa, Telebras, and Telefonica del Peru to be very patient because emerging markets are extremely volatile.<p>

UPDATE:
The October 1995 "10 Stocks to Consider" selections by John L.

It's a matter of potential risk and reward. On July 25, all the stocks below were down at least 50 percent from their 52-week highs. To find out how far each might rebound if Wall Street is right about its future, we multiplied the consensus estimate for earnings per share for the next four quarters by the estimate of the rate of earnings growth. To figure out how low each could go if earnings disappoint, we multiplied the earnings estimate by the stock's lowest annual price-to-earnings ratio in the past five years.<p>

						Heavy number crunching can give quantitative funds an edge in tough markets.<p>
By Michael Peltz<p>
On July 10, money managers John Bogle Jr. and Mark Engerman were at their computers early. Outside the Cambridge, Massachusetts, offices of their firm, Numeric Investors, the gentle flow of the Charles River was in stark contrast to the turbulence on Wall Street. The day before, <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> had announced second-quarter earnings of 54 cents a share, a staggering 20 percent below analysts' estimates. Like many investors, Bogle and Engerman were trying to decide what to do as Motorola opened down more than nine dollars a share.<p>
As quantitative investors, Bogle and Engerman looked to the numbers for guidance. Quantitative analysis -- as distinguished from qualitative analysis, which focuses on hard-to-measure factors such as the quality of a company's management -- usually begins with fundamental numbers like sales and profits. Bogle and Engerman, however, use the numbers on their computer screens to grasp changes in the psychology of the market. In the case of Motorola, "we saw the analysts' [future] earnings estimates falling dramatically after the announcement," says Bogle. This market favorite had so disappointed analysts that investors were dumping shares. This was no time to buy in hope of a rebound, the partners decided. Instead, they shorted the stock, betting that it would tumble further.<p>
This was all a normal day's work for the partners at Numeric Investors -- Bogle, Engerman, and founder Langdon Wheeler. Numeric's quantitative computer models routinely crunch through revisions in analysts' estimates of future corporate earnings to find stocks that will outperform -- or underperform -- the market. The models have certainly worked in the current market: From October 1991 through June 1996, the firm's $500 million institutional small-cap growth portfolio, for example, had an annualized return of 26.7 percent, versus the Russell 2000 growth index's 15.2 percent return for the same period.<p>
The bulk of the more than $2 billion in assets the firm manages has come from institutional investors who understand the value of the quantitative method's almost antiseptic approach to investing. "Focusing on earnings surprises and earnings growth is a tried-and-true method of picking the winners and avoiding the dogs," says Bluford Putnam, chief strategist at Bankers Trust. And focusing on the numbers also helps control risk by preventing the firm from paying too much for stocks in an overheated market. "When markets are down, risk-management controls become more important, and quant strategies are just excellent in that area because they have no feelings," says Putnam.<p>
The average individual investor has been much slower to embrace quantitative shops like Numeric. According to Lipper Analytical Services research coordinator Jon Teall, there are no more than a couple dozen purely quantitative funds among the 6,000-odd mutual funds tracked by his company. Part of the blame for the scarcity goes to the short-short rule, which basically prohibits a mutual fund from having more than 30 percent of its capital gains come from positions held less than 90 days, a not insignificant hurdle for quantitative funds, which depend on high turnover. Mostly, though, it's a matter of marketing. "The mutual-fund business is more of a marketing than investment business, and quant techniques tend to be esoteric and not easily articulated in a few sentences," says Robert Arnott, CEO of quantitative money-management firm First Quadrant.<p>
And some of the money managers marketing quantitative mutual funds have hurt their own cause, too. Until recently, for example, retail investors had access to Numeric's strategies only through two no-load mutual funds marketed by Quantitative Group of Funds of Lincoln, Massachusetts. One of these, the small-cap <a name="FUND:QBNAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/QBNAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quantitative Numeric Fund,</b></a> closed to new money at $100 million, and the other, the mid-cap <a name="FUND:QNIIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/QNIIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Quantitative Numeric II Fund</b></a>, charged investors a hefty 2.34 percent for expenses -- including a 50-basis-point 12b-1 marketing fee (see box on page 140). Last March, frustrated over high fees, Bogle, Engerman, and Wheeler ended that agreement with the Quantitative Group; in June, they introduced three retail mutual funds of their own: <a name="FUND:NIMCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NIMCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>n/i Micro Cap</b></a>, <a name="FUND:NISGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NISGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>n/i Growth</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:NIGVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NIGVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>n/i Growth & Value</b></a> (800-686-3742).<p>
Wheeler, 49, developed what would become Numeric's system while managing his own money from his Shaftsbury, Vermont, farmhouse in the early 1980s. Using an Apple II computer to crunch through earnings forecasts and prices for 300 stocks, Wheeler studied the effect of changes in analysts' earnings estimates on stock prices. Companies with upward changes in earnings expectations often outperformed the market, and those with downward changes usually underperformed. The hard part was predicting the revisions.<p>
By early 1985, Wheeler had built a successful model, but he was out of money. "I was nearly 40, with two young kids, so I decided to find a respectable job," he says. That year he joined <a name="NYSE:STT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14795"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>State Street Bank and Trust</b></a> in Boston, where he showed how his earnings-estimate-revisions model could be run alongside the bank's value model. The resulting Matrix Synthesis product, later modified by current State Street chief investment officer Peter Stonberg and others, is used today by the bank to manage $7 billion. In 1989, Wheeler left the bank and founded Numeric to continue refining his investment models.<p>
State Street's and Numeric's earnings models are based on behavioral psychology as much as on statistical analysis. "Analysts tend to cluster their forecasts," says Engerman, who came to Numeric in 1994 from BARRA, a stock-market-software developer in Berkeley, California, to head up its research. "They don't like to be perceived as being too dramatically different from the rest of the Street." Analysts tend to revise their estimates incrementally rather than all at once. These small revisions then embolden other analysts to update their estimates. "You get this leapfrogging going on with analysts following one another, and the numbers creep up [or down] over time," explains Bogle, who is the son of Vanguard Group chairman John Bogle and who joined Numeric in 1990 after spending three years at State Street, where he got to know Wheeler. Numeric tries to anticipate the "creep" by looking at not only the size and direction of earnings revisions but also the number of analysts changing their estimates and the degree to which optimistic analysts are getting more upbeat or pessimistic ones more gloomy.<p>
The model works best for smaller stocks because a change in just one or two earnings forecasts has a larger impact when only a few analysts are covering a company. "Small stocks with unique products can also sometimes avoid cyclical shifts in the economy," says Wheeler. "The trends for them can be longer lived." Most of the names in Numeric's portfolios are followed by fewer than ten analysts each.<p>
For all its skill in stock picking, Numeric could've chosen a better date to launch its new family of funds, which debuted under the "n/i" name on June 1, just a few days before the tech sector began its summer descent. Unfortunately, the firm's models had it overweighted in technology. "When you get a major sea change in a sector, the estimate-revisions model doesn't allow you to make a smooth transition," says Richard Bernstein, head of quantitative research at <a name="NYSE:MCO"></a><b>Merrill Lynch</b>. This year Numeric's Micro Cap, Growth, and Growth & Value Funds lost 7.6 percent, 6.1 percent, and 7 percent, respectively, through the end of July.<p>
Actually, Numeric may have more to fear from a directionless market than from one headed determinedly downward. Quantitative funds depend on turning over their portfolios frequently -- their success comes from being right more often than not, rather than on picking a handful of big winners. "We're probably right only 53 or 54 percent of the time," says Bogle. "We rely on the law of large numbers." <p>
That results in a lot of trading, especially in a choppy market. "The transaction costs can eat up a quantitative investor if he's not careful," says Merrill's Bernstein. Numeric's annual turnover is a high 250 to 300 percent, but the 19-person firm keeps a tight eye on every trade. "We're absolute hawks on trading efficiency," says Wheeler. <p>
A falling market, however, would be just fine with Bogle, Engerman, and Wheeler. "It doesn't matter if earnings are all down," says Bogle. "We're buying companies where earnings are decreasing the most slowly." And avoiding those stocks where the numbers on Numeric's computer screen show that investors' love has turned to hate.<p>

						Lots of stocks are trading far below their 52-week highs -- a few are good buys now.<p>
By Amy Barrett<p>
The stock market's decline this past July made some stocks look like haute couture gone bargain basement.<p>
For example, <a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Micron Technology</b></a>, one of the country's largest makers of computer memory chips, climbed as high as $94.75 a share last September. In July, it hit $18 a share.<p>
Or consider <a name="NASD:BROD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11907"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Broderbund Software</b></a>, which traded at $31.50 a share on July 25, down from its 52-week high of $78.75; <a name="NYSE:ODP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14308"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Office Depot</b></a> ($13.50 on July 25, down from $32.13); and <a name="NASD:RAYS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16239"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sunglass Hut International</b></a> ($13.25, down from $36.94). Even though stocks in general have moved upward from July lows, many issues are still trading at half their recent highs.<p>
Not all of these stocks are bargains. Some have been unfairly savaged by investors who overreacted to fleeting bad news or who fled a solid stock when an industry peer soured. But other stocks have suffered exactly the punishment they deserved as investors suddenly noticed decaying balance sheets, slowing sales, and declining profit margins. So how does an investor decide if a beat-up stock is a good deal?<p>
Wall Street's perception of what next year's earnings will be is a good place to start. A Wall Street rule of thumb says that an investor should be willing to buy a stock if it trades at a price-to-earnings ratio at or below its earnings growth rate. (But for some caveats on this approach, see "Gauging the Price of Growth," May 1996.) So an investor who believes chip maker <a name="NYSE:LSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13932"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LSI Logic</b></a> will make $1.71 a share in the next four quarters and grow by 20.5 percent annually over the next few years, as Wall Street analysts project, can reasonably value the stock at $35.06 a share, well above its August 6 price of $22.75.<p>
But Wall Street has been known to be wrong about earnings. LSI Logic has traded at a price-to-earnings ratio as low as 13 within the past five years. If analysts are wrong and earnings are headed further downward in the future, the stock could trade at just $22.23 instead of $35.06.<p>
Still, weighing the best-case against the worst-case values demonstrates that LSI isn't a bad bet. At worst, it has a fair value only about 50 cents a share below its current price. At best, its value is about $12 above that price. And, of course, the stock has more upside potential if investors get overly enthusiastic about technology stocks again and send LSI soaring above fair value.<p>
To apply this method to stocks that have recently taken a beating, we first asked Standard & Poor's Compustat to sift through the rubble. The result was a list of the 200 stocks -- each with a market capitalization of at least $500 million -- that, as of July 25, had fallen the most in percentage terms from their 52-week highs.<p>
We also asked Compustat to provide us with the consensus estimate of Wall Street analysts for each company's earnings per share for the next four quarters and the estimated three-to-five-year earnings growth rate for each. To get an idea of how each company's future compared to its recent past, we asked Compustat for the actual earnings growth rate over the past three years and the most recent actual earnings per share. (The 15 best and worst "bargains" are listed in the table to the left.)<p>
Our study showed that earnings for many of these beat-up companies are projected not only to fall but to fall steeply. At Micron Technology, earnings per share, which were $3.96 in the four quarters ended May 1996, are projected at $1.08 for the next four quarters. Actual earnings could be lower. Estimates "are under constant revision," says Ben Zacks, executive vice president of Zacks Investment Research in Chicago. "Only the economy will tell."<p>
When we apply our methodology, Micron Technology doesn't look like much of a bargain, even if that $1.08-a-share estimate holds up. Multiplying Micron's estimated $1.08 a share in earnings for the next four quarters by the consensus estimate of 22.9 percent annual growth rate over the next three years values the stock at just $24.70.<p>
But that $24.70 is by no means guaranteed. A flood of chips flowing into the market from new semiconductor plants could drive Micron Technology's earnings even lower. "For the most part, the semiconductor stocks still have the threat of negative earnings and losses as more capacity comes on stream," says Lary Aasheim, a technology analyst for CoreStates Investment Advisors in Philadelphia, which oversees some $10 billion.<p>
So how low could Micron go? Within the past five years, the stock has traded at a price-to-earnings ratio as low as 7.3. That gives the stock a worst-case value of just $7.88 a share, well below its recent price of $22.25. With a fair value on the upside just $2.45 above its recent market price and a downside more than $14 below the current price, Micron doesn't provide an investor with much potential in exchange for all that risk.<p>
Other fallen stocks, in contrast, look like real bargains. <a name="NASD:HLYW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16431"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hollywood Entertainment</b></a>, a video-store chain, plans to open 210 stores next year -- the same as this year's target. That should provide the impetus for growth, says Michael Legg, an associate analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons. Also, the company has cut costs by evaluating each store's business before ordering new videos to sell and rent. Legg expects the company's earnings per share next year to jump by almost 50 percent. The consensus estimates peg the next four quarters' earnings at 59 cents a share, up from 37 cents. Our method gives Hollywood Entertainment an upside value of $23.60 a share and a downside value of $11.80. The stock recently traded at $14.75.<p>
Bargain-hunting investors should know it's extremely difficult to pick the absolute earnings bottom for a company. At first glance, for example, <a name="NASD:NVLS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14288"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Novellus Systems</b></a> looks like a steal with an upside value of $146.20 a share, a downside value of $70.74, and a recent price of $39.50. But earnings will probably come in far below current projections because demand for semiconductor equipment has slowed, says Jeff Middleswart, an analyst at David W. Tice & Associates. While analysts have already begun trimming their projections, "earnings have a lot further to decline," making it a bad time to buy, he says. The same may be true for other equipment makers, such as <a name="NASD:LRCX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13941"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lam Research</b></a>, <a name="NASD:KLAC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13881"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>KLA Instruments</b></a>, and <a name="NASD:AMAT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12647"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Applied Materials</b></a>, says Middleswart.<p>
Analysts seem to believe that the chip makers on the list, however, have reached the bottom of their earnings cycle. If analysts are right, <a name="NASD:ALTR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12568"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Altera</b></a> should rebound from earnings of $2.35 a share to $2.53, and <a name="NASD:VLSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15037"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>VLSI Technology</b></a> should record earnings of $1.19, up from 98 cents.<p>
Of course, the fact that the turnaround at chip makers is more certain means that, although these stocks don't carry the risk of the semiconductor-equipment makers, they don't have anywhere near the upside potential either. Sadly, in looking for bargain stocks, as in 
other kinds of investing, there is really no such thing as a free lunch.<p>

						Twelve weeks of anxious and improbable brilliance<p>
By Colin Harrison<p>
When a savvy investor friend called to recommend a high-tech small-cap Nasdaq stock last May 3, little did either of us know how bad his recommendation would be nor how much money it would soon make for me. Only recently had I gone on the Internet at work, and even as my pal, a former commodities trader, extolled the company, I realized that if I bought some shares I could check their price hourly. Hopping around the Internet, I'd already found the sites where one can get a stock quote for free on a 20-minute delayed basis (I like <A HREF="http://www.pcquote.com/">http://www.pcquote.com/</A>, where I also check the Dow), and so the prospect of tracking the value of my own shares was an idea that slid into my consciousness like a needle into a willing vein.<p>
But this wasn't what sold me. The company, <a name="NASD:VSNR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47703"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Visioneer</b></a> (VSNR), made inexpensive desktop scanners -- called PaperPorts that plugged into PCs. "They're terriffic!" my friend said. "I have one." The stock price had tumbled in the previous three days from $15 a share to $10.75, and this, he ffigured, was a buying opportunity. Soon, by visiting price-graph sites and the company's home page (<A HREF="http://www.visioneer.com/>http://www.visioneer.com/</A>), I knew Visioneer had gone public last December at $12 a share and seen its price zoom to a high of $23 before falling. It had only $18 million in revenue the previous quarter, with no earnings per share and no dividend. Licensing agreements with <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> boded well, however. Perhaps Visioneer was a solid long-term buy. Or merely one of the tech IPOs that had blossomed in the rains of speculation.<p>
My last question for my friend: "Did you buy it?"<p>
Yes, he said, at $10.125, and so, with a call to <a name="NYSE:SCH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10320"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Charles Schwab</b></a>, I jumped in, too: 3,000 shares at $11.<p>
On margin, no less. Oh, hell -- I had made some money in the tech run-up. I had a feeling. I liked the buzz here. The company made a new, useful product. I'd sit back and dispassionately watch the stock grow.<p>
I'd do nothing of the sort. Within minutes of the completed order, I was obsessively checking the price and volume on my computer, greedily watching those little <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a> comets flickering with possibility. In the pauses at work. While I dialed the phone. Before lunch. After lunch. Fifteen times a day. It took, what, three seconds to flick up the price? If I could check it this often, I wouldn't lose a lot of money, right? Even if, against the advice of my friend, I hadn't put in price stops?<p>
Meanwhile, I found a chat room (<A HREF="http://www.talk.techstocks.com/proffiles/VSNR.html">http://www.talk.techstocks.com/proffiles/VSNR.html</A>) where Visioneer junkies consoled one another on the recent price drop, floated dubious analysis, and made fervid predictions about the future glory of the stock's price: $18, $20, even $30. The prevailing mood was religious, potentially ecstatic. The jargon and insiderish comments comforted me, and my faith soon proved rewarding. On May 9, the stock hit $13. I was up 18.18 percent in six days. Sell or wait? I remembered the famous words of Joseph P. Kennedy: "Only a fool holds out for the top dollar." I sold, moving 1,000 shares at $13.125, 1,600 at $13.25, and the last 400 at $13.375. After commissions, a proffit of $6,295.<p>
I called my friend. Was he still holding the stock? I asked slyly. "Nah," he said, "I was out at 11 and a half."<p>
Seduction takes many forms. Over the next eight trading days, here was Visioneer lap dancing before me. Down to $12.875. Up to $14.50. Down to $11.50. Up to $12.50. Somebody, the market maker presumably, was making serious money. How much could I make? I put together an Excel spreadsheet to figure theoretical proffits and losses after commission and margin interest. And I watched -- like a kid nervously following a jump rope, waiting to time it right, get inside the action. On May 22, I jumped -- in for 1,000 shares at $11.125. Two days later, on May 24, even as doomsayers predicted market carnage, the stock popped up to $13.50, then started to drop. Was I too late? Jump. I sold the 1,000 at $12.375. Proffit: $1,018.09. <p>
It won't get easier than this, I warned myself. I was right. On June 4, I jumped back in for 3,000 shares at $11.125. The price dropped immediately. By June 6, it was below $10. Worried, I consulted the on-line chatter: "The rumor was that they had to recall some PaperPorts in Q1 because of a potential mechanical problem." My friend called me. "Visioneer!" he said. "Yes, yes!" I answered anxiously. He made sounds of commiseration. "You know..." I mused, then repeated some of the arguments for a higher price that had appeared on-line. "And," I concluded, "with that logic I should buy more now." My friend agreed mine was a pretty theory, adding that he would be much impressed if I bought more stock now. I ended the conversation thinking he was a fine fellow indeed for not pointing out what a fool I might soon prove myself to be. But I watched the stock. The volume slowed. The bounce is coming, I thought -- do it. And I did -- 1,000 more shares at $9.75. Now I was in for 4,000 shares, on margin.<p>
On June 7, the stock hit nine dollars, equal to the record low. My proffits were gone. I was, I knew now, an irresponsible fool, a lout, a self-cheat, an unworthy father and husband, a dead dog on the road. But on June 10, the stock ratcheted back up over $10. It closed at $10.75. I kept plugging the numbers into my spreadsheet. The next day, $11.50. I had moved back into the black. The next day, the price popped over $12. I sold 3,000 shares at $12 and the last 1,000 at $11.75, for a proffit of about $4,085.<p>
I had now made seven calls to Schwab (four buys, three sells) and was up more than $11,000. As they say in certain New York City neighborhoods, botta-boom, botta-bing.<p>
Next came a vacation in Tuscany. I told my friend I thought I'd leave a buy order for Visioneer at nine -- in case the price bounced way down for a moment. "Don't!" he warned. "You won't be able to check the market!" "But that would be a record low," I said. "Don't," he responded. "You'll be taken out of your game!" On the last day of my vacation, in a café in Sienna reading the International Herald Tribune, I was able to appreciate his advice. Back in the States, the technology sector was crumbling. The Dow had dropped 115 points. Visioneer had fallen to nine.<p>
On July 8, now home, I slipped into the office early. The day before, I had signed up for Schwab's Internet trading service, and in addition to cheaper trading commissions, I had visions of lightning-fast trades made from my own desk. Zorro of the Internet, thousand-dollar bills on the end of my foil. But, as it turned out, either my computer or the office's server couldn't handle the memory requirements. Nor could I use Schwab's slick e.Schwab service, because I had a Macintosh and not an IBM compatible. Alas, I would have to trade the old-fashioned way, over the phone, while looking at my screen. I clicked off the Internet, discouraged. What a piece of luck. That day, Visioneer sank from $9 to $7.50, a 21 percent drop -- and, let it not be forgotten, a heart-stopping 46 percent drop from the highest price I'd sold at back in May.<p>
The next day, July 9, I logged on to see if there was any particular explanation for Visioneer's drop, perhaps in a news story or a chat room. I found none. But, intriguingly, a Visioneer press release had been carried on the PR Newswire that morning: Visioneer, it said, had just received three patents "covering technical innovation in paper management device design." Maybe this was corporate hype to counteract a sinking stock price. But maybe not! Perhaps the market, which had opened 25 minutes earlier, would bounce upward on bargain hunting. I checked Visioneer's price.<p>
I'd been right and had already missed the move. Visioneer was at $8.50 -- a 13 percent jump. I could have cried. I called Schwab anyway. The clerk gave me a quote of $7.50. "Really?" I asked. This seemed impossible. "Yes," came the answer. Maybe there was some pricing discrepancy, I thought. Better to ffind out later. I took 1,500 shares at $7.50 and waited for the clerk to ffill the order. He did, and then I realized my mistake: The price on my screen was on 20-minute delay. The stock had moved to $8.50 and was falling. Suckers like me were buying it now. Would it go down further?<p>
No -- it stayed at $7.50 awhile, then bounced. Within two hours it was vibrating between $8.50 and $9. I called Schwab. "The last trade was nine," the clerk said. "Put in a sell at nine," I instructed. "The bid is now 8.50," she said. I worried a few seconds. "Take the bid," I responded. <p>
The order went through. A 13 percent jump in two hours. After commission, a proffit of $1,265.65. I was up $12,000 and really didn't know what I was doing.<p>
When my friend, the retired trader, called again to check my progress, he seemed both irritated and amazed at my success, especially in such a wild week. "Let me get this right," he said. "Do you know what Visioneer makes?" <p>
"Scanners."<p>
"Right. What's their main product?"<p>
"Something called PaperPort."<p>
"Where is it sold?"<p>
"I don't know."<p>
"You've never seen it?"<p>
"Right."<p>
"Who is their president?"<p>
"I don't know. Some guy who came from another place."<p>
There was a pause while he calibrated my ignorance. "Who are their major competitors?"<p>
"I forget. I knew, but I forgot."<p>
"What's the next estimate on their earnings?"<p>
"I don't know."<p>
"Amazing," he said. "You're actually trading."<p>
My next attempt came a few days later, and if bad luck was a wall that I was destined to hit, I yearned, strangely enough, for that to happen soon, to bring this terrifying exercise to a humiliating close. What a relief it would be to finally get burned, then swear off this foolishness forever.<p>
Visioneer had moved from $8 to $7, just off its recent 52-week low of $6.75. Stocks had fallen broadly, kicked down by Hewlett-Packard's announcement that its earnings would be disappointing. How bad could it get? I wondered. If Visioneer's price could be imagined as a drunken braggart in a bar, it had been dragged out to the alley, beaten, stabbed, and then shot. It was down 69 percent from its high! And, no great surprise, both trading volume and Internet chatter had slowed to a trickle -- the wounded hiding in silence. I decided to put in a clever little order at $6.75 -- exactly at the all-time low. Maybe I'd snag an early sell, and the stock would vibrate back upward, as it had a tendency to do after a weekly low. I promised myself I'd sell at $7.375, a move of just 62.5 cents but, multiplied by 3,000 shares, a proffit after commissions of about $1,685. With the price so far down, I was forcing greater volume into a narrower bet. Gambling, in other words.<p>
The next day, Tuesday, July 16, lives now in infamy. That was the day know-nothing, jerk-weed speculators like me were said to have finally seen God -- when hundreds of billions of dollars of market capitalization vanished then reappeared. That was the day the Dow jumped up 45 points, then plunged (with the index off 167.19 at the lowest), then rocketed upward 219 points, and finally fell back to close 9.25 up -- on a volume of 695.83 million shares, the most ever. The Nasdaq also broke its volume record, trading 877.33 million that day.<p>
But I knew none of this yet -- only that we seemed to be having an office-wide problem getting on the Internet. Frustrated, I called Schwab to get a price. It was taking longer than usual to be serviced, and a recorded voice asked for my patience. Then I got through. Visioneer was at $7.25, said the clerk. How was the market? I asked. "Well, it was up," he said casually, "and now it's down 50." <p>
I could tell from his voice something was afoot, but I hung up having done nothing. I still had the buy in for 3,000 shares at $6.75. But I couldn't get on-line all morning. I tried 10, 20 times. Then, down the hall, I heard that the market was down 160 points. I felt sick. I didn't want to buy into a dropping market, and I couldn't be calling Schwab every ten minutes -- I had work to do. There was no way to track the price. I called. My buy for 3,000 at $6.75 hadn't gone through. What a relief! I canceled the order. Now I'm cool, I told myself.<p>
Bad move. <p>
The stock dropped to $6.50 then closed back up at $7. I had missed -- perfectly. By the following Friday, the stock was up over $7.50, closing at $7.625. If I had stayed in the game, filling at $6.75 and then, say, selling at $7.50, I'd have been up another $2,060.<p>
With the resolve of the ignorant, I put in an order the next Monday to buy 3,000 shares at seven dollars -- which would represent a drop of 8.2 percent from the Friday close. I figured the market had been so bloody that the stock couldn't drop much further. I was right, unfortunately. The Dow lost another 36 points and the Nasdaq another 16, but Visioneer closed back up at $7.50.<p>
Two days later, July 24, the price had dropped to $6.625. I called to see if my order had gone through. It hadn't -- which puzzled me until I realized that I had set an "all or none" order, which, ironically, had worked in my favor. Now the price was lower. This is luck, I told myself, the cheapest and stupidest luck. Make your last play and get out! I changed the order so that the 3,000 could be broken up into pieces. All 3,000 went through in blocks at $6.625. Visioneer closed at $6.50. It had been down here before. I set the sell at $7.25 and waited.<p>
But not long. On July 26, the sell went through, for a proffit of $1,495. After commissions, I was up $14,159.59, and, for now at least, out of the game. Six plays, all for a proffit. I felt like a man who had escaped from a burning building, scorched but exhilarated. Had I been reckless? Absolutely. But what a roll. Botta-boom, botta-bing.<p>

						There's no shortage of folks eager to help with your money. Here are 200 we trust.<p>
Who are the best financial advisers in the U.S.? Two years ago this month, we published our first list -- an elite group of 60 professionals who we believed merited our readers' trust. The list proved to be one of the most requested articles we have ever published.<p>
This year, we present a new register. Updated and greatly expanded, it includes the names of the 200 best financial advisers we could identify throughout the country. As in 1994, we strove to make certain that each person met our criteria for honesty and excellence. Our bottom-line question: Would we recommend this adviser to our parents?<p>
A group of handpicked industry professionals provided us an initial field of nominees. We then put candidates through an extensive review process, including background and credit checks. (More about our methodology later.)<p>
The men and women listed here are at the top of their profession. This doesn't mean, however, that we didn't overlook or exclude others perhaps equally good. With just 200 spots, competition was keen, and there had to be losers. (We did scratch nominees who aren't taking on new business, including some from our first list.)<p>
We should also note that some nominees objected to our intrusive questions and requests for documentation that went far beyond regulatory requirements. We made no exceptions and no apologies. This was the only way we could protect the interests of our readers. Still, we recommend you perform your own due diligence when hiring an adviser, whether or not the person is on our list. It goes without saying (but is worth repeating) that the price of hiring an incompetent or unscrupulous adviser can be quite high.<p>
Most of the advisers on our list are essentially self-employed, working at small, one-office firms that they own or co-own. A few work for major accounting firms, national securities brokerages, the trust departments of banks, or freestanding trust companies. Until recently, such large organizations were just about the only readily available sources of quality advice -- and then just for the very well-heeled. That's no longer true. Not only is there plenty of good help out there, but the vast majority of advisers we list have no minimum-net-worth requirement for clients. You don't need to be rich to give them a call (and you shouldn't hesitate if you are).<p>
Depending on who's counting, there are anywhere from 100,000 to 250,000 individuals who refer to themselves as financial advisers or financial planners. The best generally have solid credentials: college degrees, graduate degrees, professional certifications, evidence of continuing education in the field, published articles, and years of experience. Despite significant recent improvements in training and policing, however, the financial-planning business remains largely unregulated. Just about anyone can hang out a shingle. Remember those tabloid pictures not so long ago of England's duchess of York, Sarah Ferguson, having her toes sucked by her "financial adviser" from Texas?<p>
A planner who gives no specific investment advice need not register at all in most jurisdictions. On the federal level, earning the lofty-sounding title of "registered investment adviser'' requires little more than disclosing background, regulatory problems, practices, and compensation to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Many states administer exams for investment advisers, but these mostly cover knowledge of legal and regulatory issues, not financial smarts.<p>
We even discovered, to our surprise, that a number of advisers who had been recommended to us had paperwork discrepancies: differences between what the adviser reported to us and the records of a credentialing or governmental agency. Most of these problems were minor, such as failure to renew a routine registration, and were easily resolved. But we did drop a few candidates because of inconsistencies we uncovered -- and what we felt were unsatisfactory explanations. For instance, we found that four nominees who told us they had never been a defendant in a lawsuit or arbitration related to their business had indeed been sued for misrepresentation in the sale of investments and had ended up paying money in settlements.<p>
About 70 percent of those on our list are fee-only advisers, meaning that they do not take commissions for the sale of specific products. We generally prefer fee-only arrangements, but we do recognize that other forms of compensation can sometimes work well for adviser and client. (We detail compensation practices in "Fee to Choose.")<p>
The critical thing is that clients understand and feel comfortable with the way an adviser earns his or her living. In the fall of 1987, Money magazine published a 200-name list of the best financial planners. Fewer than 30 of those on the Money list made ours. How come? Most of the Money planners accepted commissions from financial-services companies; few were fee-only. At that time, commissioned planners were feasting on sales of tax-sheltered limited partnerships. But when the Tax Reform Act of 1986 wiped out many of the tax advantages of these partnerships, their investment value disintegrated. Investors sued advisers in droves, saying that their judgment had been skewed by the hefty commissions. The litigation forced a number of the Money advisers out of business.<p>
What can a financial adviser do? A good one should thoroughly review a client's financial situation and needs, then develop a disciplined strategy for reaching financial goals. Many advisers use specialized software to create customized balance sheets, budgets, and portfolio analyses for clients. The best ones also insist on regular meetings to assess progress.<p>
An increasing number of fee-only advisers now offer the additional service of portfolio management, but we didn't choose our top 200 advisers based on their performance in this area. In part, that's because the available data is highly subjective. But more to the point, we firmly discourage anyone from simply handing over complete management of his or her investments to someone else. Why? Partly because a reasonably intelligent person ought to be able, at the very least, to assemble a high-quality portfolio of mutual funds on his or her own -- one that should meet virtually all of his or her needs -- and at a low cost. And we think the most effective client-adviser relationship is that of an informed partnership. The best advisers prefer it this way, too.<p>
In choosing the professionals we wanted to list, we started by doing what anyone seeking financial advice would do: We asked around. Except we cast a bigger and broader net.<p>
We called more than 200 investment professionals across the country. Most were chapter presidents of various trade groups, including the Institute of Certified Financial Planners, the International Association of Financial Planners, and the Financial Analysts Society. We talked to the Personal Financial Specialist Division of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and the Licensed Independent Network of CPA Financial Planners. We also called the 59 advisers from our 1994 list still practicing (one had retired).<p>
Our query was simple: Do you know any advisers, other than yourself, who are so good you would send a parent to them? (A few of our nominators had actually done just that.) This process yielded 615 names, nearly 100 of which were offered by more than one person -- a good sign. We then sent all 615 of those recommended a letter asking for documents and samples of their work, along with a six-page questionnaire. The submissions that came back to us filled 22 storage boxes.<p>
Our questionnaire requested a lot of information. Besides personal and client references, we wanted data on education, job history, credentials, and any record of disciplinary problems. We asked about methods of compensation -- pinning down what percent of the adviser's income is derived from asset management and commissions and how this is disclosed to clients. We also asked for total income within broad ranges.<p>
To gauge the scope of an adviser's practice, we asked him or her to tell us the highest and lowest fees charged in 1995 and the highest and lowest net worth of a client. We also wanted to know how many plans the nominee had drafted in recent years and what percentage of clients had been with him or her at least three years.<p>
We asked for many documents, among them both parts of Form ADV, which almost all advisers or their firms file with the SEC. This form contains extensive disclosures on an adviser's practice, including compensation, regulatory problems, and any arrangements with vendors of financial products. For instance, an adviser who has an affiliation with a securities firm or insurance company would disclose it on this form.<p>
We asked to see samples of contracts with clients, looking for clarity. Most -- but not all -- advisers who manage money insist on an arbitration clause in which clients agree to bring any grievances to a private arbitration panel and sign away their right to sue. This usually limits damage awards. We also insisted on receiving a sample financial plan. Among other things, we wanted to know how easy it was to understand the goals, methodology, projections, and any charts or graphs contained in the plan.<p>
Finally, we got an original credit report on each nominee, looking for judgments, liens, or outrageously large credit-card balances inconsistent with prudent financial management.<p>
We contacted Better Business Bureaus and the advisers' local courthouses to see if they'd been defendants in any relevant litigation. Databases of local newspapers were searched. We contacted state securities regulators and credentialing agencies to verify that the advisers were properly registered.<p>
With a few exceptions, we knocked out those with less than ten years' experience and those for whom planning seemed to be a minor part of a larger practice. But generally, there were few hard-and-fast rules in our screening. The goal was to get as complete a picture of each candidate as possible.<p>
This included recognizing that experience is often the best teacher. Some of those on our list may have a blemish or two on their résumés -- an arbitration settlement, a pending complaint, or in two cases even a personal bankruptcy. The bankruptcies stemmed in part from the sale by the adviser of limited partnerships in the mid-1980s, followed by adverse litigation. In all cases, we inquired into the circumstances and came away convinced that the adviser was now wiser, had made real changes in the way he or she operates, and has since had an exemplary record. These problems, by the way, are disclosed in the Form ADV filings with the SEC.<p>
Here are a couple of pointers on using our chart. The advisers are listed by state, but many advisers routinely practice in neighboring states or in retirement havens like Florida and Arizona. Since financial advising is becoming a national business, it wouldn't hurt to call any adviser who catches your eye. The "Client net worth" column is intended to provide rough parameters of an adviser's practice. Some advisers will bend a stated minimum, especially if they think a client has long-term potential -- such as the owner of a small but growing business or a young client with a promising future.

						When is a rising market cause for concern? The answer may be in your portfolio's asset mix.<p>
By Susan Lee<p>
There are a couple of bad things about a stock market that keeps going up. The first is that investors begin to confuse the market's stellar performance with their own. Convinced that they possess hot hands, investors become sloppy, overconfident. They start ignoring the advice of schoolmarms like me. To be specific: They disdain the notion that they should keep their eggs in more than one basket.<p>
The second is that even people who believe in spreading risk over several types of markets often end up with radically unbalanced portfolios. As the market shoots up, the percentage of their asset value devoted to stocks rises along with it. So, too, does their exposure to stock-market risk.<p>
True portfolio diversification comes from holding assets in more than one basket, or, to use the current phrase of choice, asset allocation. The thing about this type of diversification, though, is that you have to keep working at it.<p>
This isn't easy. It requires a steely heart, so most people flop: Who doesn't want to cleave to the winners and punish the losers? <p>
Nevertheless, rebalancing your portfolio is what demonstrates that you have the discipline (more schoolmarmishness) to be a world-class investor. This, by the way, is not the same as something called tactical asset allocation, in which investors move money into one asset class or another depending on forecasts of market conditions -- trying, say, to take advantage of the prospect of lower interest rates by beefing up the bond portion of a portfolio. In my opinion, this is just market timing by another name, and it's a loser's game. <p>
The strategy I am talking about starts with the assumption that your investment strategy is tailored to meet your needs. And unless your needs change, your strategy should remain the same. You can't let changing market conditions dictate to you. <p>
The concept of asset allocation, of course, is far from new. The investment pooh-bah of all time, Benjamin Graham, for example, recommended a 50-50 rule for dividing holdings between the stock and bond markets. The theory is that when some markets are falling, other markets will be rising, and thus overall returns won't suffer quite so absolutely. <p>
Serious asset allocators, especially those who manage giant portfolios like pension plans, put money into a wide range of categories, including real estate (like commercial property and undeveloped land), foreign stock and bond markets, derivatives, venture and mezzanine capital, timber, oil and gas, gold, and art and antiques. But this takes huge bucks and huge amounts of time. <p>
Failing that, your approach needs to be driven by your temperament, needs, and situation. Consider:<p>
**How much risk do you want to be exposed to?**<p>
The majority of us are risk averse. We are willing to give up some potential return in order to avoid unpleasant surprises. <p>
Those who are terrifically averse to risk, for example, might concentrate on relatively safe categories and be happy to divide assets more evenly among riskless and risky categories (Benjamin Graham's advice); for them, U.S. Treasury bills or stock-market-index funds are attractive. For those who love risk, on the other hand, small-cap stocks and options, as well as distressed and long-term medium-grade bonds, make sense.	<p>
**How close do you want to be to your cash?**<p>
Some people have an urgent need for cash flow or like to be one fast step away from converting assets into cash. They should concentrate allocations in more-liquid categories like money-market funds and blue-chip stocks. Others, however, can afford to lock investment money away for a while; they can spread their allocations over a wider range, like real estate or arts and antiques. <p>
**How long is your time horizon?** <p>
Investors who are 30 to 40 years away from retirement can afford to be more aggressive about chasing returns, because they have more time to ride out depressed markets and make up for individual bombs. <p>
For those with long horizons, growth stocks and zero-coupon bonds might be desirable -- although the longer the time horizon, the more alert investors have to be to the danger that inflation will erode the value of their cash and debt holdings. Those with more immediate goals, however, have a much shorter time line and should stick with a smaller number of more-liquid categories. <p>
**How phobic are you about taxes?** <p>
Pretty much no one is fond of paying taxes, but for investors in high marginal brackets, avoidance is crucial. <p>
Tax avoiders ought to focus on a few tax-favored categories, while investors who are more neutral can broaden their reach. Committed tax averters, for instance, might cleave to triple-exempt muni bonds or index funds and shun the practice of short-selling stocks and buying stock mutual funds that have high turnover rates.<p>
Obviously, some of these considerations are overlapping and harmonious, and others can contradict one another and drive you to utter distraction. (You are a young pup, but you detest risk; you adore risk but need liquidity; and so on and so forth.)<p>
I can't tell you -- in the space of a magazine column anyway -- the best way to customize your portfolio. One thing I can tell you, however, is that the decisions you make in this regard will have a greater impact on the performance of your portfolio -- long term -- than anything you do in the way of individual stock selection or market timing. <p>
A 1987 study of big pension plans by Roger Ibbotson and Gary Brinson showed that decisions on asset classes accounted for 93.6 percent of the difference in total returns -- far more than the manager's choice of securities or market-timing maneuvers. Other studies have since confirmed that asset allocation is the single most important determinant of performance. <p>
After you have sweated over your allocation and, presumably, got it just right, then what? <p>
Well, first of all, you can relax -- knowing that the schoolmarms will be pleased. You are following the wisest course. You can't control what the markets will do, but you have done the most sensible thing.<p>
You can sleep at night and ignore what's happening day to day. In fact, you can sleep for a year. But then you need to wake up and look at your portfolio afresh.<p>
Presumably your needs haven't changed -- but your asset allocation most certainly will have. It's time to rebalance your portfolio.<p>
You may find, for instance, that a gangbusters stock market and a low-down bond market have thrown your division out of whack; in other words, your 55 percent stock position may now represent 70 percent of the total value of your portfolio, while your bond position has dwindled to only 20 percent. <p>
Should you sell off some stocks and buy some bonds in order to rebalance your portfolio? Your evil twin -- the greedy one -- will say no. But the answer is yes. <p>
Note: The only time you should consider varying your allocation is when you experience a change in personal circumstance -- for instance, you win at Lotto and are feeling lots more frisky and risky. <p>
There are, by the way, mutual funds that will allocate assets for you by varying the distribution of stocks, cash, and bonds within a single vehicle. Some of these are true strategic funds in the sense that the allocations rarely vary significantly, while others are just market timers in disguise, sending great chunks of their portfolios into one or another hot market. <p>
Ignore both types. You don't really need the former, and the latter will doubtless get you into hot water rather than hot returns. 
Smart asset allocation is not all that difficult. The true difficulty is hewing to it. (Okay, school's out.)<p>

						Yacht-management services help keep skippers afloat<p>
By James Gorant<p>
Once a month, Kurt Campbell packs up his flip-flops, flees Columbus, Ohio, where he runs a small hedge fund, and heads for Key West, Florida. There he heads out on a boat for five days and does nothing but fish and soak up the sun. Since charters cost up to $600 a day, such monthly outings could cause financial strain, but not for Campbell -- he owns the boat.<p>
Actually, Campbell owns two boats, which he has set up as a business so that he can charter them out when he's not using them. With Key West's year-round tourist traffic, some boats see action 52 weeks a year and not only pay for themselves but even turn a profit. "I'm always looking for a business opportunity," Campbell says, "and this looked like a good way to make some money and have fun."<p>
In almost all cases, success depends on treating a boat as a business, not a toy. "A lot of it is accounting and management," says Campbell. "I set all the budgets, take care of the insurance and proper licenses, and make sure to account for maintenance and improvements. A lot of these small owner-operators just don't do that."<p>
For those without Campbell's business savvy, help is available in the form of charter brokerage and management companies. These outfits generally offer three levels of service. The most limited, called clearinghouse, places your vessel in a series of listings available to yacht brokers internationally. Charter marketing includes all the clearinghouse functions plus the presentation and booking of the yacht. With yacht management, the most complete service, the company takes care of everything from business plans and budgets to distributing payroll and buying fuel.<p>
"Building any business takes a long time, and building a yacht business is pretty hard," says Nigel Henderson, president of Newport Yacht Services in Newport, Rhode Island. "But there's a lot of things I can do in a consulting format that can shorten the learning curve."<p>
Henderson estimates that a 65-footer costs $350,000 to $850,000 to buy and $180,000 a year to operate. Against that, the yacht earns about $5,000 a week and, in the relatively cool climes of Newport, will likely be booked up to 20 weeks a year. "If you're talking about bottom black-line profit, I don't think I've ever made it," Henderson says. "If you're talking about satisfaction that an owner has reached a point where he wants to use his boat and offset his costs, we've reached that point many times."<p>
It's the smaller, self-managed sector that fares best in the chartering world. Campbell bought his first yacht, the 43-foot Lethal Weapon, three years ago for $135,000, with 20 percent down and the rest financed over five years at 9.5 percent. He estimates his yearly expenses -- things such as equipment, docking fees, and insurance that includes a million-dollar liability policy -- at $60,000. At $600 a day, the boat needs to book 18 to 20 days a month to break even. So far he has surpassed that number enough to see a 20 to 25 percent annual return on his investment.<p>
As a fund manager, Campbell knows that's on par with some of the hottest mutual funds around. And when was the last time you escaped from an Ohio winter to sip piña coladas and chase sailfish on your mutual fund? <p>

						Down on downsizing<p>Peter Lynch and John Rothchild make a strong case for corporate layoffs and downsizing ("In Defense of the Invisible Hand," June). They even admit the pain and fear, at least in theory. But I think they miss the point of much of the criticism. Al Dunlap was CEO of Scott Paper for 20 months, during which time he fired 11,200
employees, arranged for the company to be taken over by Kimberly-Clark, and in the process made a personal gain of $100 million. A photograph in the Mobile (Alabama) Press Register showed 19 workers in the Mobile plant -- all fired by Dunlap__who had an average of 23 years each with the company and whose combined annual salaries equaled just five days' compensation for Dunlap. And he is proud of what he's done at this company! If the financial bottom line is the only responsibility of boards of directors and managers of corporations in our capitalist system, with no regard for the welfare of the workers, then the system is doomed to destruction.
George M. Murray
Fairhope, Alabama<p>"In Defense of the Invisible Hand" is described on your cover as the upside of downsizing, but its supporting evidence leads to the opposite conclusion. The table on page 90 purports to show that 25 large companies have demonstrated the link between leanness and the ability to compete by shedding 363,000 jobs since 1985.This, however, is a net figure made up of 589,000 jobs eliminated by 11 companies and 226,000 jobs created at the other 14 companies. If we compare the performance of the downsizers with the performance of the upsizers, the upsizers did better in the decade ended April 1996. If we look at the decade ended 1985, the recent upsizers also outperformed the downsizers. This suggests that the critical influence is less the invisible hand of market forces than the visible hand of corporate management and planning.

Flat Fixation<p>Hats off to Elizabeth Macdonald for her insightful and straightforward article on the flat tax ("Let's Fix the Flat Tax," June). Granted, there are some problems with a flat tax, but the intelligent handling of those problems would certainly give us a tax system far superior to the jungle we have now. Until then, perhaps we should change the name of the House Ways and Means Committee to the House Give and Take Committee. 
G. P. Karle Jr.
Miami, Florida<p>"Let's Fix the Flat Tax" manages to advance the debate not at all. For instance, that enormous 1.7 billion hours we spend doing taxes each year: Doesn't Macdonald have a clue as to the size of the economy? Think of how much more productive I'd feel if I could spend my share, about two minutes a day, finishing that cure for cancer I've been meaning to get to! Then there's the matter of asking Jack Kemp for his definition of a "fair" tax. Jack Kemp is a politician (whom I respect), not an ethicist. Perhaps next we should ask Fidel Castro for the definition of a fair return on equity. Let's cut to the ethical principle on this one: The last dollar of a family that earns__and spends__$1 million a year pays for niceties like a trip around the world, not necessities. The last dollar of $100,000 a year pays for important, but not vital, expenses like college tuition or car payments. And the last dollar (and every dollar) of $10,000 a year pays for vital expenses, like food. Fair tax rates reflect this. 
Joel Macauslan
Nashua, New Hampshire<p>
Too Speculative<p>Ted C. Fishman writes in "Speculating 101" ("Review," June), "Selling call options against stock, for example, is portrayed as a low-risk hedging strategy, when in fact it's the practical equivalent of selling puts outright__the riskiest strategy of all." I must be nuts. A put is a mirror image of a call. How can selling calls be the same as selling puts?
Donald P. Cohen
Boynton Beach, Florida<p>Ted C. Fishman replies: a number of readers have raised this question. Strange as it may sound, my statement is a well-established truth, although it usually takes even professional options traders several months to see the relationship between puts and calls. Indeed, this arbitrage relationship is the cornerstone of professional option trading. Retail customers love the covered-call strategy, and professionals routinely accommodate them by buying calls at (relatively) inflated prices, then hedging their risk by buying puts and selling stock. For those interested in how combinations of stocks and options align into equivalent positions, I recommend the book Options as a Strategic Investment, by Lawrence G. McMillan, published by Prentice Hall. <p>
Follow-up<p>Darrell Zimmerman, the former bond-futures trader whose misadventures were detailed in the December/January 1994 issue, has lost his legal battle to remain in Canada, where he fled after a grand jury indicted him for masterminding a 1992 scheme to create a downturn in Treasury-bond prices that ended up costing his clearing firm more than $7 million. According to the Chicago Sun-Times, Zimmerman has reached a nonbinding plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney's Office that would cap his potential eight-year sentence at four years if he surrenders quickly and pleads guilty to all six counts of wire fraud that he faces. Zimmerman's trading partner, Anthony Catalfo, was convicted of all six counts against him and received a 42-month sentence in June 1994.<p><p><p><p>

It's about time: Finally, investors have a good reason for signing on to the Internet<p>By Jim Jubak<p>Until recently it has been no contest. An investor armed with two old-fashioned print guides -- The Value Line Investment Survey for stocks and Morningstar Mutual Funds -- had far better information at his fingertips than anything one could find on the Internet. The Internet's World Wide Web was often hard to navigate and painfully slow. But that wasn't the worst of it. Once an investor found a page and waited for it to download, the information was dated, shallow, or a disguised ad -- sometimes all three.<p>But recently, several new Web pages have closed the gap. Now investors are rewarded with current quotes, breaking news, and alerts of changes in earnings estimates for stocks in their personal portfolios -- all for at most $20 a month. It's too soon to cancel subscriptions to paper guides, but an investor who uses the Internet will have a significant edge over one armed only with paper.<p>Quote.com (www.quote.com) is a good example of the Web's new prowess. For $9.95 a month, the cost of a basic subscription, an investor can set up two portfolios, each tracking up to 100 securities. While portfolio trackers abound on the Net, this one packs more punch. At the end of each day, Quote.com delivers a portfolio updated with prices and volume to an 
investor's E-mail address. (Updates are available during the day, too.) Users can customize the format to show a table listing such fundamentals as trailing earnings per share, price-to-earnings ratio, and the 52-week price range.<p>Quote.com also links news from Reuters, MarketScope, BusinessWire, PR Newswire, S&P News, and Newsbytes to the portfolio. Investors who don't subscribe to these services get headlines on each portfolio stock and the overall market with each end-of-day update. (Full stories can be ordered  la carte for a dollar.) Signing up for a news service (an extra $9.95 a month for Reuters, for example) puts breaking news in investors' E-mail. An advanced subscription ($19.95 monthly) adds news on insider trading in portfolio stocks from Vickers Insider Trade Reports and on earnings estimates from Zacks Investment Research.<p>Investors who want to follow revisions in earnings estimates more closely can go straight to Zacks Analyst Watch on the Internet (www.zacks.com; $150 a year or $29 a month). Like Quote.com, Analyst Watch works from an investor's portfolio. The user enters a list of stocks he wants to follow, and Analyst Watch delivers an end-of-day report on each security by E-mail. It offers more than the price and volume data of Quote.com. Analyst Watch lists the Zacks rank for each portfolio stock as well as individual revisions in earnings estimates made in the past week, changes in brokerage recommendations, earnings surprises, and dates of upcoming earnings reports.<p>Analyst Watch combines this data into a report on each company, which graphs all analyst recommendations, lists recent earnings and current earnings estimates (mean, high, and low), details the company's history of earnings surprises, and compares its forecasted and actual earnings to those of its industry as well as to the total earnings of the S&P 500 Stock Index. Finally, investors can screen Zacks's database on 81 items, such as recent price changes and rankings. Sadly, it's hard to combine such criteria into more complex screens.<p>Both Quote.com and Analyst Watch are light on fundamental data -- but either MarketEdge from Thomson Financial Services (www.marketedge. com) or Market Guide (marketguide. com) will take up the slack.<p>For $7.95 a month, MarketEdge offers unlimited quotes on stocks and mutual funds with 15-minute delays, 25 company reports, 25 mutual-fund reports, 50 historic-price charts, 5 detailed industry reports, company and mutual-fund screening, real-time market-news updates, stock and fund alerts, and fund reviews. In July, MarketEdge introduced MarketEdge Tracker, which tracks portfolio value and provides high and low prices, volumes, and earnings announcements and forecasts. <p>The company report alone is worth the price of admission. In three pages, it sums up a firm's most recent full-year and quarterly income statements and balance sheets, lists performance ratios such as return on sales and three-year earnings-per-share growth, and recaps the earnings estimates and insider-trading data from Vickers and Zacks, albeit in less detail than Analyst Watch.<p>Market Guide isn't as far along in developing its Web page or lowering prices to match its rivals. Most of its information is priced  la carte and isn't cheap. But Market Guide lets investors choose how much to buy. A snapshot report is free. A more detailed company profile, adding quarterly and annual income as well as balance-sheet and cash-flow data, costs $2.50 (for $9.95 a month you get unlimited reports). The most detailed profile, the only one on-line that shows data exactly as reported by the company, costs five dollars. (StockQuest, which will screen 8,200 stocks on over 70 variables, is due soon.)<p>Buy-just-what-you-want pricing is carried to its logical conclusion by INVESTools (www.investools.com). It provides impressive features -- such as mutual-fund reports from Morningstar and evaluations of newsletters by Mark Hulbert, editor of The Hulbert Financial Digest -- but the most interesting and, indeed, revolutionary feature is a search engine that lets investors type in a ticker or stock name and generate a list of research reports, newsletter articles, educational materials, and news stories. A simple click delivers it to the investor.<p>For example, a search on ERTS, the symbol for software maker <a name="NASD:ERTS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14059"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Electronic Arts</b></a>, yields reports from Morningstar and Zacks and six stories from Reuters in headline form. For 25 cents, an investor can download a Reuters story about Cowen & Co.'s revision of its earnings estimate for Electronic Arts. INVESTools' library of 21 newsletters works the same way: If a search turns up an article on a stock of interest, investors can buy just that piece.  INVESTools gives a five-dollar credit to those who sign on, so investors can try it out for free. Items are clearly priced, and confirmation is requested, so an accidental purchase is unlikely.<p>INVESTools is a new model for delivering information, one made possible by the Net's structure. Buy just what you need when you want it -- for a reasonable price. And those prices are falling. Intuit, the software company behind Quicken, launched Quicken Financial Network in June. QFN (www.qfn.com) isn't very useful yet, but it does offer a glimpse of the future. QFN lets investors set up and track portfolios and download quotes for free -- advertisers and financial-services providers pay the freight. Such price competition should spur information providers to lower prices and add services, augmenting the armory of information-hungry investors.<p><p><p>

						By Jonathan Butler<p>The tried-and-true discipline called dollar-cost averaging works because it is so simple: Anyone who puts a fixed dollar amount into stocks or mutual funds at regular intervals will buy more shares when the price per share is lower and buy fewer when the price per share is higher, leading to a lower overall cost per share. But recent studies show that it pays to add just a little complexity. Making those regular purchases at the right time of the month can make dollar-cost averaging work even better.<p>According to Yale Hirsch, editor of The Stock Trader's Almanac, over the past six decades stocks have done 2.5 times better in the first half of the month than in the second half. A 1996 study by Chris Hensel, client executive at the Frank Russell Company, and William Ziemba, a professor at the University of British Columbia, found an even bigger difference, with average returns of 0.07 percent in the first half of the month and negative 0.02 percent in the second half.<p>According to Hensel and Ziemba, the biggest returns come between the last trading day of one month and the fourth trading day of the following month. Daily returns then average 0.12 percent versus 0.02 percent daily for the entire month.<p>Take advantage of this "turn of the month" effect, Hensel says, by investing on the third- or second-to-last day of the month. For example, a dollar-cost averager would time his check to arrive by September 27. His dollars would then be invested when shares are relatively cheap and before prices climb. "The turn of the month is when the lion's share of the gains has happened over time," says Hensel, "so it makes sense for investors to try to be invested by then."<p><p><p>

Warburg Pincus has a strategy that should work even if the IPO bubble pops<p>By Tom Saler<p>Wonder why funds such as <a name="FUND:DGVAX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DGVAX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dreyfus Aggressive Growth</b></a>, up 68 percent for the first five months of 1996, <a name="FUND:VWEGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/VWEGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Van Wagoner Emerging Growth</b></a>, up 57 percent, and Oberweis Micro-Cap, up 49 percent, have soared so far above the overall market, which gained just 9 percent? Give the credit to IPO fever. In those first five months, the average initial public offering gained 20.9 percent on its first trading day. Six IPOs actually doubled in price. Many new small-cap funds have loaded up on IPOs to supercharge their returns.<p>Over the long term, most funds that bet their portfolios on IPOs fall as fast as they climb. History shows that the new-issues market can go from red-hot to stone-cold almost overnight. In fact, a cool breeze blew through the market in June. The average first-day gain on an IPO dropped from 25 percent in April and May to 12.4 percent in June -- just slightly above the historical average of 10.4 percent since 1980. Newly public stocks tumbled -- <a name="NASD:LCOS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=48044"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lycos</b></a> and <a name="NASD:XCIT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=47307"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Excite</b></a>, for example, fell 28 percent and 48 percent, respectively. It's no wonder that redemptions from emerging-growth funds totaled $113 million in the week ended June 19, according to AMG Data Services -- the first outflows since last October.<p>But are all the new funds specializing in the risky but potentially rewarding stocks of extremely young growth companies destined to disappoint investors over the long term? One, <a name="FUND:CUEGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CUEGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus Post-Venture Capital</b></a>, could be different. The track record of its parent firm, the experience of its managers, and a unique vantage point for finding the best new companies could give the fund a long-term advantage.<p>Warburg Pincus Post-Venture Capital's short-term returns make it clear this isn't a fund for the faint of heart. Started last September 29, it rode the IPO bubble to a 79 percent return in its first eight months, beating the average aggressive-growth fund by a staggering 59 percentage points. However, the fund didn't escape the June correction -- it was down 6.3 percent for the month.<p>But the reason to consider the Post-Venture Capital Fund doesn't lie in the short-term numbers; it's in the long-term record of the fund's managers and its parent company. Co-manager Elizabeth Dater, 51, came to Warburg Pincus as an institutional portfolio manager in 1978 after a stint as vice president of research at Fiduciary Trust. She is now one of five senior managing directors at New York based Warburg Pincus. Using her expertise in researching small growth firms for institutional clients, she began the company's first equity mutual fund, the $1.3 billion <a name="FUND:WPVCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/WPVCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Warburg Pincus Emerging Growth</b></a>, 
in 1988. That fund has earned an average annual return of 18.57 percent from its inception through June 30, 1996, versus 14.84 percent for the Russell 2000 small-cap index.<p>Co-manager Stephen J. Lurito, 33, joined Dater on the emerging growth fund in 1988 as a research analyst, after two years at money-management firm Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. He now co-manages that fund as well as Post-Venture Capital. "She's like the CEO, and I'm like the chief operating officer," says Lurito. While Dater sets the market and business strategies of the fund, Lurito focuses on the day-to-day research activities of the fund's three other analysts.<p>Since 1989, the team has worn another hat as well -- one of a fashion well suited to its new venture. Although Warburg Pincus is a relative latecomer to the mutual-fund business, the company has a solid reputation as an institutional money manager dating back to the early 1970s. Its venture-capital arm, Warburg Pincus Ventures, has been financing start-ups since 1971. For sister company Warburg Pincus Counsellors, Dater and Lurito, since 1989, have been advising pension funds, endowments, and high-net-worth individuals about what to do with shares in young companies received as a result of venture-capital investments. In the process of managing $1 billion in distributions from 400 venture-capital pools, the team has examined thousands of post-venture companies. "As a result of the research that we did on behalf of clients, we've developed an inventory of what we believe will be the great growth companies of the future," says Dater. (The fund can't buy stock in companies in which Warburg Pincus Ventures has an interest.) "Over the long run, we expect that venture-backed companies would have better-than-average returns than non-venture-backed companies."<p>A comment like that is what any skeptical investor would expect from the manager of this fund, but history seems to support Dater's conclusion. Companies backed by venture capital do perform better after going public than their non-venture-backed cousins. According to Securities Data Corp., a financial-information company, venture-backed IPOs issued from the start of January 1986 through the end of June 1996 returned an average of 126 percent, compared with just 39.2 percent for non-venture-backed IPOs. And venture-backed IPOs beat other new issues by 29.9 percent to 10.4 percent in the year subsequent to going public. <p>What gives venture-backed companies the advantage? First, venture capitalists buy equity in the start-ups they fund, resulting in less debt on corporate balance sheets. Second, in general, venture capitalists don't cut corners on funding critical research and development. Third, "when venture capitalists decide to commit capital, they will also typically act in an advisory capacity," says Dater.<p>Finally, the nature of the venture-capital industry acts as a form of quality control. With thousands of start-ups vying for limited funds -- in a typical year, the typical venture-capital partnership invests only $2 billion to $4 billion in all their deals -- companies that ultimately receive backing have already survived an arduous screening process.<p>And venture capitalists aren't short-term investors -- they usually stick around even after the company goes public. Securities and Exchange Commission rules prevent venture capitalists from selling shares in their companies to the public for two years after they invest, and agreements with underwriters keep them from selling for four to six months after the IPO. One important result: Venture capitalists often insist their companies follow conservative accounting practices. "Long before thinking about going public, venture-backed companies are already doing financial accounting and strategic business planning as if they were public," says Robin Bellas, a general partner in Morgenthaler Ventures. "We do that so we can measure the progress they're making against the strategic plan."<p>Dater and Lurito admit they aren't always long-term players in their own fund. Part of Post-Venture Capital's stellar performance ("probably a couple of percentage points," says Lurito) is from flipping hot IPOs. Flipping -- or buying stocks at the IPO price and selling them a day or two later -- can add to short-term returns. But it's not what Dater and Lurito are after. "We have flipped to a degree if we can't get a significant position in a company," says Lurito, "but by and large, we are looking to hold."<p>To pick stocks for their portfolio, Dater and Lurito combine venture-capital experience with solid growth discipline. To make it past the first cut, a company must show backing not just from any venture-capital firm but from the "ablest VCs" -- those that have the best track records of building successful companies. Then the team looks for earnings growth of at least 25 percent -- they sell at the first signs of slowing growth. The two managers expect to hold the average company for about a year. But since there's no market-cap restriction on stocks in the fund, Dater and Lurito can hold them as long as the story doesn't change.<p>To figure out if a stock is reasonably priced, they estimate a company's earnings growth rate over the next three years. Take the stock of McAfee Associates, a maker of software to detect viruses and manage personal-computer networks. "We've estimated growth rates for networks and PCs around the world and looked at how penetrated that market is," says Lurito. "We think the earnings growth rate at McAfee is 35 percent a year for the next three years. The company is only trading at 27 times our future earnings estimate. So for us, that's an attractive proposition." <p>As June demonstrated, a market downturn would hurt the high-flying fund. But Dater and Lurito believe that, over time, owning companies that grow faster than the economy will reward investors. Those with a long-term horizon can even turn the highly volatile market to their advantage: Warburg Pincus Post-Venture Capital is just about perfect for dollar-cost averaging.<p><p><p><p>

Out of the way, cynics and doubters -- new mutual-fund genius coming through.<p>By Erik Hedegaard<p>Recently, I've been feeling a little out of sorts. The problem is that I could really use a good money-making idea. An idea that I would treasure. I'd treat that idea like a king, give it the best seat in my house, because I know it would treat me the same way. It would vanquish my debts and build me a future filled with Orvis-edition Jeeps, Mephisto walking shoes, and strolls by cobbled Vermont 
streams. But an idea like that I never have. Out of sorts? In truth, I've been bitterly depressed.<p>So I was open to almost anything last spring when I stumbled across a software program called Investors FastTrack. I had entered the Mutual Funds topic area of the Prodigy on-line service, and there before me was screen after screen of messages, literally hundreds of them, extolling the virtues of this software. Investors FastTrack analyzes mutual funds and suggests which funds to buy and when to buy them. It had apparently made the note posters lots of money. They couldn't say enough about it -- though they were certainly trying, much to the mounting irritation of those who had yet to get with the program.<p>"You F/T brain dead cultists have ruined this topic for everyone but you," an anti-FastTracker wrote. "Are the inmates running the asylum? Is this a world gone mad?" Railed another: "I too am sick of seeing FastTrack everywhere. Enough FastTrack!!!" <p>I scrolled on, looking for responses. I found dozens. "You are attacking people and ideas that I doubt you would have the courage to do face to face," piped up one FastTracker. "Some people would be so offended as to give you a face full of fist -- I certainly would have in my younger, more hot-headed days."<p>Back and forth the angry notes flew. Finally, Prodigy ended the war by giving the FastTrackers their own home, in a newly created area called Mutual Fund Tools. It was a sensible idea, and the FastTrackers made the move -- though not without considerable sadness. Wrote a FastTracker named Phyllis Edmundson, "This is a good-bye to a bulletin board that has taught me so much. I have tears in my eyes thinking this will be the last time I post here."<p>The day I read Phyllis Edmundson's note (as well as hundreds of others about FastTrack and the Great FastTrack Fracas of 1996) I rocked back in my living-room chair. This was astonishing. This was fascinating. So much emotion and heat, all connected to a mutual-fund software product. How does that happen? I felt the urge to know much more about FastTrack and the people devoted to it. It occurred to me that maybe, at long last, I'd stumbled upon the thing that could make me the rich man I'd always thought I should be.<p>The day FastTrack arrived in my mailbox, I wasted no time booting up my computer. The Dow was making new highs, and I was sitting on a small wad of cash. I had no clue where to put that money -- but the FastTrack literature suggested I'd have a highly profitable idea forthwith. "Discover the incredible world of mutual fund trading," it read. "Two to four trades per year with no commissions can double or even triple your annual returns while reducing risk." Who wouldn't like the sound of that? I licked my dry, trembling lips.<p>As it turns out, FastTrack is both an analysis program and a database. For $39 initially and $24 a month thereafter, you can use this software to keep up to date by downloading daily quotes (via a toll-free number) for more than 1,300 mutual funds and stock-market indexes. Following the manual's instructions, I completed my first download, then brought up the main analysis screen.<p>It took me a few minutes to figure out the keystrokes, but soon enough a glowing chart appeared. The chart plotted the daily price movements of a mutual fund called <a name="FUND:FSVLX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FSVLX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Select Home Finance</b></a>. Against a black background, its red price line squiggled up, rising 430 percent over seven and a half years. It was breathtakingly beautiful. Briefly, I wished I'd plunged into that fund long ago -- though there was the matter of a 12-month period beginning in late 1989 when it tanked by nearly 50 percent. I could just imagine myself at some point during that slide, hand locked on the phone, barking out my angry sell order to some hapless functionary as I once again followed the time-tested investment loser's strategy of buy high, sell low. That night, I'd have been weeping in my stew.<p>After a while I began to understand what FastTrack is designed to do. Its main purpose is to offer an alternative to that hideous ride down to the bailing point. Instead, early on, you're supposed to switch out of the falling fund and into one that's still rising. To generate the switch signals, the program relies on an indicator called AccuTrack, which measures the performance of one fund relative to another. (It has many other indicators as well, which can be used instead of AccuTrack or simply to calm an investor's nerves and lend credence to the AccuTrack signals.) One problem: Since AccuTrack can work with only two funds at a time, how do you know which two to pair for optimal switching? Basically, what you're looking for are funds that, for solid, fundamental reasons, don't normally move in the same direction at the same time. The manual offers some suggestions -- pairing small-cap funds with large-cap funds, for example -- and the people on Prodigy toss around lots more.<p>Another problem: what to do when both funds are trending down. The solution is to work with more than one pairing strategy. If you're tracking four pairs of funds, you have eight funds in all, and as long as the market isn't taking a real nosedive, odds are good that one or more of those funds will be in a solid uptrend. And if none are, then it may be best to move into the safe haven of a money-market fund until conditions improve. Some people consider this market timing; FastTrackers consider it sensible rotation. In fact, the FastTrack manual advises against trying to time the market, since numerous academic studies have shown that it doesn't work. That said, almost all FastTrackers believe in market timing, and they have come up with a good dozen market-timing signals that they hope will get them out of the market when the bear finally starts clawing away at Wall Street.<p>For my initial FastTrack exploration, I used a fund combination offered up by one Joe Meek on Prodigy. It pits Home Finance against Fidelity Select Food & Agriculture, a steady performer with a 303 percent return over that same seven and a half years.<p>After punching some keys, I watched the screen redraw itself. Up came three charts: One graphed the individual performances of the two funds, one graphed AccuTrack's switch signals, and the last graphed the results of following the switches. I squinted at this final chart. The line showed a total return of 1,013 percent. That's 37.9 percent compounded annually -- results vastly superior to either fund bought and held. Grabbing a calculator, I worked out the math: A measly $10,000 invested in early 1988 would now be worth more than $111,000. Further, the maximum drop along the way was only 17 percent. Maybe I could live with that, maybe not. But the possibilities began to make me itch.<p>For the next few weeks, my wife and daughter were without husband and father. I spent all my time glued to the computer, trying out pairings both risky and not, using all kinds of funds: international, growth, income, bond, sector. Basically, what I learned is this: If only I'd found FastTrack years ago, what a proud assortment of fly rods I'd own today -- and, quite possibly, a hugely funded retirement account to secure my fast approaching addlepated years.<p>"For God's sake," my wife said one night, "aren't you ever coming to bed?"<p>I didn't even look up from the screen.<p>I also spent an inordinate number of hours on Prodigy, reading what the FastTrack masters had to say. At the moment, they were discussing matters far beyond my reach. Mostly, they talked about software products developed by FastTrackers to piggyback on top of FastTrack and use its database to create and analyze even more sophisticated and (theoretically) profitable strategies. The hottest, slickest add-on of them all is something called FastRUBE, a strategy-development and -testing program that can rank an entire group of funds and then suggest trades based on any number of the best performers.<p>I read about FastRUBE with deep, greedy interest. I wanted it for my very own.<p>But over time I became equally interested in the people who populate the FastTrack world. Compared with Quicken, which has 9 million followers, the FastTrack fan base is small, with only 8,000 subscribers. In fact, few people in the investment mainstream know FastTrack exists.<p>Even so, I thought surely the exception would be Don Phillips, the mutual-fund know-it-all president of Morningstar. I dialed his number.<p>Well, no, he'd never actually seen it, he said, though maybe he had heard of it, but only maybe.<p>Yet what the FastTrack community lacks in size, it makes up for in general bonhomie (toward fellow FastTrackers, at least) and a willingness to share. If someone concocts a promising pairing or FastRUBE strategy, it's not long before it appears either in FastTrack Monitor, the independently published quarterly newsletter for FastTrack users, or on Prodigy. Then there's the example set by Brian Stocks, one of the reigning FastTrack gurus on Prodigy and the author of FastTools, a much-loved FastTrack utility program that was built largely from ideas and concepts bandied about on the bulletin board. He gives it away to anyone who asks. His generosity is impressive, and in gratitude FastTrackers have sent him numerous anonymous gifts -- a case of Italian salad dressing, a bottle of 30-year-old port, flowers for his wife. <p>Around this time, I also learned that FastTrack Monitor was putting together the first annual FastTrack convention, down in Saint Petersburg, Florida. I knew I had to go. Like many others before me, I was FastTrack obsessed.<p>Anyway, home life wasn't what it once was. Even if I wanted to speak to wife and daughter, wife and daughter were no longer speaking to me.<p>
To unseasonably chilly Saint Pete they came, from all over: East Liverpool, Ohio; Incline Village, Nevada; and Manitowoc, Wisconsin. From Georgia, California, Arizona, and Alaska. There were lots of retirees in Sansabelt slacks, many doctors and engineers, a few women, a goodly number of money managers, one or two actual rocket scientists, a former Today-show weatherman -- more than 200 FastTrackers in all.<p>They arrived with laptop computers in their hands and one thing in common: a desire to make money using FastTrack and all strategies and programs associated with it.<p>And make money some of them had. "I've been making over 35 percent a year since I found FastTrack in October of '92," said Dr. Joe Meek, a retired orthopedic surgeon from Fayetteville, North Carolina, and a Prodigy leader. "It's made my retirement possible."<p>"In one portfolio last year I made 70 percent," added a glowing old fellow who kept his name to himself.<p>"I'm settling for a 25 percent return a year," said Jim Cleveland, from Albany, California, and a dead ringer for oddball actor Christopher Walken.<p>Then, snorting loudly, somebody shouted, "It's gotten to the point where I have a 16 percent gain -- and I'm afraid to post a note about it!"<p>This comment led to much hooting and laughter."It embarrassed you!" called out Rod Romero, a garrulous white-haired engineer from Denver and another Prodigy bigwig. "Like, 'I'm such a poor shlub -- I only got 16 percent!'"<p>On and on the happy testimonials went. In a sense it was wild, nutty talk. The long-term average annual return from stocks is only about 10 percent, and these people were claiming to have made a mockery of that. But I loved what I heard. Everything I'd been dreaming of since finding FastTrack, they were living. And they apparently had the swollen bank accounts to prove it. I saw not a sad, financially pinched face among them, except for my own. I was altogether envious. <p>The conversation then turned to Paul Charbonnet, the founder of Investors FastTrack, the man who made all this possible. The FastTrackers praised him for intentionally writing his software with an open architecture that allows other software writers to muckle onto his database. Without that, there'd be no add-ons like FastTools or FastRUBE or FastWays, a program designed to zero in on the best parameters for AccuTrack and other indicators. They also praised Paul for his data.<p>Misty-eyed, they spoke of his data. Apparently, most mutual-fund databases contain lots of small but meaningful errors. Not FastTrack's database. "Oh, it's got the cleanest data you've ever seen," whispered Jim Cleveland. "Oh my but it's clean!"<p>There was a moment of silence. <p>A few people drifted away, thoughts of marvelous error-free mutual-fund data dancing in their heads. Life was good.<p>A moment later, though, an elderly gent began pulling on his whiskers. He had a drawn face and wore a grim expression. Clearly, something was on his mind.<p>"Listen," he said. "Does anyone know if Paul has a successor in line? I mean, what if something should happen to him? Has he planned for that?" He shook his head. "Without FastTrack," he said, "I'd be lost."<p>A few people nodded. They knew how he felt.<p>A marketing executive by training, Paul Charbonnet is 48 years old, tall, thin of hair, a bit weighty, blessed with a round, happy face. At the FastTrack conference, strolling around in a tan safari-type jacket, shaking hands with his many well-wishers, he appeared quite vigorous. While his weight was a definite question mark, overall he didn't seem like he was going to kick off any time soon. I breathed a big sigh of relief.<p>It was, in fact, the search for ultra-clean mutual-fund data that led Paul to develop FastTrack in 1990. The data sources he was using at the time weren't up to snuff: The quotes arrived late, or the figures were inaccurate, or the dividends hadn't been accounted for properly. It was always something -- and when there's money on the line, that just won't do. He thought he could do the job better -- so he did, adding on a graphics screen for a little something extra, then a few indicators, then writing up his AccuTrack pairing strategies to show people what could be done with the tools in front of them.<p>Paul has never advertised heavily, and last year he used almost no paid advertising at all. Thus, his sales in 1995 -- $3.2 million -- came by word of mouth, from people spreading the news. That seems to be good enough for him, as well it might, since the word spreaders are generally so deep into FastTrack that it's hard to see what else they have to talk about. For many of them, it's entirely consuming. <p>"In the last two years, I've spent 4,000 hours developing my investment strategy," said Jim Cleveland, looking more Christopher Walkenlike by the minute. "Just the aesthetics of it, the ability to use your intellect and to see that work, is a narcotic." He grinned woozily.<p>"I had a cat I really loved that died last summer," said Rod Romero. "I was sad to lose him, but I was kind of glad he died because he'd be bothering me. It's like he was saying, 'I want to eat, goddamn it, I'm so hungry -- how come you're doing all this FastTrack shit!'"<p>"What I've heard it called is middle-aged birth control," said a middle-aged gentleman, who scooted away before I could get his name.<p>Everyone laughed heartily at this. I started laughing, too, knowing the truth of what the man had said. We were all pretty much alike. We had FastTrack on the brain. It stirred something in us, some fundamental ancient yearning that in times of unease could overpower even the instinct to procreate and extend the family line. And these are uneasy times: The doctors here were freaked out about medical reform, the retirees about the size of their Social Security checks, the downsized about any future whatsoever -- and me, I was freaked out about coming college costs, not to mention ownership of a single pathetic fly rod. FastTrack promised a way around these troubles. It was an out. And as it seemed to me, so it seemed to lots of people here. By God, we were going to use it to the best of our abilities and, without doubt or the loss of much sleep, become filthy, stinking rich in the process.<p>With a large clump of other FastTrackers, I marched into a room to hear what some of the convention speakers had to say about making 
our dreams come true.<p>Over three days, we heard strategies until strategies were coming out our ears. We heard talk of market-timing signals and their use in limiting risk during down markets, yahoo academic naysayers be damned. We listened in rapture to Richard Ottaviani, who used FastTrack to trade mutual funds so fast and furiously that he'd been banned by the Jack White brokerage house (elsewhere, he was still raking in the profits). We also saw a demonstration of a new FastTrack add-on called FastBreak, from the brothers Ken and Nelson Huck; it was so nifty a fund-ranking and strategy-making tool that the fellow sitting next to me gasped, "That's exciting as hell. My pants are wet just thinking about it!"<p>And then, on a Friday, with a meeting in full swing, with our heads full of money-making possibilities that seemed to border on money-making certitudes, one of the speakers made an announcement.<p>The Dow was dropping like a stone, he said. So far it had fallen 170 points.<p>His words bounced off the walls and echoed around. No one spoke for a moment. Finally, one brave soul hollered, "Does anyone know CPR?" Another person yelled, "Better sell your telemutilation funds -- errr, I mean, your telecommunication funds!"<p>A few people chortled. But for some FastTrackers it wasn't all that funny. Looking around, I saw plenty of ashen faces and lots of people using cellular phones to call their brokers; their strained conversations made a dull grinding sound. As I sat there, the mood of the crowd began to change. Where before it was charged with glee, now it was growing darker, tenser. It was suddenly hot in the room. I thought I heard a pencil snap.<p>I shuffled outside for some fresh air. Although I was a FastTrack novice with no money yet at risk, what if it had been otherwise? Would I now be fumbling for coins at the pay phones? Why hadn't the market-timing signals gotten these good folks out of harm's way? And weren't FastTrack's pairings supposed to have you in a fund that wouldn't lead to sell fever the instant the market had a hiccup?<p>Later on, I saw one anxious fellow belly up to Roy Ashworth, the author of FastRUBE, to talk about his personal situation.<p>From tiny Goodlettsville, Tennessee, Roy and his FastRUBE presentation had been a big hit at the convention. More than one of his Prodigy on-line acquaintances told me they'd expected him to be some kind of white Southern redneck. Instead, he was a tall, eloquent black man. This delighted them no end, as it proved (sort of) that FastTrack was an equal-opportunity program, welcoming all races, creeds, and colors. The other thing that made Roy such a hit was that he's genuinely wise.<p>Right now, the fellow before him seemed in dire need of some of that Roy wisdom. His portfolio had apparently taken a good hit. He was saying to Roy, "I can't handle the drawdowns!"<p>Roy said, "Then you do what it takes to make yourself comfortable."<p>That wasn't good enough. "What do I do!" the man nearly shouted. "Say it's Monday morning. I've got $10,000. I put it in. It went down 3 percent. What do I do!"<p>"Well, what happened to using your brain?" Roy asked as gently as he could. "I don't care if it's ranked number one. If it's in a downtrend, why do you want to buy it?"<p>Rooted to his spot, the man blinked several times.<p>"People are still searching for that Holy Grail, and I'm sorry, it's not out there," Roy went on. "You'll figure that out in a hurry. The Holy Grail isn't out there." He paused, then added, "It's just that simple."<p>The fellow looked stunned by the news.<p>Leaving the FastTrack convention and my new FastTrack friends, I was both happy and distressed. Happy that I had learned so many wonderful new ways to use FastTrack and that I now owned FastBreak, FastWays, and FastRUBE. Distressed by the thought that all this Faststuff wasn't the Holy Grail. I hadn't realized it until Roy said so, but that's what I'd been thinking it was.<p>And I should have known better. It was embarrassing. But I also mourned the loss. It grieved me deeply to think I hadn't found a way out of all my investment woes.<p>I decided to start approaching the matter with a clearer head. Even given the possible benefits of FastTrack, no one knows just what will happen during the next bear market. The various FastTrack strategies look pretty good on paper -- but that's only on paper. No one has lived through the length of them in real time; no FastTracker has ever had to face a 17 percent drawdown and wonder if that's the end of it or just the beginning. Furthermore, the testing can go back only to 1988, the start of the FastTrack database. The crash of 1987 isn't there to be tested against, nor is the great, ugly downturn of 1974. No one knows what monstrous, liver-punching drawdowns these debacles would have produced. And even if those events were in the database, what would that prove? What worked in 1987 and 1974 might not cut the mustard in some stupendous stock-market firestorm of the mid-1990s. <p>With these things in mind, I arrived home, kissed wife and daughter hello, ate lunch, then ambled back to the den to load up my new software. I also dialed into Prodigy, where Brian Stocks had left some very interesting posts. He'd decided to forswear all manner of high-flying FastTrack strategies -- which of late weren't beating the market anyway -- in favor of the most conservative ones possible, which were doing relatively well. He said he wanted to spend less time worrying about the market and more time tending to his beloved garden.<p>I looked out the den window at my own garden. There I saw wife and daughter turning the soil in preparation for spring planting, doing what Brian wanted to do more of. It made sense to me, because it was sensible.<p>But the Dow had recovered from its big down day and looked to be heading back up. And the more I played with my new FastTrack toys, the more I wanted to make a reach-for-the-stars kind of trade. So I did, calling <a name="NYSE:SCW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14756"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Schwab</b></a> and buying into a super go-getter.<p>Afterward, I sat back in my chair, excited that at last I could call myself a real FastTracker. I had real money on the line now, was ready to post notes about it on Prodigy, ready to start collecting tales of mutual-fund glory for next year's FastTrack convention.<p>I knew FastTrack wasn't the Holy Grail. I knew I should go slow and forget about making a killing. But I couldn't help myself. In my heart, I felt the surging hope that if not for everybody, then perhaps just for me -- and for me alone -- FastTrack would prove to be the one true answer. <p>I felt that as an actual, thrilling possibility. It was irrational. It didn't make any sense. But there it was, and I'd stopped using my head. I wanted those fly rods. And I wanted them now.<p><p><p>

						By Susan Lee<p>At auction houses, both buyers and sellers participate in transaction costs. A buyer at Christie's pays a "premium" of 15 percent of a final price up to $50,000 and 10 percent on any amount over $50,000. Sellers pay a "commission" based on a sliding scale: 20 percent of a final price of less than $2,000, 15 percent of a final price between $2,000 and $7,499, 10 percent of a final price between $7,500 and $99,999, and so on, until the commission falls to 2 percent of a final price of $5 million and above. Sellers also pay percentage points for insurance, administrative fees, and miscellaneous charges for framing, restoration, and whatnot, as well as a flat fee for catalogs. It all adds up.<p>Dealer markups are an inky area -- for both seller and buyer. For instance, dealers who represent works for which there might be only a few dozen possible buyers know those buyers will bargain and must set prices without an auction record. Before they settle on a price, dealers ask themselves a bunch of questions, like whether they need the money to buy something else or whether they paid too much and should be willing to accept less. <p>New York City dealer James Goodman runs through a little monologue in his mind that goes like this: "What! Is he kidding? I am not going to sell it to him. How much of a profit is there in it? Does this mean he's going to write out a check right now? Can I replace it? Do I want to make a sale? How has my business been this week?" <p>Dealer Max Davidson says that in a typical show he will sell half the works at list and the other half at a 10 percent discount. <p>Overall, some say dealer markups average 10 to 15 percent; others say 20 to 50 percent, although markups as high as 300 percent are not unheard of. Generally, the more "difficult" the artist (young, untested) or the cheaper the work (less-than-sensational prints), the higher the markup. When collector Dave Williams decided to focus on African-American printmakers of the 1930s and 1940s, he told dealers he would buy anything they could come up with. Was he afraid of getting gouged? "No, I was confident that they would treat my wife and me fairly, and they did," he says. "We bought nearly all of what they brought to us."<p>Most collectors agree that sometimes it's cheaper to buy from a dealer, but no one says it's cheaper to buy at auction. Also, dealers provide services not available from auction houses, such as pre-selection based on the dealer's expertise and allowing potential buyers to take something home and live with it before deciding to buy. (Dealers also offer discretion. Some people prefer to buy or sell without the world knowing about it -- or, sometimes, without alerting the IRS if, say, their dealer sells in London and deposits the proceeds in a Swiss bank.)<p><p><p><p>

						By Susan Lee<p>Okay. So you know that you should buy something only if you absolutely love it. But what happens if passion fades? There are straightforward disciplines that buyers can follow if they also want to be successful investors.<p>
Feel comfortable with the word "quality"<p>"Quality" is a favorite adjective in the art world. Essentially, something is considered to have quality if it has (or has the potential to have) enduring aesthetic value. Quality is something that most experts recognize and agree on but that eludes most novices, who often cleave to works that are immediately enjoyable yet won't hold their appeal. <p>To recognize quality, you must educate yourself -- tiresome as it might be -- by reading about art, looking at art, and listening to experts talk about art. <p>
Beware of fads<p>This is a bit more than a restatement of the above. Fads are endemic to the art world, where hype is part of the business. Since people want to be seen buying the right thing, it's easy to get caught up. <p>
Buy quality<p>Once you're comfy with the notion of quality, this is simple. As dealer Max Davidson says, "You make your money when you buy. It's a truism of retailing that goods bought right are goods half-sold." <p>
Buy for the long term<p>Which means nothing shorter than ten years. Rachel Adler of Rachel Adler Gallery in New York City says, "Each transaction involves profit for the seller, so it takes a while for prices to rise above that profit." Patience is especially needed if you buy something that has made the rounds at auction: It will be considered stale, and you may have to wait ten years before the art world considers it fresh and enticing again. Of course, for true collectors, long term means forever (or until their heirs sell).<p><p><p>

						By Deborah Jermanok<p>Before investing in the art market, "educate your eye, educate your brain, go to the best galleries and museums," says Peter Falk, publisher of Sound View Press. Then "arm yourself with two kinds of information -- market information, like a good annual art price index, and biographical information." <p>Each book, on-line service, and CD-ROM has its own strengths. Here are some guides to consider.<p>BOOKS
Art Price Index International (published by Sound View Press in Madison, Connecticut) has more than 200,000 entries of paintings, watercolors, drawings, prints, sculptures, posters, photographs, animation works, and installations. The annual, two-volume set sells for $195. Call 800-ART-4API. <p>Details provided by art price indexes vary from publisher to publisher. An Art Price Index International entry for a Georgia O'Keeffe painting is as follows: "O'Keeffe, Georgia [American, 1887
1986] + $321500 204796 White hill and black [406 x 508 mm - 16 x 20 in] s, i, oil on canvas, 1928. Sotheby's NY, 25 May 95, #117    P (DM461353)."<p>To translate: The artist, Georgia O'Keeffe, was an American who lived from 1887 to 1986. The plus sign indicates that the sale price in dollars ($321,500) and in pounds (204,796) includes the auction house's premium. The painting is titled White Hill and Black; its dimensions are listed in millimeters (406 by 508) and inches (16 by 20). The "s" indicates the work is signed and the "i" that it is inscribed; the medium is oil on canvas, and the work was executed in 1928. Sotheby's auctioned the painting on May 25, 1995, in lot 117. The square means the work was illustrated in the auction catalog, and the "P," for provenance, means the previous owner is documented. The price is also listed in deutsche marks (DM 461,353). <p>
Mayer International Auction Records ($190), published in Switzerland, is one of the oldest guides. It has about 120,000 entries for paintings, watercolors, sculptures, drawings, and prints (914-297-1312). <p>
Art Sales Index, published in England by Duncan Hislop, is in its 27th edition. The two-volume set ($185) lists 108,000 works and includes paintings, sculptures, photographs, watercolors, drawings, and prints (011-44-1932-856426).<p>
ADEC, published in France, covers paintings, watercolors, sculptures, prints, photographs, and drawings. Price: $170 plus shipping (800-527-3501). <p>
Leonard's Annual Price Index of Art Auctions ($219) includes prices for paintings, drawings, and sculptures but cites auctions in North America only (617-964-2876).<p>
Gordon's Print Price Annual focuses on prints and contains over 37,000 entries. It sells for $225 (941-434-6842).<p><p>ON-LINE SERVICES 
Artnet, the only on-line service that provides images, claims to have the largest electronic archive of art-auction records in the world. To access, you need a PC, a modem, and ArtNet software; the rate is $1.25 per minute in North America (800-4-ARTNET). <p>
ArtQuest was launched in 1983 by Hislop's Art Sales Index. ArtQuest provides auction-price data for fine arts at a cost of $250 a year and $1.20 per minute (011-44-1932-856426).<p>
Thesaurus, based in London, has data on over 600 auction houses and historical pricing going back to 1820. It is the only on-line service that includes decorative arts. For a cost of $150 to $500, Thesaurus also provides pre-sale notification. On-line price information costs about $12 an hour (800-491-FIND).<p><p>CD-ROMs
ArtFact is an auction-price database (made up of ten CD-ROMs) for fine and decorative arts and is the only CD-ROM that provides images. The ten CD-ROMs cost $1,995 for the first year and $1,550 every year to update (800-ARTFACT).<p>
Art Sales Index's disc lists sales from 1990 to 1995 for 528 auction houses in 32 countries. It costs $595 and is distributed by ArtFact (800-ARTFACT).<p>
ADEC provides a CD-ROM that documents the sales of 750 auction houses, including paintings, sculptures, prints, drawings, and photographs. The cost is $495 for the first year and $295 for yearly updates (800-ARTFACT).<p>
Mayer International Auction Records CD-ROM has over 600,000 sales records of paintings, prints, drawings, gouaches, pastels, watercolors, and sculptures ($199 plus shipping; 888-MAYERCD).<p>
Leonard's Combined Price Index of Art Auctions CD-ROM database goes back 15 years and lists prices for paintings, drawings, sculptures, prints, posters, and photographs ($995; 617-964-2876).<p>
Gordon's Print Price Annual CD-ROM has information on more than 385,000 print sales and also includes a database of print dealers as well as a bibliography of publications about prints. The base subscription is $595; annual updates cost $295 (941-434-6842).<p>
Now what? Gayle Skluzacek, an appraiser and the president of Abigail Hartmann Associates, suggests using a combination of price indexes and CD-ROMs; most good art-reference libraries carry both. For general introductory books on art, consider H. W. Janson's History of Art, Robert Atkins's Art Speak and Art Spoke, which are guides to the buzzwords and players of the 19th and 20th centuries, and Susan Theran's Fine Art Identification and Price Guide. Also consider taking a basic art-history or art-appreciation course.<p>One last piece of advice, this one from Stephen Abt of ArtFact: "Buying art information is exactly like buying art itself. Buy the highest quality you can find in your budget, and your purchase will eventually justify itself."  -- Deborah Jermanok<p>
Okay. So you know that you should buy something only if you absolutely love it. But what happens if passion fades? There are straightforward disciplines that buyers can follow if they also want to be successful investors.<p>Feel comfortable with the word 
"quality"
"Quality" is a favorite adjective in the art world. Essentially, something is considered to have quality if it has (or has the potential to have) enduring aesthetic value. Quality is something that most experts recognize and agree on but that eludes most novices, who often cleave to works that are immediately enjoyable yet won't hold their appeal. 
To recognize quality, you must educate yourself -- tiresome as it might be -- by reading about art, looking at art, and listening to experts talk about art. 
Beware of fads
This is a bit more than a restatement of the above. Fads are endemic to the art world, where hype is part of the business. Since people want to be seen buying the right thing, it's easy to get caught up. <p>Buy quality
Once you're comfy with the notion of quality, this is simple. As dealer Max Davidson says, "You make your money when you buy. It's a truism of retailing that goods bought right are goods half-sold." <p>Buy for the long term
Which means nothing shorter than ten years. Rachel Adler of Rachel Adler Gallery in New York City says, "Each transaction involves profit for the seller, so it takes a while for prices to rise above that profit." Patience is especially needed if you buy something that has made the rounds at auction: It will be considered stale, and you may have to wait ten years before the art world considers it fresh and enticing again. Of course, for true collectors, long term means forever (or until their heirs sell).  -- S.L.<p>
At auction houses, both buyers and sellers participate in transaction costs. A buyer at Christie's pays a "premium" of 15 percent of a final price up to $50,000 and 10 percent on any amount over $50,000. Sellers pay a "commission" based on a sliding scale: 20 percent of a final price of less than $2,000, 15 percent of a final price between $2,000 and $7,499, 10 percent of a final price between $7,500 and $99,999, and so on, until the commission falls to 2 percent of a final price of $5 million and above. Sellers also pay percentage points for insurance, administrative fees, and miscellaneous charges for framing, restoration, and whatnot, as well as a flat fee for catalogs. It all adds up.
Dealer markups are an inky area -- for both seller and buyer. For instance, dealers who represent works for which there might be only a few dozen possible buyers know those buyers will bargain and must set prices without an auction record. Before they settle on a price, dealers ask themselves a bunch of questions, like whether they need the money to buy something else or whether they paid too much and should be willing to accept less. 
New York City dealer James Goodman runs through a little monologue in his mind that goes like this: "What! Is he kidding? I am not going to sell it to him. How much of 
a profit is there in it? Does this mean he's going to write out a check right now? Can I 
replace it? Do I want to make a sale? How has my business been this week?" 
Dealer Max Davidson says that in a typical show he will sell half the works at list and the other half at a 10 percent discount. 
Overall, some say dealer markups average 10 to 15 percent; others say 20 to 50 percent, although markups as high as 300 percent are not unheard of. Generally, the more "difficult" the artist (young, untested) or the cheaper the work (less-than-sensational prints), the higher the markup. When collector Dave Williams decided to focus on African-American printmakers of the 1930s and 1940s, he told dealers he would buy anything they could come up with. Was he afraid of getting gouged? "No, I was confident that they would treat my wife and me fairly, and they did," he says. "We bought nearly all of what they brought to us."
Most collectors agree that sometimes it's cheaper to buy from a dealer, but no one says it's cheaper to buy at auction. Also, dealers provide services not available from auction houses, such as pre-selection based on the dealer's expertise and allowing potential buyers to take something home and live with it before deciding to buy. (Dealers also offer discretion. Some people prefer to buy or sell without the world knowing about it -- or, sometimes, without alerting the IRS if, say, their dealer sells in London and deposits the proceeds in a Swiss bank.)  -- S.L.<p><p><p>

One difference between buying art and buying stock: Love. Others: Liquidity, volatility, risk, rates of return. An economist looks at art as a market.<p>By Susan Lee<p>Bump. Flutter. Liftoff. <p>These three words tell the story of the art market since its crash in 1990. The question now is, Will the last two years of liftoff become soar? Is it, in other words, time to buy? <p>Well, some experts think so. Consider the signs. <p>Collectors, who had pretty much dropped out of the market by 1987, have returned. One of them, John Stewart of Sagaponack, New York, is back and putting his couch-price rule to work. He explains: "When you can buy great paintings by very good artists for less than it takes to buy a couch at Bloomingdale's, then art is undervalued. Prices for normal, young artists are back to competing with Bloomingdale's." <p>Bidding at auction is in a rational phase, too. Christopher Burge, chairman of Christie's Inc., says he now sees buyers trying to stop bidding at the same price point. "When they all start cutting their bids at the same time, that means there is a consensus on value," he says. "It's an orderly market now -- a perfect market." <p>Finally, it's an auspicious time in the broader art-market cycle. Burge has lived through four cycles in his 27 years in the business. He figures the average cycle takes about seven or eight years. "Following any spurt is a falling back, a loss of confidence," he says. "A lot of supply is withdrawn, and the supply that does come onto the market is not the best, causing a higher rate of unsold lots at auction. These things fuel uncertainty." <p>According to Burge, downturns last 18 to 24 months 
before the market finds a price level -- that is, before sellers adjust to new prices. Then follows a period of consensus. That is followed by the inevitable run-up. Burge pegs major bottoms in 1969, 1975, 1981, and 1990, which coincide roughly with economic slumps. (The last cycle was extended by the Japanese, who started a buying surge in 1988 and then, when their economy tanked, vanished from the market.) <p>So if the market is coming off a major bottom, does that mean we are in for a major top -- like the glory days of the 1980s? Days when Ivan Karp of O. K. Harris in New York could turn over inventory at breathtaking speed and at eyebrow-raising profits? "We had concluded a sale for a painting and accepted a down payment," Karp recalls. "Then a dealer came in and said he'd give us 25 percent more. I gave the buyer a $10,000 bonus not to buy. That's how it was." <p>But before you rush out with a pocketbook over your arm, step back and consider the nature of the art market. It has characteristics that make it at once comforting and dangerous. <p>As a market, the art market satisfies some of the criteria for efficiency that are attractive to investors. There are, for instance, no big price gaps among markets. Dealer Max Davidson used to buy in Paris and sell in New York; now, he says, "price differences are insignificant." Indeed, buyers can bid at auctions from halfway around the world, making former barriers like geography inconsequential. <p>Information aboundeth, too: Auction houses churn out catalogs, and publishers spew out art magazines. Price information is especially accessible. <p>The market also has a decently diverse product mix with different price and risk ranges. Its three major categories -- the biggest is decorative (furniture, rugs, silver, etc.), which is followed by painting and work on paper and then by sculpture -- account for somewhere between $20 billion and $50 billion in annual sales. In each category, good works can be bought for anywhere from a couple hundred dollars to a couple hundred thousand dollars. Risks also vary widely: In painting, for example, old masters probably carry the least risk, contemporary living artists carry the most, and impressionists and 19th-century artists are somewhere in between.<p>But the art market also has other characteristics that make it unattractive to investors.<p>First and foremost, it's almost impossible to determine if risk-adjusted returns compare favorably with those of other markets. Indeed, it's a little tricky to determine what, exactly, returns are. Price changes can be measured only for works that endure and are brought to market. Since most art is deemed worthless and thrown out, estimates of returns capture only the survivors and are, thus, overstated. Moreover, it's hard to estimate the nonpecuniary component involved in owning art -- the value attached to the enjoyment gained from the simple act of viewing. <p>Tricky as it is to figure rates of return, economists have gone right ahead anyway. William Grampp, professor emeritus of economics at the University of Chicago, reviews some of the better empirical studies in his 1989 book, Pricing the Priceless. Estimates of rates of return, gleaned from looking at price changes for a broad range of paintings, vary enormously. The highest real return was 8 percent annually from 1946 to 1968, and the lowest real return was .55 percent annually over 300 years (1652 to 1961). Such a wide range, created by honest and skilled people, should alert potential investors to the fact that investing in art is akin to flying blind.<p>Yet even if it were possible to obtain sound estimates of returns, it's still a mug's game to view those returns in terms of risk. Is the risk attached to an investment in a Picasso unusually high or abnormally low? Unlike other financial markets where risk is routinely measured -- such as with a beta for stocks, duration for bonds, and BlackScholes for options -- the risks in the art market are not that transparent.<p>There are two types of risk: market and nonmarket. Market risk stems from changes in income and wealth. Since the demand for art is income elastic, more wealth and higher incomes will mean greater demand for art, but a sudden economic or financial crunch will cause demand to evaporate and prices to crater.<p>As for nonmarket risk, on the demand side art investors are always subject to broad changes in taste. For example, Nicholas Hall of the Colnaghi gallery in New York says, "English portraiture was devoured in America at the turn of the century. In 1915, Henry Frick bought The Ladies Sarah and Catherine Bligh, by John Hoppner, for $100,000. It would now sell for $150,000. But the same year, he bought for $28,000 less a portrait by Bronzino, Portrait of Ludovico Capponi, that would now be worth about $25 million." Similarly, 10 to 20 years ago, strong Italian religious paintings, such as works by Guido Reni and Mattia Preti, were popular. Today, Italian view paintings by Canaletto and landscapes by French artists such as Hubert Robert are considered more stylish.<p>There are also smaller shifts. The art world is vulnerable to fads in which certain schools or artists can go from being wildly popular to totally shunned almost overnight -- Julian Schnabel comes to mind. Ian Kennedy of Simon Dickinson in New York says, "These days, people don't want to be challenged. They don't want pictures of difficult subjects, too dramatic or emotional. They want a picture that is easy to live with, something a bit bland and decorative." <p>Risks can come, too, from the supply side. For instance, a huge sale of an artist's works or a corporate dumping of a particular period can flood the market and drive down prices. Nor does the art market offer opportunities for hedging risk. There is no futures market or organized options market. <p>Transaction costs, too, leave a lot to be desired. They are, well, on the high side. <p>When looked at beyond these specific good and bad aspects, the art market is a puzzle -- it exhibits characteristics that are a bit like more familiar investment markets yet unlike them as well.<p>For instance, the art market resembles the stock market; it comprises certain brand names that convey known attributes. The name Rembrandt is similar to the name <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a> (a blue-chip category), while a Jean-Michel Basquiat is like <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a> (a growth category). Yet works by brand-name artists aren't fungible; not all Rembrandts are alike the way all Ford shares are.<p>Prices can experience wide and rapid swings, as they can in the commodities and foreign-exchange markets, but the art market itself is hardly as liquid as the commodities and foreign-exchange markets. Also, while the art market is global, like the bond market, it is not nearly as deep or as wide; it doesn't have a lot of ready buyers and sellers. It can surely be said -- and is with annoying frequency -- that works of art resemble pieces of real estate because they are unique and relatively illiquid, although, of course, most art is portable and real estate is not.<p>And, last, like other financial markets, the art market is subject to -- ahem -- speculative excesses. Consider what happened in the 1980s. <p>For starters, prices zoomed. The Daily Telegraph's price index for modern European painting rose at an average annual rate of 23 percent between 1980 and 1990; its index for old masters went up at an average annual rate of 15 percent. (During that time, stocks logged a 17 percent annual increase, and bonds registered a 13 percent annual rise.) <p>Speculators, drooling over the potential for fast profits, all but crowded collectors out of the market. Turnaround sales were lightning quick and generated delicious profits. One Florida dealer sold a Larry Rivers drawing in January 1989 for $19,000 only to see it auctioned off in New York at <a name="NYSE:BID"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12331"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sotheby's</b></a> ten months later -- before the check arrived -- for $88,000. "When we finally got the check," she says, "it came with a thank-you note and a bottle of champagne."<p>At auction houses, the doings were also red-hot: The 1987 sale of van Gogh's Irises for almost $54 million and the 1989 sale of Picasso's Pierrette's Wedding for close to $52 million merited international TV coverage. Christie's Burge recalls the moment just after the enormously successful 1990 auction of van Gogh's Portrait of Dr. Gachet. The place was packed, the crowd tense and silent. But at the fall of the gavel, the room burst into thundering applause. "They were not clapping for van Gogh but for themselves," says Burge. "The sale price of $82.5 million suggested their investments were secure." <p>Not to put too fine a point on it, but the art market of the 1980s had many of the markings of a financial bubble. Everybody and his sister-in-law were slurping up art -- the usual assortment of newly rich Americans as well as the Japanese, along with the Scandinavians, the French, the British, and the Swiss.<p>Why were they slurping? Well, surely some of it was motivated by a genuine interest in art. But surely some of it was driven by social climbing. "Take a fellow who has just made a couple of hundreds of millions of dollars," says Milton Esterow, publisher of Art News. "Who knows him? But let him buy a van Gogh for a couple of million, and suddenly everybody knows his name."<p>Consider the story told by collector John Stewart. In 1989, he was selling a work by pop artist Richard Artschwager. In the several years since he purchased it, Stewart had come to find the piece "atrocious." He told dealers he had an Artschwager for sale, but he was totally unprepared for what happened next. "A dealer asked if he could bring over a couple from Chicago," Stewart says. "Apparently, they were having a party, and they absolutely could not leave New York City without an Artschwager -- not my Artschwager, but an Artschwager -- to hang on a wall." (P.S. The couple returned to Chicago with Stewart's Artschwager for $165,000 -- four times what he had paid.)<p>And, finally, some of the buying was propelled by greed, pure and simple. As with all things financial when prices seem to skyrocket ever upward, buying art sure looked like easy money. When the market tanked in 1990, prices dropped 30 to 50 percent overall; 80 to 90 percent was not unusual for contemporary living artists. "Everyone disappeared at the same time," says dealer James Goodman. The result was several years of an abnormally thin and illiquid market.<p>Now, however, it looks like the art world has solidified the turnaround that began last year. Prices for certain things are coming back. Impressionists, for example, are now up to three-quarters of their top prices. Works of the modernist movement -- 1910 to 1950 -- are selling at 20 percent below their high-tide mark. Six years' time has meant that the two mighty engines of supply -- death and divorce -- have released a lot of fresh, quality stuff, and demand is once again broad based. Everyone, including the Japanese, is coming back. And there is a crop of new buyers: Americans, of course, in the form of new faces from Silicon Valley and small industrial firms, as well as new groups of English, French, Swiss, Koreans, South Americans, and Southeast Asians.<p>But the fact remains: Investors in the art market are tromping around in a lot of uncharted territory. Perhaps this is why almost everybody with any experience says art is not a good investment. Don't buy something, say the voices of wisdom, unless you love it. (Because, the voices imply, you'll be stuck looking at it forever.) <p>Indeed, the word "passion" crops up over and over again. Buying art should be a form of passion -- an exercise in passion, an expression of passion. And buyers who become collectors speak convincingly of their desire to acquire art not for profit but for the happiness of bringing significant cultural artifacts into their lives. Martin Margulies of Grove Isle, Florida, is one of those. When he started collecting contemporary art over 20 years ago, he says, he did so "for deeply personal reasons; it was something beyond business, more satisfying and illuminating."<p><p><p>

						Summer Reading<p>ECONOMICS
Hidden Order: The Economics of Everyday Life, by David D. Friedman (HarperBusiness, $25).
Of the millions who've forgotten their one semester of college economics, thousands wonder whether -- in this globally competitive age of ours -- they ought to try again. For them, David Friedman -- the son of conservative economist Milton Friedman -- has produced Hidden Order.<p>Friedman's apparent view is that, for years, market theory has just needed breezier expositors and snappier illustrations to win back those lost hearts and minds. Thus, Friedman tells us that economic rationality isn't just for "Mr. Spock" and other "calculating... Vulcans"; instead, it can help us save "a hero with a broken sword (Conan, Boromir, or your favorite Dungeons and Dragons character)."<p>As a relatively math-free field guide to traditional (and some recent) textbook concepts, Hidden Order does a cleverly decent job. We revisit Victorian-era principles and encounter newer approaches, such as rational expectations. We're cheerfully introduced to such modern figures as Gary Becker, James Buchanan, and Gordon Tullock and their applications of economics to new fields like crime, voting, and divorce. (The book notably omits any mention of John Maynard Keynes or his descendants, though, which is a bit like teaching American history sans Roosevelt, Kennedy, and Johnson.)<p>Even for readers inclined to Friedman's libertarian views, this book won't knock John Grisham off the beach; nor for sheer literacy and humor can Friedman rival his father's old nemesis, John Kenneth Galbraith. But for those who want to review their Samuelson (or McConnell or Lipsey and Steiner) through the partisan eyes of the University of Chicago, Hidden Order offers an offbeat -- and sometimes amusing -- introduction. <p>--Richard Parker<p>
WORLD AFFAIRS
Market Unbound: Unleashing Global Capitalism, by Lowell Bryan and Diana Farrell (John Wiley, $27.95).
Like Prometheus, financial markets, once bound by stabilizing international covenants, such as Bretton Woods, have now shaken off their chains. If the authors -- senior consultants at McKinsey & Company, which advises blue-chip clients around the world -- aren't the first to argue that governments are losing the ability to control the operation of capital in domestic markets, what distinguishes them is how heartily they celebrate the phenomenon.<p>The book is best at tracing the liberation of the global market, showing, for example, how the invention of simple derivatives (say, interest-rate swaps) provided the building blocks for a global financial stock marketplace worth $41 trillion by 1994. Bryan and Farrell take every opportunity to lay out clearly the interrelationships among bond, currency, and world stock markets.<p>For those who live and breathe the markets, the increasing liquidity and wealth of international financial markets can seem the most salient aspect of late-20th-century economic life. Such a view, however, has little to do with how most national economies operate. As financial markets become ever larger, the volume of money whirling through them reflects productive activity less and less. Not even one dollar in five that trades on the international-currency market is tied to a player outside the financial industry -- to someone who isn't a trader, in other words -- and over 80 percent of all U.S. productive economic activity still takes place in the domestic market. These conditions won't stop the growth of global financial markets, but they should comfort those who think the world is destined to be ruled by them. <p>-- Ted C. Fishman<p>The Challenge From the East and the Rebirth of the West, by Michael Spicer (St. Martin's Press, $22.95).
In this 200-page stump speech, Spicer claims that the nations of the East, led by China, are destined to overrun the West militarily and economically and, in the end, trounce all challengers in the age-old contest for prestige. A return to the forceful advocacy and practice of free trade is the West's only hope for peaceful coexistence with the aggressive East. Spicer's general conclusions about the merits of trade are sound enough, but he neglects to consider that the U.S. is increasingly an Eastern, as well as a Western, nation and that some Asian countries, such as Japan and South Korea, are as happy to ally themselves with Western interests as to embrace the democratic principles Spicer says are unique to our heritage. <p>-- Ted C. Fishman<p>
CRIME
Hot Blood: The Money, the Brach Heiress, and the Horse Murders, by Ken Englade (St. Martin's Press, $23.95).
Candy heiress Helen Brach vanished in 1977, leaving an estate then worth an estimated $30 million. Her body has never been found. Hot Blood tells the bizarre story of the investigation into Brach's disappearance. Penetrating the horsey set, the investigators discovered a dazzling array of lowlifes, from a Mafia hit man, to a check-forging crack addict, to a hired killer of show horses. Fun stuff for a book. One drawback, however, is that Englade writes with all the artistic subtlety of Joe Eszterhas. Nevertheless, true-crime aficionados will enjoy the book. Those tempted to buy a horse might want to think twice before reading it, though: They may end up suspecting that their trusted horse dealer would happily charge a 400 percent commission on a psychotic donkey. <p>-- William Green<p>
POINT OF VIEW
The Day Before Yesterday: Reconsidering America's Past, ReDIScovering the Present, by Michael Elliott (Simon & Schuster, $24).
An editor friend at The Economist once told me the secret of the magazine's style. Nothing to it, he pronounced: "First simplify, then exaggerate." In The Day Before Yesterday, Elliott (an Economist veteran now at Newsweek International) displays the merit -- and liabilities -- of this British approach. Expanding on an Economist article he wrote some years ago, he revisits America's last half century to examine our current complaints.<p>"Americans whine," he begins sternly. We misread the late 1940s, 1950s, and 1960s; that hazy "golden age" of American prosperity and power concealed all sorts of fissures and failures. Always a nation of immigrants, plagued by cultural wars and uneven prosperity, we were lucky, as well as energetic, after World War II -- and wrongly took this historical moment as a new norm. We still possess an entrepreneurialism and ambition that can move us forward -- but only if we stop whining.<p>A tad long on this sort of Methodist uplift, the book lacks the depth that David Halberstam, Martin Walker, and Daniel Bell bring to their work. Yet as an easily digestible blend of anecdote, data, and (partisan) judgment, it's a worthy tour d'horizon of our rightfully contested recent past. For those who favor the Newsweek castor-oil-and-spinach school of analysis (think Robert Samuelson, Meg Greenfield, and Joe Klein), it's ultimately good "vacation history."              -- Richard Parker<p>
Business as a Calling: Work and the Examined Life, by Michael Novak (Free Press, $22.50).
This is a thought-provoking but tricky book -- one that shouldn't be read blithely by those who want to believe Peter F. Drucker's claim that it's "nonsense" to judge an "economic action" by yardsticks other than profitability.<p>True, Novak endorses Drucker's remark with great enthusiasm. But he then contradicts it by arguing, somewhat unctuously, that CEOs and entrepreneurs can lay claim to moral virtues as well as economic ones. Why? Simply because business entails obedience, on pain of ruin, to morally significant obligations: providing products of "real value" and creating new wealth, new jobs, and a "reasonable" return on investment.<p>But Novak, not surprisingly for a Roman Catholic "theologian on capitalism" at the American Enterprise Institute, is a closet paternalist. As such, he believes that business folk have obligations to society beyond the obligation to prosper. For example, they must foster a strong sense of community, condemn the "animal-like" sex and violence of popular culture, and battle constantly against the forces of envy and despair.<p>This is a daunting moral agenda, requiring a quixotic resistance to such market-driven imperatives as corporate downsizing, competitive marketing, and CEO remunerations that are 200 times those of the average worker. Here, sadly, Novak falls silent. Communism's ruin has left free enterprise in the ethical catbird seat, but also under intense ethical scrutiny. So buy Novak's book for a rather smarmy exhortation on behalf of the system, but look elsewhere (if only to Drucker) for a more persuasive defense of it. <p>-- Nelson W. Aldrich Jr.<p>
FICTION
The Zero Hour, by Joseph Finder (William Morrow, $25).
If the Oklahoma City and World Trade Center bombings have taught us anything, it is this: When it comes to terrorism in the U.S., expect the unexpected. Of course, those incidents taught terrorists a lot, too. So the details of atrocity are what make The Zero Hour so hair-raising. Finder plots his entire scenario at the apex of the terrorist learning curve. The provocateur, for example, isn't a political ideologue; instead, he's a fugitive tax evader eager to get back at America by bombing Wall Street's most powerful computer network. Finder, an internationally renowned expert on the CIA, massages his material with great skill. This is one of those books that will inevitably be dismissed as a great beach read -- and it is that -- but anyone interested in how modern technology makes world finance vulnerable will find a lot more here than that. <p>-- Greg Critser<p>
The Vulture Fund, by Stephen W. Frey (Dutton, $23.95).
Mace McLain, a hotshot investment banker, is tapped to head a $2 billion "vulture fund" to buy real estate in a market crash rigged by the head of the CIA. Unless, that is, Mace and his bosom buddy from the orphanage (!), Slade, can save the day. Beach literature requires such a plot. Other essential elements are also here: venal bankers, presidential shenanigans, nuclear terrorism, a few rolls in the hay. But to be a good beach read, a book must satisfy certain commandments. No putting laughable dialogue straight off the cutting-room floor of Oliver Stone's Wall Street into the mouths of cardboard characters stuck in boardrooms. Action shall take place before book's end and not read as if slapped together by teenagers. Plausibility shall not be repeatedly stretched by suspending logic. Alas, The Vulture Fund violates them all. So instead of being entertaining and disposable, it's simply disposable. 
-- Rob Spillman<p>
MEMOIRS
Benjamin Graham: The Memoirs of the Dean of Wall Street, by Benjamin Graham (McGraw-Hill, $27.95).
The Wall Street Journal recently described Graham as one of the greatest investors of all time, ranking him with George Soros, Peter Lynch, and Graham protg Warren Buffett. Graham averaged a 17 percent rate of return over a career that saw both the Crash and the Great Depression, yet it's somewhat miraculous that he became an 
investor at all: A month before graduating from Columbia University in 1914, he was simultaneously offered teaching appointments in the school's departments of mathematics, English, and philosophy. Instead, he took a job as a Wall Street runner and apprentice bond salesman.<p>His memoirs are for those who want a look into the inner life of a notoriously private and wonderfully playful man. Some material covers his experiences and techniques as a financier, but mostly the other facets of his many-sided brilliance are on display. Not least of these is the insight of one who can criticize himself for being aicted with Horace's mens sibi conscia recti -- a mind conscious of its own rectitude (this from a person memorably described 
by another as one who "leaped from blonde to blonde like an alpine goat springing from peak to peak").<p>A fair number of other Latin tags dot the book. Makes sense, though:
Graham translated not only Latin poetry, but French and German poetry, too. He also, despite never having formally studied Spanish, translated a Uruguayan novel, Mario Benedetti's La Truega. You won't find his kind on Wall Street (or anywhere else) anymore; it's amazing you ever could. <p>-- Fredric Smoler<p>

Iacocca, credited as the "father of the minivan," initially vetoed the project in favor of developing a pickup truck. (Chrysler's sales and marketing staffs had no more foresight: They laughed at the suggestion that minivans might replace station wagons.) When the first van finally rolled off the assembly line, the power door locks failed, and Iacocca, at the wheel for a photo op, was briefly trapped inside.<p>The minivan's story may be the glue that holds the chapters together, but the book is also a litany of Chrysler travails, from Frank Sinatra's misadventures at Iacocca's Vegas farewell party, to Chrysler executives' dodging Inside Edition cameras that were pursuing a recall story, to Kirk Kerkorian's hostile-takeover attempt.<p>Don't be put off by the dry title. Yates, a noted automotive writer, columnist, and Cannonball-race instigator, uses a detective-like style and fascinating detail to produce an enjoyable, quick read. -- Jim Mateja<p>

ALSO OUT
Traders' Tales, by Ron Insana (John Wiley, $24.95). 
This charming book by the host of CNBC's Inside Opinion captures the quickly disappearing sensibility of Old Wall Street, a place, Insana writes, where "emotional extremes" fused with "a fraternal order" to create an original American culture. 
-- Greg Critser<p>The Dilbert Principle, by Scott Adams (HarperBusiness, $20). Cartoonist Scott Adams brings to his potato-headed hero a frustration with management that will resonate with anyone who's ever been passed over, unappreciated, bossed by an incompetent, or relegated to silly projects -- in short, anyone who's ever worked in an office. 
-- Ken Kurson<p>"This Business Has Legs," by Peter Bieler with Suzanne Costas (John Wiley, $24.95). 
A saga as passionately told as anything by Joan Collins; Suzanne Somers herself couldn't do better. The subtitle says it all: How I Used Infomercial Marketing to Create the $100,000,000 ThighMaster Exerciser Craze. 
-- Hillary Johnson<p>Leo Melamed: Escape to the Futures, by Leo Melamed with Bob Tamarkin (John Wiley, $27.95). 
Anyone in business knows futures markets are critical to a true international economy. What people probably don't know is that, if one man invented these markets, that man is Leo Melamed. His memoir is a lively, unpretentious account of how the Chicago Mercantile Exchange came to be what it is and how he created some of the key underpinnings of a world economy running on pure fiat money. 
-- Fredric Smoler<p>The Complete Guide to Offshore Money Havens, by Jerome Schneider (Prima, $29.95). 
This ridiculous mess of grand promises and contradictions is the dark side of the boom in global investing. Its biggest problem is that almost all of the treaties that created offshore tax havens have been revamped, and U.S. citizens have almost no advantages in moving their investment base abroad. 
-- Ted C. Fishman<p><p>

						Investor, know thy return. Appreciation is only half the picture.<p>By Kathleen Pender<p>Most investments offer two sources of profit: income (dividends or interest) and capital gains (an increase in the security's market price). Together, they make up total return.<p>Some investors fixate on capital gains, forgetting that dividends fatten returns and cushion losses. Others focus on yield, forgetting that a decline in the price of a stock or bond can wipe out years of dividends or interest payments.<p>Total return is the only way to measure an investment's performance and the only meaningful way to compare returns on two investments -- a stock with no dividend but plenty of price appreciation, say, and a high-dividend equity with some gain in price. It's easy to figure total return on a security held for a full year: Start with the total value of the shares or bonds in a portfolio at year-end, and add interest or dividends received but not reinvested. Subtract the value at the start of the year, and divide the difference by the starting value. Convert to a percentage.<p>For example, say each of 100 shares you own of a stock worth $12 a share on January 1 pays $2 in annual dividends and appreciates to $16 by year-end. The year-end total value is $1,600 ($16 times 100) plus $200 ($2 in dividends times 100 shares), or $1,800. The beginning value was $1,200. So total return for the year is 50 percent -- $1,800 minus $1,200 (or $600) divided by $1,200, then multiplied by 100 to convert to a percentage.<p>The calculation isn't usually that simple, however. Adding or withdrawing cash from a portfolio during the year changes the basis of the calculation. Dividends that are paid on different dates further complicate matters.<p>"Brokerage houses could do this for people, but they don't," says John Markese, president of the American Association of Individual Investors. Fortunately, investors have two do-it-yourself choices. Software such as Quicken, Simply Money, and Managing Your Money calculate total return with a click of the mouse after the investor enters buy and sell prices and dividends or interest payments.<p>Paper-and-pencil investors don't have to throw up their hands, either. The formula below will calculate an approximate total return for any portfolio. The approximation will be most accurate if an investor does the calculation at the end of a quarter or year and if additions or withdrawals are in fairly equal amounts and at regular intervals. <p><p><p>

						Some currently cheap high-tech stocks aren't exactly bargains<p>By Jonathan Butler<p><a name="NYSE:SGI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11735"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Silicon Graphics</b></a>, the maker of the high-end computer systems that brought the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park to life, did a good job of animating investors as well for most of last year. Its stock rose 35 percent in the first eight months of 1995. <p>But then came the technology rout. By the end of April 1996, the stock had lost all its gains, trading within three dollars of its January 1995 price. That was common for technology stocks: After rising 45 percent in the first eight months of last year, the Pacific Stock Exchange technology index treaded water in the last quarter -- while the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index climbed another 6 percent. The first quarter of 1996 didn't go any better: The Pacific Stock Exchange index fell 0.3 percent, and the S&P rose 5.4 percent.<p>Suddenly, hot performers from 1995 -- like <a name="NYSE:MU"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14116"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Micron Technology</b></a> (down 64 percent as of May 15, 1996, from its 1995 high), <a name="NASD:MACR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16658"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Macromedia</b></a> (down 36 percent), <a name="NASD:LLTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13973"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Linear Technology</b></a> (down 32 percent), and even <a name="NYSE:MOT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11023"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Motorola</b></a> (down 23 percent) -- look cheap. But investors shouldn't assume this pullback is a buying opportunity for every fallen highflier. Some of these stocks are victims of changes in technology that have cut profit margins or made key products obsolete. Many could actually fall further. Experts believe that the next technology rally will differ from the 1995 boom: This time, the rising tide will not lift all boats.<p>It's as important to know which stocks to avoid as it is to find great stocks to buy. One or two flops can annihilate a portfolio's gains. Witness the <a name="FUND:MBTCX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MBTCX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch Technology B Fund</b></a>. When its biggest holding, software maker <a name="NASD:AKLM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10544"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acclaim Entertainment</b></a>, fell 35 percent on December 5, the fund, which held 25 stocks at the time, declined 5 percent in one day.<p>How does an investor identify stocks threatened by potential downdrafts? At this stage in the technology revolution, avoid companies marketing technology in danger of becoming outdated, those with a small market share and narrow product lines, and those whose profits depend on high-margin products that are facing competition from lower-margin products.<p>OUT WITH THE OLD
Every technology investor knows what the introduction of the PC did to companies that made mainframe computers. As PCs and networks of PCs became powerful enough to do many of the tasks that only mainframes could once perform, sales of mainframes fell as a percentage of total sales. At <a name="NYSE:IBM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10796"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IBM</b></a>, for example, sales of mainframe computers and related products have declined from 42 percent of sales in 1992 to 25 percent in 1995, according to Daniel Mandresh, vice president of research at Merrill Lynch. That decline has had an immense impact on the bottom line even at companies that have kept their sales climbing in total dollars: Mainframes and related products have profit margins of at least 60 percent, four times more than the 15 percent profit margin for PCs.<p>That story is now being replayed among computer companies whose fortunes are tied to the Unix operating system. The group at risk includes such stellar performers as Silicon Graphics (NYSE: SGI) and <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a> (Nasdaq: SUNW), up-and-comers such as the <a name="NASD:SCOC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15227"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Santa Cruz Operation</b></a> (Nasdaq: SCOC) and <a name="NASD:BNYN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15842"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Banyan Systems</b></a> (Nasdaq: BNYN), and old-line mainframe makers such as <a name="NASD:MSFT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14120"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Unisys (NYSE: UIS). "The companies to be most worried about are the ones that are dependent on Unix and are not open to other systems," says Larry Eakin, a senior technology analyst at Federated Investors in Pittsburgh. "The key is that those old proprietary systems carry terrifically good profit margins compared to the new stuff," says Michael Murphy, editor of California Technology Stock Letter. For example, although revenues at Unisys, which provides computer systems to governments and businesses, have certainly headed south, falling from $8.4 billion in 1992 to $6.2 billion in 1995, earnings have plummeted even faster, dropping from $362 million in 1993 to $43 million last year.<p>Unix is one of the oldest and most versatile operating systems, the intermediary software that enables applications, such as databases and graphics, to run on a computer. PCs running a new operating system from <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Microsoft</b></a> called Windows NT still can't match the power of Unix-based systems, but they have recently narrowed the gap. And they cost much less. For example, a high-end workstation and software from Silicon Graphics can't be beat for its graphic modeling capabilities. Using such a workstation, an engineer can see how the sun would reflect off different paints on a car or let a client "sit" in the interior. But such machines cost more than $100,000. Users who don't need the ultimate in graphics capabilities can approximate the power and versatility of such machines using an NT-based PC system for about $20,000. To compete, companies like Silicon Graphics have introduced new products at the low end of their product lines. That has kept sales growing, but profit margins fell from 53.5 percent at the end of 1994 to 50.7 percent in the last quarter of 1995.<p>SIZE MATTERS
The obvious example of how heft makes a difference is <a name="NASD:SQNT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14698"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> (Nasdaq: AAPL). Its Macintosh line of personal computers, which uses an operating system that's incompatible with Microsoft Windows, controls roughly 7.3 percent of the domestic personal-computer market. That's enough to make Apple one of the world's largest computer makers, but not enough to keep software makers producing new applications for the Macintosh. Many program updates for the Macintosh get to market months after the Windows version has already been installed in users' computers. Increasingly seen as a niche player by investors, Apple finds its very survival threatened. The stock has plunged 50 percent in the past year.<p>The same problem bedevils other technology companies in less obvious ways. <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sequent</b></a> (Nasdaq: SQNT), a Beaverton, Oregon, firm that makes multiprocessor-computer systems for financial and retail transactions, is too small and specialized to challenge companies that offer customers one-stop shopping for everything from PCs 
to electronic measurement systems. "There's no way Sequent [with revenues of $535 million] can compete against the breadth of companies like <a name="NASD:BNET"></a><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a> [with $31.5 billion] and Digital [with $13.8 billion]," says Nicholas Moore, an analyst at Franklin Funds. Sequent stock has lost half its value since last summer.<p>The lesson hasn't been lost on companies in such competitive industries as networking. The big four networking companies -- <a name="NYSE:CS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10276"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Bay Networks</b> (Nasdaq: BNET), <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cabletron</b></a> (NYSE: CS), <a name="NASD:COMS"></a><b>Cisco Systems</b></a> (Nasdaq: CSCO), and <a name="NASD:LNOPF"></a><b>3Com</b> (Nasdaq: COMS) -- which have an average market cap of $12.6 billion, so dominate the market for hubs, routers, and switches that the likes of <a name="NASD:ODSI"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15698"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>LanOptics</b> (Nasdaq: LNOPF), with a mere $55 million market cap, <a name="NASD:NPIX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42199"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Optical Data</b></a> (Nasdaq: ODSI), with $400 million, and <a name="NASD:STRM"></a><b>Network Peripherals</b></a> (Nasdaq: NPIX), with $170 million, can't reach critical mass. And the big companies are determined to keep size working for them. Cisco Systems, for example, is set to complete a merger with <a name="NASD:INTC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13787"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>StrataCom</b> (Nasdaq: STRM) in June.<p>Why is size so important? It's related to the increasing pressure on margins in industry after industry in the technology sector. Size makes it possible to create manufacturing or marketing efficiencies that will let one 600-pound gorilla dominate the playing field. No company illustrates this principle better than Intel.<p><a name="NYSE:AMD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10037"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Intel</b></a> controls three-quarters of the market in microprocessors, the chips that direct computer functions (as opposed to memory chips, which merely store information). Its economies of scale let Intel pummel wanna-bes like <a name="NASD:CYRX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16430"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Advanced Micro Devices</b></a> (NYSE: AMD) and <a name="NYSE:TXN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11462"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cyrix</b></a> (Nasdaq: CYRX). For example, AMD, the number-two microprocessor maker, spends more to manufacture its chips and, with a gross profit margin of 32 percent in 1996, earns less on them. (Intel's gross margin for the first quarter of 1996 was 47.9 percent.) "AMD can't get the volume and can't get anywhere near the prices of Intel," says Bob Finch, a money manager at Aeltus in Hartford. Intel has relentlessly plowed its extra profits into new factories and into creating new products in shorter and shorter cycles. For example, as AMD was releasing its answer to the Pentium, Intel was unveiling the Pentium Pro.<p>A DIME A DOZEN
Intel's size lets it control the market for its product. Other technology companies aren't so lucky. For example, companies that make the computer chips that store memory, called DRAMs, are actually in a commodity business: Customers don't care whether they buy from Micron Technology, <a name="NASD:DELL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13193"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Texas Instruments</b></a>, or Samsung.<p>Three years of tight supply and high prices led DRAM makers around the world to build new factories. When overstocked customers slowed their purchases in the first quarter, prices dropped 50 percent, and DRAM makers like Boise, Idaho based Micron (NYSE: MU) were stuck with excess capacity. After sinking $400 million into a new $2.5 billion plant in Utah, Micron put the project on hold. Its stock has fallen 60 percent in the past seven months.<p>PCs are quickly becoming a commodity, too. Profit margins in that industry have fallen by 50 percent since 1990 as customers have realized that machines from most manufacturers are virtually identical. That left computer makers to compete on price alone.
PC companies now vary primarily in their ability to manage inventory and get their products on the shelves. Companies like <a name="NASD:GATE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16706"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dell</b></a> (Nasdaq: DELL) and <wam-co NASD:GATE>Gateway</b></a> (Nasdaq: GATE) use just-in-time delivery to gain an edge in managing inventory. But dealers and re-sellers account for 80 percent of sales in the $100 billion PC industry. Once again, size counts. Big manufacturers have the clout to win shelf space at retailers and the broad product lines that give dealers an edge in selling to their customers. It's no accident that Hewlett-Packard, the most recognized name in computer printers, has been the fastest-growing seller of PCs recently -- or that AST, a relatively narrowly focused company, has been one of the most troubled. <p><p><p>

						These are the folks who rush in where other investors fear to tread. Their ranks are swelling, and would-be entrepreneurs are grateful for it. <p>By Nick Ravo<p>Near dawn, deep in the New Hampshire woods, a half dozen lumberjack look-alikes pull up in their four-wheel-drives outside the not-as-posh-as-it-sounds Nashua Country Club.<p>Ignore the plaid shirts and work boots. "We don't wear suits, but the people who come to see us do," says Morton Goulder, a physicist-turned-investor and a longtime host of this informal gathering, which has met here irregularly for ten years and calls itself the Breakfast Club. Goulder and his friends aren't just here for bacon and eggs -- they're wealthy men prospecting for business, as their guests, many too nervous to eat, are entirely aware. These nicely dressed pilgrims are inventors and entrepreneurs in search of an angel, someone who will bestow some cash and perhaps some worldly wisdom on their embryonic businesses.<p>There are roughly 250,000 angels in the United States. ("We prefer to think of ourselves as zero-stage venture capitalists," Goulder jokes.) In 1995, they gave an estimated $10 billion to $20 billion in financing to 30,000 to 40,000 ventures -- about four times as much as the better-known venture-capital funds, according to the University of New Hampshire's Center for Venture Research.<p>Mark Conant, president and chief executive officer of Built on Technology in Derry, New Hampshire, is one of the many supplicants who have made the journey to the Breakfast Club. Last May, he met with Goulder and asked for $80,000 to help expand his fledgling company, which makes toner-dispensing units for laser printers.<p>Conant presented his business plan to Goulder and scheduled a second meeting with him and another Breakfast Clubber. He projected that investors could triple their money in three years and has found two other angels who have kicked in $10,000 each. He also has three more backers who have been with him two and a half years and who have helped him with patent applications and prototypes.<p>Firms like Built on Technology are the engines of new-job creation in the nation's economy -- the computer-software and -hardware, health-care, and consumer-product start-ups that often begin with a lone inventor's stroke of inspiration. But neither the banks nor the deep-pocketed venture-capital firms can be relied on to fund such small, vulnerable operations, especially when they need just a few thousand dollars to stay alive or get under way. Angels have rushed in to fill the gap, becoming "one of the most important and least recognized parts of the business world," says William E. Wetzel Jr., director emeritus of the Center for Venture Research and the nation's preeminent authority in the field.<p>This seed money can bear rich fruit. For example, in 1978, C. Richard Kramlich, today a managing general partner at the California-based venture-capital firm New Enterprise Associates, gave a couple of Bay Area computer geeks $22,500 out of his own pocket. The investment grew to $5 million over the next decade; the geeks were Steven Jobs and Steve Wozniak; the start-up was <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a>.<p>"I was just plain lucky as an angel," Kramlich says. Perhaps, but he got a chance to be lucky because New Enterprise Associates was just starting up at the time, and Jobs and Wozniak wanted a piddling $45,000 -- but the deal was too small. Kramlich's partners said, "Yes, it's a great company, but we are a $16 million partnership," he recalls. "So I took it myself and split the $45,000 with someone else." (Only later did Apple receive venture-capital financing.)<p>This ability to take a flier is one reason Ralph Wagner, a former owner of a chain of computer stores who now spends most of his time as an angel, believes that angels "are the seed money for most of the companies that start up in America today." Recently, Wagner put $37,500 into PureSpeech of Cambridge, Massachusetts. "It's a company that makes a voice-recognition system that recognizes the meaning of what you say contextually -- by how you say it," he says. "It hasn't gone public yet, but it will. It looks like a potential big hit."<p>Wagner has been doing this for about ten years, ever since he invested "around $100,000" in <a name="NASD:NMSS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=17026"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Natural Microsystems</b></a>, a small company in Natick, Massachusetts. It sold its first shares to the public in February 1995 and "is doing very well," he says. "But that one took a long time to pay off, so the overall annual return was probably only about 15 to 20 percent."<p>Angels make private placements of as little as $10,000 and rarely more than $500,000. In this respect, they are unlike federally regulated Small Business Investment Companies, which seldom invest less than $300,000 to $500,000, or venture-capital funds, which almost never kick in less than $1 million. While venture-capital firms are structured as eight- to ten-year limited partnerships, angels are often willing to stay invested for longer periods. Of course, this is the highest trapeze of the investing circus; there is no greater overall risk and no greater potential profit. Think <a name="NASD:BOST"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=16244"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Boston Chicken</b></a>. Think <a name="NASD:PIXR"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=46451"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pixar</b></a>.<p>Now think Vanguard Environmental.<p>What is Vanguard Environmental? Ronnie Raben knows. He's an angel in Austin, Texas, who lost $200,000 in the company, which consisted of little more than a few Waco University professors who, in response to tougher clean-water standards in Texas, had developed a new type of treatment system for businesses.<p>"It turned out the government was more flexible than we thought they would be, and companies didn't need it," says Raben, a former tax attorney, who estimates he has invested half a million dollars in about 20 deals over the past ten years. Overall, he says, he's made "over $5 million" on his original half-million-dollar stake.<p>Morton Goulder has invested several million dollars in 100 businesses over the past 20 years. He's won some and lost some. "Some of these companies do take a long time before you make any money," he says. "On the whole, though, I've probably done better than your average trust fund."<p>Of course, the prospect of a higher return means higher risk. Angels generally don't fund more than one or two budding businesses at a time, and the odds of earning huge profits on a given deal are probably one or two in ten. By comparison, venture-capital funds, which always have numerous bets on the table in order to spread the risk, hit a home run once or twice out of ten tries, fail two or three times, and are marginally successful with the remaining investments.<p>"The best angels are people who have been successful entrepreneurs themselves and feel a sense of obligation to help others get started," says Neil Rodberg, former director of operations at Technology Capital Network, a service in Cambridge, Massachusetts, that seeks to match angels with entrepreneurs. Angels often invest in areas where they have substantial experience or long-standing interest.<p>Goulder, for example, has a background in engineering. Decades ago, he worked for <a name="NYSE:RTN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11261"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Raytheon</b></a>, maker of the Patriot missile, and, in 1951, he helped start an electronics company, Sanders Associates, that was bought by <a name="NYSE:LMT"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10903"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lockheed</b></a> in 1986. The buyout netted Goulder around $10 million. Not bad for an initial investment of $5,000 that came from taking a second mortgage on his home.<p>"We sold stock to anyone who walked in the door," Goulder says. "There were no venture capitalists in those days."<p>In 1993, he invested $50,000 in <a name="NASD:SIMC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=50100"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Spacetec</b></a>, a company in Lowell, Massachusetts, that makes a three-dimensional mouse (or "spaceball") for CAD-CAM workstations used by architects and engineers. He also took a seat on the board and later invested another $70,000. "It was a good match for what I could contribute, and what they needed," he says.<p>Last December, to raise funds to enter the video-game market, the company sold shares to the public. Since then, the stock has bounced between $10 and $15 a share, and Goulder's stake -- worth a few million dollars -- has bounced right along with it.<p>Angel interest these days is concentrated in similar high-tech start-ups. Investment sectors that have gone cold include biotechnology ("The specter of FDA regulation scares some angels away," says Rodberg) and environmental control ("Too many consulting, engineering, and planning labs," says Bob Fuller, an angel in Milwaukee).<p>There are, however, many no- or  low-tech companies that benefit from angels. "We had a candy-bar manufacturer, Paris Chocolates," Rodberg recalls. "The angel tried the candy, said it was the best damn candy he had ever had, and cut a check on the spot."<p>Until recently, locating an angel was often a matter of 
hitting up a rich uncle. In the past few years, however, several nonprofit "dating services" have sprung up. The best known is the 11-year-old Technology Capital Network, which is affiliated with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and has a database of about 150 investors and 300 cash-starved companies. Its angels must have a net worth of at least $1 million or gross income of at least $200,000 for the past two years.<p>Another prominent service is the Capital Network (http://test.webtek.com/vcf/investor/tcn.htm) in Austin, Texas, which was started in 1989 by George Kozmetsky, co-founder of Teledyne. Small companies and inventors pay $450 to be listed for six months with the network; angels pay $450 for a one-year listing and receive summaries of ventures that might appeal to them. Around 80 percent of the organization's investors are angels, 15 percent are venture capitalists, and the balance are corporate investors commonly looking for a strategic alliance.<p>"The angels are usually successful entrepreneurs, but we also have doctors, lawyers, and dentists who will invest in small start-up companies, as well as some people in upper management at larger corporations and people who inherited money," says David Gerhardt, executive director of the Capital Network.<p>Several smaller nonprofit networks have also been born in recent years. Some have niches, like the computer-industryoriented Silicon Valley Venture Network (http://www. svi.org/jointventure/) in Sunnyvale, California; the year-old Environmental Capital Network (http://www.bizserve.com/ environmental.capital.network/) in Ann Arbor, Michigan; and the Investors' Circle in West Chicago, which describes itself as a socially responsible angel network.<p>"We do companies involved with health, education, energy efficiency, the environment, community development, women, and minority businesses," says Susan E. Davis, executive director of the Investors' Circle, which, since 1992, has put $16 million into 43 companies.<p>"We also have entrepreneur fairs twice a year and select a variety of different companies and show them to our investors," Davis adds.
One recipient of Investors' Circle money is Wild Planet Toys in San Francisco, a maker of educational nonviolent and nonsexist toys. "There is a real role for this type of angel," says Daniel C. P. Grossman, the company's president and chief executive officer. "In the Bay Area, most of the angels are technology-oriented and looking for <a name="NASD:NSCP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42472"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Netscape</b></a>- or <a name="NASD:YHOO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=48043"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Yahoo</b></a>-type returns. We felt that it was more important to have angels tuned into our philosophy. I sleep better at night knowing that they share our values and share our vision."
Several for-profit firms have recently sprung up on the Internet to act as matchmakers between angels and investors.
"We have designed our listings into a database format that allows investor angels to search for ventures and markets that interest them," says John Dick, president of DealFlow (http://www.dealflow.com/index.html), a World Wide Web based angel-search service. "They can download details of ventures, for five dollars each, right onto their screen, where they can then save it, print it, or E-mail directly to the entrepreneur to request a detailed business plan or other information."<p>Gerhardt warns that angels aren't always a blessing. "There are angels that can be too controlling, try to take over the business," he says. "But that can happen with any type of partnership or investment."<p>For their part, angels look for entrepreneurs who, along with a good product and a market for it, have their own money at risk. Eighties-style OPM (other people's money) deals don't fly in the 1990s. Angels also want a fast-growing company, with sales eventually increasing 15 percent a year, minimum. And they want high returns, at least 20 percent. After all, investors can get that in the stock market most years if they have a top-drawer money manager.<p>Would-be angels should recognize that, though brainy, inventors can be so obsessed with their work that they may lack the most basic social skills and business knowledge. "They can't understand why you can't call at 11 p.m. when you have a great idea," Rodberg says. "Or they don't know the difference between debt and equity."<p>He adds that the Technology Capital Network has started a "charm school" to teach entrepreneurs how to deal with investors. It will also offer classes in finance fundamentals.<p><p>
COMPANIES SEEKING ANGELS
Just to give a sense of the breadth of the deals available to angels, here are a few taken from Private Investors Network in Baltimore, 
Environmental Capital Network in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Investors' Circle in West Chicago, Illinois.<p>Clockwork Designs, Austin, Texas
Produces cost-control software for corporations. Seeking $1 million, $100,000 minimum. A two-and-a-half-year-old company with current annual sales of over $1 million, it's projected to grow to $50 million in five years. Estimated annual return from now until 2001, when the company hopes to go public: 35 percent.<p>Superior Pasta, Annapolis, Maryland
Take-out restaurant chain tentatively named Expressly Pasta. Seeking $2 million, $50,000 minimum, less for someone with investment-banking expertise. The seven-month-old company plans to develop two restaurants in the Washington, D.C., area modeled after the Boston Market chain. The first is scheduled to open this fall. Projected sales: $50 million by 2000. Estimated annual return on investment in four and a half years: 85 percent.<p>Adventure Learning Club, Vernon Hills, Illinois
Computer-education store. Seeking $500,000, $10,000 minimum investment, to open retail stores that sell lessons and time on computers. The 20-month-old company has one store open, $250,000 in annual sales, but no earnings yet. A second store is scheduled to open in September and a third next winter. The company plans to start franchising by January 1998. Aiming for a 10 percent annual return on investment over three years.<p>Cary Medical, Great Falls, Virginia
Medical-research-acquisitions company. Seeking $500,000, $50,000 minimum, to buy dormant pharmaceutical patents from the National Institutes of Health's Office of Technology Transfer. The 18-month-old company has three pending applications to license patents, including one for gossypol acetate, an old drug (used as an oral male contraceptive in China) that may 
be useful for treating breast cancer. The company expects to have nine or ten applications approved within three years. Projects an initial investment will grow 20 to 30 times if the company goes public or is bought by a large pharmaceutical corporation.<p>The Greener Cleaner, Chicago
Environmentally safe, chemical-free alternative to dry cleaning. Seeking $2 million, $50,000 minimum if part 
of a group investment totaling $500,000. The company operates one store and will soon open a second. Projects sales of $267,000 this year, up from $150,000 last year, but no earnings yet. Hopes for an annual return on investment of 47 percent over seven years.<p><p>
EARNING YOUR WINGS
How to Become an Angel<p>Q: How much money do I need?
A: Lots. You should be what the Securities and Exchange Commission calls "an accredited investor." That means having a net worth of $1 million or more, excluding your home, or earning more than $200,000 ($300,000 if investing as a married couple) in each of the past two years and expecting to do so again this year. Most angel networks require that their investors be accredited. Most legitimate entrepreneurs avoid the unaccredited or try to keep their number to a minimum. "This isn't for widows and orphans," says Jeffrey E. Sohl, director of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire's Whittemore School of Business.<p>How much should I invest?
No single investment should ever take more than 10 percent 
of your investment assets. Investing in start-ups is a high-risk proposition, with the odds of hitting a home run somewhere around 10 percent, which is right up there with other long shots like buying pork-belly futures. A prudent angel might take the 10 percent of his investment portfolio allotted to start-ups and invest in ten separate deals. That works out to about 1 percent of your portfolio per deal, which, if you have $1 million in investment assets, will get you into ten companies for $10,000 each, the minimum investment you are likely to find. Many companies require $25,000 to $50,000 minimums.<p>What kind of return should I expect?
Out of ten investments, according to David Gerhardt of the Capital Network in Austin, Texas, probably three or four deals will fail, four or five will break even, and one will make substantial money -- perhaps 300 percent in three or four years (or an annual return of about 40 percent). Perhaps much more, if the company goes public or is bought.<p>How hard is it to get my money back?
That depends on the deal's terms and conditions, or T&C. The entrepreneur may decide to buy back the angels' shares at a mutually agreeable price. Sometimes, the particulars of a buyback -- the price and timetable -- are detailed in advance in the T&C. The price is generally based on the growth and value of the company. A buyback can be a good security blanket for an investor, but it can also force a company to spend too much time raising cash when it should be focusing on growth. There are, of course, companies that don't attract suitors and that aren't strong enough to go public, and for which a buyback isn't practicable. These are called the "living dead," and there are firms that specialize in buying their shares. At a discount.<p>Is the investment insured or guaranteed?
No. A buyback option written into the T&C is as close as you will get to a guarantee. Angel investments can also be structured as debt, which can be converted to equity if the company succeeds. <p>What do I get instead of a stock certificate?
A contract stating how many shares (or, in some cases, warrants, which are similar to stock options) you own in the company and their value. An investor making a $10,000 minimum investment, say, might buy 10,000 shares at a dollar a share. This would also be called one unit -- the number of shares a minimum investment buys.<p>How do I track my investment?
Financial reports, such as income statements, should be, but often aren't, sent out quarterly. These reveal the company's sales and earnings but not the approximate value of your shares if the company were sold or offered to the public. It is not difficult, however, to learn from bankers and analysts in your company's industry, or even from the company officials, what similar businesses sell for (generally, it's a multiple of annual earnings or sales). With an estimated value of the company, simple math will tell you what your shares might be worth.<p>Where do I find a company in need of an angel?
If you have enough money to be an angel, you probably mingle with others who know about these kinds of deals. Lawyers and accountants are good sources, and state business-development offices can be useful. You might also try the venture-capital networks. Forget the classified ads in newspapers under "Capital Wanted" or "Investment Opportunities."<p>Do I need a lawyer?
Yes. Seek someone who knows about early-stage equity investing. "Otherwise, the clock is running while the lawyer is learning," Sohl says.<p>Do I need financial advisers to peruse business plans?
Probably not. But if you don't fully understand the investment, it's not for you, at least not as the sole or lead investor. "A good way to start is to partner with some other investors, one of whom is the lead investor," Sohl says. "Angels tend to invest as a group and in areas they know something about."<p>Who does the due diligence?
You or your lead partner.<p>What kind of relationship will I have with the owner of 
the company?
Close. Very close. "You should be able to pick up the phone 
at any time and call him and get straight answers," Sohl says.<p>Should I ask for a seat on the board?
Maybe. If you're investing more than the minimum and more than most of the others, a seat is a reasonable request, as it is if you bring some unusual expertise to the venture. Keep in mind, though, that not every investor can be on the board, and if you're part of a group, only the lead investor should seek a seat. "There is no magic number for getting on a board," Gerhardt says. "It all depends on the company's size, the size of the board, the number of investors, and your contribution." <p><p><p>

						SELF STUDY GUIDES
Chicago Mercantile Exchange
Free<p>AN INTRODUCTION TO FUTURES AND OPTIONS
Chicago Mercantile Exchange 
$10<p>OPTION TRADING SERIES
Chicago Board of Trade
Free<p>HOW TO OPTIMIZE YOUR STOCK PORTFOLIO WITH OPTIONS
The Options Industry Council
Free<p>By Ted C. Fishman<p>The temptation to play the passive investor is great. Today's conventional wisdom says that markets do better than individual stocks and that buying lots of different stocks and holding them forever beats trading. Plus there's an entire mutual-fund industry that promises to make everyone's investment decisions for them.<p>That's fine for most people most of the time, but let's say you want to get active. First you need some smarts -- and not merely about markets, but about trading them. Adding futures and options to your portfolio will teach you more about trading than a lifetime of buying and holding. It's fun, too, pitting yourself against the major economic trends. (Think the dollar's heading up? The bond market sideways?) What's more, introducing a small speculative element can fine-tune a portfolio by adding either risk -- and the chance for higher returns -- or stability, which is important in a volatile market.<p>Still, because futures and options have a reputation of burning investors, it's smartest not to start buying them blindly -- or from the next cold-calling futures broker. So, where to turn for some learning? Try the temples of speculative investment, the nation's top futures and options exchanges. The Chicago Mercantile Exchange and the Chicago Board of Trade offer a wide range of educational materials aimed at retail customers and professional brokers.<p>The Merc, perhaps the nation's most aggressively marketed exchange, produces the most approachable materials for beginners, much of it available for free (312-930-8210). The Merc's Self Study Guides on livestock futures and options, for example, are concise yet thorough introductions to the mechanics of trading agricultural contracts. They cover much of the same material found in the basic futures texts, and they're particularly good at explaining the most vexing strategy in trading, the short play. Other valuable materials from the Merc cover its currency and bond markets. The best aid, however, may be the manual An Introduction to Futures and Options ($10, but free for schools). It contains ten chapters (with quizzes), which are pitched at beginners, so you'll learn to tell a future from an option and a put from a call. More-advanced concepts, such as hedging and arbitrage, are also made comprehensible.<p>The Merc's crosstown rival, the Chicago Board of Trade, has its own free series of magazine-style brochures, including the Option Trading Series (800-THE-CBOT). These works assume that readers have a working vocabulary when it comes to futures and options, so they're a good follow-up to the Merc's begin-ner guides. A typical CBOT work is the Financial Option Strategies Menu, with approaches for various risk profiles, from the conservative hedger who wants to reduce portfolio risk to the crapshooter willing to take a flier.<p>Futures and options trading is often simplistically depicted as gambling. It's not. In fact, few financial instruments are more varied or can be fine-tuned more readily to meet specific investment objectives. In forging a bond-trading strategy, an investor has thousands of combinations of futures, puts, and calls of varying prices and expirations to choose from. The CBOT booklet warms up with a few straightforward, easily managed scenarios -- such as the long straddle, in which puts and calls are bought together -- and then moves on to more involved combos.<p>Don't forget to learn the math: Judging risks requires it. This is where one of the Board of Trade's booklets, Trading Ag Option Volatility, can help. It presents a step-by-step introduction to the mathematical measures of option value, such as vega (the sensitivity of option prices to changes in market volatility) and delta (the measure of how option prices change in relation to changes in their underlying contracts). It also suggests approaches on how to base trades on market volatility as well as price.<p>One caveat: Avoid the video called How to Optimize Your Stock Portfolio With Options, produced by the Options Industry Council. To the council's earlier, stilted production, The Options Tool, new material on using stock options to boost returns on equities has been added. Oversimplification is the chief fault here. Selling call options against stock, for example, is portrayed as a low-risk hedging strategy, when in fact it's the practical equivalent of selling puts outright -- the riskiest strategy of all. That's a long-standing misrepresentation of how options work. It should be struck for good. <p><p><p><p>

						Seven Stocks to turn a shortage of wheat and corn into a bumper crop <p>By Jonathan Butler<p>Commodity traders who in late 1994 bet that falling supplies and growing demand would send grain prices soaring are now sitting on a silo of profits. During the 12 months ended March 1996, the average price for a bushel of corn rose more than 66 percent, to a record high of $4.09, and wheat jumped almost 54 percent.<p>Thank the weather and government policy for a good part of those returns. In response to 1994's record-setting corn crop, Uncle Sam required farmers to idle 7.5 percent of their land, while erratic weather helped cut yields by 30 percent. As a result, domestic inventories are at an all-time low of 5 percent of expected consumption, and global inventories are at a 60-year nadir.<p>But there's more driving the global grain markets than one of those periodic, temporary mismatches of supply and demand that can send the price of a bushel climbing toward the sky faster than an Iowa cornstalk in July. The long-term demand for grain is soaring as people in the developing world eat more rice, wheat, and corn, and put more grain-fed chicken, pork, and beef on their tables. Grain exports to China alone rose 175 percent last year, and China is now the world's leading consumer of red meat. Experts project that world demand for grain will grow 3 percent annually. Three percent may not seem like very fast growth, but consider that a small increase in demand -- such as the official Chinese goal of doubling per capita egg consumption from 100 to 200 eggs a year by 2000 -- would consume the entire current grain crop of Australia, one of the world's leading producers. U.S. agricultural exports have already jumped from $40 billion in 1994 to $48 billion in 1995 and should reach $60 billion in 1996.<p>Investors who shy away from the risks of the volatile commodity markets don't have to sit on the sidelines while this trend unfolds. Although it's hard to use the stock market to play the price of grain directly, the growing global demand for food will lead to a greater need for seed, fertilizer, farm equipment, and crop insurance -- and companies producing those products are well represented on U.S. equity markets. Although some grain-related stocks have already risen, the trends that sparked this run-up should bolster them through the end of the decade.<p>SEED COMPANIES. The big news in corn -- the grain with the largest share of the global market -- is Bt seed. This genetically engineered product is resistant to the European corn borer, an insect that damages up to $1 billion worth of U.S. crops a year. Annual sales of Bt seed in North America could hit $2 billion by the year 2000 and $6 billion by 2005.<p>San Diego based <a name="NASD:MYCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14178"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mycogen</b></a> (Nasdaq: MYCO) is a pioneer in developing Bt seed, and its patent is specific enough to put it out in front, even though giants like Monsanto are also working on Bt patents, says Jim McCamant, editor of AgBiotech Stock Letter in Berkeley, California. Mycogen acquired DowElanco's United AgriSeeds business in March, making it the third-largest corn-seed producer in the U.S., with a 5 percent to 6 percent market share. Analysts expect earnings to grow by 20 percent annually for the next five years. At $16 a share, the stock is off its 12-month high of $20. McCamant recommends buying it below $18.<p><a name="NASD:SEEDB"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13152"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Dekalb Genetics</b></a> (Nasdaq: SEEDB), based in Dekalb, Illinois, is the number-two corn-seed producer and just got a patent for its own Bt product. Dekalb has revenues of about $320 million and only 10 percent of the market, but its small size actually makes it a better investment play than Pioneer Hi-Bred International in Des Moines, Iowa, which owns 45 percent of the market. Every tenth-of-a-percent gain in market share translates into additional earnings of nine cents a share for Dekalb versus only two cents for Pioneer. In the past two years, Dekalb has increased its share by two percentage points; it plans to add five more by 2000. At about $70 a share, Dekalb's stock trades at 32 times 12-month trailing earnings. Even though analysts project growth for the company of 40 percent in 1996 and roughly 20 percent in 1997, they advise buying the stock on dips. <p>FERTILIZERS. All those seeds will require a lot of fertilizer if they're ever going to amount to anything -- which is very good news for the U.S., the world's largest fertilizer exporter. The three types of fertilizers are nitrogen, phosphate, and potash, and phosphate producers stand to gain the most, because a lack of phosphate has resulted in weak crop yields in China and the former Soviet Union. "The phosphate industry, long characterized as the ugly stepsister, soon will climb out of her pumpkin," says Robert Zwerneman, director of market research at Freeport McMoran Resource Partners, one of the world's leading producers of fertilizer. Phosphate prices fell roughly 20 percent in March, creating a buying opportunity in the stocks.<p>The purest phosphate play, Freeport McMoran, is too pricey, but its joint-venture partner, <a name="NYSE:IGL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10766"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>IMC Global</b></a> (NYSE: IGL), is a cheap alternative, says Keith Chan of New Vernon Associates, a chemical-research firm in Parsippany, New Jersey. IMC Global, based in Northbrook, Illinois, manages the world's lowest-cost phosphate producer, IMC-Agrico, which is a bargain based on the ratio of its stock price to cash flow (6.4 times versus 6.8 for the industry) -- one of the best ways to value such a company. Its stock could rise to $50, according to analysts at J. P. Morgan.<p>In the more competitive nitrogen market, <a name="NYSE:FRM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10576"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First Mississippi</b></a> (NYSE: FRM) is not only cheap but relatively less risky because only 37 percent of its business is making fertilizer. "The chemicals side of the business gives a safety net to the seasonal ups and downs of fertilizers," says Chan. Analysts agree the stock has an intrinsic value of about $32.<p>FARM MACHINERY. From planting to harvesting, farmers need more machinery to increase grain supplies. "U.S. machinery sales are highly correlated with acreage and the value of exports," says Barry Bannister, an analyst at S. G. Warburg in New York. <a name="NYSE:DE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10444"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Deere & Co.</b></a> (NYSE: DE), based in Moline, Illinois, and <a name="NYSE:CSE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=42141"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Case</b></a> (NYSE: CSE), in Racine, Wisconsin, are the world's biggest producers: In 1995, they respectively sold some $5.3 billion and $2.4 billion worth of farm equipment.<p>Deere's stock has doubled since the start of 1995 and trades at 15 times 12-month trailing earnings. Analysts estimate earnings will rise 16 percent in 1996. Case's stock trades at 11 times trailing earnings. Both issues are near all-time highs and should be bought on weakness, says Bannister: "Near term, the machinery companies may be overbought, but longer term we like them because we think that we have another five or ten years before acreage, exports, and U.S. market share are maxed out."<p>CROP INSURANCE. To counter nature's whims, farmers buy Multi-Peril Crop Insurance. One pure play is <a name="NYSE:AIF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41890"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Acceptance Insurance</b></a> (NYSE: AIF) in Omaha. It makes money by increasing premiums as grain prices rise and from fees paid by the government to compensate crop insurers for their risk. "If the unit count stays constant and the price increases, then total volume and your fee keep going up, all without doing any more work," says William Gerber, head of investor relations at Acceptance. Its stock trades at 53 times trailing earnings (because of a big dip in earnings in 1995), but at only 8.8 times analysts' 1996 earnings estimate of $1.69 a share, up from 28 cents a share in 1995. <p><p><p><p>

						Does Time cut the risk of owning stocks? No, says a Nobel-winning Economist. <p>By Jim Jubak<p>The common wisdom is that market risk decreases if an investor holds stocks for the long term. But Paul A. Samuelson, the 1970 winner of the Nobel Prize for economics, disagrees. In articles stretching back to the early 1970s, he says, "I have debunked the usual arguments for the so-called long-term case for equities." Normally, investing in stocks will be the best strategy, says Samuelson, but the common wisdom makes it all too easy to become complacent about risk.<p>The basic argument for holding equities long term has two parts. First, although a stock investor can lose money in any one year, the historical record, as calculated by Ibbotson Associates, shows that since 1926 no 15-year period has produced a loss. Ergo, holding for the long term reduces risk. Second, statistics show that a coin flip has a 50 percent chance of producing either heads or tails. A short run of flips -- say, ten -- can result in this 50-50 outcome or an aberration, such as ten heads. As the number of flips rises, the distribution comes closer to 50-50. Hence, an investor who stays in the market long enough has a statistical guarantee of making the long-term average annual return: 10.5 percent, according to Ibbotson. <p>Neither part is true, according to  Samuelson, professor emeritus of economics at MIT. "Risk, properly measured, does not go to zero over long periods," he says.<p>Consider the cost of insuring against loss in the shipping industry. Insurers know that most ships don't sink, and they collect precise numbers on the chances of a ship's going down. But a policy's cost doesn't drop when a shipowner buys insurance for a longer period. Instead, rates rise to cover the greater uncertainty of a longer time frame.<p>That's partly because the world could change so that the old probabilities of a ship's sinking are obsolete. That increased uncertainty should worry investors more than underwriters. Solid financial data is available for no more than the past 100 years, and the oft cited numbers from Ibbotson date back to 1926. Is that period representative of the entire history and future of the markets?<p>Insurance premiums -- and market risk -- also rise as time increases because, statistically, "events in these arenas are not equivalent to coin tosses," says Samuelson. A coin toss has only two outcomes of equal magnitude. The market not only rises and falls but can swing by 20 or 100 points. A few outcomes are catastrophic, such as the crash of 1929. The chance of such a fiasco is small -- 
but it doesn't fall to zero over time. <p>What's an investor to do? "Most of the time, the investor who blithely ignores risk and buys lots of stock will fare better than the person who doesn't," says Samuelson. But never 100 times out of 100. That's why investors diversify or otherwise insure themselves against catastrophe. It will cost them in performance, but it assures that if the ship sinks, they won't go down with it.<p><p><p>

						Studying the financials can reveal a stock about to stumble<p>By Clint Willis<p>Last February 26, shares of <a name="NASD:BSST"></a><b>Baby Superstore</b> fell 29 percent when the fast-growing retailer alerted analysts that it would miss its targets for the year just ended. The culprit, the company said, was a problem in the financial report it had issued in November. The company had understated expenses and overstated its cash on hand. When it finally reported results for the 12 months ended January 1996, earnings (at $11.7 million) trailed Wall Street's hopes by about 14 percent.<p>Wall Street analysts were blindsided by the announcement. Six of the eight who covered the stock had recommended it as a buy in January. But the trouble at Baby Superstore (Nasdaq: BSST) shouldn't have been a total surprise. A study of the public financial documents would have shown a company under pressure: As competition forced Baby Superstore to lower prices, its gross profit margins fell, from 36.8 percent in January 1991 to 28.2 percent in January 1996. <p>In a market where investors seem to think that every stock is destined to hit a new high tomorrow, it's hard for analysts and individual investors to remain focused on the figures that can signal potential trouble at a company. "When stock prices are rising, people don't question things as much as they ordinarily would," says Jack Ciesielski, owner of the Analysts' Accounting Observer, a Baltimore advisory service. "Investors aren't as diligent as they were two years ago__and as a result, there are going to be some big disappointments," says Howard Schilit, author of Financial Shenanigans. In the last quarter of 1995 and the first quarter of 1996, the stocks of companies such as <a name="NYSE:KM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10830"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kmart</b></a>, <a name="NYSE:CNF"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10393"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Consolidated Freightways</b></a>, <a name="NASD:CRUS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12986"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cirrus Logic</b></a>, <a name="NASD:JUNO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13877"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Juno Lighting</b></a>, <a name="NASD:MTEL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14149"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Mobile Telecommunications Technologies</b></a>, <a name="NASD:PSIX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=43405"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>PSI Net</b></a>, System Software Associates, and <a name="AMEX:THP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14886"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Thermo Power</b></a> have all surprised Wall Street by reporting disappointing earnings, and all their stocks have declined.<p>As investors bid up prices for companies that promise above-average growth, the risk increases. "Some corporate managers feel they have to deliver the right numbers," says Hugh Evans, an analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore. "It's a very dangerous situation." 
It doesn't take an accounting degree to identify when corporate earnings are likely to slip. Getting access to the relevant numbers from a company's annual 10-Ks and quarterly 10-Qs (the more detailed versions of the familiar annual and quarterly corporate reports) is easy: Just call the company's investor-relations oce. The trick lies in knowing which numbers to study and how to put them together. We enlisted 20 financial analysts to guide the way; they suggested zeroing in on five areas. <p>Inventories. A rising inventory (the supply of unsold goods that a company keeps on hand to fill customer orders) can be a positive sign. It could mean a company is planning to meet growing customer demand for its products. But a growing mountain of goods in the warehouse could also signal that a company can't sell its products. Take <a name="NASD:AAPL"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12644"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Apple Computer</b></a> (Nasdaq: AAPL). In September 1994, the company built up inventory in expectation of brisk sales for the Christmas season. But computer stockpiles remained sky-high at the end of December__and continued to rise in 1995. Price slashing by competitors had cut into Apple's sales, and many potential Apple buyers were waiting to check out computers with the Windows 95 operating system. Apple's stock peaked on June 21, 1995, at $49.375; it recently traded at $23. <p>To tell the difference between a company with healthy inventory growth and one that's setting the stage for a gigantic garage sale, track a company's inventory-to-sales ratio. Find the inventory figures on the 10-Q's consolidated balance sheets and the sales figures on the income statement. To calculate the ratio, divide the value of the company's inventory by the dollar amount of its sales for the quarter. Do the same for the comparable quarter of the previous year. An acceptable inventory-to-sales ratio varies across industries, but by comparing the ratio from year to year, an investor can spot a company with a growing burden of unsold merchandise. Apple was clearly in trouble last year: Its inventory-to-sales ratio was higher than those of its rivals__and rising fast. 
It climbed from 68 percent at the end of 1994 to 81 percent on June 30, 1995, just before the stock began its slide. <p>Accounts receivable. Receivables, found on the balance sheets, represent the money a company is owed for products or services it has sold. "If a company's accounts receivable are growing faster than sales, there's probably a down quarter ahead," says David Tice, a Dallas money manager who runs the Prudent Bear Fund. It's easy to see why. If receivables have grown 50 percent from the previous quarter and sales only 5 percent, that might suggest a company is so anxious to sell its goods that it's extending the deadlines for receiving payment in order to keep its product moving out the door. Customers who may be buying more than they really need take a long time to reorder. Even worse, the firm might be recording sales when there's still a chance customers will return their purchases for refunds.<p>In late 1994, <a name="NASD:APCC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=12609"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Power Conversion</b></a> (Nasdaq: APCC), a maker of backup PC power supplies, clearly suffered from the first problem. Its sales had climbed 51 percent in 1994, but receivables had risen 81 percent, a sign that in the face of rivals like <a name="NYSE:HWP"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10723"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Hewlett-Packard</b></a>, American Power Conversion was offering customers more-lenient payment schedules. The stock fell from its peak of $30 in March 1994 to $10.625 in April 1996 <p>Cash flow. This figure shows the net flow of real money into or out of the firm. Unlike earnings or profits, cash flow factors out the effects of paper debits (such as depreciation) that get charged against earnings but don't require the company to spend actual dollars. It also reflects the costs of building a new plant or buying equipment at the time of the expenditure rather than charging them against future earnings. Cash flow shows if a company is generating dollars that can be used for building the business or if it's devouring funds that must be raised from outside sources. <p>Compare cash flow from operations, which appears on the 10-K and 10-Q statements of cash flow, to net income at the bottom of the income statement. "If a company's net income is rising but its cash flow is falling, you don't want to invest in it," Schilit says. If the firm isn't increasing cash flow, it will eventually have trouble financing growth.<p><a name="NASD:TLXN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14901"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Telxon</b></a> (Nasdaq: TLXN), which makes portable and interactive computer systems, reported profits of $7 million for the second half of 1995, but cash flow from operations was negative $56 million. A closer look reveals that Telxon was piling up inventory and receivables. "If the cash-flow problem persists, they'll need an infusion from other sources," says Schilit.<p>Expenses. Accounting rules give companies the choice of 
expensing a cost (charging it against this year's profits) or capitalizing it (charging it against future profits). Expenses are recorded on the income statement. Capitalizing costs that should be expensed can be seductive. Say a company spends $1 million in 1996 on direct mail to find subscribers to its on-line service. It could record that $1 million as an expense and charge it all against current earnings, or it could argue that this $1 million should be capitalized, since it was spent to acquire future revenue. Spreading the $1 million over a number of years increases current earnings.<p><a name="NASD:BARE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15449"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Barefoot</b></a> (Nasdaq: BARE), a lawn-care company in Worthington, Ohio, with $93.4 million in 1995 sales, capitalized its direct-mail expenses until recently. Reportedly after discussions with the SEC, Barefoot changed its accounting methods this year to record those expenses as current costs. That added over $3 million to 1995 costs, reducing the firm's profit from 96 cents a share to 84 cents. The stock recently traded at $10, off a high of $15 last August.<p>Profit margins. Profit margins reveal how much money the company makes on a dollar of sales. Profit margins can be stated in many ways. Gross profit, for example, is total sales minus the cost of goods sold, while net profit is sales minus the cost of goods sold, general and administrative costs, interest, and taxes.
Falling gross margins are often bad. <a name="NYSE:RBD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11294"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Rubbermaid</b></a> (NYSE: RBD), a maker of plastic and rubber products, saw its gross margin drop (from 34 percent in late 1993 to 29 percent in 1995) as the cost of resins it used rose. The stock fell from $37.125 in late 1993 to $27.75 recently.<p>When gross profits fall, net profits commonly go with them. When they don't, look closer. A rising gross margin and falling net margin may even be a positive sign, indicating that a company is investing in the future by adding to general and administrative costs in order to build a sales force. But investors should be wary when the gross margin is falling and the net is rising. "There are a lot more costs that go into net profit__such as taxes and research-and-development costs__that they can play with to make the net look good," says Tice. <p>In short, the bottom line on a company's income statement__the one that reports its profits__isn't always the final word on a company's prospects. Investors who remember that fact stand a good chance of being on the sidelines the next time Wall Street takes a company out back and shoots it for missing an earnings estimate.<p><p><p>

						Why add short selling to your repertoire? Because bad news knows what it's talking about.<p>By Susan Lee<p>Every month, the wall street Journal, The New York Times, and Barron's carry articles reporting on many of the stocks in which sizable short positions are held. So what?, you say. Well, according to a recent academic study, if you had owned some of the companies so listed and then sold them when they appeared on the list, you would have done yourself a favor. Stocks that were heavily shorted underperformed the market on a risk-adjusted basis.<p>Paul Asquith and Lisa Meulbroek investigated short selling between 1976 and 1993. (Reminder: Short selling describes the funny practice of borrowing a stock, selling it, waiting for its price to go down, and then purchasing it to "pay back" the lender; the profit comes in the spread between the price at which it's sold and the price at which it's bought back.) Asquith and Meulbroek's paper "An Empirical Investigation of Short Interest," released in 1995, argues that there is a strong negative relationship between the amount of short selling in a stock and the stock's subsequent performance. Simply put, stocks that attract short-sellers are more likely to go down than up.<p>Moreover, in the 18-year period Asquith and Meulbroek observed, returns were even more negative for firms that were heavily shorted for more than a month, both for the time the stocks were shorted and for the following two years.<p>This is an interesting result.<p>First, because it flies in the face of the conventional wisdom that short sales are a bullish--not bearish--indicator because they indicate future demand; that is, short-sellers must eventually buy shares to replace their borrowed shares in order to cover their positions. Second, because it proves what some people have been saying all along--that short-sellers really do know what they're doing.<p>Third, and most important, this study gives credence to the commonsense idea that since brokers and analysts pay much more attention to reasons for buying stocks than for selling, there is more positive than negative news. Thus, stocks about which there is negative information represent an inefficient part of the market, making it easier to find profitable opportunities on the short side than on the long.<p>Academic theories aside, however, practice shows that there isn't much interest in short selling. In March of this year, for example, reported short sales on the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, and the Nasdaq were at a near record high of three billion shares, but that figure represents only a fraction of the 227 billion shares held long.<p>So why don't more investors sell stocks short?<p>First, regulations governing short selling make it more difficult than buying long. There is something called the uptick (or plus tick) rule, which decrees that a short sale can occur only at a price above the last sale price. There's also a zero-tick rule, which says that a short sale can occur at a price equal to the last sale price, but only if the last price change was positive. In other words, you can't sell short if your target stock is going down. Then, there are so-called prudent-investor rules that prohibit big institutional investors, like public pension plans, from selling short altogether.<p>Second, short selling is more expensive than buying long. Money from a short sale is not available to the seller but is escrowed as collateral for the owner of the borrowed shares. (Although large short-sellers may receive interest payments, called rebates, on the sale proceeds, small investors usually do not.) In addition to the proceeds that stay as collateral, short-sellers must deposit 50 percent of the market value of the shorted shares as a margin requirement. If the price of the stock goes up, the short-seller will get a margin call and must deposit more funds.<p>Also, short-sellers must reimburse the owner of the stock for any dividends that accrue during the period the shares are borrowed. What's more, there is a tax penalty on success. Even if the short position is held for more than a year, profits are subject to the short-term capital-gains tax, which can be more than 11 percent higher than the long-term capital-gains rate.<p>Third, short selling is considered dangerous. When you take a long position in a stock, the greatest risk is that it will fall to zero and you will lose all the money you paid. Your worst loss is known and bounded. When you take a short position, however, the greatest risk is that the price of the stock will rise forever--meaning there is, theoretically at least, no limit on your loss.<p>There is also a danger, especially in a rising market, that at some point you will be unable to meet a margin call and have to purchase your stocks at a loss, before your short position yields a profit. What's more, shorts are vulnerable to a squeeze--a deliberate attempt by investors who are long in the company to reduce the lendable supply of shares by madly buying them and demanding delivery. This pushes up the price and forces the unfortunate short into the market to buy shares at the higher price.<p>And finally, short selling has an image problem. A bad image problem. After all, short-sellers are hoping for failure and misfortune. This leads to the somewhat hysterical charge that shorts are betting against America.<p>Sounds scary and unsavory, huh? Nonetheless, there are good reasons to sell short.<p>The interesting thing about selling short is that you can do well by doing good. A short-seller does well by investing in an inefficient part of the market--where negative information is not widely and rapidly known--and makes money by exploiting this inefficiency.<p>And you can do good because your short sale conveys negative information and thus makes pricing more efficient. Consider: All opinions should be reflected in prices. But when optimists buy and pessimists do nothing, there is an upward bias on prices. When pessimists sell, that upward bias is corrected.<p>Just as important, short selling can be used to control risk. If your portfolio is 100 percent long, you are totally exposed to the risk inherent in a falling market. If, however, some part of your portfolio is in short positions--stocks that will make money for you when the market falls--you have hedged your market risk. If the market goes up, however, you will make money on your long positions but lose money on your shorts.<p>This is, in fact, the classic hedge-fund strategy discovered independently and at about the same time by Robert Wilson and A. W. Jones. Back in the late 1950s, Wilson wanted an approach that would allow him to leverage without being forced to sell at a bad moment. "The worst time to sell is when the market is declining," he says. "I wanted to buy shares on margin, sure, but I didn't want my holdings destroyed in a market crash."<p>His solution was to create a portfolio of long and short positions. Then, if his longs collapsed, the profits on his short position would meet his margin calls and vice versa. Wilson, though known as a legendary short-seller, was always net long in his portfolio. He picked strong growth stocks for his long positions and vulnerable companies for his shorts.<p>Another reasonable motive for short selling is that--difficult though it is to believe after the last several years--the stock market does go down. And when it does, the weak sisters implode. Bill McGarr of the McGarr Fund, for example, runs a 100 percent short portfolio. Currently, he's pessimistic on the most popular investment idea of 1995--technology stocks. "We invest in excess," he says. "Technology has been bid up the most, and it will be bid down the most."<p>Convinced? Well, before you rush out to open a margin account (the only kind of account in which you can sell stocks short), here are some ploys to keep you out of deep water.<p>*Even though a margin account gives you the opportunity to leverage, don't do it. McGarr, for instance, tries to keep the value of his shorts equal to the amount of equity in his partnership. (Keeping your account in balance also avoids what almost all short-sellers agree is a hideous experience--getting a margin call from your broker.)<p>*Limit your losses to a set percentage of your portfolio. Typically, when a particular position does more than 2 to 3 percent worth of damage, short-sellers reduce that position pronto.<p>*Be prepared to close your position if there is a change in the fundamentals on which that position was based. A dramatic surprise calls for dramatic action.<p>*Confine your shorts to large-capitalization, liquid stocks to avoid getting short-squeezed.<p>*Forget about timing. The uptick and zero-tick rules prohibit shorting a falling stock, so resign yourself to being early in your strategy.<p>All this takes discipline and vigilance. If you doubt your capacity in these areas, then you should consider having the short side of your portfolio run by a professional.<p>Of course, you don't have to short individual stocks. If you like the longs in your portfolio but are nervous about the overall market, you could, for example, short a stock-market-index fund by selling call options.<p>You can also short mutual funds. Yes, mutual funds. Currently, there are two opportunities. Fidelity allows short selling against some of its Select Portfolio funds, such as American Gold, Automotive, Biotechnology, Energy, Environmental Services, Food and Agriculture, Health Care, Medical <p>Delivery, Precious Metals and Minerals, Regional Banks, Telecommunications, and Utilities Growth. And Jack White & Co., a broker-dealer, offers short selling on about 20 mutual funds, including the <a name="FUND:JANSX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/JANSX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Janus Fund</b></a> and the Founders funds.<p>One final note. Just because a particular stock has lots of short interest doesn't necessarily mean adios for the company. Presstek, a printing-process company, has been a fave with the shorts. Indeed, it has been heavily shorted for the past three years, during which time it has gone from about $8.50 a share in June 1993 to $108 as of April 1 this year. Adios, shorts.<p>------------------------------

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> GAUGING THE PRICE OF GROWTH <p>Companies with speedy earnings increases often can't go the distance <p> By Jonathan Butler  May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> GAUGING THE PRICE OF GROWTH <p>Companies with speedy earnings increases often can't go the distance <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> Which of these two  growth stocks is a better investment: drug giant <a name="NYSE:PFE"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11175"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Pfizer</b></a> or <a name="NASD:CSCO"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=13494"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Cisco Systems</b></a>, a maker of hardware that supports the Internet?  <p> The decision is a no-brainer, according to one time-honored Wall Street rule of thumb. When it comes to calculating a reasonable price for a growth stock, the rule goes, look for a stock that's trading at a price-to-earnings ratio lower than the rate of growth in the company's earnings. Pfizer recently traded at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27 times earnings per share, but the company's earnings grew just 18 percent in 1995. So the stock is selling at a premium of roughly 50 percent to its earnings growth rate. Cisco showed a much higher price-to-earnings ratio of 41, but the computer company's earnings rose 45 percent last year. It's reasonably priced for a stock growing so spectacularly. Buy Cisco, shun Pfizer. What could be simpler?   <p> Nothing, and that's exactly the problem. When it comes to determining the value of fast-growing, high-p/e stocks, the traditional wisdom can lead investors astray by steering them into high-risk stocks and away from dependable growers. "The rule of thumb becomes  particularly irrational at higher rates" of growth, says Chris Davis, co-manager of the <a name="FUND:NYVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/NYVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Davis New York Venture Fund</b></a> and <a name="FUND:SLASX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SLASX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Selected American Shares</b></a>.   <p> In trying to figure out if a stock is a bargain or an overpriced bauble, most investors rightly start with the p/e ratio and the rate of earnings growth. The p/e ratio shows how much the market is willing to pay for one dollar of past earnings. (The ratiois calculated by dividing the 12 months' trailing earnings per share into the current stock price.)  <p> Not all stocks trade at the same p/e ratio, however, because the market anticipates growth, too. Two stocks with earnings of one dollar per share over the past 12 months might trade at p/e ratios of 12 and 20, respectively, because the market is expecting the second company to increase earnings much faster than the first. In general, the faster the earnings growth, the more investors are willing to pay for a stock.  <p> The tough question is, how much more is too much?  <p> It's impossible to provide an answer without understanding why a share of stock is worth anything at all. To some investors, a stock certificate is simply a lottery ticket, says Davis. As long as some other investor might be willing to pay more tomorrow, the true worth of a share never troubles them.  <p> But stock certificates represent an ownership stake in a real business. The value of that stake depends on many factorsÐhow well the managers keep costs under control, how well they anticipate demand, and more. But to an investor in a growth company, nothing is more important than the company's ability to increase earnings over the long term. "The question that no one asks is how long the current growth rate is sustainable," says Davis.  <p> Imagine that instead of buying a share of stock an investor pays $1 million for a business that produces earnings of $33,333 a year. The investor is paying a p/e ratio of 30 for that income. <p> Is this a wise investment? That depends on how fast the business can increase its earnings and how long it can sustain them. To evaluate this deal, investors should also compare it to what could be earned by putting the money into other businesses or a low-risk security such as a government bond. And because a dollar next year is worth less than a dollar today, the investor must also adjust these estimates to reflect inflation.  <p> It's possible to apply this thinking to a share of stock. Consider a $30 stock with earnings of one dollar a share and a growth rate of 30 percent a year. In unadjusted terms, it would take nine years for the stock to generate earnings that add up to$30. But when one takes inflation and the potential return on alternative investments into account, this stock would actually have to maintain its annual 30 percent growth rate for more than13 years before the investor could collect the equivalent of his original $30 in profit.  <p> "The bet that a company can continue to grow at 30 percent is not a winning bet on average," says John Spears, a general partner at Tweedy, Browne, a New York money-management firm. According to Compustat, Standard & Poor's Denver-based statistics division, not one company managed to do this for all of the past 13 years. Over time, growth rates tend to revert to the mean. Even great companies have trouble maintaining rapid earnings growth as they get larger.  <p> This fact will ultimately be reflected in a stock's p/e. A 1978 study by William Beaver and Dale Morse in Financial Analysts Journal shows that the highest p/e's fall by more than one-half over one year and by roughly two-thirds over two years. So the chance of picking a high-p/e stock that can maintain its growth rate over the long term is pretty slim.  <p> Worse yet, when the earnings growth of a high-p/e stock falls, the market often trounces the p/e it's willing to pay. Look at what happened to the stock of <a name="NYSE:GIC"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15718"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Instrument</b></a>, a maker of cable-TV boxes. In 1993, its earnings leaped from a deficit of 42 cents a share to a profit of 74 cents a share, propelling the stock price from a low of $5.75 in 1992 to a high of $30.13 in 1993 and a p/e of 56. Earnings more than doubled in 1994, but the rise in stock price slowed as the p/e contracted to reflect concern that future earnings would be weak. When earnings subsequently fell short of analysts' expectations by a few cents a share in the third quarter of 1995, the p/e and the stock price plummeted. The investor who piled in when the stock traded at $30.13 with a p/e of 56 was left holding a stock worth less than $20.  <p> How does this analysis help an investor choose between Cisco and Pfizer? An investor who buys a share of Pfizer at the recent p/e of 27 is buying a piece of a business that will justify its current price after roughly 18 years of 18 percent growth. Meanwhile,at a 45 percent growth rate, it will take a share of Cisco only about a decade to justify its recent price.   <p> But how likely is it that Cisco will grow at 45 percent for that long? With $3.3 billion in projected fiscal 1996 sales, Cisco will be about the same size in June 1996 that <a name="NASD:SUNW"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14833"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sun Microsystems</b></a>, another well-managed computer maker, was in 1991. Sun increased earnings 18 percent a year over the next four years, an impressive achievement for such a big company. If Cisco matches that rate instead of growing at 45 percent a year, it would take about 25 years to justify the current priceÐsignificantly longer than it would take Pfizer.  <p> All this evidence doesn't mean it's impossible to make money buying high-p/e stocksÐfund families such as Twentieth Century (800-345-2021), AIM (800-347-4246), and PBHG (800-433-0051) have been doing it successfully for years. But these funds don't buy and hold. Instead, they sell as soon as the legions of number crunchers they employ spot the first sign of a slow down in the earnings growth rate.   <p> No individual investor can match these funds' data bases of earnings information or pay as little to move in and out of the market. "This approach is too risky to try with only two or three stocksÐthere are too many bombs out there. If you're trying to make money, you should buy a fund," says Stephen Barney, a senior vice presidentat Twentieth Century.  <p> Alternatively, an investor can buy and hold growth stocks that have more modest expectations and less stratospheric price tags. <p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> FINDING THE BUYS IN RETAIL STOCKS <p>The "little things" will ultimately determine which chains will thrive  <p> By Pamela J.

Analysts estimate that the bad times aren't over, either: The huge shakeout may have at least two more years to run.  <p> That makes this a good time for patient investors to go shopping for retail stocks. Picking the right ones, however, will take a discriminating eye; it's more important than ever to understand what makes and breaks these companies.   <p> Why did an entire industry go bad at once? Blame it on the excesses of the late 1970s and 1980s. Shopping seemed to be the recreational sport of choice. Consumers, especially baby boomers in their peak spending years, were willing to build up credit-card debt to stay in the game. Retailers responded with a giant building spree, adding hundreds of stores and introducing new concepts such as the superstore and the category killer. Retailer after retailer showed stunning growth in sales.  <p> The recession of 1990 sobered up a mall-happy populace: Suddenly, saving for retirement and children's college funds became more important than keeping up with the latest merchandising fad. Retailers, though, were slow to catch on. Their sales growth slowed from 7 percent a year in the1980s to 4.5 percent in 1995, but companies continued to expand at a breakneck pace, often in marginal locations or in the face of intense competition. Some continued to open new stores even as they slouched toward bankruptcy. For example, Bradlees, a northeastern discount chain now in Chapter 11, opened ten new stores in 1994.   <p> In 1996 investing in retailers that previously increased sales by expanding is out and buying stock in companies that earn high profits on their sales is in. In the current environment, those retailers that stick by the business basics will ultimately benefitas the competition falls by the wayside. There is no special trick to it. "Retailing just comes down to how well you execute," says A. G. Edwards & Sons analyst Donald Spindel.  <p> To see what a difference execution can make, look at two department-store companies, J. C. Penney ($21 billion in sales) and May Department Stores ($11 billion in sales). Both have around $800 million in net profitsÐwhich makes May's profit margin 6.4 percent versus 4.1 percent for J. C. Penney. Why is May more profitable? Inventory turns over slightly faster at May, 3.8 versus 3.7 times a year, and May's expenses are significantly lower: 19.8 percent of sales versus 23.8 percent for Penney's. The result for investors: In1995, May's earnings per share rose 7.4 percent, while Penney's fell 17.8 percent.  <p> An investor can actually tell a lot about how well a company executes by visiting its stores. Are a wide range of quality goods attractively displayed and reasonably priced? Are the employees helpful and knowledgeable about the merchandise? Is the store conveniently located and easy to get in and out of? Execution is "a lot of little things like listening to the customers," says Spindel.  <p> Contrast the experience of visiting two well-known category killers. <a name="NYSE:HD"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11470"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Home Depot</b></a> has become the country's largest home-improvement retailer in part because the company hires employees skilled in home-repair and building projects. "The one thing that clearly sets Home Depot apart is the level of service it provides," says David Presson, an analyst at Edward Jones in St. Louis. "It doesn't try to sell a product but to build a relationship with customers, and that will give the company a clear advantage." With 408 stores in 31 states, Home Depot has a good shot at increasing its 12 percent share of the $134 billion home-improvement market to 25 or even 30 percent by the turn of the century, Presson believes. He expects earnings to continue growing at a pace of 20 to 25 percent a year.  <p> On the other hand, at <a name="NYSE:TOY"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11495"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Toys "R" Us</b></a>, the country's leading toy retailer, cold, undifferentiated aisles stuffed with a seemingly random and bewildering selection of products discourage return visits. Despite carrying some 4,000 kinds of toys, storesÐoften unbeknownst to their employeesÐare out of some products. "More than anything else they need to overhaul the look and design of their stores," says A. G. Edwards analyst Greg Simpson. "The warehouse look they were using in the '70s and '80s doesn't work anymore." The company's net profits fell 21.6 percent last year, and earnings per share dropped 18.4 percent, from $1.85 in 1994 to $1.51 in 1995.  <p> A retailer's ability to execute also shows up clearly in a company's financial statements. For example, last year <a name="NYSE:ANN"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=14959"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ann Taylor</b></a> piled on merchandise to fill new stores. "They were building inventory, and then sales slowed," says Oppenheimer analyst Dorothy Lakner. At the same time, shoppers were snubbing the fashions at existing stores. A statistic called same-store sales, which segregates the sales at stores that have been open for a year or longer from total sales, eloquently captures that story. After climbing an impressive 22 percent in 1994, same-store sales fell 13.8 percent in 1995. To move all that inventory, Ann Taylor had to cut prices. Gross margins consequently dropped 8.5 percent, and net income fell by $32.6 million. Earnings per shareÐwhich had doubled to $1.40 in 1994Ðtumbled to negative four cents in 1995. <p> Meanwhile, the <a name="NYSE:GPS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11469"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gap</b></a> raised net profits by 10.5 percent from 1994 to 1995 by "running the business with very lean inventory," says Lakner. That solid execution is reflected in a figure called inventory turnover, which measures the number of times a company fills its shelves with merchandise, sells it all, and then re-stocks each year. The Gap's inventory turnovers have been rising for the past four years to 6.3 times in 1995, according to estimates by Value Line, while Ann Taylor's have fallen to 4.4. Add in the Gap's new Old Navy chain and it's easy to see why Gap stock has rallied from a low of $30.13 in 1995 to $56.75 on March 13. <p> But even managing inventory so that merchandise moves won't make a retailer profitable if the cost of buying and selling those goods is too high. "Sales figures can be misleading," says analyst Presson. "The most important thing is if the company is generating cash flow above and beyond its expenses."   <p> That's why investors should look at a figure called selling, general, and administration (SG&A) costs. For example, even though <a name="NYSE:KM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10830"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Kmart's</b></a> same-store sales increased 5.5 percent in December of1995 versus only 1.1 percent for Wal-Mart's, Kmart went from a profit of $1.04 billion in 1994 to a deficit of $490 million last year, while Wal-Mart increased profits from $2.68 billion to $2.74 billion.  <p> To see one reason why this happened, look at SG&A as a percentage of sales at the two chains. Wal-Mart has an SG&A of 15.59 percent compared with 21.97 percent for Kmart. This means it costs Wal-Mart just $15.59 in salaries and overhead to produce every $100 of sales versus $21.97 at Kmart. "That gives Wal-Mart a great pricing advantage," says Presson. "Kmart can't undersell that without losing money."  <p> From its start, Wal-Mart "offered low prices and good service,and paid attention to all aspects of retailing; they really watched every penny," says A. G. Edwards' Spindel. "They're more efficientat distribution and information systems. And now that they're so large they are able to buy extremely well."  <p> But with 2,000 stores in the U.S., 131 in Canada, and 126 in Mexico, Wal-Mart is now so bigÐsales recently hit $94 billionÐthat it probably can't maintain its historic 20 percent growth rate. Its fourth-quarter drop in earnings is a sure sign it "suffers from the law of large numbers," says Prudential analyst Wayne Hood. "It's difficult to grow off that base."  <p> In an effort to keep growing, though, Wal-Mart management is tackling a new market with supercenters that sell groceries as well as general merchandise. Wal-Mart plans to add 100 new supercenters this year to the 245 it currently operates. While food is a low-margin business, the hope is that it will pull in enough new customers to increase sales of Wal-Mart's more lucrative general merchandise. So far, according to Spindel, this has worked. Spindel points out that Wal-Mart currently has about 45 percent of the discount market, which is roughly a $185 billion industry, but the grocery business is a $400 billion market, and the largest company in that industry has only a 6 percent share of it. Presson and Spindel therefore think Wal-Mart can increase earnings 10 to 15 percent annually for the next three to five yearsÐbelow the company's historic 20 percent rate, but still higher than the growth rate for the average company in the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock IndexÐwhich Presson calculates at 6 to 7 percent annually.  <p> That's the plan anyway. Now it's up to Wal-Mart, just like anyother retailer in this tough environment, to execute.  <p><p>

						May 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Columns  <p>  <p>BONDS AWAY!  <p> Move aside coupon clippers. Bondholders are finding aggressive ways to make serious money.  <p>  <p>By Susan Lee  <p>  <p>Bonds are boring. bonds are for fuddy-duddies. Bonds are dead!  <p> Long live bonds!  <p> Huh?  <p> Many people--including me--look at bonds for risk control and current income; we plunk them into our portfolios and then forget about them. That's quite okay, but we are missing an opportunity for optimizing. Well, here's a strategy that will zip us out of the fuddy-duddy category. It's called investing for total return, and it can be at least as rewarding as stocks and just as exciting.  <p> Total return has two components: interest, or what the coupon pays, and any appreciation or depreciation in the price of the bond. If you have a bond paying a coupon rate of 3 percent a year and if the price of that bond goes from $10,000 to $11,000 over a year, for a gain of 10 percent, then your total returnis 13 percent.   <p> Of course, if the price falls from $10,000 to $9,000, that is a price depreciation of 10 percent. You would still have $300 from the interest payment, but your total return would be negative7 percent. (To be absolutely accurate, you should subtract transaction costs and taxes from the total return. And to be academically accurate, you should also subtract any inflation to get real total return.)  <p> Last year, when long-term rates fell 2 percent, the total return on 30-year Treasurys was 34 percent. On investment-grade corporates,total return averaged 22 percent. Not bad.  <p> A total-return strategy requires two things. First, you have to start looking at bonds more like they were stocks and less like, well, bonds. Just as dividend payments are not the only reason to buy stocks, so with bonds. You have to buy them with an eye to price changes. That means you should evaluate the potential for the price to go up--or down. The good news here, of course,is that changes in bond prices are bounded. If you let the bond's maturity run out, the price returns to par--its face value. That's bad if you allowed a big, fat run-up in the value to go unrealized, but good if you experienced a big, fat loss in value. And that brings me to the second key to the total-return strategy: Simply put, you have to be prepared to trade your bonds to realize gains--to look at bonds not as security but as an opportunity.  <p> As Eduardo Haim of E H Capital Group in New York says, "The point is to buy bonds that really produce for you--where the after-tax yield is high enough to provide a cushion against rising interest rates and where you have the potential of price appreciation." <p> So where can you go to get higher-yielding, price-popping potential in a market where interest rates are already pretty low? One suggestion is to focus on out-of-the-way markets--and really increase the thrills-and-chills factor.   <p> Take, for instance, the darkest side of a dark market--distressed securities. These bonds lurk on the bottom of the junk market. They either aren't paying interest or are about to stop paying it, because the issuers are in or are sliding into bankruptcy.These bonds are cheap, trading well below par. When the issuing company comes out of bankruptcy, however, there will be a recapitalization. Bondholders will be able to sell their bonds or convert the minto equity. In other words, the action comes from price appreciation. If the issuer recovers, there is a swift price kicker.  <p> Martin Sass of M. D. Sass Investors Services in New York has$400 million in distressed securities. "We love them," he says. He buys bonds of firms that have a strong core business but are either just going into or emerging from bankruptcy. "There are temporary, dramatic dislocations in this market because of the panic when a firm defaults," says Sass. "I can buy a dollar for 30 cents."  <p> The market in foreign bonds is another out-of-the-way place--way out, though, which means investing in new emerging-markets countries, not Western European or established emerging-markets countries. Lisa Hess of Zesiger Capital Group in New York likes Polish and Czech bonds. She expects Polish bonds to give an annual total return of 20.5 percent in local currency and 10 percent in dollars,and Czech bonds to deliver 10 to 11 percent in dollars.  <p> A nifty total-return strategy can also be built around convertible bonds. These are securities that pay interest like bonds but are convertible into stocks at a price--usually much higher than current market value--promised by the issuing company. As the stock price rises, approaching the conversion price, the value of the bond increases. Hess likes convertibles issued by small companies, because she expects small caps to out perform the market, and while she waits for that price appreciation, she receives current income in interest payments--something you might not get from small-cap stocks, which usually don't pay dividends.  <p> And finally, Fred Quirsfeld, senior portfolio manager for IDS Mutual Fund Group in Minneapolis, offers the following total-return strategy for bond funds. Put 60 percent of your bond money in a fund with shorter or "controlled" duration (duration is a wayof re-adjusting the maturity date to account for the size andtiming of cash flows--the shorter the duration, the less volatility).For example, suppose you invest in mortgage-backed securities with a duration of 3.5 years. "Given the flattish yield curve [short-term yields are close to long-term yields], you will get competitive returns with good credit--they're backed by the U.S. government--and stability," says Quirsfeld. Then combine that position with 20 percent in junk bonds and 20 percent in global bonds--two more-volatile sectors that could give you double-digit returns from both current income and price appreciation and that will diversify your exposure.  <p> The trick in total-return investing is, of course, to find bonds whose risk-return trade-off favors return. That means staying away from popular securities, where information is so good and so accessible that pricing is efficient.  <p> One place not to look would be the bonds in the various bond indexes, such as the <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lehman Brothers</b></a> T-Bond Index, the Ryan Labs Treasury Composite, and the Salomon Brothers Broad Investment-Grade Bond Index. Many players feel that big institutional bond manager sare "closet indexers," so the demand for these securities is large and constant, keeping upward pressure on prices.  <p> Before you decide to add some thrills and chills to your bond portfolio, however, consider the risks--and I do mean risks.The standard array applies in capital letters. Distressed bonds,for example, are particularly subject to credit risk--the possibility that bondholders will never get back their principal--especially if the economy goes into a recession; foreign bonds are sensitive to currency and political risk; and even high-yielding bonds are, at some point, vulnerable to interest-rate risk.  <p> There are also some barriers to investing. Money, for example.If you are buying individual bonds instead of fooling around with bond funds, it takes at least a half million dollars to get good diversification. And transaction costs can be killers; typically, buying bonds is a lot more expensive than buying stocks.  <p> Also, this stuff is not for amateurs. Every bond manager I talked with agreed with Eduardo Haim, who said, "I know this sounds self-serving, but it's almost impossible for nonprofessionals to do well on their own." This is one part of your portfolio you should strongly consider running through a professional manager. <p> And speaking of portfolios, if you have allocated a lump of money to bonds as a sleep-at-night precaution, don't touch it. Total-return ploys belong in the high-risk lump, along with, or instead of, those nifty micro-cap stocks your brother-in-law tipped to you.   <p> As Kevin Johnson of Aronson + Partners, a money-management firm based in Philadelphia, points out, "It's a question of degree and kind. On the degree side, there's a lot more money to be made on bonds that have a double-digit total-return potential, but on the kind side, you are taking on an enormous amount of risk."  <p> In other words, fasten your seat belts. You could be in for a bumpy ride.  <p> Contributing editor Susan Lee writes "Mind Your Own Business" monthly. She is an economist and author of Hands Off!

						A new technique called style analysis shows more detail about how a fund earns its returns  <p> By Andrew Gluck  <p> Smart investors know that diversification can not only enhance the safety of a portfolio but also improve its performance. Example: The best growth-and-income fund of 1990, <a name="FUND:GATEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/GATEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Gateway Index Plus</b></a> earned a total return of 9.3 percent over the past five years. But an investor who shared the same bet among the top three growth-and-income funds of 1990 --  Gateway, <a name="FUND:AAGFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AAGFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>AIM Charter</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:CAPEX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CAPEX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Capital Exchange</b></a>--  would have earned a return of 13.5 percent annually over the past five years.  <p> Something, though, has gone wrong with the methods that many investors rely on to diversify fund portfolios.   <p> Consider inves– tors A and B. Investor A uses the traditional approach, attempting to diversify by buying funds from three of the categories listed in The Wall Street Journal or one of the mutual-fund newsletters. So A purchases a growth fund, <a name="FUND:BENOX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BENOX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Berger100</b></a>; a growth-and-income fund, <a name="FUND:OMSBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OMSBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Oppenheimer Main Street Income& Growth</b></a>; and a world-stock fund, <a name="FUND:SMCWX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SMCWX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Smallcap World Fund</b></a>. Investor B knows nothing about diversification and  buys three funds listed in the growth category by Morningstar Mutual Funds: <a name="FUND:BCHYX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BCHYX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Benham Equity Growth</b></a>, <a name="FUND:BRWIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/BRWIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Brandywine</b></a>, and <a name="FUND:FDVLX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FDVLX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Fidelity Value</b></a>.   <p> It sounds crazy, but investor A is actually less diversified than investor B. According to data from Morningstar, investor A's three funds behave like the Russell 2000, an index of small-company stocks. Investor B's three growth funds differ distinctly from one another: One is correlated with a large-company index, another with a small-company index, and the third with a foreign index.  <p> "The labels applied to mutual funds are generally misleading, "says Robert Ludwig, director of investment strategy at SEI Asset Management Group, a financial-services firm in Wayne, Pennsylvania."They don't really explain what a fund does."  <p> Some fund companies --  knowing that investors measure a fund against its peers in a category --  mislabel funds, calling a growth fund a growth-and-income fund, for instance, so that it's ranked in a category in which it's likely to rise to the top during some periods. <p>But even the categories created by mutual-fund data providers, such as Lipper Analytical Services and Morningstar, can cause confusion. The data providers begin with the funds' descriptions of themselves and then adjust each description after examining the portfolios funds report to the Securities and Exchange Commission twice a year. A fund that describes itself as growth and income, for example, might be moved into the growth category after ananalyst studies such  portfolio fundamentals as price-to- earnings ratios.  <p> Funds, however, report their portfolios just twice a year, so fund analysts get only a snapshot of what the fund held on 2 days out of 365. And few funds restrict their holdings to just one category. A fund in the domestic small-cap group, for example, might own a few big-company stocks and some foreign securities, too. Yet the system forces that fund into just one of these categories. And some investment strategies, oddly, aren't represented at all. Morningstar, for example, doesn't include a value classification among its investment objectives, even though there are hundreds of value-oriented funds.  <p> "When you take a growth fund that may really be a small-cap fund and put it together with an equity-income fund that may have high-yield bonds in it, and you throw in a portfolio with a small-company fund that actually is  a small-company growth fund, you end up with things that you probably did not want to own," says Ludwig.  <p> The solution: Diversify a portfolio based on style. Most fundmanagers have a process of investing that leads them to pick certain kinds of securities. That's their style.  <p> Three factors --  growth, value, and company size --  determine a fund manager's technique. Growth managers, for example, buy stocks in companies because the companies' earnings are growing rapidly. Value managers are bargain hunters, seeking stocks with low prices compared with the value of the underlying companies. Finally, some fund managers specialize in small companies, and others buy large ones.  <p> A style may seem as vague and hard to define as a category, but thanks to Nobel Prize–winning economist William Sharpe, investors can now apply precise techniques to reveal a fund's style. In a 1992 water shed article in the scholarly Journal of Portfolio Management, Sharpe presented evidence that 85 percent to 90 percent of a fund portfolio's returns is determined by style. Just 10 percent to 15 percent of returns, he found, is attributable to securities selection. In other words, it matters more that a fund has chosen to focus on small-cap value stocks than it does which small-cap value stocks it buys.   <p> Sharpe developed software that identifies the investment styles from fund returns. Basically, his techniques look at the way a fund performs month to month --  not at its semi-annual reports--  and tries to match its performance to that of two or more indexes, such as the Russell 2000 for small-cap stocks or the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index for large-cap stocks. The mix of indexes that best matches a fund's performance defines its style.  <p> Creating a portfolio based on this  type of analysis "gives you a greater degree of precision so you can be sure the funds you invest in are different from each other," explains Andrew Rudd, chairman of BARRA, a Berkeley, California, investment-software firm. "You'll be able to construct portfolios that are better diversified."   <p> The fund universe can be divided into six basic styles. Domestic-stock funds account for four: small-cap growth, large-cap growth, small-cap value, and large-cap value. Foreign funds and fixed-income funds are the other two styles. Each has distinctly different characteristics. <p> "Style investing is accepted by academia as a useful way to create a portfolio, and it's been the investment mode for professional money managers for years," says Bob Barry, a New Jersey investment adviser. "Now it's starting to be used by advisers to create fund portfolios for wealthy clients." These advisers often employ style-analysis software that sells for $5,000 to $15,000. (See the sidebar below for more on style-analysis software, including one package designed for individual investors.)  <p> But individual investors can also design a style-based portfolio or check the styles of an existing portfolio without software.Two pieces of data from Morningstar Mutual Funds, a biweekly newsletter available at most libraries, are all an investor needs. <p> Morningstar provides a "style box" on approximately 1,500 stock and bond funds. This box shows if a fund is oriented toward small-,large-, or medium-sized companies and if its style is growth, value, or a blend of the two. Morningstar also provides historical information, showing how consistently a fund has adhered to its style.  <p> The style box has some limitations. A fund that invests only in medium-sized companies, for instance, will be listed in the style box as owning medium-sized stocks. But so will a fund that invests equal amounts in small-, medium-, and large-cap stocks.  <p> Morningstar's "Best Fit Index" will help investors get a more precise style reading. Morningstar compares funds to 27 different equity and fixed-income indexes and lists the index a fund most closely resembles --  its best fit. Statisticians call this correlation "R-squared." On a scale from 1 to 100, if a fund has an R-squared of 75 or more versus an index, then it is closely correlated to that index.   <p> For example, Smallcap World Fund is categorized by Morningstar as a world-stock fund, but has an R-squared of 85 against the Russell 2000, a domestic index of small companies. According to Morningstar's December 8, 1995, issue, Smallcap World's top holdings include <a name="NASD:FPNX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=15805"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>First Pacific</b></a>, <a name="NASD:AMER"></a><b>America Online</b>, and <a name="NASD:WCLX"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10584"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Wisconsin Central Transport</b></a>. An investor who buys Smallcap for foreign diversification is in for a surprise.   <p> An investor seeking a small-cap fund would look for an R-squared of 75 or more compared with the Russell 2000. An investor seeking a large-cap fund would look for a high R-squared versus the S&P 500. Foreign-stock funds will have a high R-squared versus the <a name="NYSE:MS"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=11018"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Morgan Stanley</b></a> Europe Austral-Asia and Far East Index (EAFE) or any other diversified foreign-stock index. To get the fixed-income style of investing in a portfolio, look for a fund that has a high R-squared versus a bond index, such as the <a name="NYSE:LEH"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=41936"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Lehman Brothers</b></a> Intermediate Treasury Index.   <p> With the style box and R-squared data, fund investors can create a truly diversified portfolio. After all, if the markets turn disagreeable this year, you won't want to be caught with a portfolio that's not your style.  <p><p><p>

						February 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Cover  <p> SEARCH FOR THE WORLD'S HIGHEST YIELDS <p>Who needs penny stocks when some Russian bonds yield 125 percent? Or course, there may be a little risk...  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> It seemed like a simple question: What's the world's highest-yielding fixed-income investment? "You're talking about truly treacherous territory," warned the first investor I talked to, the manager of a $500 million bond fund. "A lot of the people who deal in this stuff are real scum." Then he referred me to two guys he knew who specialized in such deals.  <p> So began a chain of sometimes grudging referrals that would take me from jumbo certificates of deposit to Russian Obligatsii Federalnie Zayomni. Before I was through, I would talk to more than 60 brokers, analysts, and money managers in the United States, Europe, Latin America, and Russia. Some refused to help such investments were too risky, they said even though I swore that my hypothetical investor could afford to lose the $100,000 he had to invest. Others simply didn't know they were content with instruments with lower yields and less risk. But from a few I learned how a person willing to take modest risks can boost the yield on his fixed-income portfolio and I found out just how incredibly high the yields can get for someone with a telephone, a fax machine, and a hypothetical $100,000. (Would you believe 200 percent?) Before I share the results the best of class ineight categories from low-risk CDs to the highest-risk foreign bonds I'll pass along three general lessons I learned about the planet's yielding-est fixed-income investments.   <p> First, the highest-yielding instruments aren't just risky. They are very, very, very risky. Most income investors know about credit risk, the chance that an issuer won't be able to pay. Most investors also know that climbing interest rates will slam an income investment especially one with a long time horizon. Such mishaps can cause prices of plain-vanilla corporate or government bonds to fall 5 percent to 10 percent, as many did in 1994. Big deal. Prices of the highest-yielding issues can easily plummet 50 percent or more if rates rise sharply or even decline to zero when a company (or an entire country) goes belly up. Fraud, revolution, currency devaluations, or government default can render these holdings worthless.   <p> Second, analyzing these deals is very complicated. If you think yield-to-maturity is a knotty concept, wait until you meet your first GKO; that's short for Gosudarstvenii Kratkasrochnii Obligatsii, a Russian security modeled on United States Treasury bills. High-yield investors spend their time calculating debt coverage on junk bonds, hedging for currency risk, and trying to predict how the next swing in interest rates will affect the balance of payments in Ecuador. I don't know how to do those things, I'm not sure that all the brokers, analysts, and fund managers I talked to do, either.   <p> Third, many of these instruments are hard to buy. Broker after broker told me that $100,000 would barely get me a seat at the table. Still, nagging phone calls usually turned up at least one broker who could tell me how to get what I wanted, or at least something close to it. Of course, I didn't know any of this when I began my search. All I had was a hypothetical $100,000 in my pocket and a burning desire to find the world's highest-yielding investments. Here's what I found.  <p> I START CONSERVATIVELY WITH CDs  <p> I started at the low-risk end of the scale, trying to get just a little more yield than that offered by the average one-year bank CD an annual payout of 4.89 percent. I quickly discovered that I could bump that up to 5.26 percent if I could cough up the $90,000 to $100,000 required for a jumbo CD.  <p> I figured I could do better. Some brokerage firms offer a selection of CDs from around the country. The yields are often higher because brokers buy in bulk. BanxQuote, the research division of fixed-income broker MasterFund in Fairfield, New Jersey, cited average yields of 5.18 percent on one-year brokered CDs. You might do a bit better by calling around; start with <a name="NYSE:MER"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10990"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Merrill Lynch</b></a> (800-637-7455), Prudential Securities (212-406-3380), and Smith Barney (212-816-6000).  <p> TIME AS RISK:  ZERO-COUPON BONDS  <p> Bored with 5 percent yields, I turned up the risk meter. Like CDs, zeros are often sold to conservative investors but unlike CDs, they can be astonishingly volatile.   <p> Here's why: Wall Street creates zero-coupon bonds by buying U.S. Treasurys and then separating the coupon (the interest payments) from the principal payment due at the end of a bond's life. So zeros pay no interest; instead, they are sold at deep discounts from their maturity value. For example, by paying $13,470 now for a 14-year Treasury zero, I could receive its $30,000 face value in the year 2009.  <p> But an investor is locked into the zero's imputed interest rate (the interest rate that it would take to make $13,470 grow to $30,000 by 2009) 6.1 percent in the case of my Treasury zero. If inflation climbs and interest rates rise, the projected purchasing power of my future $30,000 will shrink dramatically. I can try to get out of the deal by selling, but I'll take a big hit: The value of a 15-year zero coupon bond will decline roughly 15 percent if interest rates rise just one percentage point.  <p> A DASH OF SAUCE:  OVERSEAS BONDS  <p> Going overseas didn't automatically up the yield, I found unless I was willing to take on currency and political risks. Jean-Marie Eveillard, manager of <a name="FUND:SGENX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SGENX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Sogen International Fund</b></a> (212-278-5800),urged me to check out New Zealand government bonds: Apart from sheep and great scenery, the Kiwis have a growing budget surplus. That, of course, means that the bonds carry small risk and bonds, for example, recently paid 7.05 percent.  <p> Things got racier when I spoke to Bill Kaeli of Noyes Partners, a New York investment firm that specializes in South African debt. His pick: BAA3-rated (by Moody's Investor Service) Eskom13.5 percent coupon bonds maturing in 2020, which recently traded on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange at a 14.63 percent yield-to-maturity.Eskom, the fourth-largest producer of electricity in the world, provides 97 percent of South Africa's electric power. "Eskom would be a triple-A credit if it were in the United States," says Kaeli.   <p> But, of course, it isn't. Investors in Eskom take on the risk that South Africa could implode or devalue its currency, therand. Kaeli doesn't think the first is likely, and he expects the rand to bounce back from its recent 28-year low. Noyes Partners (800-433-0129) will arrange the trade for a $10,000 minimum purchase. <p> DEEP DISCOUNT:  CLOSED-END FUNDS  <p> Not many garden-variety mutual funds offer double-digit yields, but things are different in the closed-end arena. Closed-end funds issue only a limited number of shares, which then trade on stock exchanges often, as investor sentiment swings one way or the other, at discounts or premiums to the value of their investments. Out-of-favor funds with big discounts can easily sprout double-digit yields. No fewer than 62 of the 510 closed-end funds on the list I got from Chicago's Morningstar fund-rating service were yielding 10 percent or better as of December 1.  <p> Morningstar's Carolyn Whitfield warned me not to get too excited. "Some people chase yield in these funds, and that's fine," she said. "But make sure the fund isn't using your principal to pay the dividends." Excuse me? It turned out that three of the four highest-yielding funds were doing just that. <a name="FUND:AADBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/AADBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>American Opportunity Income fund</b></a>, for example, showed a 15.7 percent payout. In 1994, manager Worth Bruntjen had almost 50 percent of the fund in mortgage derivatives, which led to a 28 percent decline in the fund's value when interest rates climbed early that year. This year, even though he's trimmed the fund's dividend, he's kept the yield up by making some payments out of the fund's "dividend reserve." For new purchasers, that amounts to a payment from shareholders' principal.   <p> But investors looking for truly higher yields based on higher risk can find them among the closed-end funds invested in emerging markets. Morgan Stanley Emerging Markets Debt fund (13.9 percentyield) offered the highest payout of this bunch. Manager Paul Ghaffari uses borrowed money (loans equal about 9 percent of the fund's assets) to load up on securities issued in places such as Mexico, Morocco, Nigeria, and Bulgaria. That leverage pumps up shareholders' yield as well as their risk.   <p> Like most emerging-markets funds, this one has a short and bloody history: Launched in July 1993, it rose 36 percent that year, fell 26 percent in 1994, and staggered to a 17.6 percent return, early this year the fund was trading at a 0.2 percent discount to its net asset value. But the discount has been as high as 12.8 percent. It seemed like a good time to wait on this one.   <p> TRAWLING FOR TRASH:  JUNK BONDS  <p> It's hard to make a huge score with a diversified portfolio. The same safety in numbers that makes a diversified portfolio an investor's friend prevents a single good call from really raking it in. Hence my next step: Buying junk bonds directly. These are bonds rated below investment grade (Ba or worse by Moody's; BB or lower by S & P). Issued by companies with dinged-up balance sheets, they're the used cars of the bond market.   <p> Like my 1988 Taurus (whose previous owner put 104,000 miles on it), junk bonds are cheap; the average bond rated CCC and CCC+ by Moody's yielded almost nine more percentage points than Treasurys in early November. And like my car, those bonds probably can go the distance though it's never quite sure they will. <p> Analysts Michael Graves and Jeff Aurigemma of Northstar told me I'd need to invest at least $25,000 to get decent commission rates. Graves liked BB-rated California Energy 10.25 percent coupon bonds maturing on January 15, 2004, trading on the New York Bond Exchange and paying a 9.6 percent yield-to-maturity. The firm is the globe's second-largest provider of geothermal power: Basically, it uses volcanoes to boil water. California Energy has a strong presence in the Philippines as well as Indonesia, which Graves called "the Saudi Arabia of geothermal energy. "The bonds' double-digit yield reflects concern about those two countries' stability.   <p> Somewhat superstitious about making money off volcanoes, I asked for another pick. Aurigemma offered me B3-rated Ralphs.<p><p><p>

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Personal Adviser  <p> CAPITALIZE ON THE CUT <p>As the GOP works over the tax code, the most significant change for investors is the capital-gains cut  <p> By Elizabeth Macdonald  <p> Does it seem like 1986 all over again? Do you sense in the air major changes in the tax law? Well, your instincts are right. For the first time in ten years, elected officials are serious about passing major tax cuts. Although Congress is still battling vehemently over many of the changes, some stand a good chance of surviving the fight--most significantly the long-anticipated, much-debated capital-gains reduction.  <p> In mid-October, Senate Finance Committee Republicans signed off on a $245 billion tax-cut package, which was headed for inclusion in a combined House and Senate omnibus budget reconciliation package. President Clinton threatened to veto the entire package because of his objections to Medicare cuts.   <p> Tax breaks for families with children and for investors, however, are articles of faith among most Republicans in Congress. That's why the tax pros at several Big Six accounting firms who are plugged into the two congressional tax-writing committees say three measures face a good chance of eventually becoming law:a $500-per-child tax credit, an expanded IRA, and a reduction in the capital-gains tax rate.   <p> The most meaningful measure for investors would be the capital-gains cut, which would cost the government an estimated $31.9 billion over five years. The version most likely to pass would let taxpayers deduct 50 percent of their net long-term capital gains when determining taxable income, thereby lowering the top capital-gains rate of28 percent to an effective 19.8 percent. To take advantage of the cut, investors who sell or exchange assets would have to hold on to these appreciable assets for longer than one year. <p> There are still several disagreements between House and Senate tax-writing committees' versions of a capital-gains cut. The Senate version retains the alternative minimum tax, while the House bill does not. The House also wants an indexing component, meaning investors would be taxed only on gains that exceed inflation, which the Senate flatly rejected. What's more, the two tax-writing committees are at odds over the cut's effective date. The House wants it to take effect as of January 1, 1995, while the Senate is pushing for October 13, 1995. Tax experts say, however, the effective date may end up being January 1, 1996.  <p> Few tax rules change as often as the capital-gains tax rules. And few cause as many migraines and busted calculators. To figure out long-term net capital gains, taxpayers must first subtract long-term capital losses and net short-term capital losses. For assets held one year or less, investors must pay a capital-gains tax equal to their ordinary income tax rate, which could shoot to 39.6 percent or even higher with the phase out of exemptions and certain deductions for high-income individuals.   <p> The differences between the two rates produce hefty financial incentives to invest for long-term capital gains. For example, say an investor in the 39.6 percent bracket receives $100,000 in long-term capital gains. Today, that taxpayer would pocket $72,000 after federal taxes. The new law would let him or her take home $80,200.   <p> If the capital-gains cut passes, unexpected taxpayer breaks will flow from it, says Janice Johnson, tax director at the accounting firm Coopers & Lybrand in New York and a member of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants' Capital Gains Task Force. Johnson says that when taxpayers sit down to do their returns, they'll see that their long-term capital gains deductionis done as an above-the-line computation to produce their adjusted gross income. Taxpayers use AGI to calculate their limitations on certain deductions. So if AGI will be reduced by the capital-gains deduction, taxpayers will face a lower threshold for writing off miscellaneous and medical deductions, which are restricted to 2 percent and 7.5 percent, respectively, of AGI. If Congress makes the cut effective in 1996, says Johnson, taxpayers "may want to put off paying miscellaneous costs such as fees for investment advisory services, tax preparation, and elective medical costs until 1996, because they may get higher itemized deductions." <p> To take best advantage of a capital-gains cut, taxpayers must keep close track of their recognized (actual) and unrecognized (potential) gains and losses. Taxpayers "recognize" gains or losses when they sell or otherwise dispose of an asset; the date of disposal determines what tax year the gains and losses apply to.   <p> Shoving more capital gains into the long-term category, and picking the right holdings to sell, takes some work. Taxpayers who own various lots of the same security purchased at different prices can control the amount of gain or loss recognized on a sale by identifying the lots to be sold. If this isn't done in writing to the broker executing the sale, taxpayers will be considered to be selling the first lot they bought. If the stock has consistently appreciated, that lot will have appreciated the most and its sale will produce the greatest tax.   <p> Other lots of stock will produce different results. Selling a lot that hasn't been held for more than 12 months yields a short-term gain, usually the most expensive gain of all. Given the probable drop in the capital-gains rate, taxpayers might want to sell those lots in the long-term category that offer the least overall gain (after January 1, 1996, if a retroactive measure is not approved). When selling these shares, choose those in which the cost basis (the original cost plus out-of-pocket expenses, like broker commissions) is highest--this will shave the capital gains down as well.  <p> Regardless of a rate cut, there are several moves taxpayers can still make to reduce their 1995 capital-gains taxes. First, look for stock lemons on which to take a loss in 1995, say the tax gurus at the accounting firm KPMG Peat Marwick. Taxpayers can fully deduct net capital losses against capital gains, and if losses exceed gains, they can write off the excess dollar for dollar from ordinary income, up to a maximum of $3,000 in any one year. For example, a taxpayer with $10,000 in stock losses can offset $7,000 in capital gains and then deduct $3,000 of the losses from ordinary income.  <p> Net capital losses that exceed $3,000 can be carried forward indefinitely until they are exhausted. Capital losses carried over to future years should be first used to offset any short-term capital gains in that year, which might otherwise be taxed at higher rates.   <p> Taxpayers who have significant capital-gains income can also try a tax swap, but they need to be careful. Tax swaps involve dumping assets that are currently worth less than the original purchase price and replacing them with similar assets. This action converts a paper loss into an actual loss, which is used to offset taxable gains. However, if a taxpayer pulls the plug on an ailing security to create a loss, he or she cannot buy the same or what the IRS considers a "substantially identical" security within 30 days of the sale. Losses from such so-called wash sales are not deductible. Taxpayers who sell a stinker must wait at least 30 days after the original sale before purchasing the same security. <p> Bond swaps, though, can help reduce taxes without the 30-day wait, says Johnson, so long as investors buy slightly different bonds. Bond swaps work better than securities swaps because it's easier to find other bonds that have different characteristics, such as interest rates and maturity dates, but basically represent a comparable investment. Whether the value of a taxpayer's portfolio has increased or decreased this year, in a bond swap, taxpayers can recognize tax losses without altering their fundamental investment positions. Taxpayers can sell sufficient bonds to achieve a loss, which they can then use to reduce their total net capital gain for the year. They can use the proceeds of the sale to purchase bonds of similar quality, maintaining their desired position.  <p> Taxpayers can also try what's called selling short against the box. This strategy can be used to defer capital gains to the following tax year, an attractive strategy if a capital-gains cut takes effect next year. Taxpayers can lock in capital gains by short-selling borrowed securities equivalent to those they already own and then delivering their own securities to close the sale after year's end. In this manner, the gain is locked in this year but there's no taxation until 1996. Be aware, however,that this tactic limits the upside potential of the securities used to lock in the gain.  <p> Strategies like these can easily become too esoteric for taxpayers without degrees in accounting. The reasoning behind them, though, is based on simple rules that all taxpayers should abide by when doing their year-end tax planning: Realize income when the tax rate is low; lump together deductible expenses in one year to surpass tax thresholds; postpone tax whenever possible (taxes paid this year "cost" more than those paid next year); and finally, remember that a capital gain is, for the most part, better than ordinary income. These tenets are likely to remain valid no matter how the tax code is patched back together this time.   <p> ALSO NEW FOR 96  <p> Along with the capital-gains cut, tax pros at Deloitte & Touche, KPMG Peat Marwick, and Coopers & Lybrand say the $500 child-tax credit and an expanded IRA will likely pass. At press time, Senate Finance Republicans had greenlighted a $500 tax credit for each child under 18 in single-parent households earning up to $75,000 annually and two-income households earning less than $110,000. The House bill kicks the income limit up to $200,000. The fortified IRA would raise income limits and let all taxpayers, including nonworking spouses, invest a full tax-deferred $2,000. It would also allow penalty-free withdrawals to pay for items like medical or college expenses, or a first home. Another proposed savings account would allow taxpayers to withdraw interest tax-free after five years.  <p><p>

December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Investing  <p> KEEP THE FAITH <p>Foreign bonds may have taken a big hit recently, but they still offer high yields and diversification  <p> By Clint Willis  <p> Most U.S. investors have ignored international bonds for the past decade. Too bad: Overseas bonds outpaced domestic and foreign stocks as well as U.S. bonds during the five- and ten-year periods through last June. That run included strong gains early this year, when foreign issues stayed well ahead of U.S. bonds.  <p> This glittering record is largely the result of the prolonged slump of the dollar, which has fallen 9 percent versus the deutsche mark and 39 percent versus the yen in the past five years. That's made foreign bonds worth far more in dollar terms.   <p> But now some investors fear the dollar is reversing course. "Currencies in Germany, Japan, and Switzerland are overvalued against the dollar," says James Stack, editor of InvesTech Mutual Fund Advisor in Whitefish, Montana.   <p> Central bankers in the U.S., Germany, and Japan appear to agree with Stack--at least for the moment. In August, the bankers joined forces to push up the money, causing U.S. investors to lose 11.3 percent in Japanese bonds and 5 percent in German bonds.   <p> The central bankers have at least two reasons for pursuing this strategy. First, by making imports cheaper in the U.S., a stronger dollar reduces inflationary pressures here. Second, it increases exports for U.S. trading partners such as Japan. "The Japanese economy is in such bad shape that central bankers fear global growth could be affected," says Les Nanberg, manager of the <a name="FUND:MWGTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/MWGTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>MFS World Governments Fund</b></a>.  <p> Nevertheless, even if the dollar rally continues over the next six months or so, it probably won't last. The long-term outlook for foreign bonds may be brighter than it seems right now. Why? Because in the long run, the U.S. needs a weaker buck to encourage exports and thus correct--or at least control--the yawning U.S.trade deficit. Meanwhile, any setback in plans to reduce the budget deficit will hit the dollar hard. "A country cannot continue to run a balance-of-trade deficit and a high budget deficit without seeing its currency weaken," says Stack.   <p> Discord over European monetary unity should also boost the mark and the Swiss franc against the dollar. German officials recently expressed doubts that plans for a central European currency after 1999 will succeed. As a result, investors are flocking to those currencies from marginal European ones such as the Italian lira.  <p> Beyond short-term currency changes, investors who add foreign bonds to their holdings generally increase their returns while reducing the overall portfolio volatility. "Historically, bond markets in different regions tend to move in very different patterns from each other," says Nanberg.  <p> Overseas markets also offer bargains. "As more countries issue bonds, many overseas credits are mispriced," says Shirish Malekar, manager of the <a name="FUND:SIBVX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/SIBVX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Strong International Bond Fund</b></a>. "If you do your homework, you can get significantly higher yields, without taking much more risk than you'd take with U.S. issues."   <p> Studies of asset performance show that investors who committed10 to 15 percent of their fixed-income holdings overseas in the past eight years got the best trade-off between risk and reward. But only trained international-bond analysts should buy individual securities. Most people should invest through professionally managed mutual funds.   <p> Avoid funds that use sophisticated hedging techniques to eliminatethe impact of currency fluctuations on their portfolios. "Hedging costs money that comes out of your return," says Malekar. "It also eliminates much of the diversification benefit that makes the bonds attractive."   <p> Choose funds that hedge little or not at all. Andrew Lohmeier, an analyst for Morningstar Inc. in Chicago, recommends <a name="FUND:RPIBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/RPIBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>T. Rowe Price International Bond</b></a>, which rarely hedges. Its exposure to the U.S. dollar recently stood below 5 percent, and it leads foreign bond funds with a 12 percent five-year average annual return through September.

						December/January 1996 <p>Worth magazine/Experts  <p> RETAIN YOUR GAIN  <p> By Susan Lee  <p> Hey! it's perfectly normal. Who wouldn't be worried every time the stock market lurches down? At some point, of course, anxiety will turn into raw fear and you will decide to sell. If you are at that point now, I have a better suggestion: hedge.  <p> The virtue of this approach is twofold: You can protect some of your gains from a washout if the market does indeed tank, and you get to hold on to those little babies if the market makes new highs. The drawbacks--and they're nothing to sneeze at--are that hedging costs money, takes time, and requires a certain amount of attention.  <p> Given those drawbacks, review your stocks to determine whether the paper gains in your portfolio are large enough to justify the cost of hedging. For example, if you've been holding stocks since after the market crash in 1987, you'll likely have triple-digit gains--the market is up around 130 percent since then. If you've been holding since 1990, you'll probably have fat, double-digit gains--the market is up about 65 percent. Appreciation numbers like those are important enough to want to preserve. Also, realize that if you sell now, you'll lose 28 percent of your profit to taxes and that you'll be doubly aggrieved if Congress passes, as expected, a reduction in the long-term capital-gains tax toan effective rate of about 20 percent.   <p> Another consideration: What percent of your stock position do you want to hedge? If you think the market is only in for a 10 percent slide, then you don't really need to be guarding against utter calamity.  <p> Two popular ways of hedging a potential decline in the market are to sell call options and to buy put options. Let's first examine the strategy of selling call options; that is, selling the right to call away some of your shares. Say you sell a contract with an exercise price that reflects the current market value of your stock. If the stock price then falls, the buyer will let the option expire unused, because it makes no sense to buy your shares at a price that is now higher than the market price.The money you made on the sale of the option will cushion the loss in your actual stock. (Of course you will owe short-term capital-gains tax on your sale, but since you are not hedging your entire position and you still have considerable gains left in your actual shares, the comparative tax bite will be more like a nibble.)  <p> Such an outcome would certainly be attractive, and that's why selling call options is so appealing to investors--and to brokers. Unfortunately, these sales folks often neglect to mention the downside, which is pretty steep.   <p> What's that? Well, think about what will happen if things don't go as planned and the price of your stock actually goes up. Now, you are faced with the gloomy possibility of having your (now cheap) shares called away by an option buyer. In that case, you will not only lose your stock, you will be liable for the capital-gains tax. Not so attractive, after all, eh?  <p> One way around this problem is to tell your broker that if your option contract is exercised, you don't want one share of your inventory of existing stock touched, and that he or she should go into the market and buy fresh shares to settle your contract. This works under certain circumstances, but you'll have to pay a premium.   <p> Consider, too, another slightly trickier way: If you have big capital gains in a stock like <a name="NYSE:GM"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10640"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>General Motors</b></a>, you could sell call options in another "proxy" stock that tends to move in tandem with  GM, like <a name="NYSE:F"></a><a href="http://www.hoovers.com/cgi-bin/brand_worth_mlist.cgi?mode=full&index_code=10597"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Ford</b></a>. Since you don't own Ford stock to cover the option, you'll be selling what's known as a "naked" call. Then, if the price of both stocks falls, you will at least be ahead the money from the option sale because the buyer will let it expire unexercised.   <p> If both GM and Ford go up, on the other hand, an option holder might wish to buy your (nonexistent) shares of Ford. Then you will have to go into the market and buy them at their increased price. This is expensive and unpleasant, granted, but not only will you get to keep your GM shares and keep your gains safe from taxes, your option position will have generated a short-term tax loss. And the (paper) appreciation of your GM shares will make you feel better about your option loss on Ford.  <p> The danger of course, is that GM could go down while Ford goes up. In that case, you will still have a short-term tax loss, but without the appreciation in GM to cheer you up--and that could be really unpleasant. Moreover, this strategy, while it may make you sound clever around the watercooler, really only works if you have just a few stocks with really big gains--you certainly don't want to root around searching for a bunch of proxy stocks to write naked options on.  <p> But maybe all of this call writing sounds too fancy, too sweaty-palms to bother with. If so, consider the comparatively vanilla strategy of buying put options on your stock; that is,  buying the right to put the shares to the seller. Since you are buying, rather than selling, a contract, you are out the cash initially.   <p> Again, assume for simplicity's sake that you purchase options around the current price of the stock. If your stock drops like a stone, your put options become valuable and you can sell them for cash (and for a higher price than you paid for them). That's the preferred approach, although you could exercise your options by buying the now-cheaper stock and putting it to the buyer at the higher option price.  <p> If, on the other hand, the price of your stock goes up, your puts will be worthless and you will allow them to expire unexercised. The loss on your puts will be cushioned by the appreciation of your actual shares.   <p> Buying puts, while admittedly less exciting than selling calls,would be my strategy of choice for two reasons. First, it carries only limited and known risk (the price you pay for the puts). Second, it ensures that you will retain your stock, allowing you to benefit from any future price increases and avoiding the immediate payment of the capital-gains tax.  <p> Okay, so far so good. But what if you have a well-diversified portfolio and are holding lots and lots of stocks? Selling calls or buying puts on each of them individually could require a great deal of time and attention. Indeed, it could take on the aspects of a rather pricey hobby. If that's the case, you may want to consider hedging a market fall with options on a stock market index. It's the same general idea, except that it is simpler and cheaper than using individual options, and since index options are settled in cash, you sidestep the danger of paying taxes on capital gains in your portfolio.  <p> Say you sell call options on the Standard & Poor's 100 index at about the current price of the index. If the market plunges, the buyer will let the option expire unexercised, and the money you made on the sale will cushion the loss in your stock portfolio. If the market spikes up, however, the buyer will require you to settle the option in cash--at a price that reflects the new, higher value of the index option. Your portfolio will have increased in value, but you will have lost money on your option.  <p> Buy puts on a stock market index, on the other hand, and you can exercise them for cash if the market tanks, thereby dampening your portfolio loss. Or, if the market moves up, you can let the put options expire worthless--but the money you lost on the options will limit the gains in your portfolio.  <p> As you have probably realized by now, using options is not forsissies. For starters, it requires investors to stay absolutely alert to what's happening in the market. You must not only be current on the price of your stock, but since most options run for three months, you have to pay attention to expiration dates in order to maintain your hedges. More important, although hedging will soften your losses if the market falls, the flip side is that it will dampen your gains if the market goes up.  <p> Susan Lee is an economist and a contributing editor to Worth. <p><p><p>

						Ignore the Wall Street swamis and your brother-in-law. Here's how to do your own economic forecasting.  <p>
 By Susan Lee  <p>
 Everybody but everybody knows that economic forecasting is a mug's game. Even the forecasting swamis know it. So why then do they continue to make predictions, why do business publications continue to run articles based on those predictions, and why oh why do we all keep reading them? Partly because every so often, mostly in a totally random way, a forecast will be correct. And, for investors, those chance occurrences become a form of entrapment. Think back: If, on October 15, 1987, your tea leaves had foreshadowed the following week's market crash, would you ever drink coffee again?  <p>
 Of course, most people face less dramatic circumstances. Consider: if you are sitting on a little pile of cash, you don't want to pump it into stocks just when economic growth is peaking and then, as company earnings slide, spend the next two years watching your capital diminish in a slow and sickening way while you listen to your stick-in-the-mud brother-in-law, who bought bonds, crow. Nope. You want to invest when the economy is at a bottom, not a top. Who doesn't?  <p>
 So short of reading the swamis or listening to your brother-in-law, what's a person to do? One harmless way to quench your thirst for prophecy is to make your own forecasts. Many people do watch their own personal indicators. I know one former member of the Fed who used to drive around suburban Detroit before Christmas, checking the parking lots of the big shopping malls. If the lots were packed, this was a favorable economic portent. Some rules to follow:  <p>
 Rule No. 1. Base your outlook on long-term trends. The economy--andits constituents--will always wobble around a trend. Wobbles happen weekly, monthly, and quarterly. Trends take place over a year or two. Wobble numbers are untrustworthy in two ways. First, they can be expressions of random occurrences rather than reflections of actual events. Second, the data can change as the government gets more complete numbers; figures that indicate whatever is being measured shot up in October may be revised in November to show that whatever was being measured actually slumped. Trust me: This happens all the time.  <p>
 Rule No. 2. Be alert to forces other than beltway politics. Currently, the fashionable way to forecast is to focus on what policy makers are doing in Washington. Witness the huge industry of Wall Street swamis who foretell the future by following Alan Greenspan's tennis game or listening to congressional tax debates. They volley back and forth--one week Greenspan is hailed as a master manipulator who is keeping growth on a steady climb, the next week he's guilty of pushing the economy over a cliff. One day the economy is said to be surging on the promise of tax cuts, the next day the economy is weakening ahead of those very same cuts.  <p>
 Sure, monetary and fiscal policies are important, but so are energy prices, the weather, labor strikes, the rate of growth in productivity, changing global trade flows, and so on. For any move made in D.C., there are half a dozen other forces that can nullify it. For example, the weather: Congress can cut thecapital-gains tax, but a boom from a surge in investment could be dampened by serious floods or a widespread drought that zooms food prices. And I haven't even mentioned really powerful forces like war and pestilence--or investors who get burned by a nation's sudden devaluation.  <p>
 I'm not saying Washington isn't worth paying attention to. Indeed,many of the factors that propel economic growth are now in place: energy prices and the rate of inflation are both on the low side and stable, productivity is up, and the benefits of NAFTA and the new GATT trade pacts beckon. Nonetheless, economic growth has been disappointing. Why? Because the big and potentially disruptive legislative agenda in Washington is creating a lot of uncertainty. And uncertainty dampens spending and investment.  <p>
 Rule No. 3. Don't ignore the consensus. You may need to know what it is in order to know what not to do. There are plenty of investors who owe their success to rejecting conventional wisdom. Since business publications usually declare a trend just when that trend taps out, watch them closely.  <p>
 Rule No. 4. Focus on several broad measures. Official Washington spews out hundreds of numbers that track economic health, but many are too narrow to be useful, especially when viewed alone. You could, for example, interest yourself in consumer spending, which is the biggest driver of economic activity, constituting two thirds of gross domestic product (the mother measure of thevalue of goods and services in the economy). That would mean keeping an eye on how much money consumers have to spend by looking at personal disposable (after-tax) income. You would also want to know how likely it is that consumers will spend their money, so you should factor in consumer confidence and unemployment rates. And, since folks are also inclined to borrow in order to spend, you should watch levels of consumer debt and interest rates on consumer credit.  <p>
 Thus, if income is strong, confidence high, unemployment under control, debts reasonable, and credit interest rates low, it's pretty even money that the economy will grow.  <p>
 Of course, the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so a nice exercise is to determine whether those indicators tracked the slowing of economic growth that occurred in the second quarter of this year.  <p>
 The Bureau of Economic Analysis, which is part of the Department of Commerce, publishes monthly figures on personal disposable income, unemployment rates, consumer debt, average bank primerates, and consumer sentiment. As the table above demonstrates, weakness was already apparent in April, the first month of the second quarter. Disposable income, which grew decently during the first three months of this year, shrank in April and didn't recover until June. Unemployment, which was moving down in the first quarter, bounced up. Meanwhile, the ratio of outstanding consumer credit to personal income also took a big step in the second quarter. The prime rate, on which many banks base variable credit-card rates, moved up in February and held its new higher level throughout the second quarter. Consumer optimism, which fell in February, had not recovered its January mark by June. Thus, if you had been tracking these monthly numbers, you would have known something was up (or down, in this case) well before the second quarter GDP figure confirmed it.  <p>
 Now, if your eyes are still tracking, you will be saying, "Wait! The author has ignored Rule No. 1 by focusing on wobbles, not long-term trends." And you would be right. My excuse is that I am following Rule No. 4 and looking at several variables as part of a broad category, and when all those numbers wobble in an unfavorable direction, it is reasonable to assume that something real and unpleasant is happening.  <p>
 In retrospect, we know that something real was happening because growth slowed from 2.7 percent in the first quarter to 1.1 percent in the second. But that begs another question: how can you tell if what you see is part of a trend? Well, you can't. You have been alerted to the possibility that the economy is at a turning point, but you won't know for sure until results for another quarter or two are logged. Which brings me to:  <p>
 Rule No. 5. Don't get too wedded to your own forecast. If something happens to throw your prognostications in doubt, be prepared to pull an about-face. As the seesawing swamis demonstrate, flexibility is essential. In other words, not only can you forecast to your heart's content, but the more you do it, the better your forecast will be.  <p>

						October 1995 <p>Worth magazine/Advisor  <p> TECHNICAL ANALYSIS: A PRIMER <p>What to buy, when to buy it, and when to sell it these are the basic questions facing every investor. The pros have two answers: fundamental and technical analysis.   <p> By Jonathan Butler  <p> Fundamentalists scrutinize balance sheets, talk to chief financial officers, and evaluate product lines to predict a company's performance and, by extension, its stock price. Technicians, on the other hand, don't care whether a company builds cars or roasts coffee or whether its bottom line is red or black. Instead, they use historical statistics of investor supply and demand to extrapolate future stock-price patterns. "I can put my feet up on my desk while all the analysts are out there digging away because I don't need to know what the story is," says Justin Mamis, chief market technician at Hancock Institutional Equity Services in New York." All I care about is how people feel about those particular stocks as shown by their putting money in and taking their money out." <p> Few people are as faithful to a single approach; most market professionals use both fundamental and technical analysis daily and recommend that amateurs do the same. "The individual has to use them both in common," says Edward Nicoski, director of technical research at Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis. "Because the market is an anticipatory device, you're typically going to see the turns in stocks more quickly looking at charts than by being a fundamentalist and reading the front page. However, if there's really something fundamentally wrong that nobody knows about yet, the chart's not going to help you."  <p> Entire books have been written on the subject of technical analysis, and some people spend their lives learning the trade, but there is a basic core of information and tools accessible and intelligible to the individual stock picker and 401(k) participant that no investor should be without.  <p> Technical analysis dates back to the rice markets of 17th-century Japan. It tries to reduce the apparently random character of markets to statistical patterns predictive of future price trends among individual stocks, industry sectors, and market averages (it also applies in other markets, such as bonds, currencies, and commodities). The technician's premise, say Robert D. Edwards and John Magee in Technical Analysis of Stock Trends, the industry's bible, is that "prices move in trends and trends tend to continue until something happens to change the supply-demand balance." <p> While the ultimate goal of technical analysis is to identify changes in the direction of stocks, Mamis notes that investors don't need to pick the absolute highs and lows to make a lot of money. "If you've made a Faustian pact with the devil to get out within 10 percent of the high all the time, that's all you need," he says.  <p> CHART WORSHIP <p>The technician's most important tool is the chart, which allows him or her to identify trends and patterns in a single stock or average, as well as to compare the two.  There are three ways to graphically represent stock-price movement.  The familiar line chart uses one number usually the closing price to reflectthe day's price movement. The bar chart, perhaps the most frequently used, shows the high, low, and closing prices within a given time frame, usually a day, week, or month. Most bar charts also include corresponding trading volumes along the bottom.  <p> Both of these charts plot the price at specific time intervals, whether or not prices have changed. The third type of chart, the point-and-figure chart, records a price only when it fluctuates by a predetermined amount, usually one point or more. Upward movements are plotted using the letter x, while downward movements are denoted by the letter o. This is a good way to track price momentum, but since point-and-figure charts disregard time and volume and are difficult to interpret, professionals recommend that amateur investors focus on lines and bars.  <p><p>

						October 1995   <p>Worth  magazine/Advisor  <p> DOWSING FOR WATER UTILITY STOCKS  <p> By Nick Ravo  <p> When industry analysts talk about the stodgy world of utility stocks, they usually mean electricity producers or natural gas distributors. But there is a tiny subsector of utilities that virtually escapes Wall Street's notice: water companies. You practically need a dowsing rod to find them in the financial pages.  <p> "Many people don't even know about them because they are so few in number and most are very small regional operations," says Steven D. Seibel, editor of Water Investment Newsletter in Halstead, Kansas, which follows the industry. "They're not glamorous, either, even by utility standards."  <p> There are roughly 59,000 water systems in the United States, collecting, treating, and selling water to residential and commercial users. Almost all of them are owned by municipalities or private investors. Seventeen, however, mostly in California and the Northeast, are publicly traded and are, as the saying goes, generally considered safe enough for widows and orphans. United Water Resources in Harrington Park, New Jersey, for example, has paid dividends every year since 1886. The Middlesex Water Co. of Iselin, New Jersey, has been selling water since 1897.  <p> The median dividend yield on water stocks is 6.5 percent, versus 6.6 percent for electricity stocks (and 2.4 percent for the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index), but they are the most stable of all utilities because they attract little institutional interestand hence rarely trade in large blocks. (The average beta, a measure of market volatility, is 0.4 for the water industry, 0.6 for electric utilities, and 1.0 for the S&P 500.)  <p> "These are stable long-term stocks for income-oriented investors and perhaps also for people who feel the market is too high and who are looking for something defensive," says J.C. Whitfield, publisher of Whitfield's Utilities Letter in Houston. "You're not going to be making a quick buck here.  <p> That doesn't mean growth-seeking investors should ignore these companies. "If you look at the total return the share-price growth and the dividend some of these companies have done really, really well and with little risk," says Robin M. Rather of St. Louis brokerage Edward D. Jones & Co. She is one of the few water-stock analysts in the nation.  <p> Rather notes that the total return of Voorhees, New Jersey­based American Water Works, the nation's largest investor-owned water utility with 1.7 million customers in 21 states, has averaged12.7 percent annual growth over the last five years. This utility has expanded rapidly of late, Rather says, and so might other water companies, as rising costs and tougher water-quality standards force municipalities to leave the business to the nimbler, more entrepreneurial private firms. She also sees United Water Resources and Philadelphia Suburban Corp., based in Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, as good growth candidates.  <p> "The water industry also looks like something of a safe haven in the utilities sector because of volatile natural gas pricesand with electric utilities' concerns over nuclear-power decommissioning costs and competition because of deregulation," says Rather. <p> In addition, investors can boost their returns in many water stocks by buying shares (at discounts of up to 5 percent) through shareholder-investment and dividend-reinvestment plans. (See "The Poor Man's Arbitrage," July/August, for more on discount direct-purchase plans.)  <p> The risk with these stocks is a sharp rise in interest rates. Indeed, when the Federal Reserve Board upped rates six times in1994, the total return for the 14 stocks that compose the Edward D. Jones Water Utility Index was minus 6.8 percent, compared with minus 7.9 percent for the Standard & Poor's Utility Index. <p> If interest rates stay put or drop in 1995, however, share prices of water utilities should increase. Utility stocks have historically risen about 15 percent for each percentage-point decrease ininterest rates.  <p> Weather, too, can affect a water company's earnings; either too much or too little rain can dampen profits. Environmental regulations, which usually cause costs to rise, are also of some concern. There is little price competition in the industry, however, and demand for the product is growing. Perhaps more important, rising demand can almost be taken for granted, a situation not found in most industries. As J.C. Whitfield puts it, "Water is in many ways more important than oil."  <p> So far this year, with one rate increase and one decrease by the Federal Reserve, most water utility stocks have risen. AmericanWater Works has led the way; as of August 9, its share price was up 11.5 percent in 1995.  <p> Nick Ravo is a reporter at The New York Times.
