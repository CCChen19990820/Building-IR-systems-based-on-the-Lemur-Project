<H2>Philippines</H2>
<B>  MANILA, Philippines (AP)</B> - Gunmen believed to be Communist 
rebels ambushed and killed two American civilians working at a U.S. 
military base Tuesday, shortly before Vice President Dan Quayle arrived 
to discuss the future of U.S. military installations in the 
Philippines.<P>
	On Wednesday, Quayle condemmed the killings as ``cowardly 
murders'' and said the slayings will ``only serve to strengthen'' U.S. 
support for for President Corazon Aquino.<P>
	The victims were employees of Ford Aerospace Corp., which 
contracts to maintain an electronic warfare training range at Camp 
O'Donnell. The camp is a U.S.-run facility about 50 miles north of 
Manila and 12 miles from the U.S. Clark Air Base.<P>
	Ford Aerospace spokesman Norman Black identified the victims as 
William H. Thompson, 45, and Donald G. Buchner, 44. He said both were 
retired from the U.S. Air Force. Their hometowns were not known.<P>
	Also Tuesday, gunmen killed a member of President Aquino's 
presidential guard, about a mile from where the president will meet with 
Quayle on Wednesday.<P>
	The attacks followed a series of bombings this month and came amid 
growing opposition to U.S. military installations in the Philippines.<P>
	The Americans slowed their car as they approached a dump truck and 
a jeep blocking a highway near Capas, 60 miles north of Manila, police 
said. Six men sprang from the jeep and riddled their car with gunfire, 
according to police Lt. Pepito Pimentel.<P>
	The assailants then opened the car door and pumped bullets into 
the victims, Pimentel said. The attack occurred about 5 p.m.<P>
	``We deplore this senseless and cowardly act of terrorism,'' State 
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said in Washington. ``Acts like 
this will not deter us in our resolve to support the democratic 
government in the Philippines.''<P>
	Col. Florentino Amorabon, a spokesman for the Philippine 
Constabulary in central Luzon island, said the assassins were believed 
to be members of the New Peoples Army, which operates in the area.<P>
	In April, rebels killed U.S. Army Col. James Rowe as he was 
driving to the headquarters of the U.S. Joint Military Assistance Group 
in Quezon City, near Manila. In October 1987, rebels killed three 
Americans in simultaneous attacks outside Clark Air Base.<P>
	The United States operates Clark Air Base, the Subic Bay naval 
base and four smaller installations in the Philippines, but there are 
increased calls for an end to the U.S. military presence.<P>
	As Quayle arrived, hundreds of leftists burned his effigy and an 
American flag while chanting ``Bases out!, Quayle go home!''<P>
	Quayle arrived in Manila about 7:30 p.m. from Japan for a visit 
expected to focus on the future of the bases, which operate under a 
lease that expires in September 1991.<P>

<H2>Leftists End Embassy Seizure</H2>
<B>SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador (AP)</B> - Activists freed their 12 
hostages and ended a 28-hour seige at the Costa Rican Embassy to protest 
alleged human rights violations by the rightist government.<P>
	Government spokesman Mauricio Sandoval called the embassy takeover 
``an affront to the government and people of Costa Rica ... a violent 
action that makes no sense.'' He alleged the group's activists had 
``direct links'' to leftist guerrillas fighting Salvadoran governments 
for 10 years.<P>
	Some of the 20 members of the Federation of Committees of Mothers 
and Relatives of Political Prisoners who took part in the incident may 
be charged, he said without elaboration.<P>
	The activists, mostly mothers and other female relatives of people 
jailed or killed by right-wing death squads over the past decade, 
released their hostages Friday. Hostages and activists were taken away 
in six International Red Cross vehicles.<P>
	Police would not let reporters talk to evacuees. None of the 
hostages - one Costa Rican diplomat and 11 Salvadorans employed in the 
embassy - appeared harmed.<P>
	Sandoval said the hostages were taken to Red Cross headquarters in 
San Salvador for medical checks before being sent home and the activists 
returned to their group's headquarters.<P>
	The government spokesman said the activists apparently left their 
weapons ``inside the offices or hidden,'' because they boarded the Red 
Cross vehicles unarmed. The activists had insisted they were not armed, 
but Costa Rican diplomats said they carried weapons.<P>
	 The activists arrived in small groups early Thursday, pretending 
to apply for visas, then seized the embassy and took 16 hostages. They 
later allowed Ambassador Jesus Fernandez, who had heart trouble, and 
some employees to leave. A spokeswoman for the activists, who did not 
give her name, told reporters earlier the hostage-taking was to protest 
alleged human rights violations by President Alfredo Cristiani's 
rightist government, which took power June 1. It also was to bring 
pressure for ``concrete measures'' to end the war.<P>
	For eight years, the federation has protested the kidnappings and 
killings of people suspected of leftist sympathies by rightist death 
squads. More than 70,000 people have died in the decade-old war, most of 
them civilians.<P>

<H2>Andean Leaders Invite Bush</H2>
<B>ICA, Peru (AP)</B> - The presidents of Peru, Colombia and Bolivia, 
where the illegal cocaine trade has its roots, invited President Bush on 
Tuesday to attend a drug summit within 90 days. He accepted 
immediately.<P>
	In a brief communique at the end of a five-hour meeting on a 
common anti-drug strategy, the leaders said European leaders also should 
take part in the summit, to be held in Latin America. They pledged to 
continue ``all-out war'' on drug trafficking.<P>
	White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said: ``The president 
will go.'' He said 90 days was ``within the time frame we have been 
considering. It's reasonable.''<P>
	In their communique, Presidents Alan Garcia of Peru, Virgilio 
Barco of Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia said both the 
production and consumption of cocaine must be addressed.<P>
	The statement appeared to reflect Latin American concern over 
Bush's emphasis on police and military actions against the trade.<P>
	Garcia, Barco and Paz suggested details of the summit be worked 
out at a meeting Nov. 20 in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, of lower-level 
officials.<P>
	 Fitzwater said the United States had no objection to 
participation by Europeans and security concerns would not stand in the 
way of a summit. Of a planning meeting Nov. 20, he said: ``I'm sure 
that's fine with us.''<P>
	Garcia has been promoting inclusion of European nations as active 
participants in a war against the cocaine traffic. If the United States 
is successful in slowing the flow of cocaine over its borders, he says, 
smugglers will shift their focus to Europe.<P>
	The Peruvian president read the communique to hundreds of 
reporters gathered in Ica for the closed-door summit, but did not answer 
questions.<P>
	A battalion of 300 soldiers guarded the Las Dunas Hotel, site of 
the meeting, and 3,000 plainclothes policemen circulated in this desert 
city of 350,000 people 185 miles southeast of Lima.<P>
	Heavy security was ordered in case of attacks by the Shining Path, 
a Maoist guerrilla group that has fought Peruvian governments since 1980 
and works with traffickers in Peru's Upper Huallaga Valley, source of 
more than 60 percent of the world's coca leaf, the raw material or 
cocaine.<P>
	A bomb exploded before dawn Tuesday in Trujillo, a northern city 
where five Latin American foreign ministers were meeting to prepare the 
agenda for a summit of the Group of Eight countries that begins 
Wednesday in Ica.<P>
	It went off at the offices of a public housing agency, damaging 
the building but causing no injuries. Police said no group claimed 
responsibility.<P>
	Ica suffered two brief blackouts Tuesday morning, but officials 
said technical problems caused them, not sabotage.<P>
	Peru, Colombia and Bolivia have said military-style repression of 
the drug trade should be accompanied by more U.S. economic aid to 
provide alternative crops or sources of income for the hundreds of 
thousands of peasants who grow coca.<P>
	Barco began a crackdown on Colombian cocaine barons Aug. 19 and 
has received $65 million worth of U.S. military aid to help in the 
effort.<P>

<H2>Venezuela Targets Coke Demand</H2>
<B>ICA, Peru (AP)</B> - Police action against cocaine suppliers is 
futile unless the United States and Europe reduce the demand that drives 
the illicit trade, President Carlos Andres Perez of<P>
Venezuela said Wednesday.<P>
   Perez spoke on opening day of a summit of seven Latin American 
presidents in this desert city that also is to consider expelling Panama 
as the eighth member of the Group of Eight regional organization.<P>
   Panama's membership was suspended in 1988 after Gen. Manuel Antonio 
Noriega arranged the dismissal of President Eric Delvalle, who had tried 
to fire Noriega as military commander.<P>
   The Venezuelan leader called Noriega's military rule a ``masked 
dictatorship.'' President Alan Garcia of Peru used his opening remarks 
to ``express publicly the Peruvian people's and the Peruvian 
government's repudiation and condemnation of the military 
dictatorship.''<P>
   Peru and Venezuela were expected to push for expulsion of Panama, but 
diplomatic sources said Mexico and some other members felt that would 
amount to meddling with the internal affairs of another country.<P>
   Among items on the summit's agenda besides drug trafficking are 
Central America's conflicts, foreign debt and environmental damage to 
the Amazon jungle.<P>
   In his remarks on the drug trade, Peres said: ``The more demand grows 
in the north, the more production will grow in the south. Police actions 
will be useless unless demand is reduced.''<P>
   Other opening statements also expressed support for Peru, Colombia 
and Bolivia, which argue that President Bush's emphasis on attacking the 
cocaine traffic at the source is not enough.<P>
   The summit began the day after Presidents Garcia, Virgilio Barco of 
Colombia and Jaime Paz Zamora of Bolivia invited Bush to attend a drug 
summit in Latin America within 90 days. Bush accepted immediately.<P>
   Paz did not remain for the Group of Eight meeting because Bolivia is 
not a member. Garcia and Barco were joined by Perez of Venezuela, Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari of Mexico, Jose Sarney of Brazil, Carlos Menem of 
Argentina and Julio Sanguinetti of Uruguay at the third summit since the 
regional organization was formed in 1987.<P>
   The three-day meeting is being conducted in closed session at the 
Hotel Las Dunas on the outskirts of Ica, a city of 350,000 people 185 
miles southeast of Lima.<P>
   An army battlion of 300 soldiers guarded the hotel and 3,000 
plaincothes policemen circulated in the city in case of attacks by 
Shining Path, a Maoist guerrilla group that began fighting Peruvian 
governments in 1980. The insurgency has cost 15,000 lives by government 
count.<P>
   A car bomb police blamed on Shining Path exploded Tuesday night 
outside an auto parts store in residential Lima, wounding a guard and 
blowing out the windows of the shop and nearby buildings.<P>
   Police said rebels also shot and killed a woman candidate for deputy 
mayor of a Lima district Tuesday night, firing three bullets into her 
head as she stood behind the counter of her pharmacy.<P>
   Official reports said 26 other people were killed in seven incidents 
Tuesday night and Wednesday, including nine policemen, two mayors and 
two rural mayoral candidates.<P>
BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) - <P>
Two Burmese students hijacked a Burmese airliner Friday and forced it to 
land at a Thai military airfield, where they submitted a list of demands 
and held the 85 people aboard hostage, an army officer said.<P>
   Col. Somchai Dhanarajata of Thailand's Supreme Command Joint 
Operations Center said the plane belongs to Myanmar Airways, Burma's 
national carrier, and was on a domestic flight when it was hijacked to 
Thailand, Burma's neighbor.<P>
   The plane landed at 5:40 p.m. in Utaphao, 80 miles southeast of 
Bangkok, and the hijackers presented a list of demands to military 
officials at the airfield, Somchai said. He did not describe the 
demands.<P>
   Burmese officials in Rangoon, who requested anonymity, confirmed that 
the hijacking had occurred but gave no further details. They said a 
government announcement would be made later tonight.<P>
  It was the first known hijack of a Burmese aircraft in recent 
decades.<P>
   No further details were immediately available, and it was not known 
whether the students are involved with Burma's pro-democracy 
movement.<P>
   Thousands of Burmese students joined ethnic rebel groups along the 
Thai-Burmese border after Burmese troops crushed a student-led uprising 
in Burma in September 1988, killing thousands of people demonstrating 
against years of authoritarian repression.<P>
   The crackdown on dissent continued this year, and a Rangoon military 
tribunal recently sentenced three students to death for allegedly 
planting a bomb at an oil refinery near Rangoon which killed two people 
in July.<P>
   The government blamed this and another explosion in July at Rangoon's 
City Hall on students groups in contact with the insurgents.<P>
  Diplomats and dissidents say several thousand pro-democracy supporters 
have been arrested since July, when the two leading opposition 
politicians, Aung San Suu Kyi and Tin Oo, were placed under house 
arrest.<P>

<H2>BRITAIN-BLAST</H2>
<B>LONDON (AP)</B> - An explosion Friday at the Royal Marines School of 
Music in a southeastern coastal town caused one building to collapse, 
killing six people, officials said. Another 30 people were injured and 
seven were missing. Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons said it 
was too early to speculate whether a bomb caused the blast.<P>
<P>
<H2>RUSHDIE-BOMBING</H2>
<B>YORK, England (AP)</B> - A small bomb shattered the window of a York 
bookstore owned by the publisher of Salman Rushdie's novel ``Satanic 
Verses'' and bombs were found at three of the publisher's stores in 
other towns, police say. The Viking Penguin bookstore in the center of 
this northern city was closed Wednesday night when the blast occurred, 
causing minor damage and no injuries.<P>
One women seriously injured but recovering, two men suffer from shock.  
Store was next to Penguin Books, a store selling Rusdie's "Satanic 
Verses".  AP copyrighted story, see "Explosion in London Injures 1"<P>

<H2>FBI Can Catch Fugitives Abroad</H2>
<B>LOS ANGELES (AP)</B> - <P>
The Justice Department has given the FBI a go-ahead to arrest 
U.S.fugitives in foreign countries without the nations' consent, it was 
reported Friday.<P>
   Assistant Attorney General William P. Barr issued the legal opinion 
allowing the policy change on June 21, the Los Angeles Times reported in 
Friday's editions.<P>
   The action reversed a Carter administration ruling in March 1980 that 
denied the FBI authority to seize fugitives in foreign countries and 
warned that agents who disobeyed could face kidnapping charges.<P>
   There was no indication any fugitives have been arrested under the 
new ruling. It could be important, however, in such celebrated cases as 
terrorist attacks in the Middle East or U.S. efforts to bring Panamanian 
Gen. Manuel Noriega to trial in Florida on drug trafficking charges. And 
use of the ruling could draw protests from abroad that sovereignty is 
being violated.<P>
   The Times did not report whether it learned of the policy shift from 
documents or sources within the Justice Department.<P>
   Barr, the attorney general's chief legal adviser as head of the 
Office of Legal Counsel, refused to discuss or confirm the existence of 
the order with the Times.<P>
   ``I just don't discuss the work of the office of legal counsel,'' 
Barr said. ``The office ... provides legal advice throughout the 
administration and does it on a confidential basis.''<P>
   The Times reported that several other officials refused to discuss 
the ruling, originally requested by Attorney General Dick Thornburgh.<P>
   The secrecy was unusual because the order does not carry a security 
classification and the Carter administration ruling was made public.<P>

Many of these businesses cater to customers who may themselves be new to the Internet, and in fact may not be all that computer literate.  In fact some may find the Internet somewhat overwhelming.  Equally important, of course, are those new customers who are Internet literate but perhaps not as familiar with the products being offered. 
<p>
To lessen that culture shock, this area is designed to provide for easy access to several new home pages, places where each of these new businesses can deliver their messages to current and potentially new customers. 
<p>
Below we show a number of these businesses, each represented by a small icon or graphic.  Simply click on the graphic and you will find yourself browsing around in the specified area. If you are interested in opening a channel into this new medium to your business, check out <a href="http://www.onestep.com/onestep/index.html"><b>OneStep Internet Services</b></a>.  Whether it be your own in-house server you have in mind, or a turn key affair at our facility, we can help.  We'll even help you build your own! 
<p>
All work and no play is pretty silly when working with a medium like the Internet, especially since a fair amount of "foot" traffic is found in the evenings.  Thus this web server also offers some space for fun and personal home pages.  If you are interested in having your own <a href="http://www.onestep.com/onestep/persweb.htm">personal home page</a>, "walk" over to the OneStep home page and let us know what you are thinking about.  We have placed a number of folks on board for free...just to see how their ideas will go over.

<H1>World Trade Center Bombing</H1>
   <P>
<B>POLICE SAY WORLD TRADE BOMB PLANTED ON PARKING GARAGE RAMP - NEW 
YORK  (MARCH 3) UPI</B> - Police investigators have located "ground zero" 
of the bomb that ripped through the base of the World Trade Center - a 
ramp of a parking garage directly beneath the V ista Hotel. <P>
  	Lt. Walter Boser, head of the police department's bomb squad, said 
Wednesday investigators have determined the "seat" of the explosion to 
be on a ramp leading to the B2 parking level, two floors below street 
level and directly beneath the hotel. <P>
  	The Vista Hotel is at the foot of the south tower, which bore the 
brunt of the deadly blast. <P>
 	Five people are known to have died in Friday's lunchtime explosion 
and 1,042 were injured. The blast rocked the foundation of the center's 
110-story twin towers, the city's tallest buildings. <P>
  	But Bosner and other law enforcement officials refused to 
speculate further on what finding where the bomb went off tells 
investigators looking for clues as to the bombers' method and 
identities. <P>
  	"I don't know what happened on the ramp," Police Commissioner 
Raymond Kelly said. <P>
 	Heat from the explosion melted the paint off scores of cars parked 
in the garage, and its force peeled back walls "like petals of a 
flower," Boser said. <P>
  	"I know I'm safe if I say it was in excess of several hundred 
pounds" of explosives, Boser said. "There's no one I know that could 
walk in with that undetected." <P>
 	The restaurant was empty at the time, and the subway station was 
not as congested as it would have been if the bomb had gone off at rush 
hour, factors that actually limited the number of dead and injured, 
Boser said. <P>
 	The lieutenant showed slides of the devastation caused by the bomb 
to reporters at what has become a daily briefing by law enforcement 
authorities. <P>
  	The pictures showed the wreckage of burned and shredded cars, 
ripped steel and chunks of exposed concrete, exposed pipes and live 
utility cables lining the perimeter of a gaping crater. <P>
 	Bosner said the explosion caused "a tremendous release of energy, 
with not a single place to go because it was all closed in." <P>
 	"That's why it did such damage," he said. <P>
    	 Newsday and the New York Post reported Wednesday that authorities 
believe the bombers drove into the underground parking garage in two 
vehicles, both possibly vans, transferred the explosives to one vehicle 
and then drove out in the other. <P>
  	But Kelly said Wednesday such reports were based on "wild 
speculation." <P>
 	Newsday and the Daily News said the odor of the decaying remains 
of one or more of the bombers could be smelled coming from the rubble. 
<P>
 	But Fox discounted the reports. <P>
    	"We have no reason to believe the bodies of the bombers are at the 
bottom of the crater," he said. "It's entirely possible, but there's 
nothing to indicate that." <P>
 	One person remained missing. Wilfredo Mercado, a 37-year-old <P>
 restaurant buyer last seen unloading supplies in the underground 
parking garage level where the bomb went off, was believed to have been 
buried by debris. <P>
  	Fox and Kelly said the first of the 63 calls claiming 
responsibility for the bomb, which came in more than an hour afterwards 
and claimed to be from Serbian nationalists, was considered more 
"credible" than the others. <P>
 	"If you have to say one of the 63 is more credible, I suppose that 
one is more credible. I hesitate to even use that term, though," Fox 
said, adding that the agency had no evidence to "zero in" on any 
particular terrorist group. <P>
 	"It was the first one after the blast and I believe the language 
used there was, 'This was no accident,"' Fox said of the first call. <P>
  	Initial media reports attributed the blast to an underground 
transformer explosion or a subway mishap. <P>
 	But, Fox added, "To really have credibility...I think the call had 
to come in any time just before the blast." <P>
  	Kelly refused to discuss the nature of subsequent calls, saying 
information on the first phone call leaked out. "We think it undermines 
the investigation to get into specifics of additional phone calls." <P>
  	The city has placed a $200,000 bounty on the bombers - the largest 
such reward in city history. <P>
  	The bombing has brought increased security concerns throughout the 
city, as police report receiving hundreds of bomb threats since Friday. 
Several buildings have been evacuated as a precaution. <P>
 	 While no one has taken responsibility for the bombing, one 
internationally known criminal has denied having anything to do with it. 
<P>
 	Wednesday, The New York Times quoted fugitive Colombian drug lord 
Pablo Escobar, as saying in faxed written statements dated Feb. 26, the 
day of the bombing, that he had "no role in this attack." <P>
	"They can take me off the list, because if I had done it, I would 
be saying why and I would be saying what I want," Escobar said. <P>
	The twin towers were not expected to reopen until emergency and 
fire alarm systems were repaired and heat and air conditioning restored. 
<P>
  	 City officials estimate the first week after the explosion could 
cost the city nearly $700 million in losses, with the second week 
expected to add another $195 million.   <P>

<B>POST AUTHORITY SAYS WORLD TRADE CENTER TO CLOSE FOR A MONTH, REWARD 
OFFERED NEW YORK (MARCH 3) DPA</B> - The World Trade <P>
 Center, hit by a serious bomb blast last Friday, is to remain shut for 
at least a month, spokesmen for the Port Authority of New York, which 
owns the 110-storey building, said Wednesday. <P>
  The spokesmen did hold out any hope that the 50,000-odd employees with 
jobs at the Center could return to the building later in the week, 
saying that the six-floor-deep foundations, badly damaged in the blast, 
would have to be carefully strengthened <P>
  Experts were preparing to check to what extent the steel structure of 
the Center's twin towers had been affected by the explosion and what 
could be done to stabilise them if need be. <P>
  The continuing disruption is causing increasing financial problems for 
the 350 firms operating in the world's second tallest building. They are 
being forced to work from emergency accomodation. <P>
  Friday's explosion in the parking area below the buildings killed five 
people. The blast and its effects injured more than 1,000 others. 
Authorities believe a bomb was placed in a car in the building's parking 
area, but no suspect has been pinpointe<P>
  Some 50 calls accepting responsibility for the outrage have been made, 
with one, a call by a man saying he planted the bomb for the "Serbian 
Freedom Front" being taken as the most plausible.  <P>
  The leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Radovan Karadzic, taking part at the 
New York peace talks on Bosnia's future, said however in an open letter 
to Americans Tuesday that opponents of Serbia could have planted the 
device to blame the Serbs and whip up f eelings against them.<P>
    He wrote it could be the bomber's tactic to persuade the United 
States to intervene militarily in Bosnia. <P>
  Officials said they have found new pieces of evidence in the bombing, 
including a new videotape of the underground parking lot and fragments 
of a van that could have been involved in the attack. <P>

Translation:  Chief Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff.   
<p>
According to Viktor Suvorov in his book Soviet Military Intelligence, the GRU's role is "...to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union from an external blow...".   The GRU is a military intelligence organization, but is authorized to operate within the USSR and is thought to have less authority as the  KGB .
<p>
Here are notes from Richelson's <i><b>Sword and Shield</b></i> (consult the <a href="biblio.htm#sword">MILNET Bibliography</a> for this and other fine works by Richelson).

<p>
<ul>  
<li>Political  
<li>Military 
<li>Economic

 collection such as overhead reconnaissance and  
 intercepts (SIGINT). 
  <p>
 Reporting to the First Deputy Chief are four  
 geographical directorates, two technical directorates,  
 and four "Directions" or sections.  Each of the  
 directorates listed below has about 300 officers in

  <p>
<p>
 <h2>Chief of Information </h2>
<p>  
 The Chief of Information of the GRU is responsible for  
 analysis and reporting on information gathered by all  
 sources.  This is accomplished via the Information  
 Command Post.   
<p>  
 Also reporting to the Chief of Information are six  
 directorates (Seventh thru Twelfth), and an Institute:  
<p>  
 <ul> 
<li>Seventh Directorate:  NATO 
    
<li>Eighth Directorate:   Individual Countries 
    
<li>Ninth Directorate:    Military Technology

<dl><dt><u>Information Command Post</u> 
<dd>Reports directly to the Chief of Information.   
           All intelligence comes through the  
           Information Command Post whether it comes  
           from agents, technical sources, illegals,  
           allied intelligence services or intelligence  
           directorates of the military or Soviet forces  
           abroad.  The Information Command Post can  
           request additional information or more detail  
           as well as can double check information it  
           has received.  Preliminary processing of all  
           information occurs at the Information Command  
           Post. 
</dl>
</ul>
<p>
<p>         
<h2>The Fifth Directorate </h2>
<p>  
 Reporting to the First Deputy Chief is the Fifth  
 Directorate which is responsible for all non-human  
 intelligence collection.  It directs the activities of  
 21 intelligence directorates under the auspices of: 
 <p>
<ul> 
<li>Sixteen Military Districts 
<li> Four Groups of Forces 
<li>Fleet Intelligence (four geographical fleets, the  
      Northern, Baltic, Black Sea, and Pacific) 
</ul>
  <p> 
 The organizations of these intelligence directorates is  
 standardized with five departments and two facilities  
 group: 
<p>
  <ul>
<li>First Department:   Department of Reconnaissance,  
      responsible for supervising the reconnaissance  
      elements of military divisions and companies. 
    
<li>Second Department:  Department of Agent  
      Intelligence, responsible for recruitment of  
      agents and their acquistion of information. 
    
<li>Third Department:   Spetsnaz Department,  
      responsible for wartime psychological operations  
      such as assassination of political and military  
      leaders, the destruction of lines of  
      communications and supply, and terrorist  
      operations aimed at eroding the enemy's will to  
      continue to fight.  Preparations during peacetime  
      (to insure they are ready in the event war) may  
      account for many covert actions of the Soviets. 
    
<li>Fourth Department:  Information Department,  
      collects and collates all the intelligence flowing  
      into the intelligence directorate.   
    
<li>The Fifth Department collects electronic  
      intelligence, divided into two regiments: 
        -  Radio Intelligence Regiment communications  
           intercept (SIGINT) 
        -  Radio-Technical Intelligence Regiment - ELINT  
           (radar intercepts) 
    
<li>Technical Facilities Group, responsible for the  
      interpretation of aerial photography 
    
<li>Interpreter's Group, responsible for deciphering  
      and translation of documents acquired and the  
      interrogation of prisoners of war. 
  
  </ul>
<p>
<p>
 <h2>Fleet Intelligence </h2>
  
 Fleet Intelligence is responsible for the Fleet Cosmic  
 Intelligence (satellites) as well as the Intelligence  
 Directorates of each of the four fleets (Northern,  
 Baltic, Black Sea, and Pacific). 
 <p> 
 The fleet intelligence directorates are organized along  
 the same standard as the military districts and groups  
 of forces, with the differences being that the: 
<p>
<ul>  
<li>First Department:  Is responsible for Ship  
      Reconnaissance 
    
<li>Second Department: Seeks out and recruits agents  
      in large ports and naval bases.

<h1>Koresh:  The Waco Massacre</h1>
<p>
<B> UPDATE: FBI SEEKS PEACEFUL END TO STANDOFF DESPITE KORESH'S REFUSAL TO GIVE UP WACO, TX (MARCH 3) UPI</B> - Cult leader David Koresh told negotiators he reneged on his promise to peacefully 
 end his bloody four-day standoff with federal officers because  he 
 received a message from God telling him to wait, the FBI said Wednesday. 
<p>
  FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeff Jamar revealed Koresh's 
 explanation during a news conference, but he vowed federal 
 authorities would continue to seek a peaceful end to the siege 
 that cost the lives of four federal agents and an unknown number 
 of Koresh's followers. 
<p>
  Jamar said negotiators contacted Koresh two hours after his 58-
 minute religious message was broadcast nationally Tuesday. The 
 Branch Davidian leader had promised to surrender with his 
 followers immediately after the sermon-like statement ended. 
<p>
  "Subsequent contacts with Koresh indicated that he had received a 
 message from God instructing him to wait," he said. "The 
 negotiation team undertook efforts to convince Koresh to fulfill 
 his promise and surrender immediately. Koresh refused to honor his 
promise and has indicated he will keep his promise when he receives 
further instruction from God." 
  <p>
 Jamar also said Koresh claims there were 110 people still inside 
 the compound, more than officials had originally estimated. Jamar 
 said Koresh gave a breakdown of 20 children, 47 women and 43 men 
 still inside the 77-acre compound 10 miles east of Waco, Texas.
   <p>
  Since the siege began, Jamar said 18 children and two elderly 
 women have been released. 
  <p>
  Jamar said interviews with those who had been released and with 
 officers who took part in Sunday's gunbattle left the impression 
 that Koresh and two others were wounded. He said the interviews 
 "indicated there are some bodies in the compound, the precise number we don't know. " 
  <p>
  <p>
  When asked why the agents assaulted the compound if they knew it was heavily
armed, Hartman said "months and months" of 
 preparation had gone into the investigation and they were acting 
 because of the threat the arsenal of firearms posed to public 
 safety. 
  <p>
  "The element of surprise was essential for us to get in," Hartman 
 said. "There were over 75 women and children. We have a fire 
 discipline. We are law enforcement officers who can't fire 
 without having a target. So when we went in and they opened fire,
 we were halfway into the place when they opened fire." 
  <p>
  Child welfare officials have reported no signs of physical abuse 
 in the children released. There have been charges by former cult 
 members that Koresh physically and sexually abused children, but 
 he has denied the accusations. 
  <p>
  The siege began at 9:30 a.m. Sunday when 150 to 200 ATF agents 
 tried to execute a search warrant to look for illegal firearms 
 and explosives at the compound - located in open central Texas 
 farmland. 
  <p>
  Four ATF agents were killed and 15 wounded in the initial 
 assault. Koresh claims a 2-year-old child died, but ATF has been 
 unable to confirm it. A cult member was killed, another wounded 
 and a third arrested late Sunday in a separate firefight, ATF 
  aid. 
   <p>
  An ATF spokeswoman has admitted that the ATF agents were 
 "outgunned" by the so-called Branch Davidians, who had an arsenal 
 of firearms including a 50-caliber heavy machinegun. Criticism of 
 ATF planning is increasing. 
   <p>
  In an interview Wednesday with KRLD, retired Col. Charles 
 Beckwith, former commander of the Army's Delta Force, called the 
 ATF assault badly planned and a "disaster" for the federal 
 agency. 
  <p>
   "The ATF says they were outgunned," he said. "That, to me, is an 
 indicator that there was actually no intelligence collected from 
 inside to know precisely what the capabilities of this 
 organization were, and they just went charging in there with their
 jackets on saying ATF and everybody was suppose to lay down and 
 nobody did and as a result it was a disaster." 
<p>
   Hundreds of FBI and ATF agents, backed up by seven Bradley 
 infantry fighting vehicles and armed personnel carriers, surround 
 the Branch Davidian compound ruled by Koresh, a 33-year-old 
 former member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who claims to be Christ. 
  <p>
   The elderly women who left the compound early Tuesday were 
 charged with conspiracy to murder federal agents.  Another cult 
 member arrested Sunday is also charged with the attempted murder 
 of a federal agent.

<H1>Worldwide Acts Of Terrorism </H1>
Below we list a history of acts of terrorism, starting in 1968 and through 1986.  Of 
course terrorism has continued since 1986.  A few of the major events since 1986 are included as well, but data is not complete from 1986 onward, as the volume of events has outpaced the author's ability to report on them.  To make this point clear we also have compile 
brief snapshots of terrorism since 1986 in the  <a href="terrfile.htm">Terrfile</a> .            
<p>
Note that the majority of terrorism reported before 1980 occurred in or around Isarael and the Middle East.  This is due to the fact that world terrorism spread from the Middle East as Arab and Jew continued their ancestorial struggles.  The State of Israel considered Arab attacks on their kinsmen as an act of War, and not to be outdone, began their own retalitory acts of terror.  Their own band of terrorist/assassins ran free until the crew accidentally killed some innocents, at which time the Israeli government reigned them in (see "<i><b>The Hit Team</b></i> #25 in the <a href="biblio.htm#25">Milnet Bibliography</a>.
<p>
Since then, Israeli retaliation has been in a more miltary fashion, with excursions into neighboring countries, seizing land to create buffer zones around them.<p>
Today, the Gaza Strip, a contentious holding of the Israelis has been the scene of most of the Middle East violence over the last decade.
<p>
However you will also note from the data that Central Europe and London, United Kingdom have also had their share of terrorism from Middle Eastern concerns.
<p>
Until recently, the only country which has not faced Middle East terrorism
within its borders was the United States.  
The World Trade Center explosion was attributed to a radical Jordanian moslem 
group.  Only time will tell whether this trend continues in the U.S..  And of
course terrorist activities that target U.S. serviceman, while described by
terrorist groups as "acts of war", cannot be treated as such as their is no
declaration of war in place, nor is their a nation to declare war against. 
<p>
You will note a few instances where an act of violence is on the very gray 
edge of the line separating political violence versus terrorism... 
the difference being nearly indistinguishable at times.  
For instance, what were the motives of the assassin who took a shot at the 
Pope?  Was it anti-catholicism, anti-Rome/anti-Italy, or just a nut case 
trying to get his moment of dubious "fame"?
<p>
Here is the promised chronology on World Terrorism:

<b>What is the basis for ECCD programming and action?</b><p>
<p>
	The burgeoning of programme experiences over the last two decades has provided
a wide range of effective and financially feasible models to promote integrated
care, development and learning in the early years.  That experience offers us
options that go well beyond a narrow, "institutional" preschool approach, which
is often expensive and age-restricted. The experience with early childhood care
and development embraces complementary approaches that enhance early
development and learning in a variety of ways.  These approaches may be
directed toward a variety of different actors and programme participants such
as: parents, community workers, policy-makers, law-makers, and the public at
large (as well as young children and their siblings). These are described under
<b><A HREF="e14.html">Program Strategies</b></A><p>
<p>
	Under <b><A HREF="e10n.html">Projects and Program Profiles </b></A>, case studies are
provided of programmes that focus on parental education, on community-based and
non-formal pre-school centres, and on integrated home-day care programmes.
Descriptions are also available of experiences taking such lines of action as:
adding in a developmental component to existing health or nutrition or women's
credit programmes, working through home visits with a "cartoon curriculum,"
working with upper primary school children in a child-to-child programme, and
teaching groups of mothers to teach their children.  Lessons learned from these
and other programmes can help show how to adapt programmes to local conditions
and how to handle constraints, including cost and financial constraints.  The
examples can be adapted easily to varied conditions.<p>

<title>Policy -- legal frameworks to support young

<h1> Policy -- legal frameworks to support young
children and their families </h1><p>
<p>
<p>
	Many of us engaged in planning and creating programmes for young
children see policy as a distant, abstract process, carried out by suited
politicians sitting behind paper-laden desks. We view policymakers as
inaccessible as they make decisions about our fate, dictating national
priorities and how the national budget is to be allocated.  We are aware of
policy only when we find ourselves supported or limited by it, but most of us
do not see ourselves as active participants in the creation of policy.  In
reality, however, we are all affected by policy, or its lack, on a regular
basis.   If we are going to make a real difference in the lives of young
children and their families then we must focus our efforts on creating policies
that will allow needed resources to be shifted to structures and programmes
which can provide that support.<b></b><p>

<H1>Overview of Early Childhood 
Care and Development</H1>
<H2>Early Childhood Care and Development: A Definition</H2>
<P>
        Children do not just grow in size.  They develop, evolve, and mature,
mastering ever more complex understandings of the people, objects and
challenges in their environment. There is a general pattern or sequence for
development that is true of all children.  However, the rate, character, and
quality of development vary from child to child.  Culture influences
development in different ways, and the goals for children differ from culture
to culture.<BR>
<P>
        Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD) refers not only to what is
happening within the child, but also to the care that child requires in order
to thrive.  For a child to develop and learn in a healthy and normal way, it
is important not only to meet the basic needs for protection, food and health
care, but also to meet the basic needs for interaction and stimulation,
affection, security, and learning through exploration and discovery.<BR>
<P>
        ECCD activities are those that support young children appropriately
and seek to strengthen the environments in which they live.  ECCD includes
working with parents to strengthen parenting skills, working with siblings and
other family members to recognize the specific developmental needs of younger
children, working to provide or strengthen day care options,
developing preschools and other early childhood education programs that address the
child's needs in holistic ways, as well as striving to bolster the community
in its economic, physical, and moral support of families and young children.<BR>
<P>

<HR>
<H2>ECCD: A relatively new field of international focus</H2>
<P>
     ECCD is a relatively new field and combines elements from the fields of early childhood
education, infant stimulation, health and nutrition, community development, parent education,
sociology, anthropology, child development, and economics.  International ECCD arose from the
recognition that these elements all interact within a young child s life.  If we want to support
young children and help them to thrive, then we need to understand the many facets of their
development, and also address the contexts in which they are living.<BR>
 <P>
     When discussing Early Childhood Care and Development (ECCD), it is important to have
a common understanding of what is meant by the term.  There are three parts to the phrase:<I> early
childhood</I> -- <I> care</I> -- and <I> development</I>. <BR> 
<P>

<I><B>Early Childhood...</I></B><BR> 
<P>
As it is currently used internationally,<B><I> early childhood</B></I> is defined as the period of a child's life from
conception to age eight. <BR><P>

There are two reasons for including this age range within a definition of ECCD.  First, this time
frame is consistent with developmental psychology's view of the continuum of children's
development. Children below the age of eight learn best when they have objects they can
manipulate; when they have chances to explore the world around them; when they can experiment
and learn from trial-and-error within a safe and stimulating environment.  At about the age of nine
they begin to view the world differently.  They can manipulate ideas and learn concepts mentally
and are less dependent on objects.  Thus in terms of learning theory, the birth through age eight
time period presents a developmental continuum.<BR><P>
 
Second, the international definition of early childhood includes the early primary years (ages six-
eight) because of the importance of the transition for children either from home or from a pre-
school programme into the primary school.  If pre-school programmes for children are to be
effective, there needs to be some interface between what happens in the pre-school and lower
primary school.  This does not mean that early childhood programmes should become formal
experiences for young children.  Rather, there is a need for early primary teachers to become more
aware of the experiences, skills and knowledge that children bring with them into the primary
school if they have had an early childhood programme experience. <BR><P> 

<I><B>Care...</I></B><BR><P>

In the 1980s, the term <I><B>care</I></B> was added to the phrase early childhood development.  This was in
recognition of the fact that young children need care and nurturing.  They need attention to their
health and nutrition, their evolving emotional and social abilities, as well as their minds.  The term
<I>care</I> was chosen, rather than <I>education</I>, to move policy makers and program providers away from
thinking exclusively in terms of pre-schooling.  <BR><P>

<I><B>Development...</I></B><BR>
<P>
In the definition of ECCD being used throughout this Web site, <I><B>development</I></B> is defined as the
process of change in which the child comes to master more and more complex levels of moving,
thinking, feeling and interacting with people and objects in the environment.  Development
involves both a gradual unfolding of biologically determined characteristics and the learning
process. <I> Learning</I> is the process of acquiring knowledge, skills, habits and values through
experience and experimentation, observation, reflection, and/or study and instruction.  Both the
child's physical growth (the child's health and nutrition history and current health and nutritional
status) are crucial in the child's overall development.  The child's current developmental status
either facilitates or inhibits future learning.  Thus learning is part of the development process.
(Myers, The Twelve Who Survive 1992; 1995)<BR><P>

In many cases, the terms <I>care</I> and <I>development</I> also refer to the arrangements people make for
their children.  Day care, community or programme development, and child care are issues to look
at in addressing the needs and supporting the healthy growth of young children.<BR><P>
<HR>
<B>Some Key Principles and Beliefs of ECCD</B><BR><P>
 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*">Learning begins at conception.  From the moment of conception important developments occur
that affect the brain, the physical body, and the chemistry of the child.  These all have an impact
on that child s ability to learn, to thrive, to grow and be healthy.<BR><P>

 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*"> The first 6 years of a child s life form the foundation for all later development.  Developmental
psychologists have demonstrated that in the early years a child develops all the basic brain and
physiological structures upon which later growth and learning are dependent.  Emotionally and
socially, as well, the child develops many of the abilities upon which later social functioning is
based.  <BR><P>

  <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*">Attention to young children from the beginning can help to prevent later difficulties.  Good
nutrition, nurturing, mental stimulation and interactions for infants are the best  preventive 
measure for avoiding developmental delays and disturbances. <BR><P> 

 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*"> Development and learning occur as children interact with people and things in the environment. 
Therefore, we can foster learning and development by making the environment more supportive. 
That involves creating a healthy environment, and providing space and things and opportunities to
help children to learn through play, whether at home or elsewhere .  It involves enabling parents
and other caregivers to encourage, nurture, stimulate, talk to and play with their children.<BR><P>

 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*"> Children learn and develop better if they are actively involved.  Children learn in part through
constructing their own knowledge.  Therefore, we can help children develop and learn through
exploration and imitation, whether that is at home in everyday chores or in more organized
settings outside the home.<BR><P>

 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*"> Physical, mental, social and emotional development and learning are inter-related. Progress in
one area affects progress in the others.  Therefore, we need to pay attention simultaneously to
physical development (through health and nutrition), mental development (through education and
stimulation), social-emotional development (providing affection, and opportunities for social
participation), and spiritual development.  A holistic and integral approach needs to be taken.<BR><P>

 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*"> Children live within  a context -- family, community, culture-- and their needs are most
effectively addressed in relation to that context.  Support to the family and community can help
children, support to children can help the family and community.<BR><P>

 <IMG SRC="blueball.gif" ALT="*"> Support of early development yields rich benefits not only in immediate ways but also over time.<BR><P>

     All young children deserve to be cared for, nurtured and supported in their development. 
Unfortunately, a great number of the world s children are at risk of delayed or debilitated
development, due to poor nutrition, unsanitary conditions, poverty, difficult circumstances, and
untenable living situations.  There are many forms of intervention aimed at addressing the needs of
children and families  at risk : non-formal, parenting programs, preschool, home visit programs,
health education programs, etc.<BR>

 <b><h1>Child Development Theory </b></h1><p>
<p>
<H3><b>The Child:  Key Needs from Conception through the Early Years</b></H3><p>
<p>
	In terms of physical, intellectual, emotional and social well-being, the
period from conception to age 6 is the key to subsequent growth, development
and ultimate productivity.  Pre-natally through the sixth year there are
several distinct stages.  They include: intra-uterine, intrapartum (the birth
itself), postpartum (birth to 1 month), early infancy (the first six months),
late infancy (6-12 months), toddler (1 to 3 years), and the pre-school child
(3-6 years of age).  Children have different needs, depending on where they are
within these stages.<p>
<p>
	In order to create a programme for young children, it is critical to have more
specific information on their needs.  A delineation of developmental
differences is provided by Donohue-Colletta (1992) for three age groups.  She
defines the needs as follows:<p>
<p>
Infants (birth to 1) need:<p>
<ul>
	<li>  protection from physical danger<BR>
	  <li>adequate nutrition<BR>
	   <li>adequate health care<BR>
	   <li>adults with whom to form attachments<BR>
	   <li>adults who can understand and respond to their signals<BR>
	  <li> things to look at, touch, hear, smell, and taste<BR>
	<li>  opportunities to explore the world<BR>
	  <li> appropriate language stimulation<BR>
</ul>
<p>
Toddlers (1-3 years of age) need all the above and also require:<p>
<ul>
  <li>support in acquiring new motor, language and thinking skills<BR>
<li>  a chance to develop some independence<BR>
<li>  help in learning how to control their own behaviour<BR>
<li>	  opportunities to begin to learn to care for themselves<BR>
  <li> daily opportunities to play with a variety of objects<BR>
</ul>
<p>
Children ages 3-6 (and above), in addition to the above, also need:<p>
<ul>
   <li>opportunities to develop fine motor skills<BR>
   <li>encouragement of language through talking, reading, singing<BR>
   <li>activities which will develop a positive sense of mastery<BR>
   <li>opportunities to learn cooperation, helping, sharing<BR>
<li>	  experimentation with pre-writing and pre-reading skills <BR>
</ul>
<p>
	A wide variety of inputs is required to support children's growth and
development.  An important thing to note is that all the inputs require someone
to interact with the child.  Very young children are not capable of obtaining
what they need on their own.  <p>

and sizes to be expected of children at various stages) and are set in a U.S.

child&#146;s growth.<p>
<HR>	
<p>
<H3><b>Child Development Principles</b></H3><p>
<p>
	The term used by the ECCD community to describe children's development is
<i>holistic</i>.  What this means is that the child's development cannot be
compartmentalised into health, nutrition, education, social, and emotional
variables.  All are interwoven in a child's life. <p>
<p>
	Those within the ECCD field hold firmly to a belief that early childhood
experiences for children, at whatever age, should be planned around the child's
developmental abilities.  Support for this position comes from international
literature on how children develop and learn.  Specifically:<p>
<p>
<p>
<LI> <b>Development begins pre-natally and learning is occurring at birth.</b> <p>
<p>
	Too often the assumption is made that learning begins when children enter the
formal 	school system.  In fact, significant learning takes place before the
child enters school. Therefore, attention to the developmental and learning
needs of children should begin with pre- and post-natal interventions and be
continued thereafter.<p>
<p>
 <LI><b>Development has several inter-related dimensions. </b> <p>
<p>
These include physical, cognitive, social, spiritual and emotional development,
each of which influence the other and all of which are developing
simultaneously.  Progress in one area affects progress in others.  Likewise
when something goes wrong in any one of those areas it impacts all the other
areas. For example, children who are malnourished are not able to learn;
children with learning problems frequently have low self-esteem, etc.
Developing a programme based on an understanding of holistic development means
taking the whole child into consideration, providing attention to the child's
health, nutrition, cognitive, and socio-emotional needs.  Therefore
interventions should provide integrated attention to the child, including
attention to needs for protection, food, health care, affection, interaction
and stimulation, security provided through consistency and predictability, and
play allowing exploration. All of these elements should be present to support
the child's development.<p>
<p>
 <LI><b>Development proceeds in predictable steps and learning occurs in recognized
sequences, within which there is a great deal of individual and social
variability in children's rates of development and styles of learning. </b> <p>
<p>
It is important for adults to use methods that fit with the child's growth
pattern, not only in the cognitive area, but also in the affective, perceptual
and motor areas. Activities should provide the child with a developmentally
appropriate challenge. There is no value in presenting concepts and tasks
before a child is developmentally ready to understand them. Integrated
interventions promoting social, emotional and spiritual development as well as
cognitive learning can take advantage of varied forms of learning, consistent
with the culture, even while taking into account the fact that there are
recognized sequences and activities that facilitate learning.   <p>
<p>
<LI> <b>Development and learning occur continuously as a result of the child
interacting with people and objects in his or her environment.</b>  <p>
<p>
The role of adults (at home and in other settings) in supporting children's
learning is to provide children with opportunities to work with concrete
objects, to make choices, explore things and ideas, experiment and discover.
Children also need opportunities to interact with peers and adults in a safe
environment that provides the child with security and acceptance. <p>
<p>
Given the importance of the environment in promoting children's learning, it is
also possible to focus interventions on changing the child's environment.  For
example, increasing family income, upgrading health and sanitation in the
community, and enhancing the social and political milieu will affect children's
growth and development.<p>
<p>
<LI> <b>Children are active participants in their own development and learning.</b>
<p>
<p>
Learning and related development involve the child's construction of knowledge,
not an adult's imposition of information.  The skills which are the basis for
constructing knowledge improve with practice. It is important for children to
have opportunities to construct their own knowledge through exploration,
interaction with materials and imitation of role models. Therefore
interventions should include opportunities for children to learn by doing, to
be engaged in problem-solving, and to develop language and communication
skills. ECCD programmes should not put undue emphasis on rote memorisation and
learning the <i>3 Rs</i>. Opportunities for active involvement should abound,
whether at home in everyday chores or in more organised settings outside the
home.<p>
	<p>
	In sum, building ECCD programmes on a holistic understanding of children's
growth and development suggests a using a broad concept of early childhood
development: addressing the whole child within the context of the family and
community.  The early childhood years are perceived as the basis for learning
life-long skills and attitudes.  Activities and programmes planned for parents
and young children should not focus solely on providing children with school
survival skills, but should emphasise the development of the child's sense of
intellectual, motor and moral autonomy, initiative and self esteem.  Emphasis
should be on <b>how to learn</b> (i.e. positive attitudes to learning and
thinking skills) rather than <b>what to learn.</b><p>

<H1><b> Arguments in Support of ECCD </b> </H1><p>
<p>
<b>
<H3>The World&#146;s Young Children Need Attention</b></H3><p>
<p>
	&#147;At least 12 of every 13 children born (92 per cent) in 1991 will live to
see their first birthday.  When that survival statistic is compared with the
1960 figure of 5 for every 6 children born (83 per cent), it is clear that an
important advance has been made in child survival over the three decades.
Projections for the year 2000 show that 19 of 20 children born (95 per cent)
are expected to survive to age one.  Still many international organizations and
some governments continue to place almost exclusive emphasis in their
programming for children on further reducing mortality, with little attention
to the healthy development and general welfare of survivors.<p>
<p>
	What will happen to &#145;the twelve who survive&#146;?  Many of the same
conditions of poverty and stress that previously put children at risk to die
now put them at risk of impaired physical, mental, social and emotional
development in their earliest months and years.  Delayed or debilitated
development in the early years can affect all of later life.  It can also be
prevented.  And, because children are amazingly resilient, it can be overcome.
But overcoming early difficulties is not only inefficient, it requires greater
commitment than most people in privileged positions have been willing to give,
up to now.  As a result, millions of children will be deprived of their right
to healthy and normal development.  They will fail to live up to their potential
and will be further thwarted in their attempt to escape from the persistent
cycle of poverty.  Many of the survivors will lead lethargic, unproductive,
unrewarding, and dependent lives.&#148;<br>
<center>	(From R. Myers.  1995. <i>The Twelve Who Survive.  </i>Ypsilanti, MI:
High/Scope Press)</center><p>
<p>
	One and a half billion children will be born in the decade of the 1990s
(UNICEF, 1990).  The great majority will be born in what are commonly referred
to as "developing countries".  
Increasingly, due to economic conditions, children in these countries (and
within the so-called developed countries as well) will be born into poverty and
situations that threaten their chances for optimal human growth and
development.  Over the past ten years significant efforts have been made to
improve the situation of these children by providing a variety of early
childhood programs which support the child's development.  However, much work
remains to be done.. <p>
<p>
	Worldwide the quality of the environment in which millions of children are
growing up is inadequate by any number of criteria. Overcrowding, lack of
potable water and sewage facilities, lack of adequate food, and inadequate
caretaking characterize the environments of many young children.  Frequent
infection (most commonly diarrhoea) and malnutrition account for over 50% of
infant deaths in developing countries.  These statistics are likely to worsen
as the numbers living in urban areas increase, which they will.  It is
estimated that by the year 2000, urban populations in the developing countries
will increase from the 1 billion in 1980 to 2.1 billion.  This represents a 110
per cent increase, compared with a projected increase in the world's population
during that same time period of 38 per cent.  Thus a further expansion of urban
slum and squatter settlements is inevitable.<p>
<p>
	Children everywhere deserve to thrive.  &#147;As more infants survive, and as
social change accelerates, a moral and social imperative grows.  We must
respond to the question, &#145;survival for what&#146;?  The obligation mounts
to anticipate which children are likely to be debilitated and delayed in their
social, [physical], and intellectual development, and to do all in our power to
prevent that from happening.  In so doing, we will also be increasing the
chance of survival to age five and beyond, for these disadvantaged survivors to
age one are also the children who will be more likely to die before age five.
Who is caring for these children?  How is that care given?  What is their early
life like?  What can be done to enhance their growth and development and to
help them not only to survive, but also to realize their individual and social
potential.&#148; (R. Myers, <i>The Twelve Who Survive</i>, xix) <p>
<p>

<HR>
<H3><b>Why Invest in Programmes of Early Childhood Care and Development?</b></H3><p>
<b></b><p>
	Early Childhood Programmes can offer benefits to individual children, to
families, to communities, and to society.  <p>
<p>
	Before you can build a house, it is necessary to lay foundation stones to
support the entire structure.  Embedded within their family, their community,
and their cultural values, very young children (from birth to eight) need to be
supported in the development of the physical, mental, and social abilities that
will enable them to survive and thrive in later years.  The successful
education of the child during her or his years of schooling and participation
of that child in society as an adult depend to a great degree upon the
foundation stones laid during the pre-school years.<p>
<p>
	Learning and development begin at conception. In the early years, children
learn fundamental skills and develop in ways that are crucial to the success of
their future education and indeed the rest of their life.  They learn to walk
and coordinate their movements.  They learn to talk, acquiring relatively
sophisticated language skills.  They learn some basic thinking skills, as well
as the ability to connect thought to language to action.  They develop a sense
of self-control and self-confidence (or a sense of failure).  They learn how to
relate to others and what behaviour is culturally acceptable.  They develop (or
suppress) their sense of curiosity.<p>
<p>
	Scientific findings from a variety of fields have demonstrated that support of
early development yields rich benefits not only in immediate ways for the child
and its parents, but also  over time in terms of the child&#146;s ability to
contribute to the community.  Interventions in the early years of childhood
offer an extraordinary opportunity to avoid or moderate learning problems, and
to bring lasting benefits to individuals and society.  <p>
<p>
For individuals, areas where early intervention can have an impact include:<p>
 <p>
<UL>
   	<LI><b>Brain development.</b>  During the first two years critical brain
structures develop that affect children&#146;s ability to learn.  If the brain
develops well, learning potential is increased and the chances of failure in
school and life are decreased.  Programmes that provide proper nutrition and
support stimulation of a child's senses enhance the structure and organization
of the brain.<p>
<p>
   	<LI><b>Nutrition, health and the ability to learn.</b>  Children with
consistent, caring attention are better nourished, less apt to be sick, and
learn better than children who don't receive such care.  Neglected children are
more prone to sickness and malnutrition and are less equipped and motivated to
learn. Programmes that support families and teach them how to provide
consistent, healthy care are helping children develop the readiness to
participate in school and the community.<p>
</UL>
<p>
<p>
	Support for young children does not merely refer to establishing preschools or
infant classes.  <i>It refers to all the activities and interventions which
address the needs of young children and help to strengthen the contexts in
which they are embedded: the family, the community, and the physical, social,
and economic environment.</i>  This is a very different way of thinking about
education, and basic educational strategies than is conventional when
discussing the needs of primary and secondary students. <p>
<p>
For society the benefits of early childhood interventions include:<p>
<p>
	<b>1.  Increased economic productivity.</b>  Interventions that support young
children's physical and mental capacities lead to increased enrollment and
improved progress and performance in school.  School performance in turn is
linked to increased economic productivity. <p>
<p>
	2.  <b>Cost savings.</b>  Early childhood investments can reduce costs and
improve the efficiency of primary schooling.  Children who are better prepared
physically, mentally and socially for school have an easier transition from
home to school.  Therefore, drop-out and repetition rates are lower and the
need for remedial programmes is reduced, cutting costs. <p>
<p>
	Effective early childhood programmes can also bring cost savings in areas
other than education: health care costs can be cut through preventive measures
in programmes which help reduce disease and accidents (Evans &amp; Shah, 1994);
the social costs of delinquency and related problems are cut as children stay
in school longer (Schweinhart et al., 1992); and absenteeism is reduced when
parents, assured of proper care for their children, can devote their time to
the job (Galinsky, 1986).<p>
<p>
	3.  <b>Reductions in social and economic inequalities.</b>  Poverty and/or
discrimination can inhibit development in the early years. By failing to
intervene to support positive growth and development, governments tacitly
endorse inequalities.  This is certainly true if no special effort is made to
assist those who have been discriminated against and if early childhood
programmes are available only to those who can afford to pay for them.
Investments in early childhood development have been shown to modify
inequalities rooted in poverty and social discrimination by giving children
from disadvantaged backgrounds a fair start in school and in life.  Studies
suggest that these children benefit more from early intervention programmes
than their more-privileged peers.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>4. Reductions in gender inequalities.</b>  All children have a right to
develop to their full potential.  Attention to young girls often lags behind
attention to boys, beginning and reinforcing a long cycle of discrimination.
Gender-linked disparities in attitudes and expectations and in patterns and
practices of early care and development need to be examined. There is evidence
that early attention to gender can produce changes in the development of the
girl child and in the way families perceive the abilities and future of that
child.  Furthermore, early childhood programmes can also benefit women and
older siblings by freeing them from constant child care responsibility so they
can learn and seek better employment and earnings.<p>
<p>
	5.  <b>Strengthened values.</b>  Transmission of the social and moral values
that will guide all of us in the future begins in the earliest months of life.
In societies where there is a concern that crucial values are being eroded, a
strong incentive exists to find ways in which those values can be strengthened.
Early childhood programmes can assist in that effort by strengthening parenting
skills and by providing environments within which children can play and give
attention to culturally desirable values.<p>
<p>
	6.  <b>Social mobilisation.</b>  In many locations, lack of experience in the
political process made it extremely difficult to mobilise people for actions
that will be to their own benefit.  In such circumstances, focusing a programme
on young children as a point of common interest can be an effective rallying
strategy and serve as an entry point for broader community development. <p>
<p>
	7.  <b>Community and family benefits.</b>  Community improvements in health,
sanitation and nutrition that benefit children are also likely to benefit
parents, families and the community at large.  These community and family
benefits are evidenced by parents' improved self-confidence, the emergence of
leaders, and by increased organisation and social action in communities.  <p>
<p>
	<b>In sum, the benefits of investing in early childhood care and development
can be extraordinarily high</b>.  	<p>
<p>
<p>
<hr>
<H3><b>8 Arguments in Support of ECCD</b></H3><p>
<b></b><p>
<p>
<b>A SCIENTIFIC ARGUMENT.   </b>Scientific research demonstrates repeatedly
that the early years are critical in the development of intelligence,
personality, and social behaviour.  There are long-term effects associated with
a variety of early intervention programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>A HUMAN RIGHTS ARGUMENT.</b>  Children have a right to live and to develop
to their full potential.<p>
<p>
<b>A MORAL AND SOCIAL VALUES ARGUMENT.</b>  Through children, humanity
transmits its values.  That transmission begins with infants.  To preserve
moral and social values--or to change them for &#147;the better&#148;--one must
begin with children.  Values such as living together harmoniously or
appreciating and protecting the environment begin to take hold in the
pre-school years and can be promoted through child care and development
programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>AN ECONOMIC ARGUMENT.</b>  Society benefits economically from investing in
child care and development through increased productivity of children, by
freeing caregivers to earn and learn, and by saving social costs in such areas
as school repetition, juvenile delinquency and the use of drugs.<p>
<p>
<b>A SOCIAL EQUITY ARGUMENT.</b>  By providing a &#147;fair start&#148;. It is
possible to modify distressing socio-economic and gender-related inequities.
The girl child can be a particularly important beneficiary.<p>
<p>
<b>A SOCIAL MOBILIZATION ARGUMENT.</b>  Children provide a rallying point for
social and political actions that can help to build consensus and organisation
for the common good.<p>
<p>
<b>A PROGRAM EFFICACY ARGUMENT.</b>  The success of other programmes (for
example, survival programmes emphasizing health and nutrition, or primary
school education, or women-in-development programmes) can be improved by
incorporating an element of early childhood care and development focussing on
healthy mental and social development.  This is because sound psycho-social
development increases the chances of survival, makes educational programmes
more efficient by reducing repetition, and supports programmes focussed on the
productive role of women.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>CHANGING SOCIAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC CIRCUMSTANCES.  </b>The increasing survival
of vulnerable children, changing family structures and childrearing practices,
rural-urban migration, and growing participation by women in the paid labour
force are increasing the need and demand for more and better and different ways
to care for and insure the well-being of young children.<p>
<p>
Some of these arguments will be more relevant to one situation than to another,
but all are potentially important in any setting.  Taken together, they provide
a compelling case for making a heavy investment in programmes to improve care
and enhance development in the early years.  Both knowledge of the child
development process and examples of concrete programme experience are available
to be drawn upon to create and operate such programmes.  What remains is for
enlightened leaders to make the commitments that are needed for action.<p>

<b>CHILDREN CARING FOR CHILDREN:<p>
NEW APPLICATIONS OF AN OLD IDEA<p>
<p>
INTRODUCTION</u></b></center><p>
<p>
<p>
	Millions of infants and young children in Third World countries die every
year. And, for most children under the age of six who manage to survive, the
world is a threatening place. For an increasing number of these children growth
and development are delayed and disability is common.<p>
<p>
	Infant death and problems of growth and development in the early years have
many causes. Famine, war, and unemployment all take their toll. Lack of potable
water and poor sanitary conditions are common. Childhood and tropical diseases
continue to kill because health and social services fail to reach many places
with preventive and curative services that could save lives. These causes and
conditions are exacerbated by recent declines in economic development in many
countries, and an associated need for major adjustments in government budgets
and programmes. (Bennett, 1982; Cornia, Jolly and Stewart, 1987).<p>
<p>
	In such circumstances, assuring proper care and development for children is a
major challenge -- for families, governments, and international organizations alike. As discussed
during a WHO/UNLCEF workshop on alternative approaches to care of the young
child:<p>
<p>
	<ul>"In many developing countries, women have tried different ways to meet the
need for services for their children. Governments too, and other institutions,
have recognized the need for programmes for children and have made essential
inputs, both financially and by way of legislation to facilitate the operation
of such services, International agencies, particularly UNESCO, UNICEF, and WMO,
have made inputs by way of equipment, buildings, and sponsorship of
conferences, seminars, workshops and training programmes and dissemination of
materials. Despite all of  these commendable efforts, the problem of provision
of services for children are nowhere near solution. Despite major efforts and
huge investments in early childhood education, the gap between care, health and
educational needs at that level and the resources available continues to
widen." (Heron and Otaala, 1982, p. 4).</ul>
<p>
	A child's continuing struggle for survival and healthy development in the
early years emphasizes the need for low-cost approaches that can reach many
children. The institutionalised response, such as hospitals and formal
preschools or child care centers, are usually costly solutions, reaching only a
privileged few. Campaigns to vaccinate children and to educate adults may reach
many people, but are short-run
solutions; attitudes and practices are seldom changed in a fundamental way.
Primary health care systems are still limited in coverage and are not always
used by those who most need the service. Each of these approaches has some
effect on survival and development, and taken together, they. have helped to
reduce infant mortality significantly. But the vulnerability of young children
is profound, and alternate programme approaches are needed that look beyond
survival and that help to overcame vulnerability through more adequate care.<p>
<p>
<b><u>An Alternative</u></b><p>
<p>
	This paper describes and reviews experience with one promising programme
approach to care and development that is being applied increasingly, and in
diverse settings throughout the world: the care of children by children. In
most parts of the world, such care is part of a time-honored,
traditional system for helping to meet child care needs. Older children are
routinely expected to look after the health and development of a younger
brother or sister. That traditional practice provides a foundation for
programming that is not new but is being rediscovered and applied in new
ways.<p>
<p>
	Building programmes around the idea of children caring for children is an
attractive and a potentially effective complement to other programmes for at
least four reasons. First, working with child care givers offers the
possibility of affecting directly the health and development of younger
children by providing older children with information they can use in a
caretaking role. Where care of younger siblings is common, a naturally
occurring practice exists that can be reinforced and improved. For example,
sibling care givers or "Little mothers" (Mallya, I.P., 1983) can be trained to
help assure that the children under their care are vaccinated, treated with
oral rehydration salts when needed, fed properly, talked to, cuddled, and
played with. Second, Child-to-Child
programmes have a potential for being effective because the older caretakers,
although still children, will soon be parents themselves. By learning about
proper ways of caring for younger children, they will be better prepared for
their own parenthood. This outcome is particularly relevant in places where the
traditional, naturally occurring child care apprenticeship that mothers have
given to older siblings is diluted because children are now in school for large
portions of the day.<p>
	A third potential benefit of working with child care givers derives from their
communication abilities. Children can provide information about new practices
to peers, parents, families, and community members. That communication can take
place through direct conversations, or indirectly through skits or by
example.<p>
<p>
	Finally, children of primary school age can have an effect on care and
development through direct actions taken in the community, identifying health
problems or organizing to clean up the environment in which they and their
younger siblings live.<p>
<p>
	To realize these potential benefits --- to the younger child, the prospective parent in the older child, other family
members, and the community at large --- mechanisms of educating and mobilizing child care givers are needed. Many such
ways exist and experiences with them are multiplying rapidly. Indeed, the idea
of children caring for children has spread. In some places that has occurred
naturally as, for instance, local primary school teachers have taken advantage
of the presence of younger children in the classroom, brought by sisters or
brothers who could not leave them alone at home. In other cases, a programme
has been introduced from the outside. And, in 1978, an international programme
called Child-to-Child
was begun in order to articulate, operationalize and spread the idea over a wide front.<p>
<p>
	Although programmes building on children caring for children have taken hold
in many places, experience is still relatively recent. Moreover, in the
execution of activities and programmes, the original idea has often been
transformed. A number of issues and ideas have emerged that deserve
systematic review. That is the principal purpose of this paper.<p>
<p>
	More specifically, the objectives of this review are:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	  To examine the idea of children caring for children, placing it in historical context.<p>
<p>
	 <li>To describe and analyze the translation of the idea into various programme
forms.<p>
<p>
	 <li>To review selected projects and report results of project evaluations.<p>
<p>
	 <li>To present the University of London's Institutes of Child Health and Education Child-to-Child
Programme and its activities.<p>
<p>
	 <li>To draw some conclusions about the Child-to-Child
approach, with a view to aiding 	policy formulation and the operationalisation
of programmes and activities to promote 	better care and development of
vulnerable young children.</ul>

	The paper is organized in five sections, each dealing with one of the
objectives listed above. A list of references is annexed and appendices
providing more detailed information about specific programmes are attached.<p>
<p>
<b><u>SECTION I</u></b><p>
<b><u>Children Caring for Children: The Idea and History</u></b><p>
<p>
<p>
	In many societies, children caring for children has been a necessary and accepted practice, existing, at the very least, for centuries. That practice has, at the same time, provided a practical solution to child care needs and functioned as a form of socialisation to the future role of parent.<p>
<p>
	In highly industrialised countries, although some caring for infants and
children of preschool age by older siblings still occurs, the practice is
limited and in some countries has virtually disappeared, In their
pre-industrial periods, however, the care of younger children by older children
was common in these countries as well. Large families and subsistence living
requiring hard work by all family members meant that children had to contribute
from an early age. One important way to help, particularly for girls, ages 6 or
7 to 15, was to care for younger brothers and sisters. With urbanisation,
industrialisation, shifts toward nuclear families, and the reduction in family
size, child care needs changed and, with the extension of formal schooling, the
availability of child caretakers was restricted.<p>
<p>
	These same factors are affecting traditional child care patterns in all parts
of the world today. Urbanization is preceding at a rapid rate. Family
structures are changing. Primary schooling has expanded rapidly. However, in
many parts of Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, large families
and subsistence living are still dominant, and sibling care is still an
important practice. A recent study from rural Nigeria, for instance, indicated
that 16% of the child care was carried out by older siblings. (Wilson-
Oyelaran,
E.B. and Ladipo, P.D., 1987).<p>
<p>
<b><u>A Traditional View</u></b><p>
<p>
	Differences in the reliance on older children to care for younger children are
related to cultural beliefs as well as to family structure, livelihood, and
other factors described above. Each culture has its own beliefs about a child's
capacities and needs as the child passes from an infant to a toddler to a young
child to a pre-adolescent
and adolescent. For instance, there are variations in beliefs and attitudes
about the point at which older children are responsible enough to take on child
care duties and about when young children are considered old enough to be
trusted to the care of other children (Weisner and Gallimore, 1977). The point
at which it is thought appropriate
for a mother to allow others to care for her child also varies.<p>
<p>
	What form does sibling care take? How is it learned? How does it vary?
Autobiographical and anthropological accounts are two sources which help to
identify and understand similarities and differences in child caretaking within
and across cultures. These accounts provide useful insight into the natural
practice of children caring for children in "traditional" societies, We will
draw briefly on both of these in setting a base for discussion of the more
formalized and institutionalized programmes that are being carried out in
transitional settings.     <p>
<p>
	<i>Autobiographical sketches.</i><p>
<p>
	The following is taken from an account of childhood and caretaking
responsibilities provided by Lijembe, as he was growing up among the Abaluhga
in Kenya:<p>
	<ul>"Because there was no sister in the family, and my mother had to go off to
work in the <i>shamba</i> (gardens) everyday, it wasn't long before I was
obliged, though still a very young child  myself, to become the day-to-
day
"nurse" for my baby sister. For my mother to make me succeed in this function,
she had to train me --- to give me instructions and to see how well I carried them out... As her shamba
work increased, so did my nursing duties...Before moving off to the shamba, she
would give me instructions.'Do not leave the home unguarded, she would tell
me,"' (Lijembe, as quoted in Weisner and Gallimore, p. 171).</ul>

	Lijembe also describes leaving home while his younger sister was sleeping to
play with his friend nurses from other homesteads. He describes taking his
sister with him to play and to go bathing. He tells how he toilet-trained
her and how he fed her. He also says that punishment of the child caretaker for
poor performance was swift. (Weisner and Gallimore, p. 171).<p>
<p>
	<i>Anthropological accounts</i>.<p>
<p>
	The anthropological literature contains many, and sometimes very vivid
accounts of caretaking by older siblings. In her classic study, "Growing Up in
Samoa," Margaret Mead observes that:<p>
<p>
	<ul>"A Samoan caretaker learns to shout, 'Come out of the sun' before she herself
has fully appreciated the necessity of doing so. By the time Samoan girls and
boys have reached sixteen or seventeen years of age, these perpetual
admonitions have become an inseparable part of their conversation, a monotonous
irritated undercurrent to all their comments... The little nurses are more
interested in peace than in forming the characters of their small charges and
when a child begins to howl it is simply dragged out of earshot of its elders."
(Weisner and Gallimore, p. 172).</ul>

	Liederman and Liederman (1973) have provided a detailed account of how Kikuyu
caretakers (Kenya) execute their tasks.<p>
<p>
	<ul>"Kikuyu child caretakers are usually 7 to 12 years old, female, and siblings
cousins or neighbours. They may have had some schooling, but probably very
little. The child caretaker's role begins around the infant's fourth month and
gradually expands until the child is in charge half the day, or more, by 7 or 8
months.<p>
<p>
	"The caretaker is usually old enough to know the responsibilities of the
household, yet young enough to want to be included in the children's games and
activities. In her typical day, she gets up with the mother and helps about the
house. She frequently accompanies the mother to collect fuel and water, usually
taking responsibility for the infant on these journeys. If needed, she goes
with the mother to the fields where she either assists in cultivating and
planting, or cares for the child while the mother performs her chores. If the
younger girl is left at home to care for the infant, she is solely responsible
for his care. She provides food, if he is old enough to take supplemental food,
or, if he is still nursing she carries him to the mother in the fields.
Depending on the interests and sense of responsibility of the young caretaker,
she might watch the child extremely carefully, or do so in a more desultory
manner, giving in to the temptation of playing with her friends and siblings
while overseeing his activities. However, most caretakers take their
responsibilities very seriously, and many are genuinely interested in, and
involved with the younger infant, in play as well as in caretaking tasks." (p.
113)</ul>

	Whiting has examined the behaviour of 3 to 8 year old Kikuyu (Kenya) children
towards their two-year old siblings. The results show that there is marked increase with age in the proportion of nurturant caretaking behaviour toward 2-year old children and a decrease in the amount of aggressive and social interaction. Children aged eight are more consistently nurturant. Whiting concludes, "I have speculated
that this is the age of the greatest identification with the mother before the onset of puberty."<p>
<p>
	The effect on caretaking of age found by Whiting has an interesting counter-part
in a laboratory study by Cicirelli (1973) Using concept learning tasks to study
the effect of sibling interaction, Cicirelli found that children working with
siblings four years older made larger gains than children aided by siblings two
years older. In another study, older sisters were significantly more effective
teachers of younger siblings than were older brothers, and they tended to use
more deductive teaching methods (explaining and describing, demonstrating and
illustrating attributes, etc.).<p>
<p>
	Two accounts of sibling care on the West Coast of Colombia are provided by
Uribe (1982), one from a marginal urban area (Buenaventura) and one from a
fishing village (Puerto Merizalde).<p>
<p>
	<ul>"Almost all children were responsible for taking care of siblings during the
day. Those who did not engage in these activities were the youngest in the
family. Mothers were pointed out as the ones that instructed children about
this particular chore. 'My mother told me not to let the baby fall down or she
will punish me. My little brother is very playful. When I leave the room he
goes right behind me and I have to take him with me. I don't like him to take
nothing from the floor. I give him his bottle when he asks for it.... And when
he wants to pee he pushes himself forward so that I put him down and pees. When
he does something I don't like, I take him, and ask him why he is doing that
and he gets mad. I don't beat him....'.<p>
<p>
	"Children described their responsibilities with siblings in terms of feeding,
bathing, making them sleep, changing their clothes, and protecting them from
harm or other children.<p>
<p>
	 <li>'I don't let my younger brothers go out to the street because a car may come
and kill them.'<p>
<p>
	 <li>'I close the door so that he cannot go out to the street, a dog may come and
bite him.'<p>
<p>
	 <li>'I sit near her and I play with her, and I help her to drink soup with a
spoon.'<p>
<p>
	 <li>'When he gets soiled I clean him with a damp cloth, then I put him in clean
pants and a clean shirt.'<p>
<p>
	 <li>'When it gets dark I hang our <u>toldillo</u> (piece of material that
protects from mosquitoes and that is hung over the bed) and I wash my feet and
my brother and I close  the door and go to sleep."' (Uribe, pages 99-

100).</ul>
	In transitional societies, schooling and child care often represent
conflicting demands on the time of children, particularly for girls. It is
difficult to know how real that conflict is. For instance, Skinner writes, in
an anthropological study of a Nepali community where a child care centre was
introduced:<p>
<p>
	<ul>"Of 65 mothers, only three mothers said they would have kept their older
daughters home from school with out the day care centre to care for their
younger children; however, I believe several more mothers would have done so if
the centre had not been operating. Often children do not attend school even
though enrolled because they are kept out to watch younger siblings who do not
attend the day care centre." (Skinner, p. 16).</ul>
	From the few illustrative accounts provided above, it is evident that although
there are several similarities in caretaking functions, there are significant
variations as well, depending on the relative ages of caretaker and younger
child, on parental availability and expectations, on different cultural
conceptions of a child's maturity, on other tasks and demands on the older
child, and on community and household circumstances.<p>
<p>
	These accounts point to the fact that some caretaker training is given by
mothers, although they do not describe that training in detail. They suggest
that boys as well as girls can be pressed into caretaking service, although in
most cases girls perform the caretaking role. In addition, the accounts suggest
that caretaking outcomes are associated, among other things, with the
seriousness of purpose with which the task is carried out.<p>
<p>
<b>Some advantages and disadvantages</b><p>
<p>
	There are some obvious benefits to younger children of caretaking by older
siblings, if that caretaking is carried out consciously. Children are not left
alone. They may be attended to much more closely than would be possible by a
harried mother. They have a non-adult
source for learning, modelling, and play.<p>
<p>
	However, if child caretakers are distracted, irresponsible, improperly trained
and supervised by their parents, or inadequately, informed, the substitution of
child for adult in caretaking may be disadvantageous. Food preparation and
feeding may suffer, for instance. Preventable accidents may occur. Language and
other areas of cognitive development could suffer. This issue was addressed in
a study conducted by P.M. Shah, et. al., 1979. The authors identified 108
families in 9 villages participating in the Kasa Model Integrated MCH Nutrition
Project in rural Maharashtra. Their results indicated that the incidence of
malnutrition decreased as the age of the mother substitute increased. The
prevalence of these negative outcomes and the circumstances under which they
are most likely to occur, however, are not fully understood.<p>
<p>
	For the older children, caretaking provides an opportunity to learn and
practice adult roles. Exercising the caretaking function broadens parent-

child
relationships by presenting circumstances in which parents can accord their
older offspring some measure of enhanced status. The sense of responsibility
may be enhanced. Personality, attitudes and values may be influenced rather
dramatically. Weisner and Gallimore (1977) indicate:<p>
<p>
	<ul>"Suggested consequences (of personality development must be interpreted in
terms of the role demands a child must eventually meet as an adult. While child
caretaking may not foster individual differentiation, it may prepare well for
societies in which personal achievement and independence are not common
options." (p, 179).</ul>
	Perhaps the most general conclusions that can be drawn from the above brief
anthropological account of the practice of children caring for children are:<p>
<p>
	<ol>1. The practice continues to be important in some locations and is not so
important in others. Where it continues as a main child care strategy, working
with the older children holds promise for directly affecting the health and
development of younger children. Where it has diminished in importance, there
is a need to fill in a socialization gap. The effects of teaching children of
primary school age about child care are likely to be realized parents.<p>
<p>
	2. There are potential advantages and disadvantages of children caring for
children - to both the younger and older children involved.<p>
<p>
	3. The outcome of the practice is influenced by the ages of those involved and
by a series of social and cultural factors surrounding the practice, not all of
which are well documented or understood.<p>
<p>
	4. Training and supervision, and a well-

developed
sense of responsibility in the older child are crucial to successful Child-to-Child
care.</ol>

	The degree to which these conclusions, drawn from anthropological accounts,
are reflected in current programming efforts are discussed in further detail in
the following sections.<p>
<p>
<b><center>SECTION II<p>
<p>
Translating the Idea into Programmes: A Typology</center></b><p>
<p>
	We turn now to ways in which the practice of children caring for children is
being built upon and adapted to a variety of contemporary settings. In this
section, we will set out a typology that will help to frame the examination in
Section III of specific projects and of the global initiative called the Child-to-Child
Programme.<p>
<p>
<b>The Role of Older Children</b><p>
<p>
	Older children, somewhere between the ages of 8 and 15, constitute the focus
of attention for programmers building on the principle of children caring for
children. These children are the main group to be mobilized. However, as seen
in the previous section, these older children may be treated primarily as:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> Caretakers,<br>
	 <li>Future parents,<br>
	 <li>Communicators of messages to other caretakers, and/or<br>
	 <li>Agents to improve conditions affecting health and development.</ul>
<p>
The emphasis given to these respective roles in a particular project is closely
related to the definition of the primary beneficiary and influences the
project's organization and content. As the idea of children caring for children
has been translated into programmes, more attention seems to have been given to
the latter three roles than to the role of actual caretaker.<p>
<p>
<b>Participants and Beneficiaries</b><p>
<p>
	Corresponding to the above distinction in roles the primary beneficiaries in a
Child-to-Child
programme may be:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> Younger children,<br>
	 <li>Older children,<br>
	 <li>Adult caretakers, or<br>
	 <li>The community at large.</ul>

	In most instances it is hoped that several or all of the above will
participate and benefit from the programme.<p>
<p>
	Another participant and potential beneficiary is the person who helps to teach
and mobilize the older children. These may be:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> School teachers and supervisors,<br>
	 <li>Health personnel,<br>
	 <li>Social service personnel, and<br>
	 <li>Youth leaders.</ul>
<p>
<b>Institutional Location</b><p>
<p>
	Programmes of children caring for children can be found within a wide variety
of institutions. The most common attachment has been to primary schools,
sometimes to individual schools and districts, and sometimes at a national
level. In these cases, the mobilizer is usually the primary school teacher who
incorporates information and activities within the school routine that are
intended to bring about improvements in child care outside the school. However,
Child-to-Child
programmes have bean organized also in conjunction with activities of hospitals
and primary health care centers, community associations, municipal governments,
universities, and other independent organizations such as the nutrition
centers, child care organizations, and youth groups. Examples of the
institutional locus of a project or programme will usually define who is to be
the teacher/mobilizer as well as determine the specific content of activities.
The range of institutional variability will be discussed in more detail in the
examination of particular projects in Section III.<p>
<p>
<b>Programme Content</b><p>
<p>
	As specific examples of programmes of children caring for children are
discussed, more specifics about content will be provided. For purposes of the
typology, it is sufficient to note general areas of programme content:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> Health care,<br>
	 <li>Nutrition,<br>
	 <li>Accident prevention, and<br>
	 <li>Mental and social development.<br></ul>
	In addition to the above, special emphases may be taken in a particular
programme, dealing for instance with physical disabilities or sanitation, or
community work, An integrated view of child care may be taken or content may be
focussed on one or more particular areas. In some programmes, for instance,
health dominates and older children are helped to identify diseases,
promote immunization, etc., but they are not involved in education or play with
younger children.<p>
<p>
<b>Methods and Materials</b><p>
<p>
	While programmes building on the practice of children caring for children
adopt many methods of teaching and mobilizing children, emphasis is most often
placed on the development of an active and participatory approach to learning
and teaching. In this approach teachers are taught to act as a catalyst to
encourage children to help each other and their communities. In accomplishing
this goal, programme instructors are encouraged to:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> Explore ways children can identify health needs, problems, and priorities.<p>
<p>
	<li>Discuss ways of addressing these problems.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Understand through the use of role-play
and drama another's feelings and views.<p>
<p>
	 <li>Design appropriate activities which are acceptable and easily implemented.</ul>

	Child-to-Child
materials are often developed from locally produced materials and based on
simple clear messages. Emphasizing an active participatory approach, these
materials often include songs, plays, skits, puppetry, posters, and stories.<p>
<p>
<b>Scale</b><p>
<p>
	Child-to-Child
programmes vary in scope. At one end of the continuum are programmes delivered
to groups of 8 to 10 children in private homes, while at the other extreme are
massive national programmes reaching all students enrolled in a school system.
According to a recently completed survey of Child-to-Child
Programmes affiliated with the Institute of Child Wealth, University of London,
an average project has just under 250 participants, with three quarters of the
projects reviewed reaching fewer than 1,000 participants (Somerset, 1988). One
question raised by the variability in programme coverage is the degree to which
large-scale
programmes can successfully influence behaviour. The way in which scale and
impact are related is a critical issue in need of further investigation.<p>
<p>
<b><center>SECTION III<p>
<p>
An Examination of Selected Projects</center></b><p>
<p>
<p>
	In this section we will take a look at five specific programmes or projects,
selected from a wide variety of initiatives in the Caribbean, Latin America,
Africa, Asia, and the Middle East, These examples only begin to show the
creativity applied in translating into action the idea that children of primary
school age have an important role to play in caring for their younger brothers
and sisters and in improving the conditions in which they are struggling not
only to survive but also to develop to their full potential.<p>
<p>
	The examples were chosen in part because each has been submitted to an
evaluation. It is possible to draw on those evaluation results to see whether
proposed goals of the project are being met and, if they are pilot projects,
whether they are feasible and replicable on a larger scale. Looking at the
examples will also provide some insight into the outcomes achieved, forms of
organization, and differences in content and methods.<p>
<p>
<b>An Overview</b><p>
<p>
	As indicated in Table 1, each project is described according to: country and
location; the project type; institutional attachment; and content covered. In
addition, for each project the target group, expected beneficiaries, and the
reported outcomes are indicated. The following brief summary is accompanied by
a more detailed discussion of each project.<p>
<p>
	<i>Country and Location</i>. The selected projects have been carried out in
Jamaica, Colombia, India (two), and Botswana, These locations represent
considerable variety in culture, size, and economic and social conditions. The
projects represent also both urban and rural settings.<p>
<p>
	<i>Type of project</i>. Three of the six projects (Jamaica, and the two Indian
projects) started as demonstration or pilot projects but are being extended.
The project in Colombia was implemented on an experimental basis with less
direct possibility of "going to scale." In Botswana, the project is large
within the context of the country and is being carried out in 28 schools.<p>
<p>
	<i>Institutional Attachment</i>. Two of the projects were carried out in
primary schools, two in conjunction with activities of primary health care
centres, and one in relation to an on-going
programme of institutionalized child care.<p>
<p>
	<i>Content</i>. All projects focused on health care issues and four included
the additional component of nutrition education. Two of the five projects paid
specific attention to child development issues and one include information
related to dental care.<p>
<p>
	<i>Target Group and Beneficiaries</i>. In four of the five projects, the
target group mobilized as the primary focus of attention was primary school
children, ranging from grades 3 to 7. In Botswana, the programme targeted
younger primary school children in grades 1 to 3. The groups who benefited in
some way from the programmes included younger children, parents, and
communities. In four of the projects reviewed rather unexpected benefits were
received by
the teachers and schools participating in the programme.<p>

<p>
	<i>Benefits</i>. The benefits listed in the Table summarize those reported
through a range of evaluation activities. Benefits to the older children
reported by the projects included increased knowledge of health, nutrition and
education, improved personal hygiene and habits, and positive attitudes
including more nurturant attitudes towards younger siblings. In addition, the
older children acquired communication skills as well as the ability to
influence their local community.<p>
<p>
	For parents, especially mothers, an increase in self confidence and improved
child rearing practices (less physical punishment) were reported by two of the
projects. Increased knowledge about health, nutrition and education was found
in several projects, but without concomitant change in behaviours.<p>
<p>
	In at least two of the projects, school teachers charged with helping the
older children be better caretakers were also beneficiaries, they improved
their own knowledge of the subject matter as well as their teaching methods. In
the Botswana project, they had an easier job in helping first graders adapt to
school because much of that adjustment had been accomplished through the
project.<p>
<p>
	Quantifying the positive outcomes to younger children was somewhat more
difficult. It was assumed that they benefittcid directly from the activities
performed with them or indirectly through the positive effects on the older
children, parents, or teachers. In the one attempt made to study the impact on
younger children, no measurable effect was found in health, nutrition, or
developmental status.<p>
<p>
<b><center>JAMAICA<br>
Using Primary School Children to Improve Child-rearing</center></b><p>
<p>
	This experimental project was begun in Jamaica in 1979 by the Tropical
Metabolism Research Unit (TMRU) of the University of the West Indies (Knight
and Grantham-Macgregor,
1985). The purpose was to teach prinrary school children basic health and
developmental concepts with the aim of improving their knowledge, and child-rearing
practices and those of their parents or guardians. The project was conducted
in a rural community where social and health services were deficient. Unstable
family patterns in the community were reflected in the fact that over one-third
of the children involved in the project were not residing with their biological
mother. Both mothers and guardians tended to be unmarried. Housing stardards
were low with inadequate sanitation and overcrowding. The project school was
overcrowded as well with generally poor facilities and a shortage of basic
materials and teaching aids. The children's literacy level was generally low.<p>
<p>
	In this inpropitious setting, 94 children in primary school grades 3, 5, and
7, were given lessons (about 30 hours in total, over the course of one year)
dealing with child health and development.<p>
<p>
	The child development component of these sessions included information about
different areas of development, important developmental milestones, and
appropriate child management techniques. The children were taught how to make
toys from waste household materials, and how to play with them so as to
encourage a younger child's development. Dental care lessons included the care
of teeth, and information about foods which are good and bad for teeth.
Immunization lessons dealt with the purpose of immunization, the diseases which
immunization can prevent, and the times when the baby should be immunized. The
curriculum is described as "action-oriented"
and suitable for the children's level of reading and writing. Activities such
as role play, group discussions and demonstrations were included. Toy making,
drama, and poster competitions provided reinforcement. In the weekly sessions
classroom teachers were assisted by staff from the project.<p>
<p>
	To evaluate the project, a questionnaire was administered to guardians at home
and a test was given to the children at school, both at the beginning and end
of the year. Guardians were asked about their knowledge of material covered and
certain of their child care activities as well as about the school child's
activities with younger ones at home. In addition, at the end of the project
they were asked about the number of project toys brought home. School children
were tested on their knowledge of the topics taught and asked about their
activities with younger children at home.<p>
<p>
	Summarizing the results of this experiment, the following effects occurred:<p>
<p>
<ol>	1. <i>On younger children</i>. No observable change was reported in the
health, nutritional, or developmental status of pre-school
siblings.<p>
<p>
	2. <i>On primary school children</i>. Improvements occurred in the knowledge
of health, 	nutrition, and early development, as measured by tests geared to
the curriculum. This included recognition of the educational value of toys and
play and knowledge of suitable concepts to teach young children with toys.
Guardians reported that some health behaviours changed and that school children
instructed their younger brothers and sisters to clean their teeth and made
toys for them.<p>
<p>
	3. <i>On adults</i>. Guardians improved their knowledge and encouraged the
school children to play with younger children, but changes in adult caretaking
behaviour were not found.<p>
<p>
	4. <i>On teachers</i>. One unanticipated effect of the project was on the
teachers who improved their own knowledge of health and development. They were,
as well, introduced to some new forms of teaching.</ol>
	This project was considered a success, primarily because of its effect on the
knowledge and behaviours of the primary school children. It is suggested that,
the inability to document changes in the health, development, and nutrition of
preschool children reflects the difficulties in the measurement of these
changes. Moreover, the impact of the programme may not be apparent in the short-run,
but may necessitate the development of a longitudinal evaluation scheme to
monitor the impact of the programme over time. Thus, the absence of positive
programme effects must be interpreted with caution.<br><p>
	On the basis of the initial results, the project was expanded to 14 schools
and approximately 1000 students in the 4th and 5th grades. A teacher-training
programme was implemented utilizing the curriculum and activities developed
during the pilot project. Although a formal evaluation of this extended project
has not been implemented, it has been well received by teachers, parents, and
the health and education authorities. The activities are now integrated into
the primary school curriculum. In short, the experiment that began from the
perspective of helping older children care for younger children has had an
effect on the education system.<p>

	This research project was undertaken by CEDEN (Centro de Educacion No-                                                                                       
Formal)
in 1983 with three purposes in mind (Ortiz, N, and Unda, M., 1985):<p>
<p>
<ol>	1. To design and implement an educational strategy directed at the training of
older siblings as socialising agents and developmental facilitators of younger
siblings (2-5 years of age).<p>
<p>
	2. To evaluate the effect of the training on behaviours of older siblings with
respect to the care and stimulation of younger siblings.<p>
<p>
	3. To evaluate the impact of training older siblings on the psycho-social
development of the younger siblings and on the knowledge and child-rearing patterns of the mother.</ol>

	The study was based on evidence in Colombia of a tendency to leave younger
siblings in the care of older ones. Apparently children not only accepted the
role but assumed it with a certain degree of satisfaction because it provided
them with "social value" and status within the family.<p>
<p>
Four groups were initially selected for the study, two of which were to
participate in the training, and two to serve as comparison groups. One urban
and one rural group was identified, respectively, for training and for
comparison. However, the original design had to be modified to eliminate the
rural comparison group. A minimum of forty families was identified for each
group in which there were two children, one aged 2 to 4 and the other aged 8 to
12 and in the forth or fifth grade. The older child had implicit or explicit
responsibility for taking care of the younger child.<br><p>
	The rural families, selected from an area 55 kilometers from Bogota, were
largely farmers who either worked their own small plot of land or were day
workers in larger farms. The average educational level was three years and the
average family size was slightly over 8. The urban population was similar in
educational level and almost the same with respect to average family size
(7.6). Living in a marginal area of Bogota, these families often lacked public
services -                                                                                
electricity, water, sewage. Most parents were unskilled laborers whose
employment was sporadic.<p>
<p>
	Training for the older siblings was provided outside the school by CEDEN. Each
Saturday morning for 25 weeks, two hour sessions were held dealing with
nutrition, health, psycho-social
development, and the physical environment of the house and community.<p>
<p>
	To evaluate the programme, pre- and post-tests
were administered with both older and younger children, and the interaction
between older children with younger siblings was observed. Tests and
observations were repeated following the training (pre- and
post-tests
were conducted by the same individuals). Approximately 20% of the sample was
lost to follow-up.
Information was collected from parents in four sessions (one at the beginning
and end, and at the end of the second and fourth weeks).<p>
<p>
	Results of the experiment may be summarised as follows:<p>
<p>
<ol>	1. <i>On younger children</i>. No significant difference was found in the
developmental level of the experimental vs. control children in the urban area
that could be attributed to the training of older siblings. The lack of a
significant difference must take into account the difficulty of measuring such
changes. In addition, the positive benefits may not be observed in the short-run
but may be manifested at some later point in the developmental process. In the
rural group, for which there was no comparison, improvements were found in each
of the areas measured by the Griffiths test.<p>
<p>
	2. <i>On older children</i>. At the end of the project, the interaction
between older and younger children was observed for 19 pairs in the urban
experimental group, 23 in the urban control group, and 31 in the rural
experimental group.<p>
<p>
	The educational programme was successful in increasing the interest of the
older children in activities that favoured the development of their younger
siblings. Both urban and rural groups of siblings who participated in the
weekly training liked to take care of their younger siblings; they played with
them, fed them, played games, and punished them less. These behaviours were not
apparent in the urban control group. Moreover, the results indicated a tendency
to reinforce or accentuate positive characteristics of interactions. For
instance, improvements were observed in requests, gestating, less
overproduction, and more verbal modelling. In the interaction the younger
children tended to be more attentive to the requests of older children.<p>
<p>
	3. <i>On mothers</i>. Favourable changes were observed in terms of talking
with, and to, the child, being with the child, expressing affection, and
playing. There was some improvement in feeding and hygiene, particularly with
the prevention and treatment of diarrhoea.</ol>

	The results from this experimental project are in general agreement with those
reported form the Jamaican study even though the institutional setting and
conditions for the projects varied tremendously. In both, the older child
received the most benefits. However, in the experimental conditions of the
Colombian study, changes in the behaviour, as well as the knowledge of
parents
were observed. In neither of the studies was there an observable impact on the
younger children that could be attributed specifically to the project. Although
the Colombian study indicated a positive effect on children in the rural areas
neither study reported improvements received by the younger children. The
absence of results may be attributed to the shortcomings of the measurement
techniques rather than an inability of the programme to affect change.<p>

The Malvani Project</center></b><p>
<p>
	The Malvani Project, as reviewed by Somerset (1988), began in 1978 as an
ambitious project involving doctors and para-medical
workers responsible for primary health care in the low-income
suburb of Malvani on the outskirts of Bombay. The objectives of this project
were to change awareness, attitudes, and practices of the community regarding
preventive health care and community hygiene. To accomplish these objectives,
older children were trained by the local health centre staff as "communicators"
and equipped with the skills and knowledge to affect changes in their own as
well as the community's health.<p>
<p>
	During this initial phase, the results described an extremely successful
initiative. During the first year (1978-1979),
1,330 individuals were identified and brought to the health centre by 600
trained volunteer child health workers. The reported diseases included 471
cases of scabies, 233 cases of vitamin deficiency, and 150 cases of
tuberculosis. As the programme progressed, the preparation of oral rehydration
solution became a major activity.<p>
<p>
	In order to maintain the level of programme effectiveness, the project moved
from the health centre into the schools. In this scheme, a team of health
centre personnel worked with teachers to incorporate practical health
information into the science curriculum. A team of seven para-professionals
visited the schools twice each week to instruct students in the following
areas: Immunisation, Vitamin B Complex, Anemia, Tuberculosis, Malaria, and
Leprosy. Formal classroom instruction was combined with a variety of action-oriented
activities including outings, plays, public performances, and community
surveys.<p>
<p>
	The following summarizes the results available at the present time.<p>
<ol>	1. <i>On older children</i>. Students increased their knowledge and skills
related to the detection and treatment of disease and nutrition-related
disorders. Results from an anemia survey of 1,815 students implemented by the
trained child health workers found that 36% of those surveyed had positive
signs. Of these, 19% were confirmed anemic. In addition, reports indicated high
rates of immunisation as a result of a Child-to-Child
campaign.<p>
<p>

	2. <i>On the community</i>. The work of the volunteer health educators was
reflected in the community's increased awareness and need for preventive health
programmes thus reducing the need for curative intervention. For example, a
community survey was conducted in which the trained child health volunteers
found clinical signs of anemia in 27% of the 2,354 community members
examined.</ol>

	Qualitative reports of the Malvani project were highly favourable. The student
participants were exposed to an unusual set of teaching opportunities which
stressed observation, enquiry, and the practical application of information.
The pupils taking part were exposed to a set of learning opportunities. The
project's implicit message is that education can be more than just preparation
for life in the future, it can also enhance enjoyment of the present.<p>

Mobile Creche/Child-to-Child,
Bombay</center></b><p>
<p>
	Mobile Creche is a voluntary organization which provides care and education to
the children of migrant construction workers. Mobile Creches are located at a
construction site in a part of an unfinished building or in a separate
structure. A team of four to five workers and teachers organizes the day care
programme for children who range in age from 2 weeks to 12 years. Each unit
consists of an infant creche, preschool, and a primary school. There is a
strong emphasis on preventive health through visits by medical personnel. Two
meals are prepared on the premises for the children who eat, play, study, and
rest within this sheltered surrounding.<p>
<p>
	The Mobile Creche began in Delhi in 1969. Today 21 centres in New Delhi
provide services to approximately 1,500-1,800
children. In Bombay the programme, which began in 1972, provides services to
approximately 1,800 children through the 19 creches currently in operation.
Children attending the creche come from homes characterized by extreme levels
of deprivation. Their parents, migrants who have come from rural areas in
search of work, are marginalized not only by poverty and illiteracy but also by
a language barrier which cuts them off from the mainstream of city life. Both
parents work on the construction site and older children are responsible for
the care of infants and young children, A major goal of the Mobile Creche
project is to relieve older children of this burden and give them access to
opportunities for cognitive and personal growth available to their more
privileged peers. (Annual Reports: Mobile Creche, 1986-1987).<p>
	Usually a child attends a creche for as long as his parents are employed on
the building site where the centre is located. While the period is often less
then a year, for many this may be their only educational opportunity. The
programme aims to develop basic cognitive competencies including literacy,
numeracy, and simple health knowledge as rapidly as possible, In achieving
these goals much emphasis is placed on activity-based
methods. Children work together in small groups using a variety of teacher-made
learning materials. Because the groups are of mixed age, older children provide
a great deal of help to younger children, the majority of which occurs
spontaneously and informally. Thus, the pattern of care familiar to all
children residing in communities served by the Mobile Creche is simply
transferred into the creche centres.<p>
<p>
	In Bombay, Mobile Creche has formally incorporated Child-to-Child
activities into its programmes. To facilitate implementation and evaluation of
programme impact, the content has been limited to several topics including
personal hygiene, environmental hygiene, water-borne
diseases, and balanced diet and vitamins. In this programme, efforts are made
to use the primary school children as conveyors of health messages to their
younger siblings as well as parents and the community.<p>
<p>
	At present, Child-to-Child
is treated as a separate subject with its own place in the daily set of
activities. The long-term
goal is to develop a fully integrated health, numeracy and literacy curriculum.
Based on materials developed and designed by mobile Creche teachers, Child-to-Child
activities include: action songs, role plays/skits, story telling, posters,
puppetry, games, matching cards, and student teaching. Although a parental
involvement component was initially conceived, it has been difficult for
teachers to interact directly with parents. Thus, much of the activities focus
on the child as the "message communicator" to parents and families.<p>
<p>
	Efforts have been made to assess the impact of Child-                
to-                                                                                        
Child
activities on the overall functioning of the creche. A variety of data
collection techniques have been utilized, including: case studies; interviews
with teachers, project managers, and children; diaries; and direct observation.
Based on the preliminary findings from the application of these techniques on a
sample of Bombay's creches combined with the insights from the direct
observations of the programme, the following comments are offered. (Somerset,
1988).<p>
<p>
<ol>	1. <i>Children</i>. Based on teacher interviews, the Child-to-Child
Programme has helped reinforce skills and focus attention on new health
information. Given the limited time most children spend in the creche, efforts
are continuously made to repeat the message in as many forms as possible. The
teachers interviewed indicated that children have started to use dust bins,
food is covered, and an improvement in personal cleanliness was observed.
According to the reports, it was more difficult to engage children in community
activities and they cautioned that the popularization of songs may at times de-emphasize
the importance of the content of the health messages.<p>
<p>
	2.<i> Parents</i>. Based on parental interviews, Child-to-Child
messages have reached the parents particularly as related to the use of 0RS and
other dietary habits including the negative impact of alcohol, pan, and chewing
tobacco. The majority of parents, recognizing the value of this information,
accepted the communication of these messages by their children.<p>
<p>
	3. <i>Teachers</i>. The success of the programme is largely attributed to the
efforts of teachers in all phases of programme design and development, An
unanticipated benefit of the programme was the positive impact on the teacher
both in terms of health knowledge gained as well as opportunity to design and
implement creative teaching strategies.</ol>
	In summary, it appears that the success of the Mobile Creche's Child-to-Child
programmes lies in the participatory management style as well as its on-the-job
training programme and follow up. The participatory management style fosters
joint decision making through consultation at all levels of the organization.
Teachers are included, motivated and encouraged to develop curriculum materials
and innovative methods. Management is deeply committed to their staff and as
such foster a non-hierarchial
interactive managerial style. The establishment of this mode of operation is
facilitated by the voluntary nature of Mobile Creche and the absence of formal
rules and procedures characteristic of other bureaucratic organizations. The
relatively small size of the organization encourages such managerial style. If
the number of sites were to increase substantially, one wonders whether
management would become more formalized and grass-roots
participation in decision-making
and problem-solving would diminish.<p>
<p>
<b><center>BOTSWANA<br>
The Botswana Child-to-Child Project</center></b><p>
<p>
	Child-to-Child
projects have been initiated in many African countries and focus largely on
health activities. The Botswana project was selected because of its emphasis on
the educational and psychological components of the Child-to-Child
Programme.<p>
<p>
	It has been found that a number of children in Botswana, especially in the
rural areas, have difficulty adjusting to school life. (Government of Botswana,
1986). The setting is unfamiliar, the teachers strange, and much of what they
encounter, books, pencils, crayons, etc,, are often foreign to their previous
experience. If children can become familiar with concepts such as these before
beginning school, the adjustment process is made easier, and the formal
education process begins sooner and with less difficulty. (Otaala, B.1984;
1987).<p>
<p>
	As described by Somerset (1988), the Child-to-Child
Programme in Botswana has been designed to provide informal preschool education
for young children while enhancing the educational experience of older, primary-level
children. The older children ("little teachers") help prepare the younger
children ("preschoolers") for school entry and in turn enhance their own
cognitive and affective development. Beginning in 1979 with two schools, the
programme is now in operation in 28 schools reaching approximately 5,000
children. Formal control of the programme is held by the Board of the Child-to-Child
Foundation of Botswana, which includes representatives from Ministry of
Education and local government, multilateral and bilateral aid donors, and the
American Women's Association.<p>
<p>
	Initially the Child-to-Child
Programme functioned as a one-to-one
outreach programme. "Little teachers" drawn from Standards 1, 2 and 3 (7, 8 and
9 years) received two additional periods of instruction each week. To guide the Child-to-Child
teachers, lesson booklets focussing on four major themes were developed:
"Feelings and Who Am I?," "Preparing for School," "Health in the Home," and
"The Village." More recently, greater emphasis is being placed on the
development of school readiness skills including drawing, writing and number
skills.<p>
<p>
	Since 1981, the programme has shifted its emphasis from out-of-school
to in-school
activities. Preschoolers come to school several times each week to participate
in Child-to-Child
sessions in which each preschooler is paired with a little teacher. Although
there is programme variability between schools, the work of the little teachers
is divided between school and home. Child-to-Child
teachers herd a training session for the little teachers before each visit by
the preschoolers. Although teachers are present during the in-school
sessions for the preschoolers, their role is mainly organisational and
supportive. Most of the instruction is delivered by the little teachers.<p>
<p>
	After the in-school
sessions, the pair continues to work at home practicing writing letters and
numbers and learning simple songs and games. Sometimes the little teacher uses
a worksheet prepared during the training sessions, but often the children write
in the sand, using a finger as a writing instrument. In the next training
session with the Child-to-Child
teachers, the little teacher has an opportunity to report on his experience
during these home lessons. Thus, the demand for an in-school
programme for the preschoolers has been met, but at the same time the original
programme for the little teachers has been maintained.<p>
<p>
	Several factors have contributed to the shift in focus from the home to the
school, Child-to-Child
teachers felt that the original approach did not allow enough opportunity to
supervise the work of the little teachers. Furthermore, the organisation of home-based
programmes is likely to have caused problems that could be easily avoided by
moving the activities to the school. However, parental demand for
institutionalised preschool education has perhaps been the most important
factor in the recent shift. In Botswana, as in many other developing countries,
the value of preschool education has risen steadily over recent years. As
competition for formal employment has intensified, parents have sought to
provide children with educational opportunities that will improve their chance
of success. It is believed that children who get an early start to their
education have an advantage in this competition.<p>
<p>
	Unfortunately, little quantitative systematic information of the impact of
this programme on its beneficiaries is available. However, given the rapid
expansion and acceptance of this programme, it has been considered a tremendous
success. Several qualitative studies and feedback substantiate its
accomplishments. The following summarizes the benefits accrued by the intended
audiences.<p>
<ol>	1. <i>Younger children</i>. In one of the schools, a Child-to-Child
Programme has been running long enough for the first group of preschoolers to
complete primary school. In this school, results in the Primary School Leaving
Examination (PSLE) showed a sharp improvement in 1986 - the first year that there had been ex-preschoolers
among the candidates. Both the headmistress and the Chairman of the Parent
Teachers Association are convinced that the Child-to-Child
Programme has played a major role in this improvement. This success is largely
attributed to the programme's ability to provide the preschool child with
opportunities to explore the school environment gradually, making the
difficulty transition to primary school a positive experience.<p>
<p>
	A second advantage of this approach is the invaluable impact of one-to-one
tutoring in the young child's acquisition of basic cognitive, psychomotor, and
social skills. Finally little teachers are important as "communication
facilitators," since preschoolers speaking local dialects are often
misunderstood by the adult teachers.<p>
<p>
	2. <i>Older children</i>. The "little teachers" have increased self-
                                                                                        
confidence
and sense of responsibility through assisting in the instruction of younger
children. Moreover, many teachers reported improved performance in the basic
early learning skills which come from the additional training and attention
received.<p>
<p>
<p>
	3. <i>Parents and community</i>. The parents of children involved in this
programme are exposed to the school system and its operation, thereby
benefiting from the message that reaches them on health and education issues.
In addition, the programme has the ability to favourably impact a parents'
knowledge, attitude, and beliefs towards the importance of educating the
preschool child.<p>
<p>
	4. <i>Teachers and school system</i>. Teachers are exposed to and have the
opportunity to implement a set of new teaching methodologies and approaches.
Through this programme teachers have the opportunity to design receptive
learning with activity based approaches which assist children in the
construction of their own knowledge. Moreover, through the success of the
little teachers, teachers are themselves relieved of much of the time and
energy devoted to the adaptation of children to the first year of school.
Finally, the efforts of this initiative have been both a vehicle for extending
the availability of preschool education and for enhancing the quality of
primary education in the early years of school.</ol>
	From these case studies, a number of preliminary conclusions regarding
programme emphasis and results begin to emerge. However, before attempting to
extract these lessons, we turn to a description of the activities and
experience of the London-based Child-to-Child
Programme which seeks to institutionalize and promote the idea of children
caring for children around the world.<p>
<p>
<b><center>SECTION IV<br>

The Child-to-Child
Programme<br>
University of  London<br>
Institution Child Health and Education</center></b><p>
<p>
	Child-to-Child
is an international programme which was conceived by the Institute of Child
Health of the University of London, together with an International Committee,
to mark the International Year of the Child (IYC) in 1979. The programme moves
to yet another level the adaptation and institutionalisation of the idea of
children caring for children by promoting
the idea widely and providing assistance in getting local projects started.<p>
<p>
	The Child-to-Child
Programme is intended to teach and encourage older children, especially school
children, to concern themselves with the health and general development of
their younger brothers and sisters, or other young children in their community.
It pursues its goal by developing and providing materials tied to an
established and tested method, by giving start-up
financing and technical assistance to local or national programmes, and by
disseminating information about the Child-to-Child
approach, directly in workshops and meetings called for that purpose, and
indirectly through publications and a newsletter. A description of Child-to-Child
materials<p>
prepared and distributed by the Institutes is presented in Appendix I.<p>
<p>
	First and foremost an educational programme, Child-to-Child
encourages an active participatory approach to learning and teaching. The
originators of the programme, emphasize the importance of teachers perceiving
their role as helping children to help each other and to help their
communities. They suggest that in playing this helper role, teachers need to:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> Explore with children what the needs, problems and priorities in their
communities are ("find out"),<p>
<p>
	 <li>Discuss together ways of meeting these problems using what is already
available ("talk it over"),<p>
<p>
	 <li>Seek sympathetic understanding of other people's feelings and views (through
role playing, drama and other methods),<p>
<p>
	 <li>Design activities which will help, which will be acceptable, and which can
easily be 	undertaken, and<p>
<p>
	 <li>Be constantly ready to improve programmes in the light of experience
gained.</ul>
	The "teacher" may be a primary school teacher or a primary health care worker
or youth leader or another. And, the primary-school
aged children become teachers as well. The general strategy for working with
school-aged
children and communities is set out in a book titled <i>Child-to-Child</i>,
published in 1979 and now translated into several languages.<p>
<p>
	For the most part, projects affiliated with the Child-to-Child
programme have been carried out through primary schools or primary health care
centres. The primary school seems to be the central vehicle because many rural
areas in the Third World have at least one primary school, allowing coverage
over a wide area. In addition, the primary school teacher is usually a
respected and accepted figure, helping assure acceptance of the idea and the
programme at the local level. Primary health care centres also offer a good
entry point for a Child-to-Child
programme, as staff from these centres visit homes and schools and other
institutions where they can introduce activities from the programme.<p>
<p>
	The content of the materials produced by the Child-to-Child
programme covers various aspects of child care. Specific areas of concern
include: health related actions, nutrition and growth, prevention of accidents,
fostering mental and social development through play, and creating a supportive
environment. The selection of these areas was based on two main considerations:
(1) their importance in the hierarchy of problems in the community and
particularly their relevance to the health of young children, and (2)
availability of a realistic role for a primary school-aged
child to play in relation to the problem. (Webb, 1985). As these topics are
pursued within local settings, adaptations of priorities and materials in
response to the particular setting is crucial.<p>
<p>
	Topics are treated in a set of "activity sheets" prepared specifically for use
by teachers with the primary school-aged
child. The activities are chosen to fall within the experience of this age
group and lend themselves to constructive, participatory actions. They provide
factual information on a selected topic or subject and suggest relevant
activities in which to involve children in school, at home or in the community.
A list of the topics covered by activity sheets available from the programme is
provided in Appendix II together with an example of activities for one area.<p>
<p>
	In addition, the programme has developed a set of supplementary readers which
can be used in formal classes or as references, but which carry health and
educational messages. These are geared to particular reading levels of primary
school children and written in simple language with appropriate
illustrations.<p>
<p>
<b>The Spread of Child-to-Child</b><p>
<p>
	In the course of the almost 10 years that the international programme has been
functioning, the Child-to-Child
Programme has spread over a wide area. Projects affiliated with the
international programme are now found in at least 48 countries. (Somerset,
1988). This spread has been assisted by the central office in London which, in
addition to providing prepared materials, has organised workshops to enable
local groups to prepare, or update, activity sheets, and to help them launch
local projects.<p>
<p>
	Child-to-Child
affiliated projects are funded locally, often with partial start-up
funding from London. Each country manages its own activities, sometimes through
a Child-to-Child
foundation and sometimes through a relevant government organization such as the
Ministry of Education or Health.                                      <p>
<p>
	Several of the projects previously described in Section III have been assisted
by or originated with the Child-to-Child
Programme in London. Evidence of potential benefits from programmes building on
the practice of children caring for children was indicated by the discussion of
the results of these projects. The Child-to-Child
Programme adds to that evidence with a range of examples. The following section
briefly summarizes the benefits of Child-to-Child
programmes and activities.(l.) The examples are presented in the following

<p>
<ul><li>	 <i>Burkina Fasso</i>. A co-ordinating
Child-to-Child
unit has been set up to service and assist different initiatives undertaken by
government, ministries and voluntary agencies. Such a unit also initiates and
organises training but in no way "directs" Child-to-Child
activities.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Chile</i>. The Child-to-Child
Programme, instituted through the Ministry of Education and initially centred
on health education, uses 12-and 13-year-old
children as "helpers" with young children in rural schools. Each older child is
responsible for about seven young ones. The curriculum has been extended to
include basic skills and value education. The programme has been so successful,
particularly with the "helpers" themselves, that 1-1/2
million children are now affected, and all schools in Chile will be involved in
1988. Much supporting and background material has been produced.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Guatemala</i>. This Child-to-Child
Programme emphasises not only health messages but the important role of
children within the educational system. Much material is produced, including a
newsletter, comic strips, and books of writing by children that can be used as
reading material for other children. Children also take part in radio
broadcasts.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>New Guinea (Papua)</i>. Child-to-Child
approaches emphasising health education have been incorporated into the
community school syllabus. The approach also stresses the relationship of
schools to the community and the responsibility of children. One example is a
publication of a booklet by the Ministry of Education called "Finding out about
our school: Is it healthy?". Children and teachers have a checklist that they
fill out each week, month, and term.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Tanzania</i>. A new school health programme emphasising child survival and
development has been launched by the Ministry of Education with support from
UNICEF. Child-to-Child
approaches have been incorporated into this programme and into the teacher
training that accompanies it. Schools use a Swahili translation of Child-to-Child
materials and also Child-to-Child
readers in their English lessons.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Zambia</i>. National and local Child-to-Child
Committees have been established throughout the country, with participation
from both the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health. Local
committees have considerable autonomy to adapt approaches in schools. Child-to-Child
concentrates particularly on certain key health priorities, e.g., oral
rehydration, immunisation, nutrition; and emphasises the use of children as
information gatherers and communicators within their communities.</ul>
<b>Child-to-Child School-Based Programmes<br> 
Organized by the Ministry of Health</b><p>
<p>
<ul><li><i>Bangladesh</i>. A school health magazine, Mitali, has been produced by
UNICEF. It is specifically aimed at children who take care of their younger
brothers and sisters, and is entirely based on Child-to-Child
activities.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Liberia</i>. A locally produced Child-to-Child
booklet is issues by the Ministry of Health and used with school children. The
Child-to-Child
readers prove useful, and children are encouraged to tell the stories to their
parents.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Nepal</i>. Child-to-Child
materials and approaches have been used extensively by the Health Education
Unit of the Urban Development programme in Kathmandu. School children are
initiated into the activities by their teachers. They form teams and take the
messages to younger children in school, to children outside schools, and to
their families and communities. Some 10,000 children are said to be involved.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Oman</i>. Following a national seminar organised at the Ministry of
Health, plans are now being developed to spread the ideas widely through the
school system. Ministries of Education and Culture as well as UNICEF and other
voluntary agencies are all cooperating.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Zimbabwe</i>. Child-to-Child
activities are being undertaken both nationally and provincially. In one
province teachers are encouraged to include activities in their social studies
teaching, and at the same time the activities are reproduced informally through
the school health magazine, which is provided as a resource for all teachers.</ul>
<b>Child-to-Child Programmes<br>
Supported by Nongovernmental Organisations</b><p>
<ul><li><i>Angola</i>. The Children living in the area surrounding the Bongo Mission
Hospital were gathered once a week for three months in the village church and
presented with different topics of Child-to-activity sheets.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Indonesia (Jakarta)</i>. A "little doctor" programme is in operation.
Children in school are specially selected to receive "little doctor" status.
Once appointed, they work with the school health officer and have certain
specific duties to perform. They must also keep records of community hygiene
and report findings. Similar Health Scout programmes are reported in Peru and
Pakistan.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Kenya (Nairobi)</i>, A group of Health Scouts, working from a community
centre in Mathare Valley, was able through the use of songs to spread health
messages. Similar programmes are described in South Africa.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Nigeria</i>. The Boy Scouts of Nigeria use Child-to-Child
activities in various states. Emphasis is particularly on community hygiene and
safety. Training and awards for proficiency are given. Similar activities are
reported from the <i>People's Republic of Benin</i>.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Pakistan</i>. The Aga Khan School Health Service provides Child-to-Child
material both to teachers and to social workers and has prepared much
additional material. Some 12,000 school  children are affected. The Aga Khan
Foundation in partnership with UNICEF also gives substantial support to six
programmes in India.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Sierra Leone</i>. Plan International, a community development and foster
parent's agency, produces its own local version of Child-to-Child
material especially aimed at poor families. The programme trains teachers,
organises children's talks and plays, and maintains a monthly "reporting
session" by siblings on the growth and development of their younger brothers
and sisters using an "under five" clinic card.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Sudan</i>. Secondary school pupils (11-13
years of age) in the Eastern and Northern Gezira Province operate a Health
Scout Project under the direction of an area coordinator. Each school is
divided into Health Scout Committees under the supervision of a Master. Each
Committee takes an area, and each pupil takes three families. The pupil is then
responsible for teaching and monitoring certain key health priorities within
these families.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Uganda</i>. An association of Child-to-Child
schools exists, which is organised by a committee of teachers with funds
provided mainly from a group of parallel schools in Norway. Child-to-Child
schools carry out health-based
activities within those schools and in the community. Much material has been
produced including a calendar; a childrens' magazine, and a book written by
children and teachers. Other activities include the production of radio
programmes, and health campaigns carried out within their communities.</ul>
<b>Child-to-Child Programmes with Special Focus</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Focus On Handicapped Children</b>:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> <i>Honduras</i>. Students in the Department of Special Education in one of
the Teachers Colleges (Escuela Normal) are taught how to help school children
make apparatus for handicapped students.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>India (Andra Pradesh)</i>. Since 1982, activities have been organised in
Tirupati with "child leaders" identified to spread messages in schools,
families, and communities in the slum areas. A particular emphasis is being
placed on the identification and prevention of eye diseases and even more so on
the causes of these - poor nutrition, failure to immunise, and poor personal hygiene. The programme
has received funding from the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Kenya</i>. A number of schools, with encouragement from the Charity Action
Aid (which also organises similar programmes in other countries), have taken
action to help local schools for handicapped children. Child-to-Child
material has been specially adapted.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Mexico</i>. Project Projimo, located in western Mexico, is a
community-based
project for the disabled. Project members, themselves usually disabled
villagers, cooperate to make aids for disabled children. Child-to-Child
cooperation is constantly stressed, and many of the project workers are
children and youth.</ul>

	<b>Focus On Refugee Children</b>:<p>
<p>
<ul><li> <i>Djibouti</i>. Child-to-Child
material was used to teach children attending feeding centre in refugee camps.
At the same time, community health workers were trained in the use of Child-to-Child
messages for children in the villages.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Somalia</i>. Following a Child-to-Child
seminar in 1986 activities have been designed for refugee children. Child-to-Child
activities are also being used with refugees in Lebanon, Thailand, and Pakistan
(for Afghan refugees).</ul>

	
<b>Focus On Street and Other Displaced Children</b>:<p>
<p>
<ul>	 <li><i>Brazil (Itabuna Municipality)</i>. "Childrens' farms" have been
established for street children organised by the Mayor and his wife who are one
of the original founders of the Child-to-Child
Programme in Brazil. In this environment, children of' all ages work
together.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Philippines (Manila)</i>. The LINGAP Centre in Manila gives alternative
education for street children and abused children. Children work in groups of 10-12
with games, role-playing,
and group sharing. They learn to help each other and to apply the Child-to-Child
messages outside the Centre.</ul>
	<b>Focus On Children in Hospitals</b>:<p>
<ul><li> <i>India (Baroda)</i>. Older children in the pediatric ward make puppets and
read stories to the younger ones. After leaving they were encouraged to take
Child-to-Child
messages back to their villages. Similar activities are reported from Kenya
(Northern Province) where children in hospital wards have been encouraged to
read and translated Child-to-Child
readers to younger or non-school
children.</ul>

	<b>Focus On Children in Remote Areas</b>:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 <i>India (Maharashtra)</i>. Children of health workers who travel into tribal
areas regard themselves as child health workers and are taught to work with
local children. Qualities such as, understanding and humility are particularly
emphasised so that they will be trusted and accepted.</ul>

<b>Child-to-Child Programmes<br> 
Integrated Into the Training of Medical Personnel</b><p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 <i>Indonesia (Samarang)</i>. In the Department of Community Health in the
Faculty of Medicine all students are required to study the Child-to-Child
approach. The use of Child-to-Child
also forms part of their practical training. A team of' faculty members has
adapted the Child-to-Child
material to meet the particular context and purpose of the training.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Nigeria (Lagos)</i>. Child-to-Child
activities are integrated into the programme for teaching medical students and
community health care officers at the Institute of Child Health and Primary
Care at the College of Medicine, University of Lagos. The college also
maintains contact with local primary schools and tries out materials there.
Children also gather information about health problems under the direction of
the Institute.<p>
<p>
	 <li><i>Tanzania (Zanzibar)</i>. Child-to-Child
activities and approaches are used in the training of nurses. Because of the
educational and language levels of the nurses, it has been found that the Child-to-Child
readers are a very suitable means of conveying messages to them. In <i>Sri
Lanka</i> Child-to-Child
is similarly used in the university-based
training for child care workers.</ul>
<b><center>SECTION V<br>
Conclusions and Recommendations</center></b><p>
<p>
	While the practice of older children caring for younger siblings is
decreasing, as a result of changing family structures and increasing school
enrollments, it still occurs at significant levels in many parts of the third
World. As this review suggests, "children caring for children" provides one
alternative in a range of programme options intended to improve early childhood
care and development. Increasingly, justification for these Child-to-Child
efforts lies in their positive effect on the primary school child who increases
his level of health information as well as parenting skills. In addition, their
participation in the programme has had a direct impact on behaviours which
support an enhanced child rearing environment.<p>
<p>
	As a conscious strategy to improve child health and development, Child-to-Child
programmes are barely a decade old. What can be learned from this decade of
actions? Is the idea accepted?  Does it work to enhance the knowledge,
attitudes, and practices of older children, parents and communities? Does it
improve the health of younger children under their care? What content, methods,
and organization seem to be most effective? How can programmes be sustained?
This review has attempted to provide some preliminary responses to these
questions.<p>
<p>
<b>Is the Idea Accepted?</b><p>
<p>
	It is clear that the concept of children caring for children provides an
acceptable and even sought-after
basis for programming to improve the well-being
of children, families, and communities. This acceptance is evident in the rapid
spread of successful Child-to-child
programmes both as independent initiatives and those affiliated and promoted by
the Institutes of Child Health and Education in London. The Child-to-Child
idea that is currently being promoted and accepted is primarily a creative and
effective health education programme focussing on older primary school
children. In this recent set of initiatives, little attention is focussed
directly on the
immediate care and development of the younger child. Although the merits of
Child-to-Child
programmes emphasizing health education, and the acceptance of that strategy
are real and should not be minimized, it is important to recognize a shift in
most programmes away from the traditional practice of children caring for
children which provided the starting point.<p>
<p>
<b>Does It Work? For Whom?</b><p>
<p>
	Reports of the benefits of successful Child-to-Child
activities to older and younger children, families, schools, and communities
are numerous. Many of these reports are anecdotal, but they support the
relatively few systematic evaluations that have been carried out.
                    <p>
	<ol>1. <i>Older children</i>. In their dual role as the providers and recipients
of Child-to-Child
activities, older children benefit directly in terms of increased knowledge of
health, nutrition, and education, improved health practices and beliefs, and
more nurturing attitudes towards younger siblings. In addition to these
positive outcomes, older children receive benefits through their role as
"message carriers" to younger siblings and other children within the community.
In the process, children develop a sense of increased self-esteem
and confidence through school-based
and/or community activities, Moreover, it is expected that these newly acquired
skills and the emphasis on preventive rather than curative solutions to health
problems will exert an intergenerational effect on the offspring of these soon-to-be
parents.<p>
<p>
	2. <i>Family and community</i>. Families and communities have benefited from
the dissemination of health knowledge designed to change negative practices and
from surveys of health problems made by older children leading to
identification of cases needing attention to conditions requiring corrective
actions. Finally, communities have benefited from direct actions to improve the
environment and community conditions, such as cleaning up garbage and helping
to build latrines.<p>
<p>
3. <i>Teachers and schools</i>. The activity-oriented,
participatory approach used in many Child-to-Child
programmes often provides an appealing alternative to teachers seeking escape
from traditional practices. Moreover, this approach provides a low-cost
opportunity to enhance the quality of primary school health education. School-based
health education is generally integrated into the science curriculum, with
sparse coverage of such critical topics as the prevention and treatment of
diarrhoea. Child-to-Child
activities, emphasizing a creative and active approach to learning, have
strengthened the primary school's health education curriculum. In some cases,
the programmes have dramatically improved the health conditions and
environments of the schools.<p>
<p>
	4. <i>Younger children</i>. From the data reviewed, benefits to younger
children are somewhat  more difficult to capture and define. Programmers
assumed that younger children would benefit directly from the activities
performed with them or indirectly through the benefits received by older
children, parents, or teachers. The absence of adequate documentation reflects,
in part, the shift toward programmes concentrating on older children. This
situation is further complicated by the fact that influencing the nutritional
status or the psycho-social
development of young children is a continuous and long-term
process, influenced by many factors. Thus, it is difficult to measure the short-term
impact of interventions. At the same time however, a number of programmes
claimed direct and measurable effects through the identification, treatment and
reduction of scabies and through an increase in levels of immunisation promoted
though the
programme.</ul>
<b>What Is Effective?</b><p>
<p>
	<i>Linkages and integration</i>. For a variety of reasons; Child-to-Child
activities linked to and integrated within existing programmes are most
effective. Efforts to design new programmes creates competition that is seldom
welcomed. Experience suggests that schools are the most promising collaborating
institution. In most Third World countries, there are many more schools and
teachers than there are health facilities and health workers. Moreover,
substantial portion of school-aged
children attend school where they provide a captive audience for programme
implementation.<p>
<p>
	While many programmes illustrate the potential of schools to mount effective
programmes a range of complex barriers and constraints can undercut
effectiveness. These include absence of financial and material resources, low
levels of teacher morale and qualification, high rates of turnover, and teacher
overload. The ability of programmes to overcome such barriers is enhanced when
they have the active involvement and support not only of educators, health care
providers, and community workers, but also of policy-makers
and administrators. Success is also enhanced through proper training of
teachers and by assuring that the programme does not constitute an extra burden
but is, rather built upon and related to knowledge that they are expected to
impart within the regular curriculum. Teachers, through a system of rewards and
incentives, should be encouraged to design and implement creative teaching
strategies.<p>
<p>
	In addition, children-caring-for-children
programmes must be closely integrated with other ongoing programmes and
institutions operating within the schools and community, including women's
groups, child care programmes, primary health care centres, and youth groups. A
possible drawback to some school-based Child-to-Child approaches is their treatment as a separate classroom subject isolated both by
distinctive content and innovative teaching methodologies. In the long run,
this isolation renders projects vulnerable to the withdrawal of resource
support after the initial funding period. By contrast, the programmes that
persist beyond an initial critical period are those that both enhance and
strengthen existing curricula.<p>
<p>
	<i>Methods and materials</i>. Experience suggests that health education
materials developed for use in primary schools should be kept simple and
practical, written in easily understood language, and well illustrated. The
teaching methods used, where possible, should be discovery based, and encourage
children to observe, ask questions and come to conclusions for themselves.<p>
<p>
	Also effective are programmes which include:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>	 A demonstrative, participatory, problem-solving
approach;<p>
<p>
	 <li>A "child-centered" approach;<p>
<p>
	 <li>An integrated approach, involving content about health and nutrition and
child development;<p>
<p>
	 <li>An approach using varied materials and teaching techniques; and,<p>
<p>
	 <li>An approach involving applications - learning-by-doing.</ul>    
	One element of learning-by-doing
that, as suggested above, seems to have been left aside in many programmes is
the application of what is learned in direct care for younger children.
Although it is clear that not all primary school children will have younger
brothers and sisters, it is still possible to "adopt" a younger child as part
of the programme (a first grader, for instance). The obligation to work with
the younger child means that older children must learn what they are to teach,
must be good role models, and must practice. There is a strong argument,
therefore, for reintroducing the younger child more prominently into the
programme.<p>
<p>
	<i>Cultural sensitivity</i>. The material discussed within this review
emphasizes that an understanding of cultural values is essential to child care
and development programming. Programmes are most effective when the content
focusses on problems that are salient and relevant to the concerns expressed by
the community. This can be accomplished through the recognition of positive
practices, not merely discouraging negative practices. Thus, programming must
be flexible, in order to encourage possibilities of local adaption and cultural
adjustment to a changing array of child health care and developmental concerns.
There is a challenge to design activities that capitalize on existing positive
beliefs and practices at the same time that they discourage those that may be
harmful.<p>
<p>
	One set of cultural sensitivities refers to beliefs about disease and its
treatment:. Do mothers withhold food and drink when a child has diarrhoea? Why?
Are there home remedies for diarrhoea that are effective that are different
from the ones being recommended from outside?<p>
<p>
	Another set of cultural sensitivities has to do with communication strategies,
both with respect to content and as they are related to social relationships.
In what circumstances can a child be expected to communicate what kinds of'
messages to parents and community members?<p>
<p>
	In the first place, messages should be couched in the local language. These
may involve an analysis of  local vocabulary. Second, messages need to be
tested and revised before widely used. Third, programmes should respect local
protocol. Experience in Child-to-Child
programmes shows that children often bring home ideas that are considered
radical and challenging, If parents have fixed ideas not only about content,
but also about protocol - when a child can speak and whether they are allowed
to say things that contradict their parents - then messages are often
ignored.<p>
<p>
	In programmes where the emphasis is on the older child as a communicator to
adults, the question of culturally related communication strategies is not a
trivial one. For example, in many African countries, respect for age is
emphasised in the child's upbringing. Fafunwa (1974) states: "Age is an
important element in the life of the African. Reverence for those who are older
than one is particularly strong among the Yoruba....The elder is assumed to be
a man or woman of wisdom and he is expected to demonstrate this in speech and
action lest he lose his position in the company of those who look up to him for
leadership" (page 5). Under this relationship, situations where a child would
feel encouraged to pass health messages to parents and community must be
cautiously conceived.<p>
<p>
	Suggestions about how to overcome or at least allay the suspicions and
resistance of the parents and community to messages brought to them by school
children have been made by several programme developers. For example,
information should be presented with respect for the knowledge of the parents
and the traditions of the community. Parents must understand what it is their
children are doing, and children should not be placed in a position to
criticize or contradict their parents' behaviour, especially in the presence of
others.<p>
<p>
	Parents' fears may be partially allayed through discussion, newsletters
(possible only when adults can read) and entertainment-evenings
with skits and role-plays
that transmit the health messages that are being taught to children. To ensure
a correct approach teachers or youth leaders should encourage children to
practice "passing messages" to adults.<p>
<p>
<b>What Can Be Done to Promote Institutional<br> 
Innovation and to Sustain
Programmes?</b><p>
<p>
	The question of programme sustainability is particularly significant
considering recent reviews (Fuerstein, 1981; Somerset, 1988) of Child-to-Child
activities which revealed the difficulty in sustaining programmes over time.
Research evidence suggests that for one to institutionalise a new programme or
innovation, attention focussed on the following factors is crucial: (1)
adopter, (2) change agent, and (3) participatory control. For example, if the
<u>adopter</u> perceives that the innovative process or the social system in
which they work is supportive of the programme, he may react positively to it.
Secondly, if <u>change agents</u>: (1) incorporates adopters in the decision-making
process surrounding the selection, development, and training of an innovation,
(2) does not separate the role of the programme implementor from the local
national staff, (3) listens to or acknowledges adopter concerns, the
programme's chance of survival is increased. A system based on models such as
problem-solving,
social interaction, or linkage, in which the change agent collaborates closely
with the adopter population might assist the agent in avoiding the resentment
and apathy frequently evident. Finally, <u>participation</u> of local adopters
as early as possible within the innovation process is essential, and they
should be actively engaged in the definition of programme goals and
objectives.<p>
<p>
<b>Recommendations</b><p>
<p>
	Based on the foregone review, it is suggested that tile following
recommendations be considered in the design and implementation of programmes
based on children caring for children.<p>
<p>
<ol>	1. Continued support should be given to experimentation with and extension of
programmes based on the principle of children caring for children.<p>
<p>
	2. When introducing such a programme:<p>
<p>
<ul><li>		 Use a participatory model from the beginning of the process.<p>
<p>
		 <li>Incorporate participants into decisions about initial selection, development
and introduction.<p>
<p>
		 <li>Set up a coordinating body from various groups involved in and affected by
the programme.<p>
<p>
		 <li>Base training and the development of materials on a valid needs assessment,
with sensitivity to cultural differences.<p>
<p>
		 <li>Build-in
continuous assessment of the programmes.<p>
<p>
		 <li>Attach to ongoing programmes.<p>
<p>
		 <li>Avoid dependence solely on donor agencies for funding.</ul>
<p>
	3. Reassess ways in which the cross-age
concept can be refined and strengthened in current Child-to-Child
activities. Older children must be provided with real opportunities to put into
practice the concepts stressed through the programme. In addition to the
current health/nutrition emphasis, the importance of creative and active
interaction of older children with the younger children in their care must
receive renewed programming attention. Programme developers need to more fully
explore the possibilities for pairing primary school children with preschool
children and establishing greater linkages between primary and preschool
institutions.<p>
<p>
	4. Encourage and improve research and programme evaluation of Child-to-Child
programmes.</ol>

	<i>Research</i>. In many Third World countries the current body of knowledge
on the physical, psychological, learning and emotional needs of children is
sketchy and incomplete. Development of children is inextricably interwoven, and
therefore, successful programmes are those based on knowledge of the child in
interaction within his total environment. In order to design more efficient and
effective Child-to-Child
programmes which are based on the needs of the child as perceived and expressed
by the community, it is essential that a research agenda addressing critical
issues in child development be put forth.<p>
<p>
	In this regard, multi-disciplinary
research must be developed to identify the effectiveness of culture-specific
child rearing practices, patterns and beliefs, with particular attention to
their relevance in today's changing and economically constrained environment.
Country-specific reviews should identify and analyze positive practices which could be
reinforced and strengthened as well as the practices which negatively impact
upon health and development. In addition, research designed to understand the
complex set of interactions between the health, nutritional, and psycho-social
aspects of development must be conducted.<p>
<p>
	<i>Programme evaluation</i>. The investigation of the impact of programmes on
recipients has been plagued by the set of constraints confronting the
evaluation of all service-oriented
programmes. Thus the design of programme evaluation strategies utilizing both
quantitative and qualitative techniques must become a priority. Such search
should be designed to systematically address the following set of issues in
Child-to-Child
programmes.<p>
<ul><li>	 What are the short- and long-term
impacts of the programme? How effective is the approach for changing the
knowledge, beliefs, and attitudes of the intended programme audience? Is the
programme able to enhance positive behaviours of younger and older children,
parents, families, schools, and communities?<p>
<p>
	 <li>Who are the most responsive recipients of this programming approach? What are
the important antecedent variables derived from a child's background and
experience that influence an individual's ability to respond successfully to
the programme?<p>
<p>
	 <li>How can projects and activities be modified to reach the children at highest
risk?<p>
<p>
	 <li>What are the contextual and environmental factors that contribute to a
programme's success, such as institutional setting, programme incentives,
training, and teaching methods?<p>
<p>
	 <li>Which teaching and learning methodologies are most effective in transmitting
competency? What incentives drive the project?<p>
<p>
	 <li>What happens to the impact of programmes when they move from small-scale
projects to broad-based
programmes reaching large numbers of beneficiaries?</ul>
	In summary, given both the widespread acceptance and rapid spread of
programmes capitalizing upon the idea of children caring for children
throughout this past decade, the resulting programme adaptations and shifts in
emphasis suggested through this review seem to have some merit. While no one
paradigm or model can be described, it is hoped that this discussion has
succeeded in its effort to identify and understand the complex set of factors
which enhance and constrain the design and implementation of effective
children-caring-for-children programmes<p>

<center>USING PRIMARY-SCHOOL CHILDREN TO<br>
IMPROVE CHILD-REARING PRACTICES IN RURAL JAMAICA</b><br><p>

<b><u>Summary</u></b><p>
<p>
	Many children in Jamaica suffer from poor development, inadequate dental care
and low immuniration status. There is a need for low-cost
innovative programmes to reach these children. We piloted an approach to
teaching primary-school
children basic child health and development concepts with the aim of improving
their knowledge and practices and those of their guardians. The programme was
conducted with 89 children from three grade levels in a remote rural school.
The topic was taught throughout the school year with an action-oriented
curriculum. Evaluation showed improvement in school children's knowledge and
practices and guardians' knowledge. This approach is seen to be a feasible, low
cost way of improving the quality of future child care.<p>
<p>
	The development of children living in deprived envirorrments is a cause for
great concern in many parts of both the developing and developed world. This is
the case in Jamaica where large numbers of children live in poverty and suffer
from poor health, growth and development.<p>
<p>
	In particular these children show a marked decline in developmental level from
12 months of age, and by 4 years of age they are seriously behind their middle-class
peers (Powell et. al., 1982; Wein, 1972a). This decline has been attributed to
the quality of their environments. The homes lack toys, books and other
educational material, and mothers make little conscious attempt to improve
young children's development through play (Grantham-McGregor
et al., 1983; Leo-Phynie
&amp; Gaynor, 1981). Discipline is generally authoritarian (Grant, 1974). Rural
children have usually been found to have worse physical and mental development
than urban children (Wein, 1972b).<p>
<p>
	Health care is inadequate and low levels of immunizatiun (CARES, 1980, 1982;
Puffer &amp; Serrano, 1983) and dental care (Ashworth &amp; Waterlow, 1970;
Stephenson, 1969) present major public health problems.<p>
<p>
	Social, and health services cannot reach a1l high-risk
children, thus there is a need for innovative low-cost
intervention strategies which focus on all aspects of the child's development.
Using primary-school
children is one such approach, whereby older children are taught how to care
more adequately for their younger siblings at home, and also to spread concepts
of child health and development to the rest of the family.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Rationale for Using School Children</u></b><p>
<p>
	In Jamaica, families are large and children spread over many years.
Frequently, older children are left to care for their younger siblings. This
practice is not unique to Jamaica, and other studies (Bianco &amp; Chodorow,
1964; Goldberg, 1972; Leiderman et al., 1977) have shown that it is a well-accepted
practice elsewhere, particularly in Third World countries.<p>
<p>
	The school, in spite of its many problems, is still a natural channel through
which the health and development of the community could be improved, with
school children as natural change agents.<p>
<p>
	In this paper we report the results of a project carried out in a remote rural
Jamaican school. The aims were to improve school children's and their
guardians' knowledge and practices related to immunization, dental care and
child development.<p>
<p>
	The study was carried out in a school (approximately 400 children) situated in
a rural mountainous area. The school had generally poor facilities, was
overcrowded and short of basic materials and teaching aids. The children's
level of literacy was generally low.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Methods</u></b><p>
<p>
	<i>Samples</i>. The sample comprised allchildren in grades 3, 5, and 7 of the
school and their guardians. At the beginning of the project all children on the
school register were chosen. Table 1 gives a description of their age and sex
by class.<p>
<p>
	The mothers or guardians of the school children were identified by visiting
the homes of each project child in the summer vacation preceding the project.
Over one-third
of the children (37%) were not living with their mothers, and both mothers and
guardians tended to be unmarried. This reflects the somewhat unstable family
patterns found in Jamaica. Housing standards were generally poor with
inadequate sanitation and overcrowding.<p>

</pre>
<p>
	<i>The Intervention</i>. Each week of the school year the children spent
approximately 1 hour learning about child health and development. Thus the
students participated in approximately 30 sessions over three terms.The
principal researcher assisted the class teacher during these periods.<p>
<p>
	The child development curriculum included the different areas of the
development of children, important developmental milestones and appropriate
child management techniques. The children were taught how to make toys from
waste household materials, and how to play with them so as<p>
to encourage a younger child's development.<p>
<p>
	The dental care lessons included the care of teeth and information on foods
which are good and bad for teeth. The immunization curriculum dealt with the
purpose of immunization, the diseases which immunization can prevent and the
times when the baby should be immunized.<p>
<p>
	The curriculum was action-oriented
and suitable for the children's low level of reading and writing. Activities
such as role play, group discussion and demonstrations were included. The
topics were reinforced with toy-making,
drama and poster competitions. An open day was also<p>
mounted at the end of the year.<p>
<p>
	<i>Evaluation</i>. At the beginning and end of the project a questionnaire was
administered to the guardians at home and a test was given to the children at
school. Information was obtained from the guardians on their social background,
knowledge of topics taught and certain of their child<p>
care activities. The guardians were also asked about the school child's
activities with the younger ones at home. In addition, at the end of the
project they were asked about the number of project toys brought home. The
school children were tested on their knowledge of topics taught.<p>
<p>
	<i>Analysis</i>. The data were analysed by computing frequencies of responses
on the items from both the school children's tests and the guardians'
questionnaires. Chi-square
analyses were then carried out to ascertain the significance of any differences
which may have occurred between the pre- and post-intervention
measures. In those instance where the differences between scores were large and
the number in the cells was too small for this test, statistical analysis was
not done. Five school children missed their initial test because they were
absent from school. By the end of the study, nine guardians and another 12
school children were lost. This was caused by guardians moving from the area
and poor school attendance of children on the day the test was given.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Results</u></b><p>
<p>
	Generally, the project was well received by the teachers, children and health
personnel involved. Fifteen toys were made throughout the year.<p>
<p>
	iSchool children's test</i>. The baseline information revealed that the school
children knew little of the topics to be taught. Responses concerning
immunization on the first test (Table 2) indicate that the school children's
knowledge of immunization was poor. Although about half had heard of
immunization, very few know its purpose or the number of injections or "drops"
which were required. There was a similarly low level of knowledge of basic
dental care.<p>
<p>
	The post-intervention
test results showed that there was a highly significant improvement in
knowledge of both immunization and dental care following the project.<p>

	Table 3 shows the school children knowledge of appropriate child management
techniques and play activities for young children. In the first test 66% of the
school children chose positive motivation as a good teaching tool for young
children although few favoured this approach when<p>
managing young children's behaviour. A very small portion of school children
recognized toys and play as having educational value. Similarly, few children
know the suitable concepts to teach young children with toys.<p>

	The post-intervention
results indicated that a significant improvement in knowledge in all areas had
taken place.<p>
<p>
	The school children were asked to choose between a number of methods which
could improve the language development of very young children. Firstly, they
were asked how to look at a book with young children (Table 4).<p>
<p>
    Very few school children knew that talking about pictures and stories were
better techniques than insisting on the child sitting still and reading every
word carefully.<p>
<p>
    They were then asked about talking with young children and playing with
pencil and paper. Here again, they school child chose the more formal and
inappropriate approaches of teaching the alphabet and writing sentences rather
than naming things in the immediate environment and drawing picture.<p>

    By the end of the project significantly more children chose the correct
responses to each item.<p>

<i>	Guardians</i>. The guardians were asked similar but fewer questions about
their knowledge of health care and child development. Many of them were aware
of what caused tooth decay (Table 5). Less than half were aware of the
educational value of toys and play and recognised the importance of chatting
with children to promote language development.<p>
<p>
	The guardians were also asked about their own activities with the children
(Table 5). After the project a significantly higher portion of guardians
reported that they encourage the older children to play with the younger ones.
There was no differences in the number of guardians reading, looking at
pictures and playing with the younger ones.<p>

<p>
	The guardians were also asked about the school child's previous activities in
the home (Table 6). They reported that the older child did not usually tell the
younger ones to clean their teeth. Very few reported that the children reminded
them about immunizing the baby. They also said that the school children
infrequently made toys for the younger ones. The post-intervention
results revealed a highly significant improvement in all these areas.<p>
<p>
<b>Discussion</b><p>
<p>
    Baseline data support the need for intervention in those areas of child
development and health care focussed on in this project.<p>
<p>
   The study was reasonably representative of remote rural schools in Jamaica
and had no special advantages. It is therefore probable that this approach
could be reproduced elsewhere.<p>
<p>
    This mode proved to be both feasible and successful; we managed to improve
the school children's knowledge of' the topics taught, and also change their
practices in certain areas. Some of the information reached the homes, and we
improved the guardians' knowledge; however, we could not detect any concomitant
improvement in their actions. A similar project in Indonesia was successful in
improving parents' knowledge of health matters, but practices were not
evaluated (Rhode and Sadjinum, 1980).<p>

Our success was obviously limited by the quality of the school, and we were
seriously handicapped by poor attendance, overcrowding and a high noise level.
It is probable that in situations where the educational system has fewer
problems. This approach would be more successful. There is a great need to
improve child care in all areas, and the curriculum is being extended to
include hygiene, nutrition, and health care. In addition, we are presently
training teachers rather than working with the children ourselves and this will
enable us to reach larger numbers of children at relatively low cost.<p>
	In conclusion, the success of this project suggests that if the expanded
curriculum was incorporated into the government school curriculum for all
primary grade levels, there would be a real opportunity to improve the quality
of child care in the future.<p>

<h1>Young Children and Health Care</h1><p>
	<p>
	Too often health professionals, educators, and social workers work in
isolation from each other, addressing the physical, intellectual and social
dimensions of a child&#146;s development as if they were in fact separate
topics.  However, the latest research on the relationship between health,
nutrition and stimulation argues convincingly that an adequate food supply is
not enough to assure a child's survival and ability to thrive, neither is
access to micro-nutrients, neither is education, nor absence of disease.
Children's growth and development are fostered when all these variables are
present, within a caring environment<p>
	<p>
	Studies also show that multi-dimensional programmes (that address
children&#146;s needs in more than one realm) are more sustainable and tend to
achieve greater benefits than mono-dimensional programmes.  Early Childhood
programmes can offer a vehicle to provide health and social services, they can
also be integrated as components of ongoing health or social support
programmes.	<p>
<p>
	In the following article, taken from the Consultative Group&#146;s
publication,<i> The Coordinators&#146; Notebook</i>, Issue #13, the author
explores the dimensions of a caring environment, and looks at ways that early
childhood programmes can strengthen all dimensions of <b>Care</b> including
health, nutrition, education, and family support. <p>

<title>The Intersecting Needs of Women and Children</title>
<head></head><body>
<h1>The Intersecting Needs of Women and Children	</h1><p>
<b></b>	<b>Women&#146;s Work and Child Care</b><p>
<p>
	To meet the intersecting needs of  women and children, programming that is
created to benefit women and girls must also be responsive to and take into
account women's childrearing responsibilities.  And programs created for
children must be designed in relation to women's needs.   <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Women do not exist in isolation.  </b><p>
<p>
	Their lives are interwoven with their family 's lives. Thus a woman's status,
the supports she has available to her, her level of education, and her ability
to earn income all affect children's growth and development.  And conversely,
the presence of a child (children) markedly affects a woman's personal growth
and development as well as her social participation and economic
productivity.<p>
<p>
	Too often in development projects, women become casualties rather than success
stories, because the project design does not support them as producers
<i>and</i> parents. Too often there is a false dichotomy set up between
"productive" and "reproductive" activities.  Women are whole people, who need
both their productive and reproductive inter-connections with others in order
to survive and thrive.  They work to get the food, clothing and shelter they
need, they create families, they parent the next generation, they learn, they
teach, they create expressions of their culture.  Within this larger pattern
parenting a child and creating goods for income both have value.   When a
program seeks to improve a woman's life, it needs to strengthen her within the
context of her whole life. <p>
<p>
<b>Children are a reality in women's lives</b>.  <p>
<p>
	For the great majority of the women in the world, childrearing is a
centerpiece of their lives.  For this reason women are often precluded from
income-generating activities because they cannot find ways to simultaneously
work outside the home and care for their children.  Child care responsibilities
begin at a young age.  Often young girls do not attend primary schools because
the costs to the family are too high; the need for the girl child to care for
younger siblings, cook, clean and gather water is often greater than the
perceived need for her to receive an education.  <p>
<p>
	However, this does not mean that caring for children and obligations to the
family must be considered liabilities.  In order for a development program to
successfully help a woman, it must find ways to help her address the
responsibilities and needs she brings with her, including her interdependency
with children.   Otherwise her participation or her children are doomed to
failure.<p>
<p>
<b>When children's needs are being met, women can expand their earning and
learning possibilities. </b><p>
<p>
	Women in both the formal and informal sectors who are preoccupied with
concerns about the safety and well-being of their children cannot focus on
their own development.  Traditionally in many settings women have had support
from other family members, neighbors, and members of the community -- both in
their caretaking roles with children and in meeting their children's material
needs.  Today, however, many systems of social support and child care that used
to be available to women have eroded in the face of such forces as migration,
urbanization, changes in family structure and extension of schooling. Thus
women are increasingly faced with the dual challenge of providing both monetary
and non-monetary supports for their families.  The demands on women's time are
often greatest when their need is greatest:<p>
<UL>
 <LI>in conditions of poverty<br>
 <LI>in single parent, women-headed households<br>
 <LI>during the first year of the child's life<br>
 <LI>when alternative child care options are lacking<br>
 <LI>if work is poorly paid, without benefits, far from home or physically
demanding<br>
 <LI>in heavy work seasons (e.g. harvest) or "wet" seasons<br>
 <LI>where culture strongly dictates an exclusively domestic role for women,
irrespective of their actual situations.<br></UL>

	When women have quality child care available to them, when they have good
information about how to make sure their children are receiving adequate
nutrition, stimulation, and nurturing, then they are able to turn their
attention to expanding their learning and earning activities.  At present, the
lack of adequate child care options inhibits the earning and learning
possibilities of women and inhibits the participation of girls in the formal
school system.  Yet we know there are benefits for both the women and children
when women earn and retain their own income. When women earn income that they
control, children benefit.  Women are more likely than men to devote the income
they earn to benefit the health and education of their children.  Thus if
mothers are earning money and they can determine how that money is spent,
children are the beneficiaries.<p>
<p>
When women are educated, children also benefit.  Each year of education a girl
receives correlates with her ability to provide better health and education for
her children.<p>
<p>
<b>Linking child care and development programs with programs for women is a
good investment.  </b><p>
<p>
	During the first six years of a child's life, foundation stones are laid
through good nutrition, appropriate interactions and stimulation, and nurturing
safe care.  Upon this foundation can be built a more successful future -- for
girls and women, and for the boys and men in their lives as well.  Studies in
both developed and developing countries have shown that an investment in young
children pays off in many types of social benefits.  Children who receive
quality care in their early years are more likely to become productive
participants in their communities.  Children who do not receive adequate care
-- who are left with slightly older siblings, who are left alone, who do not
get appropriate interaction and nurturing -- fail to thrive.  They perpetuate
the cycles of poverty  which <i>Women in Development</i> programs are seeking
to eradicate.  <p>
<p>
	Child care needs to be seen as a legitimate form of employment and income
generation for women.  Failure to recognize and classify child care as a valid
and worthwhile form of work means that the individuals providing organized
child care -- mostly women-- have low status in society, are poorly paid and
lack social benefits.	<p>
	<p>
<b>Educating girls is the first step in educating women.</b><p>
<p>
	Organized child care offers multiple benefits.  Not only can it help children
develop the appropriate basis for later learning and development, but it can
also serve women to help them meet their responsibilities. The provision of
child care in a community also frees girls, the informal caretakers in many
societies, to attend school.  <p>
<p>
<b>Quality child care needs to be promoted and created wherever efforts are
being made to improve the situation of women.</b>  <p>
	The word <i>quality</i> means that children need more than custodial care.
Child care needs to be set up in a way that promotes children's health,
nutrition, psycho-social and mental development. <p>
<p>
	Many alternative forms of child care can be available within a community.
These can include strengthening of traditional care in families, establishing
programmes of home day care for groups of children, setting up self-standing
programmes of center-based care, and linking programmes of alternative care to
programmes of community development, credit, community<p>
gardens, co-ops or markets, care in the workplace, etc.<p>
<p>
	Alternative care should be affordable, accessible, flexible, run by trusted
and accountable persons and meet minimum quality standards.<p>
<p>
<b>Good parenting can help break the cycles of poverty and ignorance.</b><p>
<p>
	Parenting programs can stimulate parents to re-think childrearing practices
and beliefs which lead to gender inequalities.  By making parents aware of
their child's individual development, and helping them learn to be responsive
to their child's needs, it is possible over time to make a substantial
difference in how both men and women view girls and women.  More important,
through supporting parents it becomes possible to create an environment where
children can become engaged problem-solvers and active participants in their
surroundings, breaking the cycles of poverty and ignorance. <p>
<p>
<b>Some Policy Implications</b><p>
<UL>
<LI> There is a need to improve and enforce legislation that defines women's access
to child care and regulates policies of maternal and paternal leave.  Without
supportive legislation, young children often fall through the cracks of funding
and social development projects.<p>
<LI> Governments need to invest financially in adequate child care, particularly
for children whose parents are involved in the informal sector and for
woman-headed households in marginal circumstances.<p>
<LI> It needs to become accepted practice that programmes organized to improve the
productivity, participation and welfare of women also take the needs of their
young children into account.  Similarly, programmes directed toward the
development of young children need to routinely address their family's
circumstances.<p>
<LI> Programmes of adequate child care can be built using local experience and
capacity, responding to local needs with community -based approaches. This
generally requires a subsidy from outside the community.  In such programs the
goals of quality and local ownership of the program must be consistently
reinforced.<p>
<LI> Child care is both a social investment and an area of income-generation.  It
is important that those who work in child care jobs be provided with proper pay
and benefits, and be recognized for their contributions to their community.<p>
<LI> Child care is a whole-community responsibility.  Although women are
traditional care-takers, men and elders need to be invested in young children
too.  Ways should be explored to integrate men and elders into the provision of
care for young children, and to promote greater participation of women and men
at all levels of decision-making that affect young children.<p>
<LI> Domestic labour, including child care, supports the fabric of a society.  If
women are to be integrated more fully into economic equations, then their work
to care for the next generation of citizens needs to enter into national
accounting systems.<p>

<title>Childrearing Practices</title>
<h3>Childrearing Practices</h3>

<i>Children are more than the object of their parents' attention and love; they
are also a biological and social necessity.  The human species perpetuates
itself through children; cultural, religious and national groups transmit their
values and traditions through children; families maintain their lineage through
children; and individuals pass on their genetic and social heritage through
children.  The ultimate value of children is the continuity of humanity.</i><BR>

                              <center>                                     Arnold, et al.,
1975, pg. 1</center><br>
<p>
     For years anthropologists, sociologists and psychologists have been providing
descriptions of how children are raised within cultures around the world,
including the beliefs and practices surrounding pregnancy, child birth and
treatment of young children.  We have information on what children are being
fed and how often.  We know how children are socialized to pass on the culture.
We know where parents turn when a child is sick and what they do to restore
their children's health.  Yet we don't use that information when creating
programs for young children and their families. <br>
<p>
     Despite the extremely rich data that exist on traditional childrearing
practices, patterns and beliefs, it is only relatively recently that those
involved in creating interventions have thought to use these data as the basis
for program development.  Early Childhood programs have been based primarily or
exclusively on what is thought to be <i>scientifically </i>appropriate for
young children, without taking into account the traditional childrearing
contexts within which the programs are being developed.  This often creates a
gap between what the program providers think should happen for young children
and what parents are used to doing. One of the challenges faced by those
developing policies and programs to support young children and their families
is how to maximize what can be provided for the child by interweaving practices
that "scientific" evidence would suggest a child needs with effective
traditional childrearing practices and beliefs.<br>
<p>
     During the past several years the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care
and Development, with support from UNICE, has organized a series of workshops
on childrearing practices and beliefs.  The first set occurred during 1991 and
1992 and was focussed on Latin America.  More recently, in 1993, the
Consultative Group conducted a comparable workshop in Sub-Saharan Africa.
Within the workshops there was an expressed need to have a better understanding
of how to assess childrearing.  There was also a desire to share information
and develop strategies on how to use this information to develop appropriate
programs for young children and families.   In this article (see citation
below, with link to all the articles mentioned here) we will discuss what was
learned about ways in which scientific information can be brought together with
an understanding of traditional and evolving practices to develop programs that
serve young children and families.  In the two articles that follow there is a
presentation of the specific childrearing practices and beliefs uncovered in
the Sub-Saharan African and Latin America Workshops, drawn from the reports on
the workshops. (Myers, 1992; Evans, 1994)<br>
<HR>
<b>Why is Knowledge of Childrearing Practices, Patterns and Beliefs
Important?</b><br>
<p>
     Today we have considerable knowledge about what makes programs for young
children and their families successful.  We have understood the importance of
community involvement in all steps of the process,  building on what already
exists within a community, and creating partnerships to help sustain efforts.
However, even with this knowledge we sometimes miss the mark when creating
programs. We develop program activities that never seem to catch on, our
messages are misinterpreted, we find that people have no way of connecting what
we are offering to their daily lives, we find 'technologies' misapplied.  Why
is this so?  One of the most basic reasons is that frequently programs are
designed without a clear understanding of the culture within which they are
being offered. Even programs based on a community-defined need may not be
designed in response to the community context.  Unfortunately, ideas about
practices to be promoted in a program frequently come from individuals who are
not part of the culture or group that the program is intended to serve. A
clearer understanding of childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs would
help us do our job better.  More specifically,  knowledge of childrearing
practices patterns and beliefs is important: <br>
<p>
<b>to understand, support and improve the childrearing process</b><br>
<p>
The fields of health and developmental psychology suggest that there are
actions taken by caregivers that are supportive of children's growth and
development.  There are also some actions that are detrimental.  By detecting
and understanding the effects of childrearing practices on children's
development it is possible to identify those practices which should be
supported and those which ought to be discouraged. <br>
<p>
<b>to respond to diversity</b><br>
<p>
Children grow up in a wide variety of different physical, social and cultural
circumstances. Even within cultures there is diversity.  There is no "right
way" to bring up children.   Nonetheless many programs intended to help young
children are conceived of as if all children and circumstances are the same.
Too often there is a search for the one model that will serve everyone.
Understanding practices and patterns and incorporating that knowledge into
programs is crucial if programs of early childhood development are to serve the
variety of children and families and circumstances that any program is bound to
encompass. <br>
<p>
<b>to respect cultural values</b><br>
<P>
Practices, patterns and beliefs define the ways in which children are
socialized. The rhetoric of most programs includes a plea to respect cultural
differences.  Indeed, the Convention of the Rights on the Child indicates that
children have a right to their cultural identity.  If this is to occur, a much
greater effort must be made to define, describe and understand the reasons for
cultural differences in the up-bringing of children.  <br>
<P>
<b>to provide continuity during times of rapid change</b><br>
<P>
<b></b>Environments and practices are changing as a result of economic, social
and political changes.  Sometimes these changes are very rapid and they can
have a significant impact on children's  development.  In the process, some
practices are being lost that continue to have both cultural and scientific
value.  Other practices, which appear to be "deviant" represent novel
adaptations to particular settings, and may be followed for good reasons and
with good results.  An attempt should be made to understand rather than
suppress them.  Conversely, old practices are being applied in new settings or
new practices are being adopted that may not be appropriate to the changing
settings in which a child is growing up.  Unless these changes in circumstances
and in forms of childrearing are identified and understood, policy and programs
may take a misguided view.<br>
<br>
<i>Childrearing practices, patterns and beliefs are based on a culturally-bound
understanding of what children need and what they are expected to become.

<HEAD></HEAD><BODY>
<H3>ECCD and Community Development Efforts</H3>

	Many community development efforts begin with a focused goal, such as
providing immunization or improving water quality.  However, when those who
wish to help a community listen to the community&#146;s understanding of what
they need, a more complex picture emerges.  <BR>
<p>
	<b>A community&#146;s needs are inter-related</b>.  <BR>
<p>
	Health, education, sanitation, nutrition, agriculture, economy and other
aspects of the community life can all be strengthened through engaging the
active participation of community members, supporting existing strengths, and
working from the motivation and interests of the people who are the intended
recipients of the community development effort.  Many efforts to strengthen a
community ultimately can improve the quality of life for the children living
there.  In addition, efforts to improve the care and attention to young
children can help to activate community participation and to focus community
members in defining their development needs.<p>
 <p>
	<b>An early childhood care and development programme (or component within a
larger effort) can</b>:
<UL>
 <LI>help women to participate in local development efforts, <BR>
 <LI>provide training opportunities for women (and men), <BR>
 <LI>serve as a rallying point for other development efforts, such as women&#146;s
saving schemes, community building efforts, health education projects, <BR>
 <LI>facilitate participation of girls in primary school.  <BR>
</UL>
<b>	ECCD offers a forum in which parents, teachers and children can:</b><UL>

<LI>build self-esteem,<BR>
<LI>develop practical skills in organizing, collaborating, teaching, planning,
etc.  <BR>
<LI>re-establish cultural practices that have been disrupted by difficult
circumstances, <BR>
<LI>and identify what they value and wish to pass on to the next generation.<BR>
</UL>
	As we have mentioned elsewhere in this Web Site, numerous studies have shown
that mono-dimensional programs (e.g. those that provide only a nutrition
supplement or focus only on immunization, or even provide only pre-natal care
for the mother without adequate follow-up once the child is born), are much
less likely to be successful than multi-dimensional programs. Mono-dimensional
programs, which may meet short term goals, are not likely to be sustainable
over time.  It is rarely helpful to impose a single solution that ignores the
need for individuals and communities to control their own destinies. <p>
<p>
	Multi-dimensional programs, on the other hand, are built on an awareness of
the importance of meeting the multiple needs of children and their families.
They are generally created from a culturally-sensitive understanding of
people's beliefs, perceptions, needs and concerns, and the services they
provide meet the intersecting needs of children and families.  An example would
be a program that provides children with a nutritional supplement in a child
care setting, which also provides children with stimulation and emotional
support.  Another component of such a program would be to work with parents to
improve family nutrition.  Thus the need to address the whole young child,
within the child&#146;s family and community context, becomes a model for a
range of community development efforts. <p>
<p>
	<b>Attention to children can serve as an entry point to larger community
development efforts</b>.<p>
<p>
	In many parts of the world, children are highly valued.  Because of this,
programs that focus on ECCD can be used to rally community members, to engage
them in creating solutions to the problems they are facing, and to open up
dialogue that can lead them to address a whole range of community development
efforts.  <p>
	For example:	<i>Child care programs can serve as an entry point to communities
not currently receiving health services. </i> <p>
<p>
	In some areas of the world Western medical practices and services are not
easily accepted.  Services may be underutilized because people lack an
understanding of the benefits.  Because they are socially attractive and
acceptable, child care programs can serve as an entry point into the community.
The <i>Sang Kancil</i> project in Malaysia is a good example of this
approach.<p>
<p>
<b>Malaysian <i>Sang Kancil</i>, Community-based Services Project.</b>  The
<i>Sang Kancil</i> Project was developed within the squatter settlements of
Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  It was begun in 1978 by the health sector in an
attempt to meet the health needs of those living in urban squatter settlements.
The rationale for working in squatter communities was based on the fact that
they are a growing phenomenon in the developing world, constituting nearly 50%
of the total urban population.  It is widely recognized that the environment
within squatter settlements is threatening to people's health--physically,
mentally and in terms of psycho-social development. <p>
<p>
	In Malaysia there was difficulty in providing services for squatters because
they occupy the land illegally and thus are not entitled to city services
(water, sewage, medical care, education, etc.).  Nevertheless many squatter
settlements are stable communities, including people from a variety of income
levels.  The stability comes from affordable housing within the settlement that
may not be available outside, well-developed support systems, and/or leadership
positions within the settlement.  <p>
	<p>
	Developers of the <i>Sang Kancil</i> project, University faculty in
collaboration with Ministry of Health personnel, used a strategy that
recognized, valued, and built upon the complex social systems that exist in the
settlements. While the health sector personnel who began the project were
interested in establishing primary health care centers within <i>kampungs</i>
(districts) in the settlements, they began their efforts by conducting meetings
with community members to determine their needs and priorities.  The community
wanted a child care programme and income-generating activities for women.
Health care was not seen as a priority.  Program planners listened to the
community.  Rather than building a health center, they established a pre-school
and an income-generating project.  When these were well established, then it
was possible to introduce primary health care, which is now widely accepted.

<HEAD></HEAD><BODY><TITLE>ECCD Role in Basic Education</TITLE>
<H3>ECCD Role in Basic Education   </H3>

Basic Education is commonly perceived as primary education.  This is a
tragic misperception.  As we have said elsewhere, development begins with
conception and learning begins at birth.  In the first 6 years, before a child
normally reaches primary school, essential foundations are established in the
child&#146;s physical, mental, emotional, social and spiritual development.
Thus basic education begins with the child&#146;s birth, and with the parents
of that child even before the child is born.  It continues not only through a
child&#146;s preschool and primary school years, but throughout that
child&#146;s life as he or she continues to need basic skills, understanding
and information to operate in a constantly changing world.    <br>
  <br>
     To strengthen basic education worldwide, an<u> international initiative</u>
was launched in 1990 at the World Conference on Education For All, convened in
Jomtien, Thailand by UNICEF, UNESCO, UNDP, and the World Bank.  The conference
brought together some 1500 people representing 155 givernments, 33
intergovernmental bodies, and 125 non-governmental organizations (NGOs),
institutes, and foundations.  Organized in response to the widespread concern
over the deterioration of education systems during the 1980s, the Conference
concluded with the unanimous adoption of the <u>&#147;World Decloration on
Education for All&#148; and endorsed a &#147;Framework for Action to Meet Basic
Learning Needs.&#148;</u><b> [efatext] </b>Through these two texts, the world
community renewed its commitment to ensuring the rights of all people to
education and knowledge.   <br>
  <br>
     In specific reference to Early Childhood Care and Development, the EFA World
Declaration affirmed in article 5, Broadening the Means and Scope of Basic
Education, that:  <br>
  <ul>
     &#147;The diversity, complexity, and changing nature of basic learning needs
of children, youth and adults necessitates broadening and constantly redefining
the scope of basic education to include the following components:  <br>
  <br>
     <i>Learning begins at birth.</i>  This calls for early childhood care and
initial education.  These can be provided through arrangements involving
families, communities, or institutional programmes, as appropriate.&#148;  <br>
  
  <br>
<b>Two things were unique about the EFA initiative</b>:  <br>
   <br>
     1) <i>The breadth of its definitions of what is needed to make education
available to all</i>.    <br>
  <br>
     In addition to calling for universal access to schooling for all children, the
declaration reaffirms that "every person - child, youth and adult - [should] be
able to benefit from educational opportunities designed to meet their basic
learning needs."  These include "both essential learning tools, such as
literacy, oral expression, numeracy and problem solving, and the basic learning
content (knowledge, skills, values and attitudes) required by human beings to
be able to survive, to develop their full capacities, to live and work in
dignity, to participate fully in development, to improve the quality of their
lives, to make informed decisions, and to continue learning."  <br>
  
     The declaration reflects its grounding in the realities of people's diverse
needs by affirming that: "the scope of basic learning needs and how they should
be met varies with individual countries and cultures, and inevitably changes
with the passage of time."   <br>
  <br>
     The Declaration affirms the importance of early learning, by stating that
"learning begins at birth.  This calls for early childhood care and initial
education.  These can be provided through arrangements involving families,
communities, or institutional programs, as appropriate."  <br>
   <br>
     2) <i>Its focus on action</i>.       <br>
  <br>
     Countries were encouraged to formulate specific plans and policies based on
the Framework for Action.  To maintain the momentum generated at the WCEFA, an
International Consultative Forum on EFA was established to promote and monitor
the EFA goals and to facilitate information-sharing among countries, agencies
and NGOs.  The Forum Secretariat, based at UNESCO headquarters, is charged with
global monitoring and promotion activities, and with organizing further
meetings, publishing a bulletin, and maintaining a database on EFA indicators
and activities. (See International Initiatives for information on these).   <br>
  </ul>
     As part of the action initiative, the Consultative Group Secretariat and most
of the CG sponsoring members have played an active role in promoting
EFA-inspired policies and projects supporting young children, and their
families and communities.   <br>
  <p>
 In a follow-up meeting in New Delhi, India, 1993, a group of
institutions and individuals concerned with early childhood learning and
development met in order to identify key themes and collaborative actions to
pursue following the Forum.  Because of their efforts ECCD was placed firmly on
the EFA agenda.  In addition, lines of action were identified (and refined at
further meetings in the following year, and working groups were set up to
promote actions in each of these realms. <br><p> These lines of action are presented
and discussed in the article: <A HREF=eccdbob.html>Creating the Foundation Stones for

<H1>The Consultative Group on ECCD</H1>

<H3>The Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development</H3>

	The Consultative Group is an international, inter-agency group dedicated to
improving the condition of young children at risk.  Working on several levels
to <i>keep young children on the agenda</i> of policy-makers, funders and
programme developers, the Consultative Group consists of a broad membership of
international organizations, a Secretariat and a group of Field Representatives
active in ECCD networks in diverse regions of the world.<p>
<p>
	Growing awareness of the importance of and demand for early childhood
programming has created a need for knowledge and processes that can inform
planning and program choices in what is a rapidly advancing field.  It has
created a need for basic scientific information about child development, about
the conditions affecting that development, and about strategies and programmes
that can be employed in different circumstances to assist children at risk of
delayed, debilitated or distorted development.<p>
<p>
	Increasing involvement in the field has made it even more important for whose
who plan, implement and fund such programmes to communicate with one another,
to share lessons learned, and to avoid costly duplication.<p>
<p>
	To help meet those needs, and, more generally, to enhance the well-being of
young children, The Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development
was established in 1984.   Since then the Consultative Group has functioned as
an inter-agency mechanism for gathering, synthesizing, and disseminating
knowledge about early childhood development and about programmes affecting the
development of young children. <p>
<p>
<b>The Participants of the Consultative Group</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Nineteen organizations <b>[1]</b> have participated in
the Consultative Group (CG). Under the auspices of the Group, an active
Knowledge Network has been established that presently incorporates
approximately 1,800 individuals or institutions in 120 countries, crossing
disciplinary and sectoral lines. <p>

<p>
	In addition to publishing the <b>Coordinators' Notebook</b>  twice a year, and
the <b>Funders Folio </b>(recently renamed the <b>Network Notes</b>)<b>
</b>quarterly, the Group, through its Secretariat, has been responsible for
producing concept papers, reviews, case studies, digests, evaluations,
summaries of meetings, manuals, booklets and periodic mailings of current
materials to Network participants.  The Group has also been responsible for a
major book dealing with various aspects of programming for early childhood care
and development (<b>The Twelve Who Survive, </b>by Robert G. Myers).  The
Secretariat of the Group has organized at least two international meetings each
year.  It has been called on increasingly to identify people who can provide
particular kinds of programme advice and for direct programming assistance.<p>
<p>
<b>CONSULTATIVE GROUP GOALS AND FUNCTIONS</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Since its inception, the Consultative Group has taken as goals:<p>
<p>
 <LI>To increase the knowledge base: The Secretariat gathers, synthesizes and
disseminates information on early childhood care and development, drawing from
field experiences, traditional wisdom and scientific research;<p>
<p>
<LI> To serve as a catalyst: The Secretariat increases awareness of issues
affecting children, developing materials and strategies which help move
communities, organizations and governments from rhetoric to practice, from
policy to programming;<p>
<p>
 <LI>To build bridges: The Secretariat fosters networking among those with common
concerns and interests, working across sectoral divisions, putting people in
touch with the work of others by organizing meetings, by disseminating
information through publications, and by serving as a communications point; <p>
<p>
<LI> To serve as a sounding board: The Secretariat engages in dialogue with funders
and decision-makers about developments in the field, providing the base for
policy formulation, planning, programming and implementation.<p>
<p>
<p>
	There are two functions that frame the work of the Consultative Group and its
Secretariat:<b>  improving and extending the knowledge base</b> by gathering
and disseminating information; and<b> moving knowledge to action</b> for the
purposes of expanding options for children and families.  This is accomplished
through building partnerships and alliances, networking, convening meetings and
doing advocacy work.<p>
	The first function, knowledge-gathering and dissemination encompasses such
activities as:<BR>
<UL>
<LI> mapping and monitoring developments in the field, <BR>
<LI>publishing a periodic bulletin, <BR>
<LI>writing reviews and concept papers, <BR>
<LI>preparing case studies, <BR>
<LI>preparing articles and general publications, <BR>
<LI>distributing documents, <BR>
<LI>maintaining the ECCD Web site<BR>
<LI>identifying generic issues and writing guidelines, and<BR>
<LI>working with organizations and government to develop policy. <BR>
</UL>
	<p>
	Recognizing the importance of direct and personal communication if knowledge
is to move to action, the Secretariat of the Consultative Group has included as
an essential part of its operation a networking and convening function.
Networking and convening has taken several forms:<BR>
<UL>
 <LI>Networking is carried out as participants in the Group or as staff of the
Secretariat communicate via letter, telephone, fax and e-mail and travel.<p>

 <LI>Annual meetings of the CG are organized so that participants can exchange
programming information.  In most meetings a substantive topic is also
discussed. This meeting also serves as a way of involving participating
organizations directly in the information gathering and disseminating
process.<p>

<LI> The publication of the <b>Coordinators' Notebook</b> is linked to a networking
process in which the approximately 1800 recipients of the notebook are asked
to: 1) contribute to it, 2) copy and distribute it to others in their personal
knowledge networks, and 3) communicate directly with others whose addresses
appear in the notebook in conjunction with reporting of programmes or
publications or meetings.  In addition, <p>

 <LI>The <b>Funders' Folio/Network Notes</b>, a quarterly publication, provides
participants in the Consultative Group with up-to-date developments within the
early childhood field and updates on conferences, workshops and developments
within agencies and organizations.<p>

 <LI>The electronic network is becoming an increasingly important communication
tool.  Through connecting participants through the electronic network the CG
facilitates better and more frequent communications among donors and other
individuals working to promote Early Childhood Care and Development
internationally.<p>

<LI> Incipient regional networks are being bolstered, particularly in Africa and
Latin America,  with a network emerging in Asia. <p>

 <LI>Individuals or organizations have been convened under the auspices of the
Consultative Group to discuss a topic of general interest, such as <i>A Child
Readiness Profile</i>, <i>Principles and Guidelines to Strengthen Programmes of
Early Childhood Development and Learning</i>,  <i>Meeting Basic Learning Needs
through Programmes of Early Childhood Care and Development</i>, the
<i>Situation of Children in Eastern Europe</i>, and the <i>Intersecting Needs
of Women and Children.</i><p>
</UL>
<p>
	 Staff of the Secretariat and the participants in the Group use accumulated
knowledge directly by, for instance, participating in fora where investments in
early childhood care and development are (or should be) advocated.  The need to
<i>keep children on the agenda</i> through continuing advocacy efforts is
judged by participants of the Consultative Group to be of high importance and
basic to the functioning of the Group and its Secretariat.<p>

<H1> Present Projects of the Consultative Group</H1><p>

<b>Present Projects</b><p>
<p>
<b>1.  Basic activities</b> <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Producing the <i>Coordinators' Notebook</i></b><p>
<p>
Two issues of the <b><i>Coordinators' Notebook</i></b> are produced each year.
The <b><i>Notebook</i></b> helps to map and monitor the field.  At present,
each issue contains: a focus article dealing with a major issue, accompanied by
references and descriptions of relevant experiences;  profiles of programs
being implemented with support from CG participants, news from CG network
participants; and information about recent publications, meetings and
workshops.<p>
<p>
<b>Producing the <i>Funders' Folio/Network Notes</i></b><p>
<p>
	The <b><i>Funders' Folio</i></b> was created in 1993 as a way to have more
immediate contact between the Secretariat and participants in the CG.  This
brief bulletin, renamed the Network Notes and produced quarterly, provides
participants with up-to-date news on what is happening within donor agencies,
international fora, and governments in relation to programming for young
children and their families.  It includes information on upcoming meetings,
describes new initiatives and provides participants with an update on
activities of members of the Secretariat.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Moderating the ECCD Web site and facilitating the Electronic Network</b><p>
<p>
	At the 1994 meeting of the Consultative Group, the participants agreed to the
establishment of an electronic communications network focussing on
International Early Childhood Care and Development. This effort is being
organized by the CG Secretariat.  It is linked to the <a href="http://childhouse.uio.no/index.html">Children&#146;s
House</a>, a cyberspace project to link all international development efforts
on behalf of children. [http://childhouse@uio.no]<p>
<p>
<b>Convening the Consultative Group</b><p>
<p>
	One meeting of the Consultative Group is organized each year.  The meeting is
devoted to discussion of a particular topic to be agreed upon in advance and
for which background documentation is prepared.  <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>2.  Project Coordination and Technical Assistance</b><p>
<p>
<b>A Child Status Profile.</b> <p>
<p>
	Initial funding for this project was obtained from IDRC, UNICEF and USAID to
move ahead with the action research project focussing on establishing a profile
of the developmental status of children in three countries.  The project is set
within a framework of <i>Preparing Children for School and Preparing Schools
for Children</i>.  It includes, therefore, a proposal to develop and try out a
set of indicators to monitor the learning environment of children as well as
their developmental status.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Status of Children in Eastern Europe.</b> <p>
<p>
	Funding was received from USAID and the World Bank to undertake an analysis of
the situation of care for young children in four Eastern European countries:
Hungary, Bulgaria, Romania, and Poland.  This study was completed in October,
1995<p>
<p>
<b>ECCD Policy Study.</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b> 	During the past five years a number of countries have developed
specific ECCD policies, and there are others that are beginning the process.
This study addresses the issue of policy and its relation to program planning
and implementation, with the goal of developing some guidelines for those who
anticipate being involved in a policy development process. The CG Secretariat
is coordinating this effort, with support from USAID and UNICEF. The first step
in the process is to pull together existing policies that are related to ECCD
concerns. . We would also appreciate hearing about any sources that you know of
that we should pursue.<p>
<p>
<b>Study on the Young Girl Child</b><p>
<p>
	In recent years there has been considerable international interest in the
plight of the girl child--particularly in terms of girls' participation in the
formal education system.  However, what has received less attention is the
plight of the girl child prior to her entry into the formal system.  What does
the girl child bring with her as a foundation for learning and development?
What is  her overall health, her current nutritional status and her nutritional
history?  What type of psycho-social stimulation has she received and what type
of socialization has she undergone? <p>
In order to better understand girls' ability to participate fully in the formal
educational system, it is critical to have an understanding of what the girl
child brings with her, and it is important to know how and to what extent she
has been raised differently from her male siblings.  These issues are being
explored in a project which will look at the situation of young children in 6-7
countries, with a focus on understanding the ways in which current beliefs,
values and practices affect gender development, and to identify plausible
points of intervention.<p>
<p>
	Participants in the study include USAID (Emily Vargas-Baron and Frank Method)
the Aga Khan Foundation (Kathy Bartlett), EDC (Andrea Bosch) and the IDB (Sarah
Howden).  We also hope to involve Save The Children.  A meeting was held on
October 3rd to discuss the project and finalize a strategy. It was decided that
the countries to be included in the study will be Indonesia, Bolivia/Peru,
Morocco, India, South Africa, Mali and Jamaica.<p>
<p>
	We are seeking linkages with ECCD and/or girls education and /or research
projects in these countries with whom we can work.  If you know of some, please
get in touch with Judith Evans at the CG Secretariat. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>3.  Developmental Activities</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Developing the Group and New Ideas</b><p>
<p>
	This category of activities includes both the development of the Consultative
Group and the development of ideas for activities to be carried out under the
auspices of the Group.<p>
<p>
<center><b>THEMES TO BE ADDRESSED: 1995-1998</b></center><p>
<p>
<b>	EFA: A Continuing Concern.</b>  General responsibility for keeping
organizations informed of progress, for seeking extended cooperation, for
monitoring and for synthesizing results from the various activities within the
<b>Plan of Action </b>was assigned to the Secretariat of the Consultative
Group. Thus this will remain a key activity in the coming years. [link to Plan
of Action, Web 11, global initiatives, EFA]<p>
	<b></b><p>
<b>	Financing/funding of ECCD programs</b>.  This theme was addressed in the
<b>Twelve Who Survive, </b>but there has been increasing interest in the topic
since the publication of the book.  A study on financing was funded by the
World Bank in 1994, but considerably more work needs to be focussed on this key
issue.<p>
<p>
	<b>Linkage between Women and Children.</b>  The UN Women's Conference to be
held in Beijing in September 1995 has brought this issue to the fore once
again. In preparation for the Conference the Secretariat  produced a document
on <b>the Intersecting Needs of Women and Children</b>.  Our field
representative from the Philippines was able to attend, and her experiences
will be filed with the document just mentioned.  (Click on the Intersecting
Needs of Women and Children). <i> </i>[link to Web4, related topics, the
intersecting needs of Women and Children]<p>
<p>
	<b>Girls and Women's Education.</b>  This theme is a priority within many of
the organizations participating in the CG.  ECCD links into both the education
of girls and of women.  The rationale for addressing the theme through ECCD
will be further expanded and articulated, and programs illustrating the
linkages will be identified and highlighted.<p>
	<p>
	<b>Children Living in Difficult Circumstances</b>.  In 1991 an issue of the
<b>Coordinators' Notebook</b> was devoted to <i>Protecting Children from the
Scourge of War</i>.  Since that time the situation for a vast number of
children has worsened.  The number of children living in refugee camps, being
traumatized by war and being resettled after having been displaced as a result
of war, have increased dramatically.  It is time once again to address this
issue, particularly in terms of providing information on the type of
programming that has been successful, both in terms of meeting children's needs
and in terms of providing a focal point for re-organization of a community of
people.  (This topic will be the focus of Issue # 19 of the CN.)<p>
	<b>Early Childhood as an Entry Point for Democratization.</b>  The Eastern
European study made it evident that both women and children have been
negatively affected by the shift from communism to a market economy.  And, in
general, this shift has negatively affected the society as a whole.   Educating
people for democracy begins with the education of young children in terms of
decision-making, problem-solving, and living with differences.  Through the
training programs created in support of ECCD programs it is also possible to
work on these same dimensions with adults.  Ways of developing appropriate
programming will be explored and disseminated.<p>
<p>
	<b>The Development of National Early Childhood Policy.</b> In the future, the
policy line will have two aspects to it: analysis of policy and direct
involvement in policy formulation. Experiences of the Secretariat over the past
two years in working with governments to institute national policies in support
of young children has demonstrated the importance of this line of action.  This
activity will be developed further.  To begin with, Issue #17 of the CN will
focus on <i>ECCD Policy.</i>  In the Issue we will outline a process for
developing a national ECCD policy.  As we gain more experience along this line
we will develop a manual that can be used by governments and /or donors working
with governments to strengthen national ECCD policy.<p>
<p>
	<b>Capacity Building at the Regional level.</b>  Attention will be given to
supporting regional networks in order to improve the communication and use of
knowledge.  In part that will occur through support for regional <i>Focus
Groups.</i> Funds are budgeted for a staff person from the Secretariat to
travel to Asia, Africa, and Latin America at least once each year to
participate in regional <i>Focus Group</i> meetings.  Furthermore, a modest
amount of money is included in the budget to be made available to an
institution in each region to support a Secretary whose part-time task would be
to work on strengthening an early childhood development network in the
region.<p>

<CENTER><b>A BRIEF HISTORY OF</b><BR>
<b></b><p>
<b>THE CONSULTATIVE GROUP ON</b><p>
<b>EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT</b></CENTER><p>

<p>
	This document traces the establishment of the Consultative Group on Early
Childhood Care and Development.  The Consultative Group (CG) emerged from
conversations, which began in 1982, among staff members in international
organizations concerned with survival, care, and development of children 0-to-6
years of age in the Third World.  The number of participating institutions has
grown as ideas about the purposes and operation of a collaborative mechanism
have evolved.  A group mechanism is now functioning that carries out
information-gathering, synthesizing, and dissemination activities as well as
some technical assistance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>1.  Antecedents: May 1982-October 1984</b><p>
<p>
<b>1.1</b>  The process of forming an inter-agency group concerned with child
care and development began in May 1982 with informal discussions among staff
from the Ford Foundation, the Bernard van Leer Foundation, and UNICEF.  These
early conversations highlighted a need for greater understanding and
cooperation among principal international agencies - particularly with respect
to low cost, community-based programme options.  It was agreed that a meeting
should be called to "compare notes and experiences on how projects in this area
were developing and to consider whether and how it might be possible to
coordinate and enrich the responses of agencies."<p>
<p>
<b>1.2</b>  Then, in May 1983, a meeting was held at the Ford Foundation,
co-hosted by the Bernard van Leer Foundation and Ford, and also involving
UNESCO, UNICEF, USAID, and IDRC.  The mix of United Nations, bi-lateral, and
philanthropic institutions was intentional.  An informal and frank exchange
took place.  A summary report of the meeting was prepared by the van Leer
Foundation.<p>
<p>
The need for a regular exchange of information about new and on-going projects
was reaffirmed.  No specific plan for a mechanism to accomplish such an
exchange was discussed in detail at the meeting, but there was general
agreement, reflected in the summary record, about the need to collaborate in
order to improve:<p>
<p>
		1) the data and knowledge base on early childhood interventions,<p>
		2) communication and dissemination of programme outcomes, and<p>
		3) evaluation results and methods.<p>
<p>
It was also agreed that collaboration in specific projects or programmes might
be useful although precise mechanisms needed to be worked out carefully.<p>
<p>
Follow-up activities suggested at the May meeting were:  1) collaboration in a
Latin American meeting being organized by UNICEF to discuss costs and
effectiveness of early interventions; 2) collaboration at the field level in
Peru; and 3) organization of a subsequent meeting of the group focusing on a
particular theme, including other institutions, and bringing in participants
from the health field.  UNICEF agreed to organize and host the next meeting.<p>
<p>
<b>1.3</b>  The follow-up between June 1983 and October 1984 included:<p>
<p>
    a.  A meeting on costs and effectiveness of early interventions was held in
Santiago, Chile.  The Ford Foundation and IDRC each collaborated with the host
institution, UNICEF, by providing funding for a participant.<p>
<p>
    b.  Evaluations of field projects in Peru were carried out by USAID,
UNICEF, and van Leer, but the field-level collaboration hoped for at the May
1983 meeting was difficult to achieve.<p>
<p>
    c.  UNICEF made preparations for the second inter-agency meeting to be held
October 29-31, 1984.  The topic, "Going to Scale", was selected as the
substantive topic.<p>
<p>
    d.  Work began on operationalizing collaboration and exchange through an
inter-agency group or mechanism focussed on early childhood development.
Several of the participants in the May meeting encouraged Robert Myers to
elaborate the idea, based on a document titled "Seeking Sounder Strategies"
that he had written and shared informally prior to the May meeting (but which
was not then tabled for discussion).  To develop the idea further, subsidies
were provided by UNICEF, which made an office available, by a contribution from
USAID, and by support from the High/Scope Foundation (which guaranteed Myers
salary).  The resulting proposal, for an "Inter-agency Service," was shared
with the organizations that had participated in the May meeting and was
presented formally to the Ford Foundation.  In the proposal, a tentative work
plan was set out together with an estimated budget for operation over a
three-year period.  Ford approved partial funding, joining with UNICEF and
USAID in providing support for the collaborative process.<p>
<p>
    e.  UNICEF indicated its willingness to continue to provide office space
and to defray part of the core costs of an inter-agency mechanism that would
foster information exchange and collaboration.<p>
<p>
<b>1.4</b>  Ten international organizations participated in the October 29-31,
1984 meeting on "Going to Scale," organized by UNICEF and held at its offices
in New York.  (The Carnegie Corporation, the World Bank, the Aga Khan
Foundation and WHO were new participants.)  The agenda included discussion of a
proposal to establish an informal Knowledge Network that would facilitate CG
communication and strengthen the information base related to early childhood
programming.  From the group came the idea of an informal Consultative Group
(adjusting the proposal from a more formal "Inter-Agency Service" mechanism).
Several features of the proposed Consultative Group were spelled out:  it
should be informal, not exclusive, focussed on information exchange, and be
guided by an Advisory Committee.  UNICEF offered to follow-up the discussion by
formulating a proposal in light of comments and suggestions received in the
meeting, by circulating the new proposal for comments, and by exploring with
others how to proceed.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>2.	Formation and Expansion of the Consultative Group: </b><p>
<b>	November 1984-December 1985</b><p>
<p>
<b>2.1</b>  Following the October 1984 meeting, a summary record was circulated
in draft form.  Additions and corrections were solicited and a final document
was prepared incorporating comments received.  This exchange provided a chance
for further clarification of ideas about the inter-agency mechanism, as
discussed in the meeting.  Next, a revised proposal for a Consultative Group
was put together by UNICEF and circulated.  Institutions were asked to comment
on the proposal and to indicate whether (and if so, how) they would participate
in the Consultative Group.  Responses were received from most participants for
whom the working arrangements set out seemed to be acceptable.  With responses
came additional financial support so that by May 1985, funds were in hand to
cover approximately two-thirds of the operating costs of a secretariat
(Coordinating Unit) over a three-year period.  Contributing were:  UNICEF,
Ford, USAID, Carnegie, WHO and IDRC.  The High/Scope Foundation was asked to
continue serving the Consultative Group in the technical advisory capacity it
had been assuming in the earlier stages.<p>
<p>
On the basis of the replies received, a final description of the Consultative
Group was prepared.  That description was mailed to participants together with
a review titled "Effects of Early Childhood Interventions on Primary School
Progress and Performance in the Developing Countries," undertaken by the
Coordinating Unit with funds from USAID.  Names were requested for an Advisory
Committee and a suggestion was made that the next meeting focus on the
interaction of health programmes with early education/stimulation programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>2.2</b>  During the remainder of 1985, the Consultative Group continued to
grow.  The World Bank and the Aga Khan Foundation joined in supporting the
Consultative Group bringing the total number of participants to eight
organizations.  The Bank commissioned a review of policy options and costs.
The Aga Khan Foundation contributed support to the Coordinating Unit for
dissemination activities.<p>
<p>
In addition, a Knowledge Network began to take shape.  A first issue of the
<i>Coordinators' Notebook</i> was mailed out, originally to about 200
individuals and organizations.  The mailing included also review papers,
prepared for the Consultative Group.<p>
<p>
An informal consultation of the Group was carried out in November, 1985, at
which further suggestions were made regarding functioning of the Consultative
Group and the Knowledge Network.  These were incorporated into a "Description
of the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development."  Plans for
the Third Inter-Agency Meeting, which would focus on ways to combine
health/nutrition and psycho-social elements in programmes designed to benefit
the development of young children, were discussed.<p>
<p>
Several review papers were prepared during 1985 dealing with the utilization of
early childhood care and education programmes for delivery of maternal and
child health care components and primary health care; the intersecting needs of
working mothers and their young children; and improving programme actions to
meet intersecting needs. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>3.  Continued Growth and Consolidation: January 1986-October 1989</b><p>
<p>
<b>3.1</b>  During 1986, information-gathering, synthesis, and dissemination
proceeded apace, with writing of reviews, mailings of the <i>Coordinators'
Notebook</i> and attachments, participation in and summaries of several
meetings, and visits to field offices and projects by the Coordinating Unit.
The Knowledge Network reached about 400 institutions and individuals in 90
countries.  The Rockefeller Foundation requested a review paper of "Women's
Work and Child Care," thereby becoming a participant in the Consultative Group,
and the UNESCO/UNICEF liaison office agreed to fund a review in 1987.  With
these two new participants, the informal Consultative Group expanded to include
ten organizations.<p>
<p>
<b>3.2</b>  A meeting of the Consultative Group was held in January 1987 to:
1) discuss combining health, nutrition, and psycho-social components in
programming for early childhood care and development, and 2) to begin the
process of looking ahead.  An Advisory Committee set out recommendations for
future activities.  During the year the Knowledge Network continued to expand.
Reviews of 1) Child-to-child programmes and 2) instruments and methods for
measuring child development (focusing on Latin America) were undertaken.  The
Coordinating Unit was called upon by several of the participants to help think
about policy and programming for early childhood care and development.  An
independent review of Consultative Group activities was carried out.  Ground
work was laid for a modest expansion of activities.<p>
<p>
<b>3.3</b>  An informal meeting of participating organizations was held in
October 1987 to discuss the evaluation and subsequent participation.  In line
with the recommendations of both the Advisory Committee and the evaluation,
another person, Cassie Landers (Ed.D, MPH), was added to the staff of the
Coordinating Unit in December 1987.<p>
<p>
<b>3.4</b>  By June 1988, support had been renewed allowing the Coordinating
Unit to continue functioning at its increased level until 1990.  Plans were set
in motion for a meeting of the Consultative Group in July, to be hosted by the
International Development Research Center in Ottawa, Canada, and taking as its
main theme, "Child Care and Women's Work."  Eight of the ten involved
institutions remained active.  The Knowledge Network grew to 600 individuals
and institutions in 119 countries.<p>
<p>
<b>3.5</b>  Following the Ottawa meeting, the Consultative Group continued to
grow, incorporating as participants the Swedish Agency for International
Development, Save-the Children, the Pan-American Health Organization, the
International Child Development Centre, and the Bernard van Leer Foundation.
Funding was assured through the end of 1990.  Additional papers were produced
and work began on a book-length manuscript summarizing previous work and
setting out a "State of the Practice."  The Knowledge Network grew to 850
individuals in 123 countries.  A process of decentralization was set in motion,
beginning with a "Focus Group" meeting in East Africa.<p>
<p>
<b>3.6</b>  In October 1989, the fifth meeting of the CG was held in Paris,
hosted by UNESCO. The meeting focused on "Preparing Children for Schools and
Schools for Children", and represented the beginning of an active initiative to
incorporate early childhood care and development into the World Conference on
Education for All. That initiative included advocacy in regional meetings in
Boston and Quito and with the Conference Secretariat, as well the preparation
of a video for presentation at Jomtien. At the meeting in October 1989, the
Group recommended a gradual expansion of the staff of the Coordinating Unit and
of the Group's activities. The Advisory Committee recommended several new lines
of action.<p>
<p>
During 1989, the Coordinating Unit helped to organize a Global Training Seminar
dealing with early child development, at UNICEF Innocenti Centre in Florence,
Italy.<p>
<p>
Throughout this period, the Coordinating Unit was called upon to participate in
a variety of international meetings and to provide some help to participating
organizations in their programming.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>4.	From Knowledge Towards Action: October 1989 to 1992</b><p>
<p>
	<b>4.1</b>  From October 1989 to October 1991, the Group grew slightly in size
with the new participation of Save the Children, the Christian Children's Fund,
the Inter-American Foundation, and the Organization of American States. The
Knowledge Network continued its expansion, including about 1,500 individuals
and institutions, while <i>The Coordinators' Notebook</i> mailing increased to
approximately 3,500 copies. The quality of the publication was improved.<p>
<p>
	<b>4.2</b>  During the period, papers were written dealing with childrearing
practices, ECD measures and instruments, language learning in preschool,
women's work and child care, the generalization of education, the transition
from home to primary school, the family setting for early development, children
in institutions, and children in war. The measurement project expanded to
include reviews in 6 countries or regions outside Latin America.<p>
<p>
	<b>4.3</b>  The Consultative Group contributed to the September 1990 Summit
for Children by assisting UNDP in the compilation of a wall chart, writing a
section for the <i>UNICEF Sourcebook</i>, and writing a booklet for UNESCO
titled <i>Toward A Fair Start for Children</i>. A book titled <i>The Twelve Who
Survive</i> was published by Routledge in conjunction with UNESCO.<p>
<p>
	<b>4.4</b>  The process of decentralization proved to be more difficult than
expected and, although the idea continues, active Focus Groups have not been
formed yet.<p>
<p>
	<b>4.5</b>  Over the last two years changes in the world's climate, continuing
demographic trend (the reduction of infant mortality, women's entry into the
paid labour force, migration flows, etc.) international focus on the child
(WCEFA, the World Summit for Children, the Convention on the Rights of the
Child), and new demands from governments, non-governmental and international
organisations opened the field considerably, placing greater pressure on the
Consultative Group to provide direct technical assistance as well as the
strengthening the knowledge base, A process of moving from knowledge to action
had begun.<p>
<p>
	<b>4.6</b>  To meet these challenges, the Coordinating Unit shifted its work
somewhat to incorporate more direct technical assistance to participating
organisations.<p>

<b> ANNOUNCING: GLOBAL PARTICIPATION NET (GP-
NET)!
</b>
</center><p>
<p>
You are cordially invited to subscribe to USAID'S new electronic discussion
group, GP-
NET,
which will open September 11.  GP-
NET
uses Internet to enable interested USAID staff and other
development practitioners anywhere in the world to engage in a conversation
about participatory approaches.<p>
<p>
The conversation will have a facilitator (or "manager" of the list), Wendy
Kapustin, who will make subscribing and participating "user friendly."  More
important, Wendy will encourage the group to focus attention on specific
experiences and lessons learned about participatory approaches, as well as to
share useful information and resources for participation.  <p>
<p>
Short case studies that focus on the use by USAID of a particular
"participatory practice" and explore results and lessons learned about its use
will be disseminated for discussion.  GP-
NET
participants will be encouraged not only to comment on these cases and the
issues they raise, but to describe other instructive experiences.  With your
help, some of these, in turn, will be fleshed out as Participatory Practices
cases. <p>
<p>
Please note: GP-
NET
is not replacing the Participation Network, a list on our internal
e-
mail
directory of USAID staff who wish to receive summaries of the Participation
Forum sessions and related notices and materials.  GP-
NET,
on the other hand, makes use of "listproc"
software on the Internet, to enable the messages that you send automatically to
be received by all other GP-
NET
subscribers. Another important difference is that GP-
NET
includes development
practitioners from outside USAID: other donors, PVOs, universities and-
-
with
your help-
-
host
country NGOs and other institutions.  Like the Participation Network and the
Participation Forum, GP-
NET
is an effort of USAID's Participation Initiative.  <p>
<p>
If you would like to subscribe to GP-
NET,
or if you have questions about it, please contact Wendy Kapustin via e-
mail <A HREF="mailto:WKAPUSTIN@USAID.GOV"> WKAPUSTIN@USAID.GOV </A>.

the policies in the country where you are working, the more effective you will
be in meeting the needs of young children and their families.<p>
<p>
	The Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development invites you to
collaborate in a project that will provide information on the kinds of policies
that currently exist, what is being developed, and the policy-making process.
From this project we will write a manual that will be distributed to help
others work with their governments to develop appropriate policy. <p>
<p>
We are asking that you:<br>
	Review current government documents in the country where you work to identify
policies that provide support to young children and their families.  (One
source may be the National Plans of Action in relation to the Convention on the
Rights of the Child. Another is policies that may have been developed in
response to the Education for All (EFA) Initiative.)<br>
	Some of the questions that we would like you to answer include:<br>
<ul>	
	--What is the specific wording of the policy?<br>
		--What Ministries are involved in ECCD activities?<br>
</ul>
(Those we have come across so far include: education, health, social services,
women and youth, local government, community development, national development.
There may be others!)<br>
	Try to find out what the process has been in the creation of policy.<br>
<ul>
		-- Who was involved?<br>
		-- How did the process evolve?<br>
		-- Was there an attempt at cross-ministerial collaboration?<br>
</ul>	
<br>
By gathering this information you will have a better understanding of what
currently exists within government policy to support the work that you are
doing.  You will also be able to identify gaps in policy that you may be able
to address through your programming.<br>
<br>
We are hoping to gather information on national policies as soon as possible,
by early 1996 at the latest.  Please let us know if you can contribute.   Many
Thanks!<br>
<p>
Send any information that you gather to: Judith L. Evans, Consultative Group on
ECCD,<p>

<h1>Networks: Regional and Coalition-based</h1>  
<h3>The CG: a Network of Networks</h3>  
The Consultative Group is a network of networks concerned with young
children and their families.  Each participant of the CG represents one or
several networks of development groups, family service networks, programme
developers, NGOs, researchers, regional capacity-building coalitions, and
international initiative  efforts.  We try, to the best of our ability, to
gather information on the efforts of these diverse networks, and to disseminate
that information through our contact people.  Our aim is to help promote
collaboration, information and resource sharing, south-south dialogue, inter
and intra regional dialogue, and most important: better, more integrated
programming for young children and their families.  <br>
  <br>
	In this section of the Web Site, we need your help to collect the best, most
useful information about what is happening within the diverse regions of the
world and within the networks you represent.  Please send us 
<A HREF="mailto:info@ecdgroup.com">e-mail </A>or faxes
(U.S.: 413- 268-7279) letting us know about the child, family and community
focussed networks you participate in that might be relevant to the participants
of the Consultative Group (we want to hear about networks that are
communicating through traditional channels such as print media, phone and fax,
as well as those which are on-line).

<TITLE>The Regions</TITLE>
<h1>The Regions:</h1>
<b><i>Latin America. </i></b> <br>
Within the Latin American region a large number of networks pertaining to the
young child have been developed over the past few years.  These can be
classified roughly as follows:<br>
<li>General child development communication networks:<br>
<ul>		<i>Red para la Infancia y la Familia de America Latina y el Caribe</i></ul>
<li>Thematic Networks:<br><ul>
<li>The Child Rights Network</i> <br>
		<i>Liga de Leche</i></ul>
<li>Sectoral or disciplinary networks (linked to health, psychology or
education)<br><ul>
<i>The International Society for the Study of Behavioral Development
(ISSBD)</i><br>
<i>		The Centro Latinoamericano de Perinatologia (CLAP)</i><br>
<i>The Latin American Network of Educational Information and Documentation
(REDUC)</i><br>
	</ul>
	An analysis of these networks is provided in the publication, <i>Hacia el
Fortalecimiento de Acciones e Interacciones en Favor de la Ninez: Informe del
Primer Encuento sobre Redes de Ninez de America Latina y el Caribe.</i> (May
1994) which is available from:<br>
<ul>
	CINDE, <br>

	Santafe de Bogota, COLOMBIA.  <br>
		Tel: (571) 256-4116; Fax: (571) 218-7598<br></ul>

	Yearly symposia involving many of these actors have been organized by the
Organization of American States, with the collaboration of UNICEF, UNESCO, the
Pan American Health Organization and others.  The November 1994 symposium was
held in Lima, Peru and the 1995 Symposium titled, "Programa de Desarrollo
Integral para la Infancia en Contextos de Probreza" took place September 25 to
29 in San Jose, Costa Rica.  For information about these meetings and for

	The Early Childhood Development Network for Africa (ECDNA) is moving ahead.
As a result of a meeting in South Africa in February the proposal draft of
December 1994 was reviewed and changes made.  The new proposal was then shared
with donor agencies and the wider ECD community within Africa.  The proposal
was further refined at a meeting in Uganda, August 18-22, 1995.  The Uganda
meeting resulted in a revised proposal that focuses on the identification,
selection and description of 3-5 case studies of innovative ECCD programmes
(family-based, community-based and centre-based).  Results will be translated
into policy papers, videos, pamphlets, etc. for distribution to specific target
audiences.<br>
<p>
	The ECDNA proposal was shared at the Development for African Education (DAE)
Meeting held October 18-21 in Tours, France.  Included in the proposal is a
recommendation that the ECDNA be recognized as a Working Group within the DAE.

Over the past few years the Arab Resource Collective has
organized a number of workshops/seminars designed to provide a networking
function in the region. <i> Dialogue 95 </i>was another seminar that is part of
the process.  It was held July 10-15 in Cyprus. The meeting brought together
practitioners and policymakers from different sectors who have specific
responsibility for ECCD and complementary programmes.  In addition to the
promotion of networking, objectives of the seminar included: to collaborate in
producing a conceptual framework consistent with the Convention on the Rights
of the Child; to guide programming; to set priorities for work in the region;
to organize subsequent training seminars; to promote networking; to establish a
newsletter; and to begin the compilation and assessment of existing Arabic
resources in ECCD.<br>

<h1>General Resources for Information on the Regions, or on particular
countries</h1>
<b>	</b>We will continue to search the World Wide Web and Internet for
resources and information relating to Early Childhood Care and Development, and
link those resources into the appropriate sections of this Web Site.  However,
you may wish to search for particular information (or general information)
through one of the following resources:<p>
<p>
<b><A HREF="http://childhouse.uio.no/index.html">
The Children&#146;s House</b></A><br>

	The Children&#146;s House is a good place to start for all international
child-related searches.  	Our ECCD site represents the &#147;early childhood
floor&#148; of the Children&#146;s House, which is a collaborative effort
spearheaded by Childwatch in Norway to link all international on-line efforts
that focus on children and international development/research/advocacy.  The
formal launching for the Children&#146;s House is in February, 1996, but it
already contains many useful resources, such as extensive information on the
Convention on the Rights of the Child, and on NGOs working to serve families.
It also contains links to many other resources.  We recommend you take some
time to become familiar with the House.  It is growing in leaps and bounds, and
will eventually contain or link to most of the significant data-bases of
information concerning children.<p>
<p>
	<b>
<A HREF="http://undcp.or.at/unlinks.html">
List of United Nations servers and On-line Resources</b><br>
</A>
	This list will connect you with most U.N. resources including UNICEF.  From
there you 	can  get to the Innocenti Centre on-line catalogue of publications,
as well as Web Pages or gophers for some of the regional offices.  In the
UNICEF Eastern and Southern Africa (ESARO) web page, for example, you can find
descriptions of projects and e-mail addresses for key people in the region.<p>
<b>	</b><p>
	<b><A HREF="http://naic.nasa.gov//nsi/survey/">
Survey of International Internet Servers and K-12 connectivity</b></A><br>
<b>	</b>This site set up by NASA, offers information on internet resources on a
country by 	country basis.  If you are trying to help local or regional
organizations to get on-line and participate in electronic networking, this
might be a useful starting point in identifying local computer experts and
internet servers.    <br><p> 
 
<b>	<A HREF="http://www.odci.gov/cia/publications/95fact/index.html">
World Fact Book</A></b><br>
	The World Fact book offers a whole range of demographic information on a
country by 	country basis, with information about the people, their government,
birth, death, infant mortality rates, etc.  It also lists ethnic groups by
percentage, languages spoken, major industries and resources and a wealth of

  These programme and project descriptions have been collected over the last 10
years.  Some of them are more extensive case studies, others are programme
profiles taken from the Consultative Group publication, the<b>
Coordinators&#146; Notebook</b> , and others have
been extracted from reports, prepared for presentations, and cited from other
sources (please note citations for those that are quoted from publications).
Over time we hope all professionals in International ECCD and all CG
participants will help us to build a large library/data base of program and
project profiles.  The Secretarial will continue to develop, with CG feedback,
outlines detailing what kinds of information to include, so that this can
become an increasingly useful data base as it builds over time. <br>
 <br>
At present, all program descriptions include the following information: <br>
	Name of country in which project takes or took place <br>
	Age group of children served (or target group if not children) <br>
	Sponsoring agency (agencies) <br>
	Contact information (if available) <br>
<b>They will be sorted according to the outline above Programme Approach, and
within that category, the type of model they represent.</b> <br>

<h1>Global Initiatives To Address the Needs of
Children </h1><p>
 
<b></b>	In the past few years, the plight of the world&#146;s children has
received some significant attention in various world forums.  Advocates for
children, families, and women have tried to raise awareness among policymakers,
the media and governmental bodies of the ways that children are suffering and
being put at risk as a result of financial, social and environmental decisions
(or lack of decision-making) in both the Majority and developed worlds.  <p>
	<p>
	Unfortunately, the youngest children, those below school age, are often
greatly overlooked in international efforts to improve the education and
welfare of the world&#146;s at-risk populations.  Many efforts to improve
&#147;basic education&#148; for example, focus on primary schooling and older.
Many efforts to help women become integrated into their local economies often
fail to take into account the intersecting needs of the young children in these
women&#146;s lives. International initiatives frequently address only the
health concerns of very young children, ignoring their social, intellectual,
emotional and spiritual needs.  The Convention on the Rights of the Child, for
example, while promoting the improved welfare, nutrition and safety of all
children, does not address to any significant extent the particularly
precarious situation of very young children, for whom at-risk situations
threaten their lifelong developmental prospects. <p>
<p>
	One ongoing concern of the Consultative Group, and its participating
organisations, is to bring the needs and concerns of very young children to the
attention of policymakers, decision-makers, programme providers, the media,
educators, researchers, and others. In this section of the Early Childhood Care
and Development Web Site, we offer information on several international
initiatives, with specific reference to their provisions concerning young
children (0-8) and their families.<p>

<title>Convention on the Rights of the Child</title>
<h1>Convention on the Rights of the Child</h1><p>
	November 20, 1989, the <A HREF="http://childhouse.uio.no:80/childrens_rights/index.html">
Convention on the Rights of the Child</A>
 was signed
by the United Nations assembly as an effort to support children
internationally.  The Convention was subsequently ratified by approximately 170
countries.  <p>
<p>
	To promote greater understanding of and compliance to the Convention, a
<A HREF="gopher://hqfaus01.unicef.org:70/11/.s2summit">Summit for Children </A> was
held in September, 1990.  At this Summit, a process of developing National
Plans or Programmes of Action (NPAs) was identified .  NPAs are linked to a
worldwide Plan of Action adopted at the conclusion of the World Summit for
Children, obligating the 71 heads of State and Government and 88 Senior
officials who attended to create national plans for the decade of the 1990s.
The World Summit Plan of Action sets out 25 specific goals, based on provisions
of the Convention.  Most of the participating nations in the Summit and the
signatories to the Convention have now formulated NPAs for children looking
ahead to the year 2000.  This process is promoted and monitored closely by
UNICEF.<p>
<p>
	These two events have without doubt, had an important effect on the ways in
which the governments that are signatories to the Convention include attention
to children within their social planning and programming.  This is so in part
because national approval of the Convention creates a moral commitment by a
country, within an international framework, to seek improvements in the
survival, development, protection, and social participation of children. In
addition, individual countries that signed the Convention effectively made the
provisions of the Convention legally binding within their countries<p>

<head></head><body><title>Children's International Television Charter</title>

<h1>Children's International Television Charter</h1><br>
 
<b>Children's Television Charter, </b> presented at the <b>World Summit on
Television and Children</b>, Melbourne Australia, March 1995.<br>
Report submitted by Feny de los Angeles Bautista, Field Representative,
Consultative Group on ECCD.<br>
<br>
	A Children's Television Charter was developed and presented at the World
Summit on Television and Children, held in Australia in March, 1995.  At the
Summit the Charter was discussed in depth by delegates from over 70 countries.
It was then revised by a representative group of Summit delegates.<br>
<br>
	The Charter is conceived as a worldwide television industry commitment to
principles embodied in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
which has been ratified by over 90% of the world's governments.<br>
<br>
	The Charter will be circulated for endorsement to children's television
industry leaders worldwide, including all 637 Summit delegates.  The Charter
will be made public to ensure that viewers have a standard against which to
judge provision for their children.  Telecasters and producers will be urged to
heed its seven points when making decisions concerning programme production,
acquisition and distribution.  Advocacy groups, researchers and festivals will
be encouraged to adopt the Charter as the standard for evaluating service to
young people.  <br>
<br>
	Governments, advertisers and funding organizations are called on to recognize
the need for stable, adequate support for domestic children's television. Those
companies that endorse the Charter will be asked to report annually on their
own performance vis-a-vis the Charter's standards.  "This report will be a
valuable strategic tool for those companies that take it seriously," said Anna
Home, President of the European Broadcasting Union Working Group on Children's
and Youth Programming, and the author of the first draft of the Charter.<br>
	<br>
<center>The Children's Television Charter</center><br>
<br>
	As stated in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which
has been ratified by more than 170 countries, broadcasters should recognize
children's rights in the production of children's television programmes.  As
those responsible for the world's most powerful and widespread medium, and its
services to children, we accept our obligation to entertain, inform, engage and
enlighten young people in accord with these principles.  Specifically:<br>
<br>
1	Children should have programmes of high quality which are made specifically
for them, and which do not exploit them.  These programmes, in addition to
entertaining, should allow children to develop physically, mentally and
socially to their fullest potential.<br>
2.	Children should hear, see and express themselves, their culture, their
languages and their life experiences, through television programmes which
affirm their sense of self, community and place.<br>
3.	Children's programmes should promote an awareness and appreciation of other
cultures in parallel with the child's own cultural background.<br>
4.	Children's programmes should be wide-ranging in genre and content, but
should not include gratuitous scenes of violence and sex.<br>
5.	Children's programmes should be aired in regular slots at times when
children are available to view, and/or distributed via other widely accessible
media or technologies.<br>
6.	Sufficient funds must be made available to make these programmes to the
highest possible standards.<br>
7.	Governments and production, distribution and funding organisations should
recognize both the importance and vulnerability of indigenous children's
television, and take steps to support and protect it.<br>

<h1>Meetings in late 1995 and 1996</h1>
 
<b>DEVELOPMENT FOR AFRICAN EDUCATION (DAE) - Paris/Tours - October 16-21,
1995</b><br>
 
<b>ECCD WORKING GROUP Proposal from ECDNA</b><p>
<p>
<i>	</i>The Early Childhood Development Network for Africa (ECDNA) is moving
ahead.  As a result of a meeting in South Africa in February the proposal draft
of December 1994 was reviewed and changes made.  The new proposal was then
shared with donor agencies and the wider ECCD community within Africa.  The
proposal was further refined at a meeting in Uganda, August 18-22, 1995.  The
Uganda meeting resulted in a revised proposal that focuses on the
identification, selection and description of 3-5 case studies of innovative
ECCD programmes (family-based, community-based and centre-based).  Results will
be translated into policy papers, videos, pamphlets, etc. for distribution to
specific target audiences.<p>
<p>
	The ECDNA proposal will be shared at the Development for African Education
(DAE) Meeting held October 16-21 in France.  Included in the proposal is a
recommendation that the ECDNA be recognized as a Working Group within the DAE.
The proposal is being presented by Margaret Kabiru and Barnabas Otaala.  Kathy
Bartlett will be in attendance as well.<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>MOTHER-CHILD FOUNDATION - ANKARA, TURKEY - October 19-20, 1995</b><br>
 
	The Mother-Child Foundation is conducting a Symposium on Early Childhood
Education and Non-Formal Education.  Robert Myers will present a paper at the
Symposium.  A Turkish translation of <b>The Twelve Who Survive</b> should be
ready in time for the meeting.<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>FRANCOPHONE SUMMIT- Benin - November 29-December 3</b><br>
 
	This meeting is held every 2 years and includes Ministers of Education.  At
the meeting this year the focus will be on Basic Education, with an emphasis on
what is happening for the girl child.  ECCD is a part of the effort.  In fact 2
lines of action have already been developed:<p>
	1.  School-based day care.  Within this daycare centres are being set up at
primary schools so that girls can bring their younger siblings to school with
them.  That way the girl child can attend school and the younger child is
provided with an appropriate programme.<p>
	2. Parent Education.  Literacy classes are being established for parents.
They can bring their children who will then attend the day care established in
the schools. <p>
	At the present time these strategies are being developed in Cameroon and
Burkina Faso.<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>FUNDAMENTAL RESEARCH REVIEW- Bernard van Leer Foundation - December,
1995</b><br>
	The Bernard van Leer Foundation is hosting a meeting in The Hague to review
the outcomes of the Fundamental Research Project that has been conducted in
Kenya, Venezuela, India and France.  Several participants in the CG will be
attending the meeting.<p>
<p>
<hr>
<b>COSTS and FINANCING - Washington D.C. - April/June?</b><br>
 
	The InterAmerican Development Bank (Ricardo Moran), the World Bank (Mary Young
and Donald Winkler), and the Secretariat of the CG (Robert Myers) are
collaborating in the planning of a meeting that will deal with the costs and
financing of early childhood programs.  The meeting is to be held somewhere
between April and June of 1996, but specific dates have not yet been set.  We
will keep you informed.<p>
<p>
<hr> 
<b>EFA - MID-DECADE REVIEW - Amman Jordan - June 16-20, 1996</b><br>
	There is still very little information on the form this meeting will take.
Kate Torkington and Frank Method who are on the Steering Committee will be
attending a meeting in Rome from November 22-23 to see what has developed so
far and determine next steps.   Countries have been requested to complete a
questionnaire in relation to their activities associated with EFA.  In
addition, regional meetings are to be held, the results of which will be fed
into the international meeting in Amman.   Hopefully responses from the
countries will be available for review at the November meeting, and there will
be input in relation to the regional meeting.  All of this will help determine
the specific focus of the June meeting.  <p>
<p>
	<b>Mid-Decade Review of Progress Toward Education for All</b><p>
<p>
	<i>Background.</i>  The <i>Framework for Action to Meet Basic Learning
Needs,</i> adopted by the World Conference on Education for All (Jomtien,
Thailand, March 1990), foresees a mid-decade review of progress as an
opportunity for governments and organisations to undertake a mid-term
evaluation of the implementation of their respective plans and adjust them as
needed, and to undertake comprehensive policy reviews at regional and global
levels.<p>
<p>
	The International Consultative Forum on Education for All, the global-level
interagency mechanism for following up the Jomtien Conference, is the
designated focal point for the mid-decade review (MDR) process designed by its
Steering Committee and Secretariat.  The Forum Secretariat, based at UNESCO,
will cooperate closely with all the Jomtien partners in this regard.<p>
	<i>Purpose</i>.  The global MDR process is intended to serve several
purposes:<p>
(i) to take stock of progress toward Education for All (EFA) since the 1990
Jomtien Conference in respect both to the original goals and to the current
context; (ii) to identify priorities and promising strategies for overcoming
obstacles, accelerating progress, and making cooperation in EFA more effective;
(iii) to build and strengthen partnerships among the several actors within and
outside the public sector concerned with the provision of basic education; and
(iv) to promote renewed commitment to the goals of achieving Education for All
within a defined timeframe.<p>
<p>
	The MDR process and results will enable policymakers, planners and managers in
government and in organisations to adjust strategies and plans to develop and
support basic education.  Insofar as the main EFA partners participate actively
in the MDR process, it will promote dialogue and cooperation in implementing
national EFA strategies and plans.  The global MDR results will be used by
several EFA constituencies (Government, UN agencies, donors, NGOs) to determine
collective policy and necessary cooperative action.<p>
<p>
	<i>Scope.</i>  The MDR is forward-looking, but grounded in an analysis of past
experiences in promoting EFA, particularly since 1990.  Basic education is
understood in the sense of the expanded vision proclaimed in the<i> World
Declaration on Education for All.</i> The global-level MDR will seek answers to
five questions:<p>
 What actions have countries and organisations taken in line with the
<i>Framework for Action to Meet Basic Learning Needs?</i><p>
 What progress has been made globally in respect to each of the six 'target
dimensions' proposed in paragraph 8 of the <i>Framework</i>, and in respect to
the EFA goals that countries set for themselves?<p>
 What new factors may affect the validity of the targets and goals and the
prospects for further progress toward EFA?<p>
 What changes in the pattern of investment in basic education seem to be
obtaining effective results?<p>
 What problems require increased attention by governments and the world
community during the remainder of the decade?<p>
<p>
	The MDR will also take into account the relevant objectives and commitments
adopted by the world community since 1990 at certain major conferences dealing
with development, notably the 1992 Rio Conference on the Environment, the 1994
Cairo Populations Conference, the 1995 Copenhagen Social Development
Conference, and the 1995 Beijing Women's Conference.<p>
<p>
	While all countries are invited to participate in the MDR, the focus will be
on the progress achieved in the developing countries which face the most
challenges in providing EFA.  The Forum's own limited funding will be used to
support the MDR process in the developing countries and regions.<p>
<p>
	<i>Process</i>.  The Forum will invite national governments, major
intergovernment and bilateral organisations and key groups of NGOs concerned
with basic education to review their respective EFA actions and plans.  The
Forum will propose general guidelines for conducting and reporting on these
micro-level reviews.  These will be important in themselves as well as
constitute the main inputs to regional and global MDR activities.<p>
<p>
	The principal focal point for the country-level MDRs will be the Ministry of
Education or another designated EFA mechanism (commission, task force,
interministerial committee).  The national focal point is expected to work with
representatives of other concerned government departments (including Planning
and Finance), the teaching profession, NGOs active in EFA, the business
community, the media and other international and external partners.  Each
country will work out its own MDR process, which should be open, participatory
and include at least one national meeting on EFA, as well as public information
activities.  The MDR process should be useful in itself, as well as producing
useful 'products' such as reports, studies and strategy documents.  Countries
are expected to submit a report on their MDR findings to the Forum as an input
for regional and global analyses of progress toward EFA.<p>
<p>
	In order to ensure obtaining information on key aspects of Education for All a
variety of initiatives will be undertaken:<p>
 A number of country case studies will be carried out under contract by
competent national institutions and/or researchers.  The case studies are
expected to generate information that will contribute to or complement the
national MDRs in the selected countries;<p>
 Desk studies will be carried out to analyse existing documentation in basic
education since 1990 to identify significant achievements, trends and problems
for each of the major regions and significant universal issues that need to be
addressed by the international community;<p>
 Regional policy review seminars will be held to examine and validate the
analysis of EFA progress for each major region and formulate proposals for
consideration by the governments concerned and by their external partners;<p>
 A survey of donors and intergovernmental organisations will focus on the
significant changes in their policies and modalities of cooperation since 1990,
their experiences in supporting EFA, their perception of EFA progress, and
their plans for the immediate future;<p>
 The collective reviews of NGOs actively engaged in basic education will bring
another set of perspectives into the global MDR process;<p>
 Media coverage of the MDR will be sought at key moments during the entire MDR
process. Various EFA advocacy and information activities will be organised by
the competent services of the UN system, using specialised and mass media
channels;<p>
 The involvement of the international business community will be sought, as it
constitutes untapped resources for basic education.<p>
<p>
	The outcomes of the several MDR activities will be analysed and distilled into
a report for examination by the Forum at its third meeting, planned for 1996.
The final MDR report, including the Forum's conclusions and proposals will be
distributed to all governments and submitted to selected meetings in 1996 and
1997 dealing with education and related policy issues. <p>

<H1>ECCD Programming Principles</H1>

	Given the need to respond to the rapidly growing interest in high-quality,
affordable early childhood care and development programs that can reach a
significant number of children and families, an understanding of the
programming process is critical.  First, because of the breadth and scope of
early childhood projects -- in terms of the developmental differences between
children during the first eight years of life, and in terms of the range of
needs to be met physically, socially, emotionally, cognitively and spiritually,
there are a wide variety of activities that can legitimately be undertaken.
There is no single &#145;model&#146; that could be appropriately applied to all
settings.  However, there are some basic social principles, some principles of
child development and learning that should guide programming intended to
improve the welfare of children in their early years, and there are some
operational principles that should be respected when establishing such
programmes.  They are described below:<p>
<hr>
<CENTER><b>Social Principles</b></CENTER><p>
<p>
With respect to statements of social principle, the Consultative Group finds
that it is useful for each organization to take into account assertions
presented in the Convention on the Rights of the Child, the Declaration of the
World Conference, the Summit on Children, and others, but that these positions
must be viewed critically.   The CG does agree upon several statements, by way
of preamble to the discussion of principles and guidelines, that have their
roots in affirmations found in the outcomes of recent world conferences and
conventions.  These are:<BR>
<p>
   	<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Children, by reason of their physical and mental immaturity, need special
safeguards and care.  Children living in especially difficult circumstances
need special consideration.<BR>
<p>
   	<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">All children, without distinction of gender, race, language, religion or of
any other kind, should have the opportunity to develop to their full
potential.<BR>
<p>
   	<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Parents and families (however defined) -- men as well as women -- have the
primary responsibility for the upbringing, development and education of their
children.<BR>
<p>
   	<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Governments should establish a policy environment which enables families
and communities to fulfill their responsibilities of child rearing and
protection.<BR>

<b><CENTER>Principles of Child Development and Learning</b></CENTER><p>
<p>
	The term used by the early childhood community to describe children's
development is <i>holistic</i>.  What this means is that the child's
development cannot be compartmentalized into health, nutrition, education,
social and emotional variables.  All are interwoven in a child's life. As a
result, early childhood experiences for children, at whatever age, should be
holistic and developed around the child's developmental abilities.  Support for
this position comes from international literature on how children develop and
learn.  Specifically:<p>
<p>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"><b>Development begins pre-natally and learning is occurring at birth.</b> Too
often the assumption is made that learning begins when children enter the
formal school system.  In fact, significant learning takes place before the
child enters school. Therefore, attention to the developmental and learning
needs of children should begin with pre- and post-natal interventions and be
continued thereafter.<br>
<p>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"><b>Development has several inter-related dimensions, and learning occurs in
each of these areas. </b> These include physical, cognitive, social, spiritual
and emotional development, each of which influence the other and all of which
are developing simultaneously.  Progress in one area affects progress in
others.  Likewise when something goes wrong in any one of those areas it
impacts all the other areas. For example, children who are malnourished are not
able to learn, children with learning problems frequently have low self-esteem,
etc.  Developing a programme based on an understanding of holistic development
means taking the whole child into consideration, providing attention to the
child's health, nutrition, cognitive, and socio-emotional needs.  Therefore
development and learning must be seen holistically and interventions should
provide integrated attention to the child, including attention to needs for
protection, food, health care, affection, interaction and stimulation, security
provided through consistency and predictability, and play allowing exploration.
All of these elements should be present to support the child's development.<br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"> <b>Development proceeds in predictable steps and learning occurs in recognized
sequences, within which there is a great deal of individual and social
variability in children's rates of development and styles of learning. </b> It
is important for adults to use methods that fit with the child's growth
pattern, not only in the cognitive area, but also in the affective, perceptual
and motor areas. Activities should provide the child with a developmentally
appropriate challenge. There is no value in presenting concepts and tasks
before a child is developmentally ready to understand them. Integrated
interventions promoting social, emotional and spiritual development as well as
cognitive learning can take advantage of varied forms of learning, consistent
with the culture, even while taking into account that there are recognized
sequences and activities that facilitate learning.   <br>
<p>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"> <b>Development and learning occur continuously as a result of the child
interacting with people and objects in his or her environment.</b>  The role of
adults (at home and in other settings) in supporting children's learning is to
be emotionally responsive to and involved with children, to provide children
with opportunities to work with concrete objects, make choices, explore things
and ideas, experiment and discover.  Children also need opportunities to
interact with peers and adults in a safe environment that provides the child
with security and acceptance. <br>
<p>
Given the importance of the environment in promoting children's learning, it is
also possible to focus interventions on changing the child's environment.  For
example, increasing family income, upgrading health and sanitation in the
community, and enhancing the social and political milieu will affect children's
growth and development.<p>
<p>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"> <b>Children are active participants in their own development and learning.</b>
Learning and related development involves the child's construction of
knowledge, not an adult's imposition of information.  The skills which are the
basis for constructing knowledge improve with practice. It is important for
children to have opportunities to construct their own knowledge through
exploration, interaction with materials and imitation of role models. Therefore
interventions should include opportunities for children to learn by doing, to
be engaged in problem-solving, and to develop language and communication
skills. ECCD programmes should not put undue emphasis on rote memorisation and
learning the <i>3 Rs</i>. Opportunities for active involvement should abound,
whether at home in everyday chores or in more organised settings outside the
home.<br>
	<p>
	In sum, ECCD programmes building on a holistic understanding of children's
growth and development, suggest a broad conceptualisation of early childhood
development in terms of the whole child within the context of the family and
community.  The early childhood years are perceived as the basis for learning
life-long skills and attitudes.  Activities and programmes planned for parents
and young children should not focus solely on providing children with school
survival skills, but should emphasize the development of the child's sense of
intellectual, motor and moral autonomy, initiative and self-esteem.  Emphasis
should be on <b>how to learn</b> (i.e. positive attitudes toward learning and
thinking skills) rather than <b>what to learn.</b><p>
<hr>
<center><b>Operational Principles</b></center><p>
<p>
	Some of the following operational principles are directly related to the
principles of development and learning.  Others are general principles that
apply to ECCD programmes as well as other social development programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>Identify Those Who Should be Involved in the Programme Development
Process</b> <b>: Foster participation by individuals, families and communities
who are to be the primary beneficiaries</b>.<p>
<p>
	Before one begins the programme development process it is important to
identify the people and organizations that should be a part of the process.
Historically programmes were developed by people from outside the community.
&#145;Experts&#146; got together and determined what it was that a community
needed and designed a programme for the community.  The programme was then
introduced and it may or may not have been successful based on how &#145;in
touch&#146; the experts were with the needs and resources within the community.
Today there is much greater emphasis on developing programmes with the
community, based on community-defined needs and building on community
strengths.  What this means is that communities are involved right from the
beginning.  They are part of the needs-definition process.  They are the key
actors in determining what the goals and objectives ought to be.  They plan the
activities to be undertaken. They are the primary implementors of the project.
They assist in the development of appropriate resources, and they are active in
the monitoring and evaluation process.  In other words, it is the
community&#146;s programme; the process has developed the community&#146;s
&#145;ownership&#146; of the effort.<p>
<p>
	The community is the primary &#145;stakeholder&#146; in the effort.  But there
are other groups that are also stakeholders.  A major one is the government.
In the majority of instances the expectation is that if the programme is to be
sustained over time it is necessary for the government to take some
responsibility for its continuation.  This responsibility may be in the form of
policy, laws and regulations that provide support for and recognition of the
programme, and/or the allocation of resources -- financial and human -- to
sustain the effort.<p>
<p>
	Other stakeholders include the research community. They can assist in
providing basic research which can be drawn on to help shape the ECCD
initiative.  In addition, researchers can be involved in developing the
monitoring and evaluation processes that provide necessary feedback to
implementors on the effectiveness of their programme.  Another potential
stakeholder is the private sector that may be able to provide some of the
resources to sustain the programme over time.<p>
<p>
	The more the various stakeholders are involved from the beginning, the greater
&#145;ownership&#146; they will have for the effort and the more they will be
committed to seeing that the programme is successful.<p>
<p>
 <b>Determine the Needs</b><p>
<p>
	There are several dimensions that have to be taken into consideration in
determining whether or not there is a need for an early childhood care and
development programme.  These can be divided into two groups -- those that are
related to the context within which the child lives, and those directly
associated with the child or group of children.  As assessment of both is
required before it is possible to create an ECCD programme that is appropriate,
cost effective and sustainable.<p>
<p>
	<b>Assessment of the Context</b><p>
<p>
	In assessing the context, it is worthwhile to seek answers to the following
questions:<p>
<p>
	- <i>What is happening in terms of changes in the social fabric and what are
some of the possible consequences of those changes for young children and their
families?  </i>There are a variety of forces that are impacting the family.
Today there is extensive migration.  In some parts of the world this involves
men leaving their homes and sometimes countries to seek work elsewhere.  In
other parts of the world women are the ones who are migrating.  The long
absence of either (or both) parents makes a difference in the lives of young
children.  <p>
<p>
	Other common social changes involve the movement of people from rural to urban
areas; from subsistence agriculture to paid labor, from reliance on the
extended family for a range of supports to living within a nuclear family.  The
practices in relation to childrearing that were in place before these shifts
have necessarily changed.  Sometimes there is a conscious awareness of shifts
in practice as a result of these changes; at other times new practices are
adopted without much thought.  These changes in the social system may have left
families without adequate child care, children may be living in environments
where they are at risk physically, they may lack appropriate places to play,
they may be cautioned against contact with &#145;strangers&#146;, there may be
new expectations of them in terms of their independence and ability to bring
money into the family. <p>
<p>
	There are some situations that put children at great risk in terms of
physical, social and emotional development.  These are situations of war,
violence, homelessness, and abuse.  In all these situations children learn to
fear rather than trust; they expect the unexpected instead of living in a
relatively predictable world; they live only for today with no expectations in
terms of what will be there for them tomorrow.  This social context presents
programme planners with a set of needs that must be addressed if ECCD
programmes are to be effective.<p>
<p>
	<i>- What is the economic context within which families are living?</i>  The
need to provide even the basics for a family can put a great deal of stress on
the family if there is no land to cultivate, if there are no jobs within the
formal sector and if there are few ways to earn money through the informal
sector.  Children living in the poorest families are at greatest risk of
debilitated and delayed development.  <p>
<p>
	<i>- What is the political milieu</i>?  The answer to this question is sought
through making an assessment of how individuals and communities relate to and
are served by the government.  In some societies there is a great deal of
individual freedom and autonomy.  Communities are encouraged to develop their
own programmes, with some degree of support from either local, regional or
national government.  In other contexts all decisions regarding social
programming are made by central government, leaving communities with little
flexibility in terms of the creation and implementation of programmes.  In
designing an ECCD programme it is essential to know how to position oneself in
relation to government, what resources are available and what regulations will
guide the implementation of ECCD efforts.<p>
<p>
	<i>- What is the government&#146;s social policy in relation to the family,
children, health, social services and education?  </i>Governments define their
role quite differently in terms of how much responsibility they think it is
appropriate for the family to take in terms of raising children and what they
view as the role of government in that context.  Where there are policies in
place to support the family, then these can be drawn on in creating programmes.
Where the government seeks to play a minimalist role in supporting families,
fewer resources are available for the implementation of programmes.  In this
case it may be necessary to engage in awareness raising activities in order to
facilitate the development of a more supportive policy environment.<p>
<p>
	<i>- What is current government expenditure on social programmes, and within
which ministries/departments is the spending administered?  </i>This question
is tied closely to the question of social policy. At times there are policies
in place that suggest a strong government commitment to social programmes, but
resources have not been allocated for implementation of the policy.  The
government budget should be analysed in terms of: 1) the percentage of the
national budget that is allocated to ECCD-related programmes; and 2) what that
means in real terms.  Other questions relate to where those monies are located
within the government and who controls their allocation.  In addition, it is
important to learn what the process is for obtaining the funds. <p>
<p>
	- <i>What is the role of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) within the
country?</i>  In some countries there is a long tradition of NGO involvement in
the development of social sector programmes.  In other countries NGOs are a
relatively new phenomenon.  Where they have existed they have been the ones to
develop innovative ECCD programmes that are designed to reach the poorest.  The
models they have developed and the lessons they have learned in the process can
be built on to expand coverage and use in the development of new programmes.
In countries without a strong NGO tradition, one strategy might be to help
strengthen the ability of the NGOs to work with communities to develop
appropriate ECCD programmes.<p>
<p>
	<i>- To what extent and in what ways is the private sector involved in ECCD
programmes? </i> Private industry has a great deal it can contribute to the
well-being of young children and their families.  The most direct route is
through the creation of jobs.  Beyond that the private sector can fund
programmes directly, they can provide child care, they can participate in
social marketing efforts, they can be influential in terms of policy
development.  They can be active partners in the development of social
programmes.  In order to do that, however, there needs to be legislation and
laws in place that encourage private businesses to become involved.  This can
be accomplished through tax incentives and appropriate legislation. <p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>Assessment of the Situation of Children</b><p>
	<p>
	In addition to doing an analysis of the context within which children are
being raised, it is critical to gain an understanding of the specific situation
of children.  There are some statistical data that can be gathered regarding
the number of children within a given age group.  These include the absolute
number of children at different ages, the percentage of the population that
young children represent, their urban/rural and geographic distribution, the
infant mortality rate, the under-five mortality rate, immunization rates, rates
and degree of malnutrition, etc.  In addition there are a series of questions
that need to be answered in order to target ECCD programmes to those most in
need. <p>
<p>
	<i>- What types of out-of-home care are children already receiving?  </i>This
includes the kinds of services that children are already receiving-- in terms
of health care, nutrition inputs, support for social, cognitive and spiritual
development.  This analysis should be done by social class, geographic
distribution, urban/rural residency, etc.   By looking at family income data
and/or socio-economic status it is also possible to identify those populations
of children that are the most &#145;at risk&#146; of not doing well
developmentally.  It is highly likely that these children are not included
among those children currently receiving the full range of  ECCD support.  <p>
<p>
	Once data are gathered it is possible to begin to identify children with
particular needs.  These might include children at risk of abuse, children with
special needs, children living in the poorest families, children living in
especially difficult circumstances due to war, violence and migration.   With
limited resources it is suggested that ECCD programmes for these children be
given priority. <p>
<p>
	<i>-  Who is caring for the children?</i> What are the current child care
arrangements?  Who cares for the child?  Is it only the mother?  To what extent
are other extended family members involved?  In most developing countries older
children, particularly girls, have responsibility for the care of young
siblings.  This phenomenon has led to the development of Child-to-Child
programmes where older children are provided with knowledge and skills that
assist them in their caretaking task, providing a safer and more stimulating
environment for the young child and providing the older child with skills and
knowledge that they will carry into their adult life.  When the current
caregivers are identified then it is possible to assess the knowledge and
skills and develop programmes that will enhance the ability of these
individuals to support the young child&#146;s development.<p>
<p>
	- <i>What are the current childrearing beliefs and practices?</i> It is
important to try to identify current belief systems and child rearing practices
that are guiding adult&#146;s interactions with young children.  Many
traditional beliefs and practices are very positive in promoting
children&#146;s overall development.  These should be identified and built upon
in the creation of new programmes.  Those practices which are harmful can be
replaced by alternatives that are more supportive of positive growth.<p>
<p>
	Not all of these questions can be answered by national survey or by the
standard methods used to obtain data.  Nonetheless, national statistical
bureaus are a good place to start.  Additional data can be obtained through
independent studies that can be drawn on or commissioned as required.  It is
important to involve key individuals and institutions in the process so that
they can help interpret the finding, become more aware of the situation of
young children, and develop a greater degree of commitment through their
participation.<p>
<p>
	In sum, an analysis of the context and the situation analysis for the child,
makes it possible to define the population to be served by the ECCD programme.
In general, priority should be given to families and communities in which
children are &#145;at risk&#146; of delayed or debilitated development.  The
criteria used to define &#145;at risk&#146; includes the condition of children
(birth weight, infant mortality rates, nutritional and health status,
immunization rates); the condition of women (educational levels, maternal
mortality rates, health and nutritional status, age at first pregnancy, work
demands and control of family income); family and support systems (size and
composition, employments and income, the availability of adequate support to
care for young children); childrearing practices and beliefs (feeding, health
habits, nurturance, communication); the general social conditions (access to
potable water, sanitation, literacy rates, access to social services); and the
political climate (degree of government control, stability, political will in
relation to support for families and young children).   There is no formula for
weighing these dimensions to come up with a <i>score </i>to indicate those
children who should be given first priority in an ECCD programme.  The
political realities combined with social conscience, technical competence,
resources and experience are likely to act as strong forces in determining who
is to benefit from ECCD programmes. <p>

<hr>
<b>Define the Goals and Objectives of ECCD Programming</b><p>
		<p>
 	Once the needs are clearly defined then it is important to determine how the
needs might  be addressed through an ECCD programme.  That is, what can one
hope to accomplish by providing an ECCD programme?  What are the goals and
objectives of ECCD programmes?<p>
<p>
	An overarching goal for child development programmes is <i>to assure the right
of each child to realize his or her potential.   </i>The child&#146;s potential
is likely to be defined differently across cultures.  Thus what this means is
that the specific objectives derived from the general one will be
culture-specific.  For example, in some cultures there is greater emphasis on
independence.  In other cultures what is most important is for the child to
find his or her place within an inter-dependent social group.  Expectations in
terms of how children relate to their elders are different; the value of
convergent versus divergent thinking is different.  Thus the specific
objectives of ECCD programmes will differ.<p>
<p>
	As has been noted in the section on <b>Program Strategies</b>, children are
not the only beneficiaries of ECCD programmes.  What follows is a listing of
the possible goals and objectives that can be accomplished through ECCD
programmes, for children, families, communities and the society at large.<p>

<p>
<b>ECCD Programmes Should be Developed within a Broad Conceptual Framework and
Form a Part of a Comprehensive, Multi-faceted Strategy: Programmes should not
be developed in isolation of other social services</b><p>
<p>
	There is unity in a child&#146;s needs.  Therefore, ECCD programmes should be
part of a broad conceptual effort that addresses the needs of children from
birth through the early primary years.  Integration of services should be
sought in the conceptualization, planning and implementation of services. This
principle derives in part from the holistic nature of child development in
which physical, mental, social and emotional dimensions of development affect
each other.  Hence, effectiveness requires integrated attention to children.
In addition, there is a maximization of resources when programmes are
multi-dimensional, combining health, nutrition, education and social actions.
<p>
<p>
	Attempting to adhere to this guideline does not mean that all components must
appear in all programmes of all those providing ECCD services.  Nevertheless,
an overall strategy that is comprehensive and multi-faceted should frame all
child development programme efforts.  Opportunities should be sought to blend
services, to encourage multi-sectoral collaboration, and to fit new components
into on-going programmes whenever it is opportune.<p>
<p>
	Further, complementary strategies should be developed and implemented to meet
ECCD goals.  Since the child's development is affected by the environment (the
home, the community, social institutions, legal frameworks, and a cultural
ethos) a comprehensive programme to improve child development should function
simultaneously at different levels, focusing respectively on the child,
caregivers and national institutions and policies.  <p>
<p>
	ECCD programmes should also take an inter-generational view, seeking ways to
take into account the needs of families as well as the needs of children, and
to involve children, youth and adults in ECCD programmes.  Programmes of early
childhood development can and should benefit parents, other caregivers and
community members as well as children.  Child care, for instance, is generally
the responsibility of various family members (older siblings and extended
family members in addition to fathers and mother). Thus ECCD programmes can
focus on supporting these individuals in their caregiving task.<p>
<p>
<b>Begin with What Exists and Build from There</b><p>
<p>
	This principle derives from a belief that programmes are sustainable when they
are built on the &#145;known&#146; in people&#146;s lives.  Programmes that
introduce ideas and practices that are too &#145;foreign&#146; seldom take
hold.  Thus ECCD programme models should build on the strengths of communities.
These include: traditional family units and social structures that can be
mobilised; rich traditional practices that are supportive of children's growth
and development;  parents' strong desire to provide the best for their
children; people's desire for education and knowledge; and the networks that
have been created as a result of the fact that many people belong to churches
and religious organisations.  When people feel that their current practices and
beliefs are respected and recognized it gives them confidence to entertain
other ways of doing things.<p>
<p>
	This principle also applies to current social programmes that are in place.
It suggests that it is possible to expand the mandate of current social
programmes to provide a more holistic range of services.  For example:
education components can be added to nutrition programmes; child development
information can be provided by the health care profession when they work with
families; parenting information can be included as modules within literacy
programmes; current children&#146;s T.V. programmes can be modified to
encourage better health and nutrition.  And the list goes on.<p>
<p>
	Building on what exists within the community and the larger cultural ethos
provides a maximization of resources and reinforces a holistic view of
children&#146;s development.<p>
<p>
<b>Identify Partners at all Levels to Support the Creation, Implementation and
Sustainability of ECCD Programmes</b><p>
<p>
	ECCD provision should be created and expanded through partnerships at all
levels -- from the community to local, regional and national government, to
non-governmental partners. The principle of developing partnerships between
government, non-governmental agencies, the private sector and the community
arises from social as well as financial needs. Neither government nor
communities, nor a wide range of non-governmental organisations, can easily
maintain an effective ECCD programme without help.    In most countries, the
development, management and funding of early childhood provision is the joint
responsibility of the state, regional and local governments, the private
sector, the community and parents. The notion of creating partnerships is
consistent with a holistic view of the child and it will: decrease duplication
of services in some areas with other areas being under-served; assure more
equitable access to ECCD programmes; and maximise the use of human and fiscal
resources.<p>
<p>
	Within many governments there is an increasing focus on the development of
community-based programmes and the strengthening of communities to define their
own needs and develop their own resources, thus decreasing their dependency on
the State.   Early Childhood Care and Development programmes should be
developed in collaboration with the community. A growing body of experience
shows that community participation increases the effectiveness of most
programmes.  Community participation also allows extension of the services
beyond what would be possible using only the budgets and resources of the
public sector. Specifically, community-based programmes: build local capacity
to identify needs and seek solutions; create ownership and accountability;
encourage unity and strength within the community; enhance the probability that
decisions will be implemented and that programmes will be maintained once
initial outside support is withdrawn; and empower people to make decisions in
relation to all aspects of their lives.<p>
<p>
	Other important partners are non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which, in
many countries, have made significant contributions to ECCD programmes.  In a
wide range of countries the NGO community has developed both appropriate ECCD
delivery systems and training. Their experiences, skills and knowledge should
be maintained and built upon. Capitalising on the experience of these agencies
enhances the provision of ECCD programmes.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>ECCD Programmes Should:</b><p>
<p>
<ul>
<b>	 Provide Equity in Access.</b> 
</ul>
<p>
	While the aim is to provide universal attention to young children, there is
special recognition of children living in conditions that put them at increased
risk of delayed or debilitated development.  This strategy recognizes the need
for all children to be supported as they grow and develop, while stressing the
urgency of attending to children living in poverty or those who are
discriminated against as a result of ethnicity.  The sustainability of
programmes, and in particular those in remote and isolated areas, is a critical
factor in determining a strategy that will increase and maintain access.<p>
<p>
<ul>
<b>Be Flexible and Reflect Diversity</b>  
</ul>
<p>
	This principle derives in part from the social and individual variation in
children's needs. It is not necessary nor appropriate for all children to
receive the same kind of early childhood services.    This principle is also
derived from a recognition of the cultural diversity which exists within a
given country. Nations, communities and cultures differ widely in the
particular needs of their children.  Unless programme planners can be
responsive to these differences they risk designing efforts that are irrelevant
to the population to be served. The actual form the programme takes will vary
depending on local and regional needs and resources. Out of respect for this
diversity ECCD programmes will necessarily differ. <p>
<p>
<ul>
	<b>Ensure Quality</b>  
</ul>
	It is essential that quality not be lost as a result of tyring to implement
&#145;low-cost&#146; models and/or increasing the coverage of proven models.
The argument that efforts should be aimed at increasing supply before
endeavouring to improve quality misses the essential point that without quality
costs will be incurred later on, in schooling and by society.  	Low quality
programmes are ineffective, deprive children of benefits, and represent a waste
of resources.  <p>
	A quality programme is one that is appropriate to the child's stage of
development and addresses the needs of the child, while respecting individual
differences.   In seeking quality, it should be recognized that quality is
affected by the motivation and training of programme personnel, the physical
environment, the materials used, the curriculum, and the supports available to
providers.  (See <A HREF="e15.html">Program Structure</A>)<p>
<p>
	It is also important to recognize that quality cannot be legislated.  Setting
norms and standards does not guarantee quality.  Neither is quality defined by
expenditure level. Nonetheless a process for establishing standards (in
relation to facilities, staffing, curriculum and programme quality) and for
effective monitoring needs to be established.  This should include a clear
definition of responsibility for standards at the central, the regional and
community levels. Standards should be complementary and consistent across the
health, welfare and education sectors.  What is important is that quality be
defined within the national context, and that it not be identified only with
high-cost pre-primary school models.<p>
<p>
<ul>
	<b>Be Cost-effective</b>
</ul>
<p>
	Clearly it must be possible to implement programmes within recognized
resource constraints, and they should be economically feasible over time.  The
economic feasibility of a programme is only partly a matter of available funds.
It is also a matter of priorities and how funds are allocated.  If a programme
is accorded a high priority, it can be implemented by giving up something that
has a lower priority. Thus public awareness and political will are important
dimensions in determining feasibility.<p>
<p>
	Even when ECCD programmes are seen as a priority, those involved in such
efforts are concerned about identifying and implementing cost-effective models.
Resources need to be used efficiently and effectively.  Thus there is a need to
create and promote the adoption of low-cost programmes to ensure maximum
coverage.  However, low-cost programmes are not necessarily the best.  Too
often low-cost means low quality. If programmes are of such a low cost that
they are ineffective they represent a waste of resources. There needs to be a
systematic evaluation of a programme to determine the balancing point between
cost and quality. In general, strategies that stress prevention are more
cost-effective than compensatory strategies.<p>
<p>
	Because the need is so great, programmers should give priority to those
programmes that offer the best prospect of reaching the most children who are
&#145;at risk&#146;.  That means looking beyond demonstration and pilot
projects to the possibility of expansion and replication of the programme
model.<p>
	<p>
<b>Determine the Appropriate Size for the Project/Programme; Coverage should be
achieved by combining a variety of approaches rather than developing a single
national model meant to apply to all.</b>  <p>
<p>
	One of the things that is very difficult in designing a project/programme is
to determine an appropriate size for the programme.  It needs to be large
enough that the per beneficiary costs are not exorbitant, creating a project
that it is neither possible to expand nor replicate.  On the other hand, the
initial effort needs to be realistic in coverage based on the human, technical
and financial resources available.  Political pressures sometimes result in
projects being designed that cannot be implemented in a way to assure programme
quality and impact.<p>
<p>
Thus it is important to begin with a pilot project that reaches a reasonable
percentage of the target beneficiaries, with an eye to what it would take to
expand the project, if it were successful.  Further, the timeline for project
implementation needs to be realistic, based on resources -- human and financial
-- that are available.<p>
<p>
	Attention to all the children should be sought through a series of different
programmes responding to distinct needs.  When projects are successful there is
a temptation to take the project to &#145;scale&#146; to reach desired
coverage.  In the early days, it was assumed that scale was best achieved by
taking an exemplary project and expanding it to achieve national coverage.  By
and large, experiences with such expansion efforts have not been successful.
This is the result of several factors.  For example, projects that are
appropriate in one geographical area are not necessarily what is required in
another part of the country; the NGO that created the initial project may not
have the capacity to expand its own staff and capability to support the
implementation of a large project; the dynamics in terms of the way the project
was created and developed are difficult to replicate in large-scale
expansion.<p>
<p>
	As a result, today &#147;scale&#148; is defined as the sum of varied programme
efforts rather than the expansion of a single model.  This allows for cultural
variation; it allows for differences in terms of needs and resources; it allows
for the development of a variety of approaches, based on what is required and
the skills and competencies of those working with a given population; it allows
for more specific targeting, rather than attempting a blanket coverage; and it
provides for the development of more local ownership rather than having the
programme established from a central point.<p>
<p>
	Myers (1995) argues that scale should be achieved through<i> association</i>
or <i>addition.</i>  Scale is achieved by combining several models, varying in
size and carried out with relative independence, addressing the needs in its
own way, but with a <b>common goal or framework</b>. Scale by association is
like a puzzle.  All the pieces need to fit within the framework and when all
the pieces are in place the puzzle is whole -- coverage is achieved.  Myers
cites Chile as a country which has achieved scale through the implementation of
at least three major models, with several minor ones also involved, which
together, add up to significant coverage. (Myers. IADB, 1995, p. 23)<p>
<p>
<b>Create Systems for Monitoring, Assessment and Evaluation of the Programme
from the Outset.  </b><p>
<b></b><p>
	Programmes are only effective and sustainable when they include the capacity
to analyse strengths and weaknesses and to adjust programmes accordingly.
Assessment/evaluation processes need to be an integral part of all programmes.
This should occur at several levels.  There should be an assessment of the
child's developmental progress.  There should be an evaluation of the impact of
the provision on the child's progress through school and in relation to
life-long learning.  As well as focusing on the child, there should be an
evaluation of the ECCD programme being provided and the formal primary school
system the child is entering.  An assessment of the teacher training and
support process is critical.  And there should be an assessment of the
effectiveness of linking parents, the community, NGOs and government for the
purposes of supporting children's development. <p>
<p>
	Few ECCD programmes have been adequately evaluated.  One of the primary
reasons is that programme evaluation and monitoring is seldom considered as the
programme is designed.  It is frequently tacked on at the end and conducted by
someone outside the system.  There is also a lack of expertise in programme
evaluation, a paucity of  widely accepted child development impact measures,
and little realization of the value of on-going feedback and monitoring in
terms of continuing to improve the programme.  Another difficulty is that
alternative approaches to ECCD programming require alternative monitoring and
evaluation systems.  As there is no one model of ECCD provision, so there is no
one evaluation model that can be applied across the board.  Innovative data
collection techniques must be created, techniques that capture both the
intended and unintended outcomes of programmes for children, families and the
community.<p>
<p>
	There are several arguments in support of strong well-developed evaluations.
First, documentation of success is a powerful tool in eliciting the attention
as well as sustaining the commitment of policy-makers and planners.  Second,
evaluations can identify the factors that are fundamental to achieving
programme goals and assuring quality.  Third, evaluations can provide the
information that planners need to determine the extent to which a model can be
expanded and/or replicated.  Fourth, evaluations allow for cross-programme
comparisons of the effectiveness of alternative programming strategies.<p>
<p>
	Evaluations need to be designed at several levels.  There are evaluation
processes that can be used by parents and other caregivers to monitor
children&#146;s development.  There also needs to be an evaluation system put
into place to assess the impact of the training and support systems provided
for caregivers and others who work in the programme.  Evaluations can also be
conducted at the institutional level to assess the effectiveness of the
management systems in place.  And programmes can be evaluated in terms of their
impact on the community and the nation.  Thus, in addition to monitoring
individual programmes, it is necessary to evaluate the extent to which national
goals have been achieved. <p>
<p>
In designing the evaluation/ monitoring system the following principles
should be considered:<p>
<p>
	<b>Demystify the evaluation process</b>.  Evaluation and monitoring are seen
as something that is <i>done to</i> a programme, not something that can help
those involved in the programme do their job better.  Work with those involved
in developing and implementing the programme to identify what they need to know
to do their jobs better and develop ways to gather that information.  As people
receive evaluation data that they can use immediately in their work, they will
become more involved in the process and help develop instruments that are the
most useful.<p>
<p>
	<b>Involve all stakeholders in the evaluation process</b>.  The
stakeholders--from parents to policy-makers--should be a part of defining the
desired outcomes and be a part of collecting the data.  The extent that the
various stakeholders are involved on a day-to-day basis will depend on  when
they need to have the information that the process produces.<p>
<p>
	<b>Determine what information will be needed at each phase of the project in
order to make sound decisions</b>.   Define the kinds of information that is
required in order to enable the programme to grow and become stronger, both in
relation to the programme&#146;s operation, and in terms of longitudinal
results that can affect policy makers and the programme&#146;s ability to be
expanded or replicated in other settings.  Decide what kind of information will
be needed: soon after the programme begins (e.g. the demographics of the
children who are being served by the programme; the extent and kinds of parent
response; the extent to which various institutions and organizations are
supporting the programme; if there are skills and competencies that caregivers
do not have); at a mid-point in the programme (e.g. the types of families
involved in the programme and the turnover since the programme has begun; the
capability of staff to operate the programme with their current level of
training and supervision; additional training needs; the costs of the programme
as compared to anticipated costs); end of programme evaluation (immediate
impact on beneficiaries; costs and how they are being funded; projection of
costs into the future and who will pay them; potential to continue at same
size; potential for expansion); longitudinally (e.g. as compared to
alternatives,  the lasting impact of the programme on beneficiaries, costs and
financing).<p>
<p>
<b>	Define the evaluation methods to be used that will provide useful ongoing
information to programme providers, as well as methods to be used for the
purpose of summative information for decision-makers. </b> Most evaluations
will require a mix of quantitative and qualitative evaluation methods.  There
are some data that can easily be gathered for quantitative evaluation purposes
(number of children, ages of children, malnutrition rates, height/weight,
characteristics of parents (education, employment), staff/beneficiary ratios,
staff characteristics, etc.  To acquire a more in-depth understanding of the
programme and what it is accomplishing, however, qualitative data are of more
value.  This involves gathering information about attitudes and beliefs.  There
are a variety of instruments and processes that have been developed for the
gathering of both quantitative and qualitative data.  <p>
<p>
	<hr>
<b>Develop Strategies from the Beginning that Assure</b> <b>Programme
Sustainability</b><p>
<p>
	This principle addresses the issue of planning from the beginning to see that
the programme, if successful, will be maintained after the initial investment
is made.  The following should be taken into consideration as the programme is
being conceptualized and developed.<p>
<p>
	<b>Develop stakeholder &#147;ownership&#148; of programmes</b>.   If the
programme is developed with the community, then it is based on their needs.
They have helped to develop what the programme will do and how it will be
implemented.  As a result of this involvement from the beginning, and if the
programme does in fact meet their needs, they will work to find ways for the
programme to continue.  If the programme is handed to them, fully designed and
funded, the community will make use of the programme to the extent that it
meets their needs, but when external financing ends,  the community is unlikely
to make an effort to see that the programme continues.<p>
	<b>Build the capacity of individuals, the community and institutions to
continue the programme</b>.   It takes more than just financial resources to
sustain a programme.  There must be the capacity within the institution
offering the programme to continue to provide quality services.  The building
of institutional capacity may involve creating an NGO if the programme was
started by an individual.  It may involve taking a relatively small NGO and
enlarging it.  This frequently involves shifts in functions and requires
training and other technical supports for those taking on new roles and
responsibilities.<p>
<p>
	<b>Create a financing system for the programme</b>.  Many ECCD programmes
begin as innovative pilot efforts that are funded by external sources --
foundations, donor agencies, bi-lateral agencies, UN organizations and
international NGOs.  Frequently the mandate of these organizations is to
provide funding in the initial stages of a programme&#146;s evolution.  There
is funding for 3-6 years of time.  The expectation is that at the end of that
time period, if the programme has been successful it will have developed
alternative funding sources that will help sustain the work.  Frequently there
is the expectation that the community will fund parts of the programme.  That
is possible in some communities.  But if the ECCD programme is truly reaching
the poorest of the poor, no matter how willing or committed, the community can
provide only a fraction of the real programme costs.  Other possible funders
include the government, non-governmental organizations, and the private sector.
Some programmes even begin their own income-generating activities to subsidize
the programme.  Regardless of the strategy employed, it is most likely to be
successful if planning for the long-term funding of the programme is a part of
the initial programme design process.  It takes time to develop alternative
funding sources.<p>
<p>
	<b>Develop public education and promotional work that supports social adoption
of a service or programme</b>.  Programmes have a much greater possibility of
being sustained if the general public is aware of the programme and what it is
accomplishing.  Thus documentation and evaluation of the effort is critical.
The more that is known about the programme and what it can do, the more likely
it will be continued.  The media and popular press should be provided with
information, they should be invited to visit and feature the programme.
Identify a public figure that believes in the effort and get them to promote
the programme.  We live in a world that is governed by media, so take advantage
of that.<p>
<p>
	<b>Work with policy-makers to ensure the development and implementation of
policy that will create an enabling environment for ECCD programming.</b>  In
many instances exemplary pilot programmes that were well developed and
evaluated have fallen by the wayside because there has not been the political
backing that is necessary to sustain efforts over time.  Appropriate
legislation and policy will help assure programme continuation.  Once again, as
the programme is being designed it should be done with an understanding of
current government policy and how that policy will either support or inhibit
the development of the effort.  If there need to be changes in government
policy then activities related to lobbying and policy development should be
included among programme activities.	<p>

<h1>Program Strategies in Early Childhood Care and
Development </h1><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Programme Approaches</b>:<p>
<p>
	&#147;For too many people, a child development project or programme
immediately conjures up the image of 25 or 30 small children, ages 3 to 5,
playing with blocks or fitting triangles and squares into brightly colored
puzzle boards, supervised by a professional teacher in a &#145;preschool&#146;
classroom. Associating child development with this &#145;preschool&#146; model
is unfortunate because it focuses narrowly on a child&#146;s mental
development, is relatively expensive, and begins late in a child&#146;s life.
It also involves a direct, &#145;institutional&#146; approach, relying on the
creation of centres that &#145;compensate&#146; for missing elements in the
family and community members, while, too often, leaving parents and community
members out of the programme.  This image seldom provides the most appropriate
guide to programming for child care and development in Third World
locations.&#148;  (Myers, The Twelve Who Survive, 1995, pg. 83)<br>
<p>
	Early childhood care and development (ECCD) programmes are much broader than
that--in terms of their purposes, the forms they can take and the potential
beneficiaries.  Within this section a variety of approaches that can be taken
in relation to ECCD will be outlined.<br>
<p>
1. 	<b>Deliver a Service Directly to Children</b>.  This approach focuses
directly on the child from the time the child is born up until school entry age
(0-6/7).  The immediate goal of this approach is to enhance child development
by attending to the immediate needs of children in &#145;centres&#146; outside
the child&#146;s home.  The objectives of these programmes include: child
survival, child care, socialization, overall child development, programmes that
&#145;prepare&#146; children for school, and rehabilitation programmes. These
programmes can be offered in centres designed specifically as a pre-school or
child care centre, but they are also found in a neighbor home, in a community
centre, in the market place and under the trees.   In other words these
programmes can exist anywhere children are brought together in a group.  <br>
<p>
	There are advantages and disadvantages related to the direct provision of
service.  The benefits include:<br>
<p>
<ul>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">direct attention allows programme implementors to know what kinds of services
the child is actually receiving;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">grouping children facilitates protection, health care and nutritional
monitoring;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">for children 3-6/7 years of age it provides them with a chance to socialize
with their peers in ways not possible when they stay at home, preparing them
for socializing within the culture and preparing them for the school
environment;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">it is possible to monitor children&#146;s physical, social, emotional and
cognitive development and plan activities accordingly and to identify children
with special needs;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">centres provide visibility that can be useful politically, both to get
programmes going and to sustain them;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">ECCD centre-based programmes can serve as an entry point into the community to
foster community development objectives.<br>
<p>
</ul>
There are also cautions associated with focusing only on the development and
implementation of programmes for children in centres/groups.  These include:<p>
<p>
<ul>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">increasing the child&#146;s exposure to communicable diseases;<br>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the potential conflict that can occur between home and centre in terms of
language, values and beliefs;<br>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the fact that some parents then turn their children over to the
&#145;experts&#146;, abrogating their responsibility in terms of supporting
children&#146;s growth and development.<br>
</ul>
<p>
Models: Purpose-built centres for young children<br>
	  Family day care where children are provided for in a home in the
neighborhood<br>
	  &#145;Add-on&#146; programmes within community centres, women&#146;s
programmes, health centres,
	         Religious schools<br>
	   <p>
Programme examples: India - ICDS; Peru - PRONOEI; Colombia - Family Daycare
Homes - Homes of Well-Being; Nepal - Entry point project.<p>
<p>
<p>
2.	 <b>Support and Educate Caregivers.</b>  The focus of these programmes is on
those who care for and are responsible for the growth and development of young
children.  Included in these programmes are efforts to support and educate
parents, community members, care providers and/or older children.  The
objective is to create awareness of the importance of the caregivers&#146;s
role in relation to supporting children&#146;s growth and development, and to
change attitudes, beliefs and practices.  Ultimately these programmes empower
caregivers in ways that will improve their care of and interaction with young
children and enrich the immediate environment within which children live.<p>
<p>
	Once again there are benefits and cautions related to these programmes. The
benefits include:<p>
<ul>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">both caregivers and children can benefit from the programme;<p>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">when educating parents their roles and responsibility can be reinforced;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">improvements in development are more likely to be sustained because activities
that promote the child&#146;s development are part of the child&#146;s everyday
life and not provided only for a few hours a day;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">broad coverage can be achieved at relatively low costs;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">ECCD components can be added to existing programmes, for example, literacy
programmes, health centre provision and women&#146;s groups.<br>
</ul>
<p>
In terms of cautions:<p>
<ul>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">to be effective the information provided to caregivers must be timely in
relation to the child&#146;s developmental stage;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">information should be culturally appropriate, building on current beliefs and
practices while adding to caregivers&#146; knowledge;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the teaching/learning process must be participatory, allow for interpersonal
exchange and mutual support;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the education of caregivers is an on-going process; goals are unlikely to be
achieved through a &#145;one-shot&#146; training.<br>
</ul>
<p>
Models: Parent education classes<br>
	  Home Visiting<br>
	  Child-to-Child programmes<br>
	  Literacy programmes with child development content<br>
             Training programmes for those who work in ECCD programmes<br>
<p>
Programme Examples:   Indonesia: BKB; Jamaica - Child-to-Child; China - Parent
Schools; Thailand - Integrated Nutrition and Community Development Project;
Chile- The Parents and Children Programme<p>
<p>
<p>
3. 	<b>Promote Community Development</b>.  Emphasis in these programmes is on
changing conditions within the community that make a difference in terms of
children&#146;s ability to survive and thrive. There is emphasis on building on
community initiative and the empowerment of the community to define its needs
and to develop strategies for meeting those needs.  This can include water and
sanitation projects or other efforts that improve the physical environment and
have an impact on the child&#146;s health, nutrition and general development.
It also includes projects that increase the knowledge and skills base within
the community and the ability of the community to organize around a common
problem.<p>
<p>
	The benefits of such efforts include:<p>
<ul>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the programme impacts on the whole community, enhancing the quality of life
for all community members;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the effects of the programme are likely to be sustainable;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the programme can provide the base for the development of a series of efforts
that will empower the community to act on its own behalf socially and
politically. <br>
</ul>
<p>
The cautions include:<p>
<ul>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the benefits of the programmes may take a long time to or never
&#145;trickle-down&#146; to children;<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">the poorest of the poor may not benefit directly from the programme;<p>
 there is no way to monitor the services children actually receive, nor to
monitor the child&#146;s health, nutritional, and developmental status.<br>
</ul>
<p>
Models: Water and Sanitation Projects<br>
	   Micro-enterprise projects for women <p>
<p>
4. 	<b>Strengthen National Resources and Capabilities.</b> There are many
individuals and agencies/institutions involved in carrying out the approaches
listed above.  In order to do an adequate job, they need financial, material,
and training resources that provide them with the capacity to plan, organize,
implement and evaluate ECCD efforts.  Thus within this category are programmes
that develop institutional and human resource capability.  These include the
training of staff and administrative personnel, the provision of materials, the
upgrading of physical facilities and the introduction of new technologies.<p>
<p>
	The benefits and cautions connected with this strategy and those that follow
(numbers 5, 6, 7, 8,) are all similar.  Basically the strategy is designed to
make a difference in the child&#146;s environment and in the cultural and
political ethos that surrounds families as they raise their children.  It is
difficult to see the impact of these strategies on the lives of specific
children, but there is a strong belief that without these efforts direct
service provision and the work with parents and other caregivers is
unsustainable, and it is difficult for the child to maintain the gains made in
early childhood programmes.<p>
<p>
Models:   <br>
	Training of supervisors, managers and programme developers<br>
	Linkage programmes which upgrade the quality of the primary school and prepare
it to 		receive children with and without prior &#145;pre-school&#146;
experience.<br>
	Providing teachers and caregivers with appropriate materials<br>
	Providing a safe and secure environment within which programmes can be
offered<br>
	Development of  in-country research capability through national and
international training 		and exchanges.<br>
	<p>
5. 	<b>Strengthen Demand and Awareness</b>.  This programme approach
concentrates on getting information on the importance of the early years to a
broad audience, to both raise their awareness and increase the demand for ECCD
services, and create an &#145;enabling environment&#146; for young children and
their families.  The potential audience includes policy-makers and politicians
and the general public, as well as families and communities who could benefit
directly and immediately from ECCD programmes.<p>
<p>
Models: Social marketing<br>
	  Media exposure to concepts and projects (radio, T.V. videos and films)<br>
	  Coalition building/petitioning<br>
	  Linkage to national and international efforts to raise awareness (e.g
Education for All,
		Convention on the Rights of the Child)<br>
<p>
6. 	Develop National Child Care and Family Policies.  Ultimately to make ECCD
programmes sustainable over time it is necessary to have policies in place
which support the development and implementation of ECCD programmes.  Policies
need to be in place that encourage family-sensitive social service delivery
systems and employment.  Thus programmes within this category are focussed on
analyzing current policies and getting involved in the process for creating new
policies if that is required, and/or facilitating the implementation of current
policies that are supportive.<p>
<p>
Models: Participatory policy reviews (Malaysia, Namibia, South Africa)<p>
Creation of policies related to the Convention on the Rights of the Child and a
procedure      to monitor compliance (e.g. National Plans of Action - official
and unofficial)<p>
	Development of Government/NGO and private partnerships from a policy
perspective<p>
	Development of policies that are supportive of women&#146;s participation in
the home and 	     workplace<p>
<p>
7. 	<b>Develop Supportive Legal and Regulatory Frameworks</b>.  There needs to
be a legal framework which allows for the institutionalization of
non-governmental agencies and the private sector to engage in the provision of
programmes that support young children and their families.  Further regulations
need to be established which help govern the implementation of programmes,
serving as one aspect of quality assurance in terms of direct provision.
Programmes within this strategy are designed to increase people&#146;s
awareness of their rights and legal resources, increase the use of ILO
legislation, and increase monitoring of and compliance with international
conventions.<p>
  <p>
Models: Development of regulations/standards for ECCD centre-based programmes
<br>
	Development of creative mechanisms for funding ECCD programmes<br>
               ( Colombia - taxes earmarked for ECCD programmes; Mauritius -
Children&#146;s Fund)<br>
	Develop legal structures that support Government, NGO and private
partnerships<br>
	Development of employee benefits to support male and female responsibilities
within the 	    family (maternal/paternal leave, breast-feeding for working
mothers, child care)<br>
	Development of protective environmental standards<br>
<p>
8. 	<b>Strengthen International Collaboration</b>.  Currently most of the major
international and bilateral donor agencies are involved in funding the
provision of ECCD programmes.  To facilitate the exchange of lessons being
learned, collaborate in terms of programme development and mitigate against the
duplication of efforts, there are formal and informal mechanisms that have been
established that encourage collaboration.  The direct beneficiaries of this
strategy include donor agencies, UN agencies, international NGOs, foundations,
policy-makers and researchers.<p>

<title>Programme Structure</title>
<h1> Programme Structure</h1><p>
<p>
	This section defines the components that need to be considered in creating and
implementing an ECCD programme.  It describes what needs to be put into place
in order to serve the beneficiaries.  Essentially it answers the questions of
<b><i>what </i></b>(curriculum, activities and materials), <b><i>how
</i></b>(the organization of the services and the methodology used with
beneficiaries)<b><i> </i></b>,<b><i> where</i></b> (location and facilities
required), <b><i>when </i></b>(timing of programme activities, daily schedule),
<b><i>who </i></b>(the human resources required for the programme - staffing)
and <b><i>how much</i></b> (costs).  The <b><i>why</i></b> is described in
<A HREF="argu.html">
Arguments in Support of ECCD</A> and the<b><i> who</i></b> in terms
of beneficiaries is described in <A HREF="e13.html">ECCD Programming Principles.</A><p>
<p>
The <b><i>What</i></b> of ECCD Programming<p>
<p>
	The <b><i>What </i></b>of ECCD programming is the curriculum.  We define
curriculum as <i>the plan for providing learning opportunities for the
beneficiaries</i>.  The plan includes a specification of objectives and the
content to be conveyed, and a specification of activities to be undertaken. It
also provides a way to evaluate whether or not the objectives were reached.
This definition of curriculum allows us to talk about the kinds of ECCD
programme opportunities that are planned for parents, children and the
community within various Programme Strategies.<br>
<p>
	Different Programme Strategies require different kinds of curricula.  There
are a variety of curriculum models available for providing services for
children, particularly within the 3-6 age-group.  The best known
internationally are the <u>Montessori</u> and the<u> High/Scope Curriculum</u>
for centre-based programmes.  The <u>Hippy Program</u> is a model used
internationally for home visiting programmes.  All of these have been adapted
for implementation, based on the cultural context.<p>
Some countries provide national curriculum guidelines that can be adapted
locally.  <u>The Kenya Institute of Education Early Childhood Curriculum</u> is
a good example of this.<br>
<p>
	Parent education materials tend to be developed locally, drawing on
information from a wide variety of sources.  The most centralized parent
education curriculum is the Parent School curriculum in China. <br>
<p>
	The curriculum actually delivered through an ECCD programme is dependent on
the objectives of the programme.  For example, if there is a desire to work
with parents and provide them with additional parenting skills, then the
&#147;what&#148; has to do with the kinds of information that you wish parents
to receive.  This may include information on how children grow and develop.  It
might include information on health and nutrition; it might address
socialization issues; it might provide information on quality child care.  The
specific content will depend on the needs that parents have defined for
themselves and the information that professionals think it is important for
parents to receive.<br>
<p>
	There are several marks of a good curriculum.  They include*:<p>
<ul>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Were data reflecting the characteristics of the learners, the social and
cultural milieu, the nature of knowledge and the learning process available to
those planning the curriculum?  How is this reflected in the curriculum?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Are the goals of the programme clearly stated and understood by all concerned?
Are the values and assumptions underlying the goals known?  Are the goals
sufficiently comprehensive, balanced and realistic?  Is there provision for
modifying, dropping and adding goals as needed?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Is the curriculum plan a part of a comprehensive community-wide plan?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Do the learning opportunities anticipate a progression from dependent,
other-directed learning to independent self-directed learning in accordance
with the level of the learner?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Do learners and<i> teachers/caregivers</i> mutually understand the specific
plans in the curriculum that affect them?  Do learners participate, as their
maturities permit, in making the plans?  Do they generally understand and agree
as to what is expected of them, and why?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Is there a clear relationship between the goals and learning activities?  Do
the learning opportunities seem to be the best possible activities for this
group of learners at this time to achieve the agreed-upon goals?  Are all
appropriate and feasible types of learning experiences used?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">To what extent has the curriculum been tailor-made for the learners?  If an
external curriculum is being used has it been adapted to the setting and
characteristics of the learners?  Are the learning opportunities planned truly
relevant to the educational needs of the population and community?  Are
provisions made for the individual differences of learners?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Is the total curriculum plan comprehensive?  Does it define appropriate
teaching methodologies and evaluation as well as include goals and
activities?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Does the group planning the curriculum include all persons concerned,
including the learners, community members and professionals?<br>
 <IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Does the curriculum plan allow for adequate provision for feedback from
learners and other concerned groups as well as the means for making
modifications as needed?<br>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"> Can the curriculum and each of its parts be explained clearly to learners and
others who are impacted by the programme?<br>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*"> Is there a mechanism in place for identifying problems?  Is there a systematic
way of securing, monitoring and reporting action regarding suggestions for
change and innovation?<br>
<IMG SRC="blue.gif" ALT="*">Does the curriculum plan anticipate full use of the resources--within the
programme, community, local and regional government, and beyond--available to
the programme?<br>
</ul>

Planning for Better Teaching and Learning.</b> New York: Holt, Rinehart and
Winston. (Pgs. 48-50)<p>
<p>
<p>
The<b><i> Where</i></b> (location and facilities required) of ECCD Programmes<p>
<p>
 	After determining what it is that will be delivered through the ECCD
Programme (i.e. the combination of health, nutrition, and stimulation for
children, or the kinds of information and experiences desired for parents, or
the activities to be undertaken with the community, etc.) Then the location of
the programme needs to be determined.  Will the programme for children be
offered to children in groups?  If so, where can the group meet?  It may be in
a purpose-built centre for children.  But this is a very expensive alternative.
ECCD programmes can be offered in existing centres or halls, including
community centres and religious centres.  They can be offered in the home of a
community member, in a corner of the market place, or any other place that
children can be gathered together safely, with access to water and sanitation
facilities.<p>
<p>
	Likewise programmes that work with parents and other caregivers can provide
services through a variety of mechanisms.  They can visit parents in their
homes, meet with women in a health centre, set up regular meetings in a
community hall, be affiliated with micro-enterprise projects, etc.  In other
words, these programmes need to be flexible and set up where it is convenient
for the beneficiaries, wherever that might be.<p>
<p>
The <b><i>When </i></b>(timing of programme activities) of ECCD Programmes<p>
<p>
	The when of ECCD programmes takes into consideration the timing of the
programme.  When will it be offered?  For how long?  Over what period of time?
For example, parent education programmes frequently meet over a period of
months, meeting once a week or once a months for 2-3 hours at a time.  The
scheduling of these time-blocks depends on the availability of parents,  the
intensity of the course being offered, the number of facilitators available to
work with the groups, the number of groups that a facilitator is able to lead,
the distance facilitators have to travel to meet with the group, etc.<p>
<p>
	The timing within home visiting programmes is dependent on the balance of a
number of dimensions.  Home visiting programmes may involve 1-2 hours per week
over a year&#146;s period of time.  Less intensive programmes may include home
visits only once a month, with more frequent visits being made for those
families who are in greater need.  The once-a-month visits may be extended over
a two-three year period of time.  The specific structure will be dependent on
the needs of the population being served, the objectives of the programme, the
number of families to be served, the number of families that an individual home
visitor is working with, the number of home visitors available to the programme
given the resources available, etc.<p>
<p>
	Programmes that involve young children directly can also be offered within a
variety of structures.  A common form is full-day child care programmes that
are offered from early in the morning until late in the afternoon/evening,
designed to accommodate the needs of working parents.  For the pre-school aged
child the most prevalent model is a half-day programme, offered five days a
week.  Or the child may attend a programme only two or three times a week.  The
focus of these programmes is generally on socialization and the development of
cognitive and learning skills.  <p>
<p>
The <b><i>How </i></b>(the organization of the services)<b><i> </i></b>of ECCD
Programmes<p>
<p>
	This speaks to the way in which organizations and institutions are organized
to deliver the service.  In some instances new organizations are created,
designed specifically to provide ECCD programmes.  This is a costly
alternative. An effective way to offer ECCD services is to build on what
already exists.  For example, if there is a health centre where women come
regularly to monitor the growth of their child, it is relatively easy to
provide mothers with parenting information during the visits.  This does not
require setting up a separate organization or institution or place to deliver
the service.  It requires working with current programme staff and providing
them with additional skills, knowledge and competencies to enhance what they
are able to provide when they work with parents.<p>
<p>
	In some countries where there is a decreasing population, one consequence is
that there are frequently empty rooms in the primary school, and teachers are
unemployed.  This might be an opportunity to introduce a pre-school programme,
housed in the primary school.  The teachers can be re-trained to work with
younger children.  This option takes advantages of under-utilized resources.
The danger in this situation, however, is that the pre-school can easily become
a scaled-down version of what happens in Primary 1, with inappropriate
activities and teaching methodologies being employed with the young children.<p>
<p>
	While building on existing efforts is a viable alternative, there is a danger
of over-loading the local worker.  An example comes from the Integrated Child
Development Service (ICDS) in India, where, over time, the responsibilities of
Anganwadi Worker, the local woman trained to deliver the services of the
programme, has been increased exponentially.  Every time a new component is
added to the programme the Anganwadi Worker receives additional training and
has to add a new service to the list of things she already does.  She meets
with pregnant women, she provides support in breast feeding, she monitors the
child&#146;s growth and development, she provides the nutritional programme for
the children, she operates the Anganwadi Centre attended by the children...and
she fills out forms and forms and more forms.  She also receives little pay.
Thus the danger of building on current efforts is the exploitation of the local
worker and the dilution of her work to the point where none of the services is
delivered well.<p>
<p>
	Thus there are clearly trade-offs in terms of the value of building on already
existing programmes.  These must be weighed against the costs of creating new
programme structures.<p>
<p>
The <b><i>Who </i></b>(the human resources required for the programme -
staffing) of ECCD Programmes<p>
<p>
	One of the most critical features of ECCD programmes is the people who are
expected to deliver the service--whether that be working directly with
children, working with parents and/or the community, working with the media, or
undertaking advocacy work with the general public and politicians.  Each of
these tasks requires a different set of skills.  Even more than that, they
require different kinds of personalities.  Thus in putting together the
programme, planners need to be clear on the knowledge, skills and the personal
characteristics that will be required to undertake a given set of activities
and seek individuals who fit the right &#145;profile&#146;.   For example, not
every woman is interested in nor has the ability to work with young children,
although that is a common assumption.  <p>
<p>
	In thinking about staffing of programmes there are several dimensions.  First
there is the set of skills and personal characteristics that people bring with
them in relation to the tasks to be undertaken. The profile will be determined
by the roles and responsibilities that individuals will be taking on in
relation to the beneficiaries.  Thus in seeking staff the specific skills,
knowledge and competencies that are desired should be spelled out.  Academic
credentials will give you some information about the person, but hiring should
not be done based on degrees alone.   For example, if one of the objectives of
the programme is to support the development of self-directed learning, then the
candidates one hires must be self-directed learners themselves.  If people are
expected to do advocacy work and work with policy-makers then they must be
people who have the ability to relate to policy-makers in a positive way.  If
awareness-raising is one of the programme objectives then people who have
skills as communicators should be among those hired.<p>
<p>
	 Second, there is a need to plan for the kinds of additional training that
people will require to undertake the task.  On-going staff training is an
important feature of any ECCD programme.  Staff need to be renewed; they need
to be provided with current information; they need to learn new techniques.
But the training should be tailored to the programme and done is a way that
reinforces programme objectives. For example, if staff are given lectures on
methodologies that can be used to foster interaction and group work with
children or adult learners, they will continue to lecture those they work with.
We teach the way we were taught.  So, if you want those working with children
and adults to use more participatory methods in their work, then they must be
trained through participatory methods.<p>
<p>
	Third, there is a need to think about the complementarity of skills, knowledge
and competencies among staff.  The emphasis in ECCD programming is on
participatory development.  The participatory model encourages team work and a
sharing of tasks. Thus one of the things that planners should strive toward, in
hiring staff, is the creation of a team that can work together to accomplish
programme objectives. <p>
<p>
	The team will include those who work with the beneficiaries -- children and/or
adults -- those that provide on-going supervision and support for the
direct-line workers, administrative staff, financial and accounting services,
and consultant services that are required periodically.<p>
<p>
The <b><i>How Much</i></b> (costs and financial resources required) of ECCD
Programmes<p>
<p>
	All of above have implications in terms of costs.  There is a cost to having a
facility within which to operate the programme, there is a cost for each and
every staff person, there are costs associated with the materials that are
needed for use in the programme and for use by those administering the
programme, there are maintenance costs (electricity, water, petrol).  All of
these have to be factored in when determining the costs of a programme.<p>
<p>
	Costs can be divided into two general categories: start-up costs and recurrent
costs.  As the name implies the start-up costs include all those things that
need to happen to get the programme going.  It may include the building or
refurbishing of facilities, the buying of equipment and initial supplies, the
purchase of a vehicle.  These are one-time costs, or at least they are costs
that are not incurred every year.<p>
	Recurrent costs are those costs that are on-going.  You always have to pay
them.  These include staff salaries and benefits, maintenance of the facilities
(heat, water, electricity, taxes), the replenishing of supplies.  In addition
an allocation should be made for on-going training if the programme is going to
continue to develop and not stagnate.  <p>
<p>
	The initial and on-going costs must then be matched with resources--those that
currently exist and those that need to be gathered.  In addition, the costs
should be examined in relation to the benefits that are expected from the
programme.  By taking the total cost of the programme and dividing it by the
number of intended beneficiaries it is possible to derive a cost/beneficiary
figure for the programme.  This calculation should be made in relation to
recurrent costs, since the initial costs of establishing programmes can be
high.  The inclusion of start-up costs in the calculation will produce a much
higher costs-per-child figure and not accurately reflect what is required to
sustain the programme over time.  <p>
<p>
	The actual costs per beneficiary will vary across and within countries based
on the population being served, the cost of living in the area, the type of
staffing required, and the actual services being provided. (For example, a
nutrition component can account for half the per-child costs in a programme.)

Robert G. Myers<p>Consultant to UNICEF *<p><p>September, 1984<P><p>
</center>* This paper has been commissioned by UNICEF.  It is intended to stimulate discussion and does not represent an official position of UNICEF.<p><p>
<p><p><hr>
<center>			                     INTRODUCTION<p></center>
<p>
   The main purpose of this paper is to provide a basis for discussing issues
associated with the process of "Going to Scale"(1) with programmes of early
childhood development. Section I will summarize results from three analyses of
successful projects and programmes in an attempt to identify barriers toscale
and to specify conditions, characteristics, strategies and processes
accompanying successful programmes. A second section will examine advantages
and drawbacks of three broad approaches to achieving scale. The third section
will draw implications for child development programmes from the preceding two
sections. The final section will discuss costs, organizational issues, the role
of communications, evaluation, and some options for international organizations
as they consider ways to increase the coverage and impact of early childhood
development programmes.<p>
<p>
   National governments and international development organizations are, for
humanitarian, political and economic reasons, interested in reaching as many
people as possible with the services or self-help programmes they promote or fund.(2) One measure of success for development
organizations is whether or not programmes they have assisted can and do grow
beyond restricted pilot projects to touch the needy, wherever they may be
found.(2)<p>
   There are at least two reasons why "Going to Scale" has recently become of
increasing interest to international agencies. First, some organizations have
placed their institutional prestige on the line by committing themselves to
programmes promising nationwide or even worldwide coverage and impact. Primary
Health Care for all by the year 2000 is an example. The "Child Survival and
Development Revolution," promising dramatic reductions in mortality and
morbidity, is another. These commitments, made in part to stir enthusiasm,
mobilize demand and spur action, bring with them also a responsibility to mount
the sustained operations necessary to accomplish these large goals - or at least to show major progress toward them. If that does not happen, these
successful and inspiring communication efforts will be interpreted as hollow
public relations ploys.(3)<p>
    A second reason for the increasing interest in analysing and understanding
what is necessary to mount large-scale programmes is a growing frustration within organizations whose small scale
research, pilot or demonstration projects have failed to have an impact on
policy and programming over the years, often despite their successful outcomes.
That frustration is not confined to organizations with small budgets that
depend on others to pick up and utilize ideas and methods on a large scale.
Rather, governments and larger development organizations have also experienced
problems repeatedly, as they have tried unsuccessfully to bring pilot projects
"out of the hot-house".<p>
<ul>	         "How many times during the last three decades of intensive
development efforts has a demonstration or pilot project provided 'the answers'
to a development problem? Everyone is flushed with enthusiasm and optimism. The
model that proved so successful on a small scale is expanded with the hopes of
benefitting a larger portion of the population. All too often, however, impact
decreases or disappears completely." (Pyle, p. 1)<p></ul>
<p>
         The problems associated with going to scale are common to many fields.
This paper, while drawing broadly on experiences in such diverse areas as
family planning, literacy and irrigation, will emphasize multi-dimensional,
community-based, and participatory programmes directed toward improving the intellectual,
social, and emotional development of poor children, ages O-5 in the Third World.<p>
   Child development projects and programmes vary widely depending on social
and economic conditions, the mix of programme components, the age group, the
institutional structure of planning and implementation, and the degree of
community involvement sought and the methods used to deliver the service.
Approaching scale will obviously be different if a programme focusses on
physical development and on immunization in a small country where the
population has a relatively high literacy rate, than if it attempts to build a
sustained, community-based service including health, nutrition, and psycho-social
components in a large country with a relatively low literacy rate.<p>
<p>
<center><u>		            I. REASONS FOR PROGRAMME FAILURE AND SUCCESS: A Review</center></u><p>
<p>
    Compiling reasons why there may not be "Life After Project" (Pyle, 1984)
does not require a major research project. With little effort, for instance, a
useful list of possible reasons emerged from conversations with a handful of
UNICEF, USAID, and World Bank field staff about why projects fail to "go
toscale".<p>
<ul>	<li>Funds for the larger effort were not available (or were cut off).<p>
		<li>Political commitment was missing.<p>
		<li>The social organization and participation that helped make community-based
pilot models work was too threatening when contemplated on a larger scale.<p>
		<li>The demonstration model that was successful in one region did not work in
other locations.<p>
		<li>It was difficult to hold people accountable.<p>
		<li>The organizational base was inadequate to support large scale programmes, and
expansion occurred too fast for the needed changes to take place.<p>
		<li>The "mystique" associated with an original project did not transfer as the
programme grew.<p>
		<li>The charismatic, dedicated leadership that accounted for so much of the small-scale
success could not be cloned.<p>
		<li>Squabbling among regional groups took its toll.<p>
		<li>Administrative methods were not in place.<p>
		<li>Bureaucratic territoriality and malaise undercut good intentions.<p>
		<li>Information about the pilot projects was not available at the proper time and
in the proper form to the people who counted.<p>
		<li>Response by the people to the programme was slow and no attempt was made to
mobilize them, to gain real participation and involvement.</ul><p>
<p>
    The reasons fall into four general categories: resource constraints, lack
of political commitment at various levels, weak demand for services, and
organizational, implementation, and management problems. Readers will certainly
be able to add to the list based on their own experience.<p>
   More difficult than listing potential causes for <u>failure</u> is the task of
discovering what accounts for<u> successful</u> attempts to "move to scale". How, for
instance, have successful programmes coped with the leadership question and
overcome the potential problem arising from natural limits on charismatic
leadership? Have successful programmes always started on a small scale and
grown large slowly? How have successful large scale programmes coped with
diversity? Is it possible to identify commonalities among programmes that have
successfully "scaled up"? Under what conditions is "participation" really
necessary for the successful spread of a project? How is demand created?<p>
   Relatively few projects have been evaluated systematically as they have
grown into programmes. And, relatively little energy has been devoted to
documenting the process of arriving at solutions to the organizational,
administrative, and management problems facing most projects as they increase
in size. Fortunately, however, experience is growing and lessons have been
extracted from case studies by several authors. Here we will summarize results
from reviews and analyses of successful projects and programmes by three
authors: David Korten, Samuel Paul and David Pyle.<p>
<center><u>	 A. Korten: Lessons from Five Asian Success Stories</center></u><p>
    David Korten examines five extremely varied Asian prograrames(4) in his well-known
paper on Community Organization and Rural Development (Korten,1980). Each
programme began on a relatively small scale as a community-based
project and grew significantly in size.<p>
      From his analysis, Korten concludes:<p><ul>
	1.<u> There is no blueprint.</u> Each project was successful because it had worked
out a programme model responsive to the beneficiary needs at a particular time
and place and each had built a strong organization capable of making the
prograrmne work. (p. 495)<p>
<p>
	2.<u> "Successful transition from project to programme is associated with a
learning process</u> in which villagers and programme personnel shared their
knowledge and resources to create a programme which achieved a fit between
needs and capacities of the beneficiaries and those of the outsiders who were
providing the assistance" (p. 497) "The learning process approach calls for
organizations that: (a) embrace error; (b) plan with the people; and (c) link
knowledge building with action." (p. 498)<p>
<p>
	3.<u> The roles of researchers, planners, and administrators were combined</u> in a
single individual or a closely knit team so that "Even as the organizations
grew, the mode of operation stressed integration. Researchers worked hand-in-hand
with operating personnel, and top management spent substantial time in the
field keeping in contact with operations."(p. 499)<p>
<p>
	4.<u> The organizational capacity developed in the pilot projects was preserved
and drawn on as expansion occurred.</u> "The individuals who had created and
sustained the fit were assigned to guide the learning experiences of others
until they too gained the knowledge, commitment, and skills to make the
programme work. As the programme moved into new communities, new lessons were
learned, including lessons on how to maintain the fit between programme and
people as the organization expanded. New knowledge and the organizational
capacity to put it to work were created simultaneously by one and the same
process." (p. 499)</ul><p>
<p>
    Later in the paper, three stages in the learning process identified by
Korten will be sketched.<p>
<p>
<center><u>	    B. Paul: The Lessons of Success</center></u><p>
    Echoing Korten in several respects is an analysis by Samuel Paul of six
successful national development programmes in Asia, Africa, and Latin
America.(5) Paul's study also emphasizes the importance of organization and
management variables as a necessary complement to political commitment and to
availability of resources. Despite their diversity of the sectors and
countries, the successful programmes studied by Paul had in common:<p><ul>
	1.<u> A marriage of planning with implementation.</u> Programme managers were
included in the formulation of programme strategies. Successful prograrmnes
avoided the tendency to import programme strategies or formulate them through
internal groups without any reference to those    likely to manage them.
Therefore, strategy and implementation were not disjointed and were mutually
adaptive.<p>
	2.<u> Political commitment</u> was evident in a degree of flexibility and
organizational autonomy given to programme leaders by the government.<p>
	3.<u> Selectivity.</u> Initial focus on a single goal or service was followed by
sequential diversification.<p>
	4.<u> Organizational networking.</u> Even single services require complex integration
of diverse inputs and required skillful coordination of efforts at national,
district, and community levels. That was best accomplished by relying on inter-organizational
cooperation through networks rather than on hierarchical control.<p>
	5.<u> Deliberate linkages between pilot projects and national programmes.</u> Pilot
projects were used as learning experiences.<p>
	6.<u> Phased programme implementation.</u> Phasing development programmes in
geographic or functional terms is an adaption to the uncertainty, diversity,
and scope of the environment and to the lack of techno-managerial
resources. It also serves as a means by which programmes can successfully build
on experience.<p>
	7.   <u> Mobilizing demand</u> was an important feature of programming.<p>
	8.  <u>  Simple information systems</u> with fast feedback were developed and used.<p>
	9.  <u>  Flexible selection and training processes</u> were used.</ul><p>
    The role of national governments in successful programmes involved:<p>
<p><ul>
	a.    Specifying broad objectives and providing resources.<p>
	b.    Bringing programme planning and implementation together by establishing
the programme agency, making the key appointments before formulating the
programme, and allowing discretion to the appointed leaders in both formulation
and implementation.<p>
	c.    Helping monitor progress and performance.<p>
	d.    Providing stability, commitment, and continuity of programme leadership
(continuity and commitment by leadership were more important than charisma).<p>
</ul><p>
According to Paul, programmes differed in: Their approaches to participation,
the nature of the functional and vertical integration, the degree of
decentralization, and the mix of incentives used to motivate beneficiaries. For
instance, whereas economic incentives work well for programmes with economic
goals, non-economic incentives (recognition, status, a sense of challenge) are more important in
social programmes.<p>
   Variation in the critical interventions from one programme to another
depended on the complexity of the environment (in terms of scope, uncertainty
and homogeneity) and whether single or multiple goals were sought.(6)<p>
<center><u>	            C. David Pyle: An analysis of 7 Indian Experiences</center></u><p>
    In his draft manuscript, "Life After Project", David Pyle attacks directly
the question of moving to scale. He examines seven successful pilot projects
carried out in the Indian state of Maharashtra first in terms of what he calls
a "rational actor model", and then from organizational and political
perspectives. The "rational actor analysis" emphasizing inputs and cost
effectiveness, is inadequate according to Pyle. Its assumption - that increasing inputs and solving technical problems will be sufficient to
bring about the desired results - is faulty. More  important, he suggests, are the organizational and political
dimensions of projects.<p>
    Focussing on the process of implementation, Pyle draws an ideal type from
the seven small-scale projects. Comparing the small scale project with the extension to large scale
programmes, he finds the following organizational deviations from the ideal.<p>
   Pyle adds a political analysis to his organizational review by examining
commitment, and accountability, how programmes relate to the structure of
interest groups, and the degree of self-sufficiency
sought. <u>Commitment</u> is evident in policy statements, budget allocations,
motivations, and the willingness to make needed structural reforms. This last
indicator of commitment is seldom present. Needed structural reforms run
counter to too many vested interests. The commitment to needed decentralization
reforms, for instance, requires an unusually strong and secure central
government.<p>
In most settings the structure and influence of interest groups favor those who
are urban, educated, and established professionals. Accountability is affected
by how precisely goals are stated, how monitoring is set up and how training
occurs.<p>
    The political analysis of programmes, in terms of the self-sufficency
sought for/by beneficiaries, quickly exposes the potential political threats
that can accompany programmes promoting participation and involvement. Pyle
suggests there is a need for more precise definition of what is meant by
community participation "so that we can distinguish real community involvement
from community-based service delivery". (p 219). He notes that an active role by the community in
all phases of a project or programme, however desirable, may be idealistic and
unrealistic.<p><ul>
	    "The important thing to remember is that while community participation and
involvement have definite advantages and benefits for all concerned (e.g.
increased control for the community and decreased economic and administration
role for the bureaucracy), it is not always required to achieve impressive
impact".<p></ul>
<p>
    In the above discussion what emerges as the preferred approach to achieving
scale successfully is a rather deliberate focussed, phased approach beginning
with a single service, then adding on. It is an approach requiring not only
political commitment and resources, but also flexibility, time for learning and
adjustment, teamwork, and innovative and continuous leadership capable of
fitting programmes to existing environmental, organizational, and resource
conditions/constraints even while trying to change them. Pilot or demonstration
projects linked specifically to plan for expansion are seen as potentially
important, not only to work out technical details but also as a training ground
for those who will follow a programme to scale and as a source of information
that can help gain or sustain commitment.<p>
    Before falling into the trap of accepting a new "blueprint", albeit one
that emphasizes flexibilty and learning,  we should consider alternatives to
the phased, flexible, learning-oriented
approach to achieving scale described above. In the following section, three
approaches are distinguished.<p>
	<center><u>	                               II.ACHIEVING SCALE</center></u><p>
   There are at least three ways to approach scale -- by expansion, explosion, or association. Scale through <u>expansion</u> begins
typically with one model which is tested on a small scale, adjusted, and then
extended (usually with further adjustment) to other locations until the desired
coverage has been attained. Scaling up through <u>explosion</u> by-passes
the pilot stage. Programme implementation starts on a large scale usually with
one model serving all parts of a nation.A process of local adjustment and
filling in may occur after an initial explosion in order to make the programme
more responsive to diverse social needs and to intensify coverage in some areas
"covered" in the original burst, but in a token way. An association mode
achieves scale by adding up coverage obtained in several distinct (and not
necessarily coordinated) projects or programmes, each responding to the needs
of a distinct part of the total population served.<p>
    The conceptual distinctions made above blur in practice. Expansion to large
scale may, for instance, be programmed over such a short time after the initial
model has been tried out successfully that it is, in effect, an explosion. Or
expansion might occur as several very different models are tried out and
applied successively within different parts of a country. In that case the
result approximates scale achieved by associating different models.
Nevertheless, distinguishing the three approaches is useful because each
requires different pre-conditions
for success and is related to differences in timing, organizational needs,
learning potential, initial costs, and other features.<p>
	 <b>   A.   <u>  Scale by Expansion</u></b><br>
         Virtually all the cases of successful programmes reviewed by the
three authors summarized in the previous section would be characterized as part
of a process of expansion.  Ideas were developed first on a relatively small
scale and expansion occurred in stages with adjustments based on learning from
experience along the way.<p>
    In the expansion that characterizes a "learning process approach", Korten
suggests that programme development proceeds, ideally, through three stages,
each emphasizing a different learning task. In the first stage,
the major concern is with <u>learning to be effective.</u> In this stage,efficiency
and coverage are low, and errors may be high. "The programme begins to make a
transition to Stage 2 when it is found to be effective in responding to an
identified need and it achieves an acceptable level of fit between
beneficiaries, the working programme model, and the capabilities of  the action
research team." (p. 500) In the Stage 2, major concern shifts to <u>learning to be
efficient</u> - to "reducing the input requirements per unit of output."  Modest programme
expansion during Stage 2 will increase the cadre of persons experienced in
making the programme work and who are available to help build the expanded
organizational capacity of Stage 3 in which emphasis is on <u>learning to expand</u>
and on organizational capacity (rather than programme). Constant attention to
ensuring an acceptable level of fit (among organization, programme, and
beneficiaries) will mean some inevitable sacrifice in effectiveness and
efficiency. The rate of expansion will be governed largely by how fast the
necessary organizational capabilities can be developed to support it. Once
Stage 3 has been completed, the organization may turn to the solution of new
problems.<p>
<p>
    The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) of India is probably the
main example of a national programme that is large-scale
and explicitly a child development programme. The ICDS has followed an
expansion approach, beginning in 1975 on an experimental basis in 33 of India's
5,000 or more administrative blocks (UNICEF, ICDS, 1984). By 1985, the
programme was scheduled to be in effect in 1,000 administrative blocks through
the nation. The ICDS system (7) takes a holistic approach to child development
and is a valiant attempt to orchestrate services for the benefit of poor
children and their families. Poor blocks have been chosen for participation in
the programme. Within each block, all children under age 6 are eligible; no
particular attempt is made to select children "at risk". This more democratic
view contrasts with, for instance, a model used in the nutrition
supplementation programme being carried to scale in the Indian state of Tamil
Nadu, in which only children "at risk" are provided supplementary feeding.<p>
   The ICDS programme, although launched on a relatively (for India) small
scale has expanded quickly. The opportunity to learn along the way has been
present, but there seems to be relatively little room for adjustment in the
basic ICDS model. A true "learning process approach" does not seem to have
taken hold and means are needed to make adjustments in the on-going
programme. A case study of the ICDS experience would be instructive.<p>
	<b>   B. <u>Scale by Explosion</u></b><br>
         The "big bang" approach to scale is usually the product of a national
political decision, often motivated by a desire to gain broad political support
or to build goodwill. Maximum coverage is sought in the shortest period
possible. In such cases, programmes are centrally conceived, and organized,
even though community participation and popular education may be considered
central elements of the programme philosophy. A "blueprint" approach is taken
in which the same model is applied to all parts of a country or region.<p>
    Once a national political decision has been taken, development
organizations and implementing agencies move to take advantage of the political
moment, even while recognizing potential problems associated with attempting to
do too much too fast. The quality of the service delivered may  be sacrificed
in order to attain greater coverage as quickly as possible. Demand mobilization
is a crucial element in scale by explosion. By quietly establishing a large
programme, organizations hope to secure resources not previously available and
to gain a mortgage on the future thereby turning an immediate action with short
run results into a longer-run
programme with continuing benefits.<p>
    If judged from the organizational viewpoint presented in the previous
pages; an explosion approach might appear undesirable. It does not embody a
learning process nor allow organizational and management capabilities to adjust
with the expanding programme. It seems guaranteed to overload the system and to
open up accountability problems. However, there are circumstances in which such
an approach to scale appears not only to be justified but successful.
Programmes can successfully explode on the scene if they concentrate on one
developmental component or idea, and are directed at a goal that is easily
articulated, understood, and achieved.  Indeed, the enthusiasm and energy
created as part of the explosion will be a major contributing factor to
success.<p>
	  A successful explosion to scale is probably best illustrated by immunization
and literacy campaigns. Colombia, for instance, has recently completed an
immunization campaign raising coverage dramatically. The literacy campaigns in
Cuba (1961) and Nicaragua (1980) were clearly-focussed
national campaigns producing excellent results in a short period. Although
campaigns can achieve short-term
success, the problem, of course, is to capitalize on that success to build the
lasting programmes required to maintain the gains. No matter how successful
immunization campaigns may be,  for instance, they must avoid building an
"innoculation mentality" about organization.<p>
    The Mexican "Programme of Development for Children Ages 0-5
Through Parents and Community Members" (Mexico Sept, 1983) provides a somewhat
different example of scale by explosion. That programme was not a campaign but
was initiated simultaneously in rural areas in all Mexican States in 1983. It
did not pass through a pilot stage.(8) The programme illustrates the
"blueprint" approach criticized by Korten and Paul. One model was used for all
parts of the country and one set of materials and a manual served  equally for
all.(9)  To serve multiple goals -nutrition, health, and early education --
the Secretariat of Education did not formulate new programmes in  each area
but, rather, sought collaboration (networking in Sanruel Paul's terms) with the
Ministries of Health, Agriculture, and Culture, and with the Post-Literacy
Programme of the National Institute for Adult education.  As is so often the
case, the "national" programme covered a relative small fraction of those in
need (150,000 of the estimated 14,000,000 children under age six  were
included). The programme is being touted as a success. However, it will need to
adjust as it continues and as it grows. If that happens, it will provide
evidence that a programme can, without having passed through a pilot stage,
adapt successfully. The case deserves to be followed closely.<p>
    Not all cases of scale by explosion are national programmes born of
political expediency. The regional primary health care programme launched in
Sine-Saloun,
Senegal with funding from USAID is a variation on the theme.(10) That "all-or-nothing"
project was directed at 880,000 rural inhabitants and launched without a test
run( (Gaspari, p. 19)<p>
 <b>    C.<u> Scale by Association.</u></b><br> In this mode, scale is achieved by adding
together results of projects each of which is relatively small-scale,
each  initiated and/or carried out independently, and each approaching the
problem  in its own way. Although a central government might set general
guidelines  and provide some incentives, it does not dictate how coverage is to
be  achieved.<p>
     It is not unusual, for instance, for several nutritional supplementation
programmes to be operating in a country at one time, each linked to a separate
source of food, and to separate financing. The programmes may be directed to
the same or to different target populations. For practical reasons, a
government may assign geographic areas to each programme. Taken  together the
different programmes may amount to large-scale
national coverage even though no one programme is national in scope, and even
though the type of coverage, delivery system, and even type of food varies from
place to place.<p>
    In nations that are themselves loose confederations of distinct cultural
groups, achieving scale by association may be a practical and desirable
approach. It would allow each programme to work with a relatively homogenous
population, respond to particular needs, and make the adjustments necessary to
mount an effective programme with that group. As suggested in Pyle's political
analysis, centralized bureaucracies are, however, often reluctant to allow too
much independence of action in precisely such situations - particularly if sub-scale
programmes are community-based
and participatory.<p>
   The idea that relatively independent groups should develop and carry out
their own programming (within general guidelines) has about it an air of "free
enterprise". That need not be the guiding philosophy, however, as illustrated
by the Indian National Adult Education Campaign (NAEC). The NAEC was government
initiated and guided. It was constructed on a philosophy closer to Paolo
Freire's consciousness raising than on a production-oriented
basis. A programme of the Janata Party, NAEC was a politically-motivated
attempt to go to scale quickly with a programme that would give the party
credibility and support following its defeat of Mrs. Ghandi in 1977. The
distinguishing feature of the unusually flexible, decentralized and varied
approach to literacy, was its support for the many PVOs which were already
providing adult education, each in its own way, in different parts of the
country and to different groups. A pre-conceived
notion of how literacy and adult education should be delivered was not imposed.
Modest amounts of money were to be used to assist the various groups in small
ways that made a difference. Scale was conceived as the sum of the efforts of
these groups.<p>
   Scale by association may occur more by chance than by planning. However,
national governments and international organizations can contribute to that by
providing funds for distinct approaches to a problem. In the best of worlds,
simultaneous funding of different approaches leads to"creative competition"
among programmes, with broad benefits and extended coverage. In the worst
cases, scarce funds are squandered and scarce human resources are destructively
pulled in several directions by conflicting demands and models reducing
potential coverage and impact.<p>
<p>
<center><u>		           GOING TO SCALE WITH CHILD DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES</center></u><p>
<p>
    Several statements about the process of early childhood development will
help draw out implications from the previous two sections for that area of
programming.<p>
	1. Development occurs as a child's combined physical, psychological, and
social needs are met. Psycho-social
needs should not be dealt with separately from physical needs. The truly
integrated nature of early development places a strain on programming large
scale activities which, as we have seen, tend to work best when concentrating
on one problem. The current attention to child survival responds to only part
of the development problem, focussing on physical needs of young children, but
often neglecting the psycho-social
dimension. How to promote psycho-social
development in the context of attempts to go to scale with programmes of health
and nutrition is an important question.<p>
	2. Child development needs vary according to the socio-economic
circumstances and cultural patterns surrounding the child. Needs vary also by
age. There is, therefore, no formula for programming that is equally applicable
in all locations, This suggests that an explosion model will be difficult to
apply to promoting healthy child development on a large scale.<p>
	3. Improvements in the psycho-social
development of children do not, particularly in the period from O to 2 years of
age, require investments in institutionalized services. The problem is more one
of education or motivation of family and community members than it is one of
infrastructure. A new water system or a cold chain or an insecticide is not
needed.<p>
	4. In one respect the technology of early childhood development is extremely
simple; healthy and supportive forms of interaction between caregivers and
children do not require fancy activities or expensive toys. In another respect,
the technology is underdeveloped. An effective equivalent of the growth chart
does not yet exist to help caregivers diagnose what is best for a given child,
or to tell when a child needs special attention. Such devices as the Denver
scale exist and have been tried out in some locations of the Third World. The
"Portage Project" has developed a set of diagnostic cards related to
stimulation activities and has experimented with versions in four languages in
several parts of the developing world. Baby books have been created that help
parents tract their child's developmental progress. Simple toys abound. Still,
the technology needs experimentation and adjustment.<p>
	5. National commitment to early childhood development is extremely varied, but
in most countries early development programmes are not now a high priority.
Appreciation of the need for attention to the psycho-social
part of child development is growing, often as part of the attention to child
survival or in line with growing needs for child care (related to increasing
urbanization and increased participation of women in the labor force). The
lower priority given to child development suggests a need for mobilization of
political will and/or an approach that builds directly on existing institutions
and/or customs.<p>
	6. For children ages 3 to 5, an unusual range of institutional experiments are
being tried out in many different socio-economic contexts providing an
excellent opportunity to learn from the experience. The variety of needs and of
models suggests an association approach to scale.<p>
<p>
	<center><u>				 IV. ISSUES</center></u><p>
<p>
    Any effort to go to scale raises a number of basic issues. In this paper,
and as a backdrop for discussion in the meeting, we will highlight five issues:
cost, organization, the role of communications, evaluation, and the role of
international assistance agencies.<p>
	<center>		1.<u> Costs: What are the Costs of Going to Scale and Who Bears Them?</u></center><br>
         To "Go-to-Scale", low-cost
programmes are required. That is the prevailing practical doctrine. Integrated
services, appropriate technologies, volunteerism, para-professionals,
and community participation are all part of the quest for affordable, effective
programmes that can be extended widely. However, whether or not low cost
programmes can be achieved that function on a large scale and that are
effective is still an open question. Evidence is thin. With respect to primary
health care, for instance, a study of 52 programmes by the American Public
Health Association concluded that, "Although the stated intention of all the
programmes is to provide low-cost,
affordable health care, this study yielded little evidence that would indicate
whether such can or cannot be delivered". (APHA, p. 77) The recent UNICEF paper
to the Executive Board, which included a review of 42 projects, concluded that
"the projects do not shed much light on the important questions of costs".
(UNICEF, p. 26)<p>
    Large scale programmes tend to spread resources so thinly, for political
reasons and/or in an attempt to keep per capita costs low, that programmes run
the risk of producing massive waste because they are of such low quality.<p>
    It is often assumed that the process of going to scale will bring with it
&#147;economies of scale". However, "While many planners 'intuitively feel'
that economies of scale exist with respect to their particular projects, there
is no conclusive evidence on this topic." (Gaspari, p.12). Increased coverage
may reduce purchase costs. Programme success on an expanding scale can reduce
other costs as, for instance, when a targeted nutrition programme reduces
malnutrition and leads to less need for food supplementation. A case in point
is the Tamil Nadu nutrition programme. However, as a programme expands, it is
likely to cover those who are more and more difficult to reach, (geographically
and culturally) creating higher costs of training, supervision, education,
transportation, and administration. The issue then becomes one of equity rather
than of costs. Commitment to equity is severely tested in a circumstance when
costs are relatively high as they may be for programmers aspiring to full scale
coverage.<p>
    One reason for analyzing costs is simply to project what resources will be
necessary to move to scale. Often, however, such projections are results of
crystal ball gazing. Accurate data are not available on which to base
projections. Variations in costs from country to country or district to
district make working with averages difficult. And, the assumptions required to
make the projections are heroic. (See, for example, the global projections by
David Parker, undertaken for UNICEF). In general, "Initial assumptions about
projects are often overly optimistic and costs are underestimated". (APHA, p.
78). Although some good work has been done to estimate costs for multi-goal
programmes at a point in time (Cornia, 1984) the need for systematic analysis
is still great.<p>
    In this discussion, the question of costs is of interest not only from the
standpoint of overcoming resource constraints but also from the point of view
of strategy and organization.  The choice is not only between low-cost and high
cost alternatives, but involves also decisions about who will bear the costs.
Will community members, or government, or an international agency shoulder most
of the cost burden? If the community bears the cost, how is participation in
the service affected? When does shifting the burden to the community move
beyond an expectcd and desirable contribution that can be labelled "self-help",
become a form of exploitation?  How does who bears the costs relate to control
over strategic decisions? These questions are rarely asked.<p>
    The resources contributed by communities are usually underestimated and so,
therefore, are the real costs of a programme.<p><ul>
	"The thought that community participation does not cost anything must be
abandoned. In fact programmes based on community participation are not
inexpensive. To begin with, because untrained and unskilled village workers are
the basic service deliverers, their training needs are considerable. Training
becomes a continuous affair which is combined with strong supervision. Thus,
the intermediate supervision level must be intensive and capable". (Pyle)<p></ul>
Before accepting volunteer and para-professional
solutions as truly low-cost
alternatives, therefore, closer analysis is needed of costs in relation to
effects.<p>
<p>
	<center>		2.<u> Organization: Participation and Integration</u></center><p>
    The analyses in Section I pointed to a host of organizational issues. In an
important way they provide a challenge to two of the most basic assumptions in
today's development doctrine -- the assumed need for "integrated basic services", and for commnunity
participation. Successful larger scale programmes seem to begin with single
service strategies.  Multi-service
strategies can easily overload the delivery system leading to failure. Indeed,
the concept of "converging services" seems to be more appropriate to most
environments than that of "integrated services", particularly as programmes go
to scale. The <u>integration</u> of components necessary to make a particular service
function seems best achieved by establishing communication channels among
existing organizations rather than by "integrating" participants in a new
organization. These observations have particular importance for programming to
promote child development, which is, by nature, multi-dimensional.<p>
   While pointing to the need for and importance of community participation,
the authors point out that successful programmes have not necessarily required
continuing involvement in the management and local control of programmes. On a
larger scale, deep and continual involvement become more and more difficult to
achieve.<p>
    That position is supported by the APHA review of projects:<p><ul>

	"Although participation is important for reasons of equity, its value in
improving health is not clear from the projects reviewed. However, available
evidence suggests most ministries of health do not have the ability (financed
or organizational) to undertake the direct task of delivery health services and
mobilizing communities for more than routine programme-supported
activities". (p. 17).</ul><p>
    There is a need to untangle the participation question, accept
participation as a goal, and seek it. But without major changes in the
attitudes and structures of most governments, and without a radical shift in
recruitment policies in order to identify a new type of technician sensitive to
community needs and problems, community participation will remain an empty
slogan.<p>
<p>
	<center>		3. <u>The Role of Communication</u></center><p>
   Mobilizing demand emerges clearly from the review of successful projects as
an important element in going to scale. Social marketing to create demand can
be applied at the highest levels of government and can also be used to empower
local people with knowledge. In the case of child development, the educational
messages used to mobilize demand may themselves have an effect on child
development, whether or not a "service" emerges.<p>
    The potential force of the communications industry requires careful
monitoring. With respect to child development, the social marketer should be
sensitive to existing patterns of child rearing, reinforcing effective patterns
rather than trying to introduce new practices that may be unfamiliar
and no more effective.<p>
<p>
	<center>		4.<u> Evaluation</u></center><p>
    From the analysis of successful programmes comes a bias against forms of
evaluation that are linked to a "blueprint" and that do not allow for changing
goals and processes as programmes develop. Over the last ten years, that
position has grown increasingly strong. With it is often associated a reaction
against surveys, closed-ended
questionnaires with pre-set
questions, and statistical analyses based on linear assumptions. Slowly,
ethnographic methods and "illuminative evaluation" have claimed their place in
the evaluation repertoire as part of a general shift toward participatory
research and evaluation.<p>
   The technology and methods of evaluation should not be the main issue,
however. A wide range of well-developed
and validated techniques and methods are being applied successfully to evaluate
development projects and programmes -- from cost-effectiveness
to anthropological studies. Whether a "traditional" or "non-traditional"
method is chosen from among this range is not the question. Survey methods, for
instance, can play a useful role in evaluations by project members designed to
provide a project with immediate feedback for policy purposes or in more
participatory evaluation involving villagers and designed to help change their
behavior. Ethnographic methods can be useful to help interpret data gathered in
a large-scale
project directed to very specific goals. What is important is that the
technique be matched to evaluation goals and user needs, and that biases be
recognized and stated. If more than one method can be applied in the same
project evaluation, so much the better.<p>
   More important than the choice of evaluation methods are choices related to
the organization and use of evaluation, beginning with the question of who is
to be involved in the evaluation process. Two basic observations may help
thinking about organizational and user issues in evaluation. First, the most
immediate users of evaluation results are likely to be those who have
participated in obtaining the results. Second, use of evaluation results should
not be considered as something that happens only <u>after</u> an evaluation has been
completed, rather it can occur during the process, leading to changes in the
evaluation. If these observations are accepted, they lead to organization of
evaluation in a way that will directly involve the users of evaluation results
from the beginning. It responds to Korten's and Paul's observations that, in
successful programmes, planning, evaluation, and implementation were not
divorced -- that the same individuals were involved in all, or that closely knit teams were
organized.<p>
    The role of an evaluator in a learning process approach is "that of an
enabler, suggesting hypotheses, sharpening the project's focus, indicating
appropriate methods, building up local capacity through training" (van Leer,
<u>Summary</u>, p.5).<p>
    Evaluation directed at project improvement and training is a labor
intensive task.  Paralleling the programme suggestion that a new type of
technician is needed to work with communities in implementing programmes that
are community-based,
there is need for a new type of evaluator who can work with villagers and local
programme staff. That may be feasible as well as desirable within pilot
projects, but labor-intensive,
participatory evaluation becomes an expensive and potentially difficult
strategy as projects go to scale. As programmes grow larger, the need to tie
evaluation ever more closely to monitoring systems providing quick feedback on
carefully selected variables grows apace.<p>
   Twb other suggestions about the evaluation process arise from the earlier
review.<p>
	1. Attention should be given to the political dimensions of policy and
implementation. This cannot be done in an overly empirical way. However, it is
possible to establish scales for rating policy formation, development, and
implementation. Pyle and Wallerstein (in Sahn, 1984), for instance, suggest
criteria for examining infrastructure, the degree of self-reliance,
support from political elites, a results orientation, and the results of
"targeting".<p>
	2. Process documentation, although sometimes tedious, is needed.<p>
<p>
	<center>		5.<u> The Role of International Assistance Agencies</u></center><br>
    In the preceding analyses of programme implementation, the authors pose a
major challenge to the international development community. Korten concludes,
for instance, that: "In general, the need is for a flexible, sustained,
experimental, action-based capacity-building
in a style of assistance which most major donors are ill-equipped
to provide." (p. 484) To move toward the learning process approach, he goes on
to suggest that:<p>
	1. Donors might view pilot projects as a kind of venture capital investment in
which only 10-20
percent of the projects funded would be expected to succeed and be funded for
the next level of support in the process.
<p>
	2. Major donors should be prepared to live with staff-intensive
programming in pilot project stages and should not expect to move large sums of
money at that point.<p>
	3. Major donors should change their established programming procedures to
allow more flexibility (in budgets, in implementation schedules, and even in
project plans) so as not to pre-empt
learning or its application which often requires changes (p. 502).<p>
	4. A portion of funding might be programmed around individuals with leadership
qualities and commitment rather than around sectors. (p. 502)<p>
	5. Different funding organizations might play different roles at each stage
with small, on-the-ground
organizations (Foundations and PVOs) playing an important role in learning to
be effective (Stage 1), larger funders such as UNICEF or USAID entering in the
stage of learning to be efficient (Stage 2), and the World Bank entering at the
third stage (learning to expand).<p>
    Pyle suggests that donors fund experimental<u> intermediate-sized
programmes</u>, still experimental, rather than moving to expand small projects to
large scale in one giant step as is so often done. An intermediate-sized
project, carried out in "real world", not "hothouse" conditions would shift
focus from technical issues (presumably tried out in the pilot project) to
delivery and organization. The suggestion is similar to Korton's stage 2.<p>
    These innovative suggestions cannot be carried out unless there are major
changes in most international agency policies. Continuity, flexibility,and
restraint are required for learning by trial and error over extended periods.<p>
    Collaboration among funding agencies at different stages in the process of
going to scale could allow each organization to contribute in a cumulative way
to the process. It might help overcome the frustration associated with pilot
projects that go nowhere. The suggestion, however, raises questions related
precisely to the organizational discontinuities that would occur in such an
arrangement. These discontinuities would have to be controlled by national
continuities. In addition, it may be difficult to fit agency norms together. As
an example, a World Bank staff member indicated to me that most pilot projects
funded by other organizations did not provide the information or meet the
standards needed within the bank to allow it to consider subsequent funding of
the project idea on a large scale. There is, also, a constant need to guard
against a kind of international collusion affecting the relationship of donors
to national governments.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<center>			CONCLUSION</center><p>
    There are several reasons to conclude that now is not the time, in most
places, to move ahead guickly with large-scale
programmes that emphasize the mental, social, and emotional development of
young children, as important as these programmes might be. First, the field of
child development is a complex one requiring multiple responses to multiple and
varied needs. Second, a technology similar to that developed for health and
nutrition (oral rehydration, growth charts) does not seem to have been
adequately tested and adjusted. Third, the current emphasis on survival seems
appropriate still for most parts of the Third World where infant mortality
rates are still very high. Therefore, focus on health and nutrition should
continue to command major attention. Putting that together with warnings about
the dangers of overloading systems gives one pause before adding another
service component to a system, even in cases where to do so would be relatively
inexpensive. Fourth, the demand for early childhood development programmes, per
se, is only now beginning to grow. That demand is related tochanging social
conditions. It will continue to grow, particularly in urban areas in
conjunction with the need for systems of child care for working mothers.<p>
    Different nations will, of course, be able to move faster or slower to
increase the coverage of child development programmes depending on the strength
of existing institutions, their social commitment, and the availability of
resources. Although this is not the time, in most places, to go to scale with
institutionalized programmes emphasizing intellectual, social and emotional
development of young children, it is a time to educate, to mobilize demand, to
learn from on-going
experiences, and to experiment further. Interest and demand are growing. Simple
technologies are being tried out. Implementation experiments abound,
representing a wide range of alternative delivery models. Possibilities for
"piggy-backing"
on existing programmes are widespread. There is, then, a rich opportunity to
prepare for expansion in the future through continued experimentation and by
learning in a systematic and collaborative way from present experiments. Doing
so would help to raise the consciousness of both national governments and
international organizations and would help to train needed personnel along the
way.<p>
<p>
	<center>				Endnotes<p></center>
(1).In this paper "scale" will not be defined precisely. In general, the term
describes programmes (rather than smaller projects) that attempt to reach as
many potential beneficiaries as possible at a regional, national, or even
worldwide level. One convention suggests that reaching 80 per cent of a
population constitutes scale. By that standard very few programmes anywhere in
the world can be said to have gone to scale. Another is a classification used
by the American Public Health Association in its review of 52 USAID-assisted
programmes: National programmes; Large-Scale Regional (2-18 million) programmes; Medium-Scale
Regional (500,000 -1 million) programmes; Small-scale Regional (100,000 - 500,000) programmes; and Small-Scale
(under 100,000) programmes. (APHA, p. 26) even in cases where geographic
coverage approaches 100 per cent, the actual number of participants is likely
to remain a small fraction of the total. While keeping the ambitious goal of
total coverage in view we will here be more concerned with the process of
moving to scale than we will be with achieving a particular level of coverage
and use.<p>
<p>
 (2) It is not surprising, therefore, that the topic, "Going to Scale", emerged
in May 1983 as one of considerable interest during the inter-agency
meeting held to exchange ideas about projects and programmes designed to
increase survival and enhance the development of young children in the Third
World. (See Bernard van Leer Foundation, Summary Report, 1983, p.6)<p>
<p>
  (3)Impressive and widespread as the public interest in a child survival and
development revolution has been, it is only a beginning. All we have achieved
so far is hardly more than a world-wide
clamour of great expectations. If we fail to mount the next phase -the operational phase -immediately,
two years from now we will have little or no substance to show for all the
hopes we have raised." (Vittachi, p. 3)<p>

</pre>
<p>
 (7) The focal point of the converging services is the anganwadi or pre-school
child centre, located within the village itself. The anganwadi worker and a
helper are supported by a Child Development Project Worker. These individuals
are selected according to uniform criteria set by the Central Government, based
on education and experience. A uniform curriculum has been developed for pre-service
training, provided by existing academic institutions and non-governmental
organizations. The programme includes growth monitoring, iimnunization, health
check-ups, supplementary feeding, non-formal pre-school
education, and nutrition and health education for mothers.<p>
<p>
(8) It did, however, include preparation in terms of<p><ul>
	1. a review of pertinent social, economic and cultural studies.<p>
	2. a review of literature on child development.<p>
	3. a survey of communities designed "to corroborate the documentary
research".<p>
	4. elaboration of documents, including a carefully conceived manual of
operations.<p></ul>
<p>
(9) The "non-formal" programme is built around a guide for parents presenting a series of graduated
activities that they can carry out to help their children develop. Parents and
other family members are trained in the use of the manual by "promoters" who
are community members with a minimum of a primary school education. Parental
training is carried out over 15 days, for two hours each day, after which the
promotor makes periodic home visits and calls meetings of small groups to
reinforce parental actions. The promoters work with and through Community
Committees.  They are paid.  A supervisor is charged with orienting and
organizing the work of 16 promotors.<p>
<p>
(10) In the Sine-Saloun
case, health services are provided through "Health  huts", each of which was to
be self-supporting.
 Before the project began,  however, there was no attempt made to establish
that the effective demand of  the population for health care was sufficiently
great to enable the huts to become self-sufficient. <p>

<u>SUMMARY</u><p>
 <p>
<p>
This paper highlights the pattern of childcare and women&#146;s work within the
Yoruba traditional rural settlements of Oyo and Owo Local Government Areas in
Southwestern Nigeria.  The division of labour and task allocation within the
Yoruba patrilinear system are highlighted.<p>
<p>
It is emphasized that the majority of woman face the task of incorporating the
requirements of work with high child care loads of 2 under 6 years old
siblings, on average.  In a situation of high fertility of 6-8 pregnancies per
woman, low socio-economic status and insufficient food intake in the presence
of a biting economic recession, these woman present with maternal depletion;
low nutritional and health status which readily saps their energy.<p>
<p>
The mothers&#146; income generating activities tent to dictate needs for child
care and the place where community based child care centres can evolve.<p>
<p>
Market based villages/neighborhood models and women cooperative models ate
being tried out on an experimental basis.  In addition, the feasibility of a
&#147;child to child&#148; care programme and a greater involvement of fathers
and grandmothers with young children are other alternatives to be considered.<p>
<p>
The Early Childhood Programme is implemented within the UNICEF assisted
programme which takes a comprehensive and multisectoral approach to primary
health care with additional sub-components of household food security,
nutrition and woman&#146;s training programmes during the present 5 year plan
period.<p>
<p>
The programme intends to strengthen and upgrade the present skills of
professional, para-professional as well as community members on early childcare
and development.  Health, Nutrition, Sanitation and Early Childhood stimulation
messages are being incorporated into the national Woman and Adult Education
Movement and as part of primary school curricula.<p>

<u>FINDINGS IN RURAL SOUTHWESTERN NIGERIA AND IMPLICATIONS FOR UNICEF&#146;S
PROGRAMME PLANNING</u><p>
<p>
<p>
Introduction:<p>
<p>
The social structure in Western Nigeria is primarily patrilinear with a strong
orientation for male authority and dominance.  Culturally, the Yoruba rural
society is based on a polygamous family system where husbands and wives, to
some extent are economically dependent.<p>
<p>
The woman-folk form a single productive unit with their husbands who are the
heads of the unit.  The predominant occupation is farming with a re-orientation
from subsistence to &#147;consumption&#148; economic patterns.  The husband
usually owns the land and labour-supply is lineage-based or hired.  Other
economic pursuits for women include trading, home crafts such as weaving,
dyeing, pottery, soap making, food processing and food vending.  In addition,
the woman are responsible for the following domestic chores:<p>
<p>
- the fetching of water from streams/ponds,<p>
- the fetching and chopping of firewood for food preparation and<p>
- the environments sanitation within their communities.<p>
<p>
Therefore, the combination of income generating activities with household
chores and child care arrangements has been culturally accepted as an integral
part of a woman&#146;s life in the rural setting.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>Role allocation within the Polygamous setting:</u><p>
 <p>
Given this setting, child care is a collective responsibility of the family and
the community members and &#147;there is less stress upon the individual
mothers role in the socialization of the child&#148; (Ellis 1978)<p>
<p>
The younger wives stay at home to take care of the family children, theirs and
those of other wives.  This living pattern also accords them the opportunity to
engage in food processing and petty trading.<p>
<p>
The tradition of male authority or dominance allocates to the man the
supreme-headship of the household.  His tasks are the provisions of
accommodation, food maintenance allowance and protection.  He is not
traditionally expected to assist the wife with household chores rather he is to
be served by the womenfolk and the children.  In a polygamous setting, each
wife and her children constitute an economic unit.  The mother is usually
responsible for her own and her children&#146;s clothing, medical/ceremonial
expenses, food as well as taking care of her own parents (Akintoye 1981).<p>
<p>
A study from Oyo LGA indicated that mothers had to provide most of their
children&#146;s foods, 50% of the family health care and that on the whole
women contribute 42% of all the household expenditures. (Adekanye 1987) (Table
1 presents the Division of Household Expenditure (monthly))<p>
<p>
<u>WOMAN&#146;S WORK: A review of Literature</u><p>
<p>
From the review on woman&#146;s work in the traditional Yoruba society, Awe
(1975) declared that Yoruba woman as a rule do not go through the ordeal of
tilling the ground.  Women are however assigned the following task:<p>
<p>
- caring yam tubers before the husband who plants each in the prepared yam
mounds.<p>
- harvesting, and processing of crops such as cassava, palm oil, etc.<p>
- preservation of the harvest crops from vermin, insects and natural
elements,<p>
- shelling of maize, beans and melon seeds.<p>
<p>
According to Makinwa-Adebusove (1985), the Yoruba woman regard work as part of
their roles as wives and mothers.  She posits that <p>
- women process food and non-food commodities such as soap, palm oil and cooked
food,<p>
- sell processed and non-processed farm commodities mainly produced from their
husbands farms.<p>
<p>
Favi (1977) in a study of Oyo villages discovered that women assist with
planting, harvesting, processing and transportation of farm products such as
yam, maize, cassava, etc.<p>
<p>
Osuntogun (1976) in a study of farmers&#146; wives in Oyo State declare that
trading constitutes the most important occupation of the farmers&#146; wives in
addition to harvesting, processing and marketing.<p>
<p>
<u>WOMAN&#146;S INCOME GENERATING ACTIVITIES:</u><p>
 <p>
The prevalent income generating activities in the rural communities include
cassava and palm oil processing in addition to farming.  Cassava processing for
gari, fufu and (lafun) cassava flower is a tedious, woman&#146;s income
generating venture.  The data from the Oyo LGA show that a total of 2,253
unconverted work hours needed for all stages of cassava development, may
contribute only 29%, women 46% and children 25%.  Women and children contribute
100% of the total labour for processing and 94% of that for marketing.  The
processing involves the peeling of cassava, the grating manually or with
machine, the fermentation and dehydration method of applying weight, the
sieving of the grated cassava, the frying cooling, preserving and marketing of
the finished product.<p>
<p>
A rapid assessment study of the rural cassava in household food security among
the Yorubas revealed that cassava is the major crop for household food
security.  Cassava is nearly always intercropped and provides the bulk of the
family&#146;s energy requirements during the lean ,months of the year (April -
June).  This is true in the rural areas and increasingly in the urban areas
where it is the survival food among the urban poor.<p>
<p>
The processing of palm oil involves the women standing in the processing pit to
separate the palm kernel from the oil which collects at the top.  The
processing entails rigorous boiling of the palm nuts in containers made of clay
or tin drums.  Fire making is tedious, using firewood and locally produced
tinders.  Processing is non-hygienic, laborious and time-consuming.  Women,
employing child-labour are often seen cracking the palm kernels before the
shells are sold to trading companies for soap making and also used locally for
processing blacksoap: a low cost, locally acceptable and available commodity in
the Yoruba communities.<p>
<p>
Women also perform 60 - 80 percent of all agricultural labour and 95 percent of
all domestic tasks.  They help with weeding the farm,<p>
- carry out most of the farm work during harvest period as well as<p>
- carry home the harvest products before processing and marketing
respectively.<p>
<p>
<u>The Problem:</u><p>
 <p>
Women&#146;s income generating and domestic chores are labour intense, energy
consuming and physically tasking.  The majority of women face the task of
incorporating a heavy work load with high childcare load of 2 under 6 year old
siblings, on average.  Given a situation of high fertility of 6-8 pregnancies
per women, low socio-economic status, insufficient food intake in the mist of a
biting economic recession and food taboos which effect mainly the women and
their children, the majority of mothers present with maternal depletion of low
nutritional and health status which readily sap their energy.<p>
The also suffer from physical exhaustion as a result of hard labour.
consequently these gender roles as primary care givers, wives, cook and
housekeepers are adversely affected.  Their children also present with poor
nutritional health status.  Childcare arrangement that becomes the
responsibility of the olds siblings, grandmothers where available, neighbors
and relations if still resident in rural communities.  The search for job
opportunities had taken a sizable proportion of family members into the urban
centres.  <p>
<p>
Besides, the rural areas have not witnessed the off shoots of daycare centres
as these are urban oriented and urban based.<p>
<p>
<u>Government&#146;s Policy on Early Childcare and Development</u><p>
 <p>
Where as some women groups such as the National Council of Women&#146;s
Societies and the Women in Development have been vocal and active at getting
the government to institutionalize early child care arrangements, their
activities have been focused mainly in the urban centres.<p>
<p>
The National Policy on Education: Guidelines on Pre-Primary Education (1987)
has enlisted certain objectives of preprimary education as:<p>
<ol>
<li>effecting a smooth transition from the home to school;
<li>preparing the child for the primary level of education:
<li>providing adequate care and supervision for the children while their parents are at work (on the farm, in the markets, offices, etc.);
<li>inculcating in the child the spirit of enquiry and creativity through the exploration of nature and the local environment, playing with harmless, educative materials and toys, artistic and musical activities.
<li>teaching cooperation and team spirits;
<li>teaching the rudiments of numbers, letters, colors, shapes, forms, etc. through play and
<li>teaching good habits, especially good health habits.</ol>

<p>
The Ministry of Education will effect the requirements for preprimary
institutions in multisectoral/ministerial approach with the ministries of
Health, Works, etc.  The Ministry of Education (1987) has also commended these
guidelines to both Nursery Schools and Day Care Centres for use as a reference
point.  National Child Welfare Policy for Nigeria (1987) has emphasized
Government&#146;s awareness that adequate attention tot he education and
intellectual development of the Nigerian Child is an invaluable insurance for
the future well being of the nation.  The government will therefore implement
faithfully the provisions of the National Policy on Education particularly on
the objectives of preprimary education whether the Child resides in the urban
or rural areas.<p>
<p>
It is worth mentioning however that the conventional institutional, urban based
approaches to Early Childhood Care and Development programme have failed to
provide adequate services for the escalating needs of preschool children.<p>
Given such a background at the rural area and in Nigeria as a whole, UNICEF
Nigeria in collaboration with the Bernard Van Leer Foundation has initiated an
informal community based Child Care and Development Programme in Oyo, Owo and
Oyun LGAs which are predominantly Yoruba speaking.<p>
<p>
From 1987 until 1989, Early Child Care and Development Programme will focus
it&#146;s activities within these three LGAs in the order to develop models
that will be adequate Yoruba children in the 0-6 year age group, under
different but comparable conditions.  The ECCD programme is implemented with
the UNICEF assisted Integrated Community Health and Development programme which
takes a multisectoral and holistic approach to primary health care with
additional sub-components such as household food security, nutrition and
women&#146;s training.  These activities involve various Ministries of Local
Government and Community Development, Health, Education, Agricultural and
Women&#146;s Organizations.<p>
<p>
The remanding two LGAs of Akko in Bauchi State, Calbar in Cross River State
will require more systematic planning since fairly little is known about the
traditional childcare patterns and modern needs for alternative arrangements in
comparison with the Yoruba speaking LGAs.<p>
<p>
<u>THE OBJECTIVES OF THE PROGRAMME</u><p>
<h3>

 <li>To demonstrate and apply low cost, community based approached to childhood care and education which respond to the needs of women and children in rural areas.       <br>
<li>To develop a system of training for young women in rural areas which will enable them to function as workers in community based early childhood centres.       <br>

<li>To reinforce the development of creativity and thinking in children at the informative age.       <br>

<li>To develop a system which based on early childhood centres could address the wider needs of women at community level in preparing them for motherhood, improving their child rearing skills and their understanding of their children&#146;s growth and development needs.       <br>

<li>To improve the process of transmission of social and cultural skills, enhancing the child&#146;s self-image and identity and        <br>

<li>To promote, through the growth of alternative early childhood services employment opportunities for young women, halting the drift to the city.       <br>

<u>The Target Audience of the Base Studies for Programme Development</u><p>
 <p>
Oyo Local Government Area is located in the northern part of Oyo State and
shares a common boundary with Kwara State.  It&#146;s headquarters:  Oyo town
with a population of under 200,000 people, is a traditional town and the
capital of the old Yoruba kingdom.<p>
<p>
Oyo LGA consist of a conglomeration of three urban centres Oyo, Awe, Ilora and
hundreds of small villages and temporary farm camps and their farmsteads.  It
has an estimated population of 544,047 people in 1986 and is one of 24 local
government areas of Oyo State.<p>
<p>
Owo Local Government Area is a merger of three, previously autonomous district
councils with it&#146;s headquarters at Owo town.  Owo LGA consist of 6 towns,
their farmsteads, camps and hamlets with an estimated population of 353,000
people.  It is located in the north-east of Ondo State and shares common
boundaries with Bendel and Kwara states.  Owo town is the largest with a
population of about 150,000 people.<p>
<p>
Some 40 percent of the population in Oyo and Owo LGAs reside at Oyo and Owo
towns respectively.  The population of the children under 6 amounts to 18
percent and 20 percent of Oyo and Owo LGAs respectively.<p>
<p>
Oyun LGA though the smallest LGA within Kwara State, has the highest population
density with more then 300 people per square kilometer of an estimated
population of 234,000.  About 70 percent of it&#146;s population lives in Offa,
the headquarters of the LGA.  Oyun LGA though close to Oyo, is within the dry
savannah region with fewer cash crops than the richer forest zones.<p>

 <p>
For the purpose of data collection, a three part questionnaire focused on care
and development was constructed.  It comprises of -<p>

<h3>
	<li>The Household Questionnaire which solicits the information on household record and series of items on infrastructural facilities in the community.       
<li>Mother Questionnaire which combined both the child birth and the child fostering record.       



       </h3>
	The Child Development Questionnaire which focused on the child&#146;s health
and nutritional, current health and nutritional status and the socialization
practices.<p>
<p>
The 98 item questionnaire also solicited information on material assessment
strategies and childcare arrangements among working mothers.<p>
<p>
To standardize the questionnaire, a pre-test was conducted on a rural
population in Oyo State.  The same questionnaire was used in the local
government areas of Oyo and Owo through slight modifications and corrections
were made before the second survey.<p>
<p>
It is necessary to mention here that the survey on childcare and development
for Oyun LGA is currently in progress.<p>
<p>
<u>The Conduct of the Baseline Survey/Observational Assessment:</u><p>
 <p>
Two surveys have been completed in two LGA&#146;s of Oyo and Owo.  In each LGA,
thirteen interviewers were selected from their performance on a related
aptitude test and interviews.  One hundred mothers were interviewed in Oyo and
Owo town respectively while 150 and 175 were selected from the rural areas of
Oyo and Owo LGAs respectively.  Selection of hamlets, small villages and
rural/urban settlements were based on size category.  For the observational
assessment, Time Series Analysis was adopted for each child between two and six
years.  This was conducted on a 10 percent of the sample interviewed.  Every
child was observed for an hour at different periods of the day.  Pictorial
documents were also obtained.  The collected data was computerized.  The
socio-economic and educational data were analyzed using simple tabulations and
percentages.  Attempts are being made to correlate Oyo and Owo data.<p>

<p>
<u>Statistical Findings and Implications for UNICEF&#146;s Interventions:</u><p>
 <p>
<u>The socio-economic Characteristics of Mother</u><p>
 <p>
<p>
Generally, there are more monogamous marriage in Owo rural communities than at
Oyo: approximately 66 percent to 53 percent of the sample.  Twenty-two females
in Owo completed the Primary School education as against only 9 percent on Oyo
rural communities.  Over one-third females in Owo (39%) are literate, about 18
percent are literate in Yoruba and English, 12 percent in Yoruba (only) at Oyo
rural communities.  However, 86 percent and 57 percent females at Oyo and Owo
rural communities have had no formal education.  Access to primary education is
the same for boys and girls in LGAs.<p>
<p>
Adekanye (1987) reported a high school drop out rate for both boys and girls of
20 to 30 percent especially after primary four.  This is due particularly
academic inaptitude and to some extent parental financial constraints at
keeping all children in school during the present economic recession.<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>Religion:</u><p>
 <p>
The predominant religion among the household in Oyo rural communities is Islam
while the rural population in Owo is almost 100 percent Christian.  The
implication of religion is that polygamy tends to be more prevalent among the
Moslems than the Christian orthodox denominations.  Greater parental
involvement has been attributed to monogamous family than the polygamy setting
where each mother is expected to shoulder certain responsibilities of her
children.  The mean age at marriage in Owo rural communities is about 20.4
which is probably high than for Oyo which is predominately Moslem and with
lower lever of education.<p>
<p>
The general trend is that early marriage, low level of education and high child
mortality are correlated factors in child survival and development.<p>
<p>
<u>Economic Activities:</u><p>
 <p>
Over 60 percent of adult female in Oyo indicate that they process and trade in
various farm product particularly in palm oil and cassava.  Over 21 percent
report that their primary economic activity is farming.  However, most of them
also trade and process farm products on a secondary basis.  The pattern is
different at Owo rural communities.  Twenty-six percent of females are farmers,
43 percent engage in farming and trading activities while 13 percent describe
themselves as traders.  Two women regard themselves as housewives.<p>
<p>
Owo is one of the few Nigerian areas still covered with dense tropical rain
forest and about half of the LGA is kept as forest reserve.  Therefore, most of
male adults are hunters.  Owo is heterogeneous because of the long settled
groups of immigrates from the neighboring ethnic groups.  On the other hand,
Oyo is midway between the woody and the grass savannah zones in a homogeneous
race.  Farming is more important to women in Owo than Oyo:<p>

<h3>
	<li>because Owo women readily have access to farm lands through their families of origin under customary law.       
<li>farming in Owo is more profitable due to it being a dense rain forest area.  It has several cash crops such as cocoa, rubber, colanuts in addition to the main staple food crops.       
<li>the services of farm labourers are more readily available in Owo than in Oyo due to influx of other ethnic groups.  This often leads women to return to their families of origin after their child bearing years.  Food processing and storage are almost exclusively in the hands of women in Oyo and Owo.       

       </h3>
<p>
<u>Household Size and Child Dependency:</u><p>
 <p>
The average household size in Oyo rural settlements is 8.5 persons and 7.7
persons in Owo.  These figures are considerably higher than the recent estimate
for rural populations in Southwestern Nigeria of a mean household size of 4.66
(Willson Oyelaran and Ladipo 1987).  The majority of households are male
headed.<p>
<p>
In Oyo about 9 percent of under 5 and 12 percent of 5 to 14 ear old children
are in traditional fostering, being raised in households where their primary
caretaker in not a biological parent.  In more than 46 percent of the cases,
the primary caretaker is the grandmother while in approximately 22 percent of
the cases, older sisters assume parental responsibilities.<p>
<p>
In Owo, 15 percent of the women surveyed are involved in traditional fostering
situations.  Slightly more than 13 percent of the fostered children are below
preschool age.<p>
<p>
The figures in Table 2 shoe evidence of high fertility and mortality.  Oyelaran
and Ladipo (1997) reported a great deal of under reporting thus indicating the
tendency for these figures to be higher.<p>

</pre>
<p>
These figures are confirmed by Adekanye&#146;s (1987) findings showing that
fertility is higher in rural areas.  The desire for large families is also
expressed by approximately 76 percent of the women responding in the
affirmative when asked if they want more children.  Significantly, this is
spelled out 13 percent of the surveyed children were twins amounting to 54 sets
of twins.  Spelled out 59 sets of twin pregnancies were also reported by the
surveyed women.<p>
<p>
The high incident of twining among the Yoruba women is common knowledge and has
been well documented by researchers.  There is no correlation between twining
and morbidity/mortality.  This could have resulted from inaccurate/under
reporting of morbidity/mortality correlates by the respondents.  There is a
relatively high incident of neonatal and child aged 1-5 year deaths in Owo
while the most at risk period is that of infancy as well as the 1-5 age
category in Oyo.  The age categories of reported child deaths are presented in

The cause of child deaths are presented in Table 4.  While fever is reported as
the most common cause of death in Oyo, the &#147;illness&#148; category is
prevalent at Owo.<p>
<p>
The implication of these findings is that child survival components ORT, EPI,
Growth Monitoring and Nutrition be intensified during the high risk age period.
Incidentally, no respondent from Oyo and Owo attributed any child&#146;s death
to diarrhea.  Diarrhoeal diseases are often regarded as necessary and
inevitable as an &#147;internal cleansing mechanism&#148;.  The importance of
diarrhoeal knowledge is therefore critical to child survival in the rural

<u>The Nutritional Status of Children:</u><p>
 <p>
In the baseline study at Oyo rural settlements (1987), age discrepancies were
found during data collection, therefore the survey relied on age independent
parameters of nutritional status using age only in a cautious way to explore
the possibility of trends.<p>
<p>
Using the Height for Weight as percent of standard, the children of Olorunda in
Oyo rural community, of mean age 2 years had moderate PEM and severe PEM for
children of mean age 4.  On the whole anthopometric measurements, the children
of Olorunda 0-18 months did not meet the standard, a reflection of inadequate
breast feeding from malnourished mothers, as well as poor weaning diets.<p>
<p>
The weight for Height revealed a severe PEM for 4 year olds in Oloruda probably
due to inadequate food intake.  using Weight for Height percentiles, 41 percent
of the children in the survey fell at or above 100 percentile, 37 percent fell
below 95 percentile whilst 19 percent were below 90 percentile.  Only 2 percent
was below 80 percentile *.<p>
<p>
Generally, the nutritional status of children is considered unsatisfactory in
terms of micro-nutrients and possibly protein intakes.  In the survey, it was
shown that the shortest group of children are ass of satisfactory weight whilst
in the tallest category using Weight for Height, scores show the oldest group
of children to be the least well nourished, quite possible the children
reported to be the oldest are not the tallest.  These findings suggest that
many of the children are maintaining adequate Weight for Height ratios at the
expense of height and that in an on-going programme, it would be worthwhile to
register births so that height for age and long term nutritional status could
be evaluated.<p>
<p>
Recent rapid nutritional assessments conducted by the Nutritional Unit FMOH
revealed that 30 percent of children in Oyo LGA are malnourished between the
ages of 12-36 months while and average of 30 percent of children in the sample
are regarded as malnourished considering all the parameters (Height for Weight,
Weight for Age and Height for Age).  using the Height for Weight as percent of
standard:  about 4q percent in the sample were normal, almost 30 percent had
mild PEM, about 10 percent had moderate PEM (acute) while 2 of the children
suffered from severe PEM.  Weaning food is often low in energy density because
it consist mainly is watery corn porridge.  Even where mothers sell fruits such
as oranges, children so not readily get them.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------<p>
<p>
* (Reference values for Weight and Length/Heights Table 31 in Cameron and
Hofvander, <u>Manual on Feeding Infants and Young Children</u>, Oxford 1983)<p>
<p>
<p>
A similar survey conducted at Owo showed that 30 percent of children age 0-5
are moderately to severely malnourished according to Weight for Age and 25
percent moderately to severely stunted by Height for Age standards.
Malnutrition tends to be more common among girls than boys and increases with
age, especially in the 4-5 age group where moderately/severely malnutrition is
twice as common among girls as compared to boys (40% against 20%) respectively.
Two-thirds of all infants 0-1 year are relatively well-nourished due to the
wide spread and prolonged breast feeding practices.  Malnutrition among this
age group is mainly due to a late introduction of solid food after the first
4-6 months of exclusive breast feeding.  According to the survey, 15 percent of
all mothers did not introduce additional weaning until the child was over 12
months old and believe that &#147;children should not be fed on any other food
besides breast milk and pap until the children are two tears old&#148;.
(Balogun 1987)<p>
<p>
From the UNICEF/IITA/UI (1986) field survey it was discovered that the 0-5 year
old children at Olorunda do not consume an appreciable amount of red palm oil,
protein, carbohydrates and vitamins. Researches have shown that palm oil does
not only increase the food density for young children but also adds the much
needed minerals to the diet in it&#146;s freshest state.  The baseline survey
in Oyo also revealed that most of the children in the low weight group eat with
siblings while more of the high weight eat with adults.  More of the children
in the low weight category have mothers who do not think that milk or legumes
are particularly good for children.  There is the indication that the higher
the number of undesirable foods, the more likely the child is to be in the
lower weight group.<p>
<p>
<u>The Health Status:</u><p>
 <p>
The health status of the children at Olorunda showed the correlation between
the nutritional and health indices.  General physical examination conducted
during the UNICEF/IITA/UI survey (1986) revealed that 51 percent had angular
stomatitis, 37 percent had splenomegaly while a large portion of the children
at Olorunda presented with umbilical hernie.<p>
<p>
From the blood films, packed cell volume (PCV) and stool specimens examined,
about 27 percent of the surveyed villagers including children were anaemic with
PCV less than 40 percent, 81 percent had ascaris infection with a high
proportion of people infected with hookworm.  These findings were confirmed by
the clinical examinations which were conducted at the inception of the Child
Care project in August, 1987.<p>
<p>
The most prevalent health problems are fever, anemia, nasal discharge and
inflammation with lymphadenitis.  Umbilical hernia, hepatomegaly, wounds and
boils were also detected.  Other rampant health problems such as excess wax in
the ears causing hearing impediment, scabies, poor dental hygiene and
unawareness on the part of the parent.<p>
<p>
The baseline survey revealed that fever, chicken pox and diarrhoea were
reported as prevalent among the pre-school children in Oyo.  Both surveys
(1986, 1987) in Oyo have shown the immunological status of children to be low
at 20 percent (1986) and less than 28 percent in 1987.<p>
<p>
In Owo, the most prevalent, identified health problems include fever, diarrhoea
and measles/  The immunological status of children is good with 87 percent
haven completed triple antigen.<p>
<p>
<u>Ethnicity and Child rearing patterns:</u><p>
 <p>
The population is Oyo is predominately (95 percent) Yoruba.  Ojomo (1987)
reported that Edo-like language with increasing pigeon English repertoire to
the South of Owo reflects a gradual transition to Bendel State.  The
implication is that this section of Owo population tends to eat a substantial
amount of red palm oil, yam and vegetables just like Bendelites with whom they
have contact.<p>
<p>
Unlike the parents in rural settlements of Oyo who rely mainly on their
children for farm works, parents in Owo LGA hire labour from outside the state
to work on their farmsteads.<p>

<p>
Generally speaking there is a slight later age where children are expected to
do certain task in Owo.  Physical control of children is expected earlier in
Owo than in Oyo: a more westernized concept which in indicative of maternal
level of education.  Self reliance and responsibility are heaped at an early
age on children in Oyo rural settlements.  Children in Oyo are judged by their
ability to run errands at an early age.  Foe example, children are given money
to buy food for themselves at Oyo whereas Owo women tend to prepare food and
are more protective towards the children.<p>
<p>
Relatively early autonomy and competence are expected of the Oyo rural children
with respect especially to assistance with trading, farming as well as care for
themselves alone for 2 hours indicative of activities which help to enhance
income generating activities of mothers.  More emphasis is placed on Owo on the
acquisition of skills to have control of certain bodily functions and good
manners (etiquette) for example, feeding and dressing self.  These are
important for programme planning in each LGA.<p>
<p>
<u>Stimulation and Development:</u><p>
 <p>
Whereas pre-reading exposure to books and other materials is unavailable to
most preschool children in Oyo rural settlements, over half the population in
Owo have access quite often to these materials.  Despite the absence of books
and toys in Oyelaran and Ladipo (1987) declared that this environment can
hardly be viewed as intellectually impoverished.  For them, the everyday
experiences of the preschool child provide many opportunities for the
development of psycho-motor, perceptual and linguistic skills.  Perceptual
motor skills particularly of eye-hand coordination, apprehensions and a sense
of balance are reflected in many of the preschoolers actions such as palm
kernel cracking/shelling and cassava peeling and grating.<p>
<p>
Of particular concern from the point of view of the development of pre-literacy
skills the relatively high percentage of children who are not being exposed to
stories and riddles.  These oral literature experiences which were quite common
in the past provide a powerful source of linguistic stimulation.  The riddles
in particular challenge both the child&#146;s imagination and his reasoning
process.  While these activities appear to be dying out, there is no evidence
that they have been replaced by their counterpart in literate societies, the
bed time story (Wilson Oyearan 1987).<p>
<p>
Less than one-third of the mothers play or sing with their preschoolers with
any regularity.  In Owo mothers believe that play is important for keeping the
child busy and for development of body as mind.  They also indicate that play
teaches social skills and body control.<p>
<p>
Motoric development is influenced in the rural catchments of both LGAs by the
spatial and architectural designs of the camps, the attitude of adults to
children&#146;s mastery of the spacious environment, children&#146;s imitation
of the older siblings and the innate capacity to walk early in this part of the
world.  Besides mothers&#146; aspirations for these children are high and are
independent of maternal level of education, occupation, residence, child&#146;s
ranking order, sex and the number of children in the family.  Approximately 77
percent and 70 percent in Oyo and Owo respectively wan their children to be
doctors, lawyers, engineers and nurses.  The expectation of rural women is that
their children should eventually move out of the rural areas.<p>
<p>
Mothers stress intellectual skills so that their children could be economically
viable, build houses, provide financial and moral support for them during old
age periods.  Parents further expressed the desire for their children to live
abroad, or wherever God directs them.  In Owo, parents are so anxious that some
children are sent to school as early as two tears of age.  Programmes should
take into consideration these parental expectations and goals.<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>Child Care Load and the Demands of Work:</u><p>
 <p>
The majority of women:  47 and 51 percent carte for at least two children
between the ages of 1 day and 6 years in rural Owo and Oyo respectively.  In
Owo, 20 percent are responsible for these young children as against 10 percent
in Oyo.  The majority of Oyo rural women: (53 percent) however look after one
preschooler as compared with approximately 31 percent in Owo.  While about 31
percent indicated that they are fostering children (not their natural
off-springs), small but relevant number of children (2 percent) under 5 years
are cared for by other relatives.  The fostering responsibility seems to be
reciprocal, at time.<p>
<p>
On average the child care load is 1.66 and 2 preschool children at Oyo and Owo
respectively.  When asked how many hours they spend away from home during the
day, the mean number of hours for all care takers is 4.7 and 5 hours at Oyo and
Owo respectively.<p>
<p>
While the majority of farmers (39 percent) are away for three to five hours, a
sizable percentage (24 percent) are away for more than eight hours a day in
Oyo.  Over a third of the sample was absent for more than 6 hours in Owo rural
areas.<p>
<p>
<u>Child Care Arrangements:</u><p>
 <p>
The Owo data revealed a weak correlation between the mothers&#146; occupation
and the methods of child care arrangement.  Children are more likely to
accompany the mother if she is a farmer or farmer/trader.  Although the
assistance of grandmothers is common irrespective of occupation, fathers are
more likely to assist with child care is the mother is a trader.  On the whole,
less than 10 percent of the fathers assume child care responsibilities on a
regular basis and over three-quarters of these men reside in the rural
settlements.  Settlements and place of residence are therefore significantly
associated with the pattern of child care.<p>
<p>
<p>
The majority of children accompany mothers who work (43 percent), about 25
percent remain with grandmothers, while nearly 8 percent remain with older
siblings in Owo.  The picture is slightly different at Oyo.<p>
The most common child care arrangement is that children remain at home with
grandmothers (24 percent).  Other common arrangements involve the child
accompanying the mother to work, (18 percent) or remaining with a sibling (16
percent).<p>

The overwhelming majority of women, 96 percent, were satisfied with the child
care arrangements employed at the time of field work.<p>
<p>
<u>Child Care Options:</u><p>
 <p>
When confronted with child care options, each mother taking care of her own
child was the overwhelming choice (73 percent and 67 percent) in Oyo and Owo
respectively.  At Owo, about 23 percent opted for a group care arrangement
under the supervision of a trained care giver while the preference is for a
cooperative daycare arrangement at Oyo.  In Owo, 17 percent indicated their
willingness to pay cash for such services while only 7 percent at Oyo would pay
in cash or kind.<p>
<p>
The majority of women in Oyo (54 percent) and 30 percent in Owo would be
willing to reciprocate child care arraignments.<p>
<p>
In both studies, child care arrangements are regarded as everybody&#146;s
responsibility and not something for which they should pay.  This is because
mothers perceive child care arrangement as a child minding rather than as a
stimulating activity.  This cultural idea has implications for program
sustainability in both areas.  Some mothers in urban economy are however
prepared to pay a high premium on getting their children the right
stimulation.<p>
<p>
The following models of self help, community based child care arrangements have
been decided in collaboration with the mothers at Oyo LGA -<p>

<h3>
	<li>Rural community-based using existing centre and organized by women&#146;s cooperative society.  Olorunda, a homogenous village north of Oyo town has been chosen for model building.       
<li>Rural market based periodic group using a given space.  this will operate only on the 5 day market system.  Omooba/Olanite of Oyo LGA is to be established as a model.       
<li>Urban market based full-time group using Akesan market in Oyo town       

	
       </h3>
<p>
The rational for the choice of the market based models is to reach the high
risk groups from hamlets, villages and urban poor areas who would not have
otherwise benefited from this programme.<p>
<p>
The following model would be built later in Owo LGA:<p>

<h3>
	<li>Establishment of a preschool annex at Owo to cater for the needs of preschoolers who attend schools with other siblings.       
<li>Development of child care arrangements at the church premise using the church as the focal entry point since Owo LDA is predominately Christian.       
<li>A market based model will also be considered.       



       </h3>
<p>
An educational component for all age categories would be developed as
follows:<p>


<pre>
Age Category                             Programme                                
0-2 years                                Emphasis on child care, nutrition and    
                                         stimulation                              
2 1/2 - 4 years                          Child development, stimulation and       
                                         nutrition                                
4 1/2 - 6 years                          Preschool education and child            
                                         development                              

</pre>
<p>
In all these categories, there would be opportunities for cognitive and
psycho-social stimulation using play in all its ramifications.  Based on
UNICEF&#146;s programme approaches, the following activities would be integral
to the child care project.<p>
<p>
1. <u>Delivering a service</u>:	The project is seeking to meet the identified
needs of children at the project sites.  Health/Nutrition components have been
built into the programme to improve and promote the health/nutritional status
of the children in Olorunda.  Nutrition surveillance is an integral part of the
project.  As part of the nutrition strategies, food production among the
poorest farmers, particularly the women will be increased to cope with the
family protein-energy needs.  For these reasons, improved varieties of cassava
and soybeans have been introduced to rural primary schools, groups of communal
farmers at Owo LGA in 1986 and Oyo in 1987.  Fast growing and high yielding oil
palm seedlings would be introduces at Oyo and Owo to combat the high incident
of energy malnutrition.<p>
<p>
2. <u>Educating Adults:</u>	Adult literacy classes have commenced at Olorunda
since May 1988 by the Directorate for Social Mobilization.  Women in particular
are to be empowered to participate along side their husbands who have imbibed
the value of literacy.<p>
<p>
Training courses have been organized and schedules for community members, LGA
staff, school masters, women leaders etc. on multiplication of root crops and
soybeans as well as on cultivation, processing and utilization.  This is a
collaborative programme between UNICEF, IITA and the LGA Agricultural/Extension
staff.  Adult male and female and in general, all care-givers including older
siblings are to be instructed on breast feeding technique, family planning,
ORP, EPI, personal and communal hygiene, child care and development with
emphasis on the use of low cost toys, traditional stories, games, songs in
their lingua franca to stimulate the child&#146;s psycho-social and cognitive
development.  Women are being taught to monitor child and maternal growth and
nutrition.  A curriculum will be developed to train women/parents, older
siblings as care givers in the various child care models.  There would be
emphasis on cultural transmission through the process of socialization.<p>
<p>
In addition, The Can Leer Nigerian Educational Trust in collaboration with
UNICEF will develop &#147;First Readers&#148;, designed to convey health care,
nutritional, social and developmental messages to educate and improve the
quality of lives of rural women.<p>
<p>
<u>3. Promoting Community Development:</u><p>
 <p>
UNICEF in collaboration with consultants in appropriate technologies from ITDG,
England, RAIDS and FIIRO would pursue a project of upgrading household
technologies for women in food storage, processing and preparation for their
families.  There would be additional input on water-storage with filtering,
improved cooking stoves for firewood and less labour intensive methods on the
preparation of cash crops such as palm oil, melon and fried cassava (gari) for
local markets.  A low cost food processing centre has been constructed at
Olorunda in February through the efforts of COWAD members, the community, RAIDS
and UNICEF with a fund from the Dutch Government.  The centre was declared open
in February by the wife of the Oyo State Governor.<p>
<p>
The technical skills of the women groups have been upgraded to operate the
mechanized processing centre and cope with the child care project.  The skills
of local artisans would also be upgraded to produce appropriate toys and
educational equipment for use within the child care models and to make low cost
toys readily available.<p>
<p>
4. <u>Strengthen National Resources and Capacities:</u><p>
 <p>
UNICEF would implement the child care in collaboration with
National/State/Local women&#146;s organizations, OMEP, Nigerian Educational
Research Council (NERC), various related Ministries, specialist in early
childhood education etc. to effect policy making and evaluation strategies.
The capability of COWAD would be strengthened through training and supervision
by qualified early childhood teachers who have been identified at Oyo LGA.
OMEP Nigeria would be encouraged to carry its preschool activities to the rural
communities.  Steering Committees would be established at National/State/LGA
levels.  These would be inter-organizational and interministeria.<p>
<p>
5. <u>Social Marketing and Advocacy:</u><p>
 <p>
Community mobilization and training strategies will be integral tot he
programme to create awareness and disseminate knowledge on early childhood
education at all levels.  Education materials would be produced by UNICEF to
strengthen the primary school system and teaching force into effective
participation in child survival and development activities.<p>
<p>
The following programme activities are also complementary to the child care and
development project -<p>
<p>
1. An assessment of women&#146;s development needs has just been completed at
Oyo and Owo LGAs.  Women Development Programme would be institutes at ICHDs
unit later this year.<p>
<p>
2. The training of TBAs (Traditional Birth Attendants), the baseline surveys on
API, malaria, diarrhoea, knowledge of ORT and Nutrition are ongoing
processes.<p>
<p>
3. In order to prepare for adequate nutritional interventions for children
under two years of age most at risk, UNICEF intends to sponsor an in-depth
study into the positive deviance in child feeding patterns and their
development among Yoruba.  This will be carried out by the Tufts University in
collaboration with the University of Lagos.<p>
<p>
4. <u>Water and Sanitation Project</u> - UNICEF implements a low cost
generation of drinking water supply and sanitation in the deprived rural
communities.  Thus, water and sanitation are used as focal entry to mobilize
communities particularly women so they could meet the minimum requirements and
needs of child survival and development.  Availability of water also acts as a
time/energy saving device for women and their children who otherwise spend long
hours fetching water.  These facilities have been provided at Olorunda.<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>The Role of OAU on the African child.</u><p>
 <p>
At the OAU summit in July 1987, the year 1988 has been declared for the
Protection, Survival and Development of the African child using immunization
programme as a vehicle for achieving other wider goals.  This was brought about
because of the  deteriorating condition of children under the Structure
Adjustment Programme in Africa generally.  Child development is stressed by OAU
as a human right for the African child.<p>
<p>
The challenges of early childhood education programme is to reach the children
who are most at risk.  This is the problem to which the ECCD programme will be
addressed.<p>

</head><title>Language Rights, by Cassie Landers</title><body><b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The United Nations Declaration of Human Rights includes no mention of language
rights. One attempt to formulate such a statement is UNESCO's report on the use
of vernacular languages in education (1953). That report asserted the right of
all children to be educated in their native tongue. Now, nearly 40 years later,
controversy continues over the practical difficulties of implementing that
right, and even over whether there can be a single "language right" for all
situations. (See Ch. 11 on "Vernacular language education" in Fasold, 1984, for
review of discussions of these issues since 1953.)<p>
<p>
The practical difficulties of vernacular education are obvious. To name just
three: inadequate materials in many language communities whose financial
resources are stretched too thin as it is; the social need for a lingua franca
shared among speakers of different vernaculars in a multilingual country; and
the need for students to switch at some point in their educational career to a
language of wider communication in order not to be cut off from the world-wide
heritage of knowledge.<p>
<p>
Questions about the wisdom of the UNESCO policy, even where it can be
implemented, arise from conditions of current and past oppression. Among
minority communities of guestworkers in Europe, schooling in the vernacular
reinforces their segregation and "prepare[s] the migrant pupils for forced
repatriation when their parents' labour is no longer needed" (Skutnabb-Kangas,
1988, pp. 23,26). In South Africa, the Bantu Education Act of the 1950's is the
linguistic expression of apartheid, placing barriers between majority Black
students and the English-speaking world and also barriers among Black speakers
of different Bantu languages. <p>
<p>
Moreover, in communities where indigenous languages are dying because of past
oppressive policies, the UNESCO policy ignores attempts--as by the Maori in New
Zealand, and Native American and Canadian communities--to create immersion
education in the group's heritage language for the purpose of revitalizing
it.<p>
<p>
Taking such linguistic, cultural and political complexities into account,
Spolsky (1986) has reformulated "a responsible and feasible language education
policy." He asserts two principles: the first concerning the rights of
individuals to equality of educational opportunity; the second concerning the
rights of groups to maintain their own linguistic heritage. Spolsky discusses
each of these principles in turn:<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Equality of educational opportunity has two complementary parts to it. The
first is the right, whenever feasible, to be educated in the variety of
language one learned at home, or at a basic minimum when this is not feasible,
to be educated in a school that shows full respect for that variety and its
strengths and potentials....The second is the right to learn in the best way
feasible the standard or official language or languages of wider communication
selected for the society as a whole....</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The second major principle recognizes the right of the individual or the
group to do whatever is possible to preserve or strengthen varieties of
language that have important ethnic, traditional, cultural, or religious values
for them (p. 189).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
As Spolsky says in conclusion, "These two straightforward principles, because
of the complexity of situations in which they apply and because of the
complexity of factors that come to affect them, can lead in actual fact to a
large number of actual policies." (p. 190) <p>
<p>
This paper focuses on language in preschool education, and Spolsky's principles
seem a wise guide there as in educational policy for the primary and secondary
schools. In considering the issues which these principles raise for young
children, we do not attempt any specific recommendations about which language
should be used in any specific situation. We offer instead a discussion of
research findings on young children's language acquisition and its relationship
to their general development, and a discussion of issues to be considered in
making the necessary decisions in each community and program.<p>
<p>
We use the term `language planning' to refer to all these decisions: not only
those at the national level (where the term is more conventionally used) but at
the community and program level too; and not only decisions about <b>which</b>
language but also decisions to be made in planning the preschool environment to
give maximum support to children's learning and development in whatever
language is in use.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT IN THE PRESCHOOL YEARS</b><p>
<p>
<p>
The preschool years see rapid and dramatic developments in many aspects of
children's abilities, none perhaps more striking than in the areas of language
and cognition. Children of 18 months express their thoughts in gestures or
single-word utterances, but by 6 years they can express themselves in long and
complex sentences; 18 month olds rely on an expressive vocabulary of only a few
dozen words, but 6 year olds control several thousand; 18 month olds use
language primarily to request things of adults and to discuss the here-and-now,
whereas 6 year olds use it for a wide variety of purposes and topics, including
humor, deception, fantasy, explaining, hypothesizing, and narrating. These
developments in control of the language system parallel and rely upon equally
astounding developments in the domain of cognition--the abilities to plan, to
remember, to categorize taxonomically, to learn intentionally, to take a
variety of perspectives, to understand complex and abstract phenomena, to
analyze problems and to solve them, all develop rapidly during the preschool
period.<p>
<p>
Increasingly throughout the world the social contexts for the cognitive and
language developments of the preschool years include group-care settings. In
some settings preschool group care is conceived of primarily as an alternative
to home care, and as directed primarily to concerns about protecting health,
promoting nutrition, and providing enjoyable experiences to the children
served. In others preschool group care is designed to serve primarily social
needs--providing opportunities for children to develop interpersonal skills and
to become members of a peer group. In still others, group care is seen
literally as 'pre-school', i.e., as a setting in which the activities can be
conceived of as a 'curriculum' and designed to promote cognitive development,
language, and early literacy skills.<p>
<p>
A world-wide perspective on language planning for preschool education must also
reflect the fact that a majority of those children are living in multilingual
societies, and the children themselves either are or are expected to become bi-
or multi-lingual. Some children are first confronted with the need to learn a
new language during their initial exposure to formal education--but in many
cases this happens even earlier, during preschool in group care settings.
Central questions for educators about language development include: a) what
does normal language development look like? b) how do we know which children
are showing slow or deviant development and may need special help? c) does
bilingualism slow down language development? d) how do we design environments
to ensure optimal language development? e) how does language development relate
to literacy? <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
One goal of this paper is to illuminate the nature of practices designed to
provide language experience and teaching to preschool aged children. Our focus
will be especially on preschool aged children in non-mother tongue care
settings. In the first section of the paper, as a background, we will briefly
review what is known about language development and factors influencing it in
preschool children. The second section will review the sociolinguistic
dimensions of relevance to understanding the role of language in preschool
education programs, and will present three case studies that illustrate quite
different situations in which choices about language for preschool care have
been made. The third section of the paper will consist of discussion of issues
that arise when considering language-oriented preschool education. The final
section presents an annotated bibliography of materials about other-language
preschool programs.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Language Development of Preschool Children</b><p>
<p>
We are using the term 'preschool children' in this document to include children
older than two (i.e., those for whom group care settings are common). The upper
end of the 'preschool' age range is difficult to establish, since formal
schooling starts in some countries as early as 4 years and in others as late as
7, 8, or even 9. However, we will focus in this discussion on the years 2
through 5. In considering issues and programs, in later sections of this paper,
we include programs designed for older children if they are not part of the
local formal 'public' educational system.<p>
<p>
What can children reasonably be expected to learn about language during the
years 2 to 5? Our descriptions of language acquisition are based primarily on
work done with English-speaking middle class children, though descriptions of
children learning other languages in diverse cultural settings are becoming
increasingly available. First and most obviously, children learn
words--estimates for the size of a 6 year old's vocabulary range from 8000 to
12000 words. The lower figure works out to 3.6 words a day or over 25 a week!
Of course, many of these words are acquired along with new concepts as well. In
these cases, it probably takes several exposures to the word in
information-rich contexts (e.g., a word like 'harvest' might be learned from
repeated discussions of 'the grain harvest,' 'harvesting the crops,' 'after the
harvest,' etc.). However, if children already know something about a particular
semantic domain (e.g., already know several color terms, or several different
animal names), they can learn the meaning of a new word in that domain from
hearing it used (in a way that is understandable) only once or twice.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In addition to words, of course, children by the age of five learn an enormous
amount of detail about the language in their environment. Much of this detail
has to do with form--which prefixes or suffixes or little function words
express particular meanings (see the papers in Slobin, 1985, for more
information about cross-language differences). But an enormous amount of it has
to do with meaning itself. Each language selects, from the large set of
possibilities available, a subset of semantic dimensions as linguistically
important. In English, for example, the dimension singular vs. plural has been
selected as one that needs to be marked linguistically in every single
reference to physical objects. One can say <b>I saw a house</b> or <b>I saw
(some) houses</b>; but English speakers do not have the option (as do speakers
of Chinese, for example) to say simply 'I saw house' and leave unspecified the
question of how many. Speakers of Marshallese (the language of the Marshall
Islands in Micronesia) must attend to number considerably more carefully than
English speakers; they mark the distinctions among a single, two, three, or
more than three objects. English speakers are also obliged to place events in
the present, past, or future linguistically, and to mark whether the event
referred to is finished or ongoing; thus, for example, <b>I ate dinner</b> is
marked for both past tense and completion, whereas <b>I was eating dinner</b>
is marked for past tense and incomplete, ongoing action. These distinctions of
tense and of aspect are by no means universal in the world's languages. Hebrew,
for example, has tense but no aspect; Tok Pisin, spoken in Papua New Guinea,
has aspect but no tense; and Chinese has neither. Some languages select quite
different aspects of meaning to mark linguistically: in Turkish, for example, a
verb must be marked to indicate whether the event was actually witnessed by the
speaker or is reported based on indirect knowledge; in Navajo verb markings
reflect the relative degree of activity and intelligence of their subjects and
objects (whether human, animate non-human, mobile non-animate, etc.); in
Hebrew, verbs must be marked for the gender of their subjects; in Japanese,
verbs are marked for degree of respect the speaker owes the listener. Learning
any language involves becoming sensitized to the aspects of the world that
language has identified as important to the linguistic system, and then
learning how the linguistic system works to mark those dimensions.<p>
<p>
Thus, during their preschool years children learn how to use at least some
parts of the morphological systems of their language to express semantic
distinctions (e.g., the difference between <b>magnet</b> and <b>magnets</b>;
the difference between <b>jump</b>, <b>jumping</b>, and <b>jumped</b>). They
also can learn to control morphological distinctions that are not semantically
motivated, such as gender in German, French or Hebrew, or noun class in
Russian. Especially in languages more morphologically rich than English, such
learning requires hearing and analyzing many individual instances to see the
underlying patterns. English- speaking children display their discovery of <p>
those underlying patterns when they make errors with irregular forms, e.g.,
<b>foots</b> for <b>feet</b>, or <b>bringed</b> for <b>brought</b>. Such errors
are common in any language that shows exceptions to its morphological rules or
more frequent and less frequent morphological patterns--as every language
except Esperanto does. Thus, Spanish speaking children early learn that
feminine words typically end in <b>-a</b> and masculine words in <b>-o</b>, so
they regularize exceptions (producing <b>la flora</b> for <b>la flor</b>, and
<b>el mano</b> for <b>la mano</b>), and Hebrew-speaking children note very
early that many present tense verbs start with m- prefixes (mi, me, or ma), and
incorrectly use this prefix as a present tense marker with groups of verbs
where present and past tense are actually the same form (e.g., <b>mesim</b>
instead of <b>sam</b>, or <b>mirademet</b> instead of <b>nirdemet</b>). The
crucial thing to note about these errors is that they are, in fact, indicators
of progress in language acquisition; thus, while it is considered nonstandard
if an adult English speaker says <b>brang</b> for <b>bring</b>, such a form
would be an indicator of linguistic sophistication and thoughtful analysis in a
five year old.<p>
<p>
Whether or not five year olds have fully mastered the morphological system of
their language has to do in part with the internal complexity of that system.
Plural is relatively easy in English, and few mistakes are made after about
three. In Arabic, the formal marking of plural is much more complex (though the
idea is, of course, perfectly simple), and children still make mistakes until
10 or 12. There are five classes of nouns and seven cases in Russian, with a
complex system of noun endings many of which are ambiguous. Russian children
still make errors with this complex noun morphology through the early school
years; the same basic system of case and noun classes is much more regular in
Polish, and children learn it much earlier. German, French, Hebrew and Spanish
speaking children typically are not making mistakes with gender any more by
about age five, but Polish children still have problems with the
virile/nonvirile distinction, which is marked only on plural nouns.<p>
<p>
Children also learn about word order by age five. English speaking children are
producing utterances like <b>Can I take it off and put it on?</b>, in which the
subject and verb have switched places, and like <b>I don't want any cheese</b>
in which the negative is correctly marked. They are typically able to
understand passive sentences like <b>The boy was kissed by the girl</b>, which
confuse younger children. And they are generally able to produce sentences that
have adult-like word order. Turkish children typically put objects first and
verbs last, like Turkish adults, whereas French children put subjects first and
objects last, like French adults. Some sentence constructions may still offer
trouble, e.g., embedded <p>
questions (<b>I wonder why did the teacher stay home today</b> instead of <b>I
wonder why the teacher stayed home</b>) for English speakers. Embedded
relatives (sentences like <b>The girl who the boy kissed kicked me</b>) are not
typically produced, and are often still misunderstood by English speaking
children, and most relative clauses still cause problems for Turkish children
under five. Thus, <p>
<p>
most languages have a few areas of difficulty that are not fully controlled by
the school-aged children, but the basic syntactic system is typically largely
acquired by about age five.<p>
<p>
An obvious difference between the speech of a two year old and that of a five
year old is in pronunciation. Two year olds often make phonological
simplifications (<b>goggie</b> for <b>doggie</b>, <b>ehpane</b> for
<b>airplane</b>) and often find substitutes for difficult sounds or sound
combinations (<b>waywo</b> for <b>yellow</b>, <b>peam</b> for <b>cream</b>).
Most five year olds have achieved generally adult-like pronunciation. In
addition, five year olds have often started to think about words as sounds, no
longer totally focused on their role as referential and communicative symbols.
Thus, five year olds typically can engage in word play or games that reveal
their understanding of rhyme, of concepts like 'the first sound' in a word, and
even of ambiguity (one word with two meanings). Five year olds who know the
names or the sound values of the letters in their alphabet will often produce
spontaneous spellings that reveal their analysis of the sound structure of
words.<p>
	<p>
There are many additional areas in which five year olds are not finished with
language learning. First, of course, they must triple their word-learning rate
if they are to achieve adult-like vocabularies of 70,000+ words by the age of
20. Second, their control over the means for talking about complex topics
(politics, agriculture, literature) will develop along with the cognitive
capacity to consider such complexities. Third, their control over the means for
expressing relations across utterances will grow, so that they will be able to
make explicit the logical relations between propositions (using words like
<b>however, nonetheless, although,</b> etc.), the temporal relations between
events in narratives (five year olds typically use only <b>and then</b>), the
causal relations between events in the physical and the psychological world
(<b>because, as a result, in spite of, consequently,</b> etc.), and so on.
Fourth, their control over nonliteral uses of language (irony, metaphor,
sarcasm), over sociolinguistically complex uses of language (condolence-talk,
ritualized speech-making, jokes, issuing and declining invitations, arguing a
legal case, praying, etc.), over the nuances of register variation (how to talk
to a social superior, a social inferior, a priest, a teacher, etc.), over
politeness dimensions, and many other matters has only begun <p>
to develop at age five. Finally, of course, the analysis of oral language forms
necessary to understand how they are mapped in the local orthography, and how
they are changed in the special registers most frequently encountered in
literacy, is typically just beginning for the five year old.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Facilitating Preschool Children's Language Development</b><p>
<p>
Most of the research that has been done on how the environment facilitates
language development relates to the early period (1 to 3 year olds), and to
children's interactions with their mothers at home, not to group care settings.
For young children, one facilitative style of interaction is highly responsive,
a style in which the adult lets the child decide what to talk about, expands on
that topic, works hard to figure out what the child means, suggests new
activities only when the child is not actively engaged in other activities, and
worries more about what the child wants to say than about whether it is being
said correctly. This picture shows an optimal language teacher who assumes the
role of cooperative conversational partner, rather than an explicitly didactic
or directive role. The studies on which this picture is based have mostly been
carried out in middle class, English speaking families, a cultural group within
which responsive, nondirective, child-centered parenting is considered
desirable, children and adults have relatively equal social status, and
children are expected from a very early age to function as conversational
partners (Cazden, 1988; Snow, 1989).<p>
<p>
In other cultures, the rules governing parent-child interaction and parental
roles are quite different. In Samoa, for example, social status is closely
connected to age, and the idea of engaging a child in a conversation as a
social equal would seem unnatural. Among the Kaluli of Papua New Guinea, it is
considered better to induce children to talk like adults about adult matters
than to 'descend to their level' in talking to them. In these cultures, we
would not expect the responsive style of talk that facilitates language
acquisition for American children to work well; even if parents were willing to
engage in it, they would produce children who were poorly adapted to the larger
society in which they are growing up. In these cultures, though, future
research will no doubt confirm that there are better and worse language
environments for young children; the better ones just have different
interactive features from those in England or North America.<p>
<p>
Furthermore, even for middle class English-speaking families, it is not clear
that the strategy of always responding to the child's conversational topic
remains optimal for language development throughout the later preschool years.
In their first few years, children's mastery of the core of the language system
depends on
their finding connections between newly developing semantic notions and
linguistic procedures for expressing those notions. Thus, language is most
useful to them if it is presented embedded in and related to their own
activities and attempts at expression. As they get older, though, children can
use language to learn language--they no longer need to encounter every new
language form embedded in a meaningful context that is provided
nonlinguistically. Furthermore, they become increasingly capable of learning
intentionally, of attending to and benefitting from explicit instruction, and
of using models as a source of learning. At this stage, simply responding to
the child's interests might not optimally stimulate language development any
more: talking about a wide variety of complex topics, modelling an enriched
vocabulary, engaging in talk about talk itself, discussing word meanings,
challenging children to explain themselves and to justify their own thinking,
setting higher standards for comprehensibility, and explicitly correcting
errors may come to function as facilitative factors in language development as
children turn 4 or 5 or 6. Children in this age range are also expected to
control certain language-related literacy skills that probably emerge from
being read to, from experience in looking at books with adults, and from
experience with letters, with pencils and paper, and with observation of adult
literacy activities; such skills are fostered when parents manage the
environment so as to provide and encourage the use of literacy artifacts.<p>
<p>
In group care settings, one study has shown that the quality of the language
environment of the day care center has a large impact on the language
development of the children enrolled (McCartney, 1984). The study was carried
out in Bermuda, where over 80% of children of all social classes are in day
care by age two. Quality in this study was defined in different ways: a) as
ratings on the Early Childhood Environment Rating Scale, which reflects quality
of personal care, furnishings, language/reasoning activities, fine/gross motor
activities, creative activities, social development, and adult facilities; and
b) as amount of talk from caregivers to children, and the proportion of that
talk that was controlling or directive vs. expressive and representational.
While overall quality as reflected in the rating scale was related to measures
of the children's language and cognitive development, the amount of expressive
verbal interaction with caregivers had a specific effect on the children's
language development. Particularly interesting was the finding that children's
language level was related to their opportunities to initiate conversations
with caregivers, and negatively related to number of conversations initiated
with peers. These findings suggest, not surprisingly, that many of the
characteristics of the stimulating, enriching group care center are very like
those of the optimal home
environment--opportunities to talk one-on-one with an interested and responsive
adult. In addition, though, children with experience in group care settings
have been shown to be better at certain uses of language than children who
spend most of their time with adults: learning the rules for playing,
conversing, negotiating, and arguing with peers is easier in preschool than at
home. <p>
<p>
Another important point to derive from this study of day care quality was the
effect of quality on cognitive as well as linguistic development. During the
preschool years, language and cognition are very closely related. Stimulating
children's language involves enriching their vocabulary, their understanding of
how things work, their knowledge about numbers, about weather, about how things
grow, about how people live in other parts of the world, and dozens more such
topics. Furthermore, preschool programs that wish to prepare children for
schools in which reading and writing are central activities need to plan ways
to stimulate the development of preliteracy skills. Though three year olds
don't need to start learning how to read formally, they can learn a great deal
about letters and the sounds they stand for, about how to write important words
like their own names, about the many purposes writing is used for, about books
and the stories in them from the activities planned in their preschools.
Children who start formal reading instruction with this kind of background have
a head start over children with little exposure to either the forms or the uses
of literacy.<p>
<p>
<b>Multilingual Preschool Children at Home and in Group Care</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Native Bilinguals</b>. There are many reasons why a preschooler might
already be or need to become bilingual. Some children grow up in homes where
two or more languages are used; they might be called 'native bilinguals'.
Studies of the language development of such children (e.g., Fantini, 1985;
Saunders, 1988; Taeschner, 1983) suggest that they look much like monolingual
children. They manage to learn two language systems in about the same time and
to about the same degree of skill as monolingual children take to learn one. Of
course, if such children stop hearing or using one of their languages, they
typically also lose it quite quickly.<p>
<p>
<b>Submersion Settings.</b> Very often children have to become bilingual at the
time when they enter group care settings. For example, immigrant families'
children may be almost entirely monolingual until they enter a day care or
nursery school, where they have to learn the societal language. Group care is,
in fact, utilized as a procedure for speeding assimilation of nonnative
children in Sweden, where children of immigrant families have priority for
places in government subsidized day care centers (Test, 1988). Such settings
are called 'submersion' settings for second language
learning, since the learners are submerged in a situation where their first
language is not used at all--often there is no one in that situation who can
even understand it.<p>
<p>
Studies of such children have been carried out in American preschools serving
university communities with many foreign graduate students. Tabors (1987), for
example, studied a preschool where half the children spoke no English on entry.
Since all the foreign children had different language backgrounds, they all had
to learn English in order to forge any social relationships at all, and of
course to be able to talk to the teachers and understand the activities going
on in the classroom. Meyer (1989) studied a similar preschool, but a classroom
in which four Korean children arrived at the same time and thus could band
together for social activity, and help each other negotiate the complexities of
communication with the English speaking teachers and children. The children in
this second setting probably learned English somewhat slower--but perhaps also
with less trauma, since they did not

experience an initial period of total isolation and communicative
ineffectiveness, as Tabors' subjects did.<p>
<p>
It is a common belief that children like those studied by Tabors and by Meyer
will learn their new language quickly and easily, benefitting from the child's
ability to 'just pick languages up'. Some have argued that this ability relates
to a critical period for language acquisition, in which the brain is still more
flexible and capable of new learning than is the older child's or adult's. In
fact, a normally developing preschool child can take quite a long time to learn
a second language. It is not uncommon for such children to start out refusing
to speak at all, for a period of weeks or even months. They are, of course,
learning a great deal during this silent period, starting to pick up words,
phrases, sounds, and meanings; but they are also failing to understand a good
deal of what is being said around them. It is hard to assess exactly how much
preschoolers understand of the language they hear, since they can look like
they understand just by attending to other children's activities and joining
in. Do they respond to the teacher saying 'Time to go outside to play now' or
to the other children putting on their coats? Do they understand the teacher
saying 'Choose between the water table, the sticker table, and the easels', or
do they simply assess the options visually and go to the preferred activity?
Evidence that the children didn't understand very much English during their
first year or more in an American preschool classroom abounds in Tabors' and in
Meyer's reports, though the children were very clever in coming to understand
the structure of the classroom, the daily schedule, and what was expected of
them. No doubt these nonverbal understandings helped them ultimately learn the
language that went with these activities.<p>
<p>
Children's emergence in Tabors' study as more competent English speakers was
marked by their increasing ability to enter into more language-mediated
activities. Thus, even the four year old foreign children were pretty much
limited to the sand box, the water table, and solitary art or manipulative play
activities, until they could talk at least a little English. They couldn't
insert themselves into the most desired activities--fantasy play in the house
corner, dress-up, and so on--until they could speak quite a lot of English,
since those activities were highly dependent on language and were controlled by
the English-competent children.<p>
	<p>
The teachers in the preschool classroom studied by Tabors offered some insights
into the difficulties the non-English speaking children faced in their second
language environment. They reported organizing their classroom in some ways
more like a toddler classroom--one for children a year to two younger than
those actually involved. These adaptations included planning activities and
selecting books that were relatively simple, less dependent on language, more
predictable, and thus a better environment for beginning to learn English.<p>
<p>
Sometimes children living in largely monolingual societies like the U.S. come
to reject the use of a different familial language, refusing to speak it in
public, or at all. Parents who continue to use the family language at home but
without forcing their children to speak it can maintain the children's
comprehension ability at least. Moving back home, or even visiting for just a
month or two in an environment where the other language is used widely,
typically enables the child to catch up quickly in production. But
the issue of maintaining two languages is not a negligible one for young
children, for whom loss can occur much more quickly than acquisition. <p>
	<p>
<b>Immersion Settings.</b> Second languages can also be acquired by preschool
aged children in immersion settings. The term 'immersion' derives from an
innovative way of teaching second languages first used in Quebec to teach
French to English speakers. In immersion programs for school-aged children, a
class of same-language children receive their teaching from a native speaker of
the target language, entirely in the target language. Thus, the curricular
language is one the children do not know at all (to begin with), but an entire
group of children who can talk to one another face this experience together,
their teacher can understand and respond to the children's language (though
teacher talk is all in the second language), and the nature of the teacher's
talk is designed to be adapted to the needs and capacities of the children.<p>
	<p>
Immersion programs are sometimes used with preschool aged children in precisely
this way in order to start the children out early in the second language. For
example, the Ecole Bilingue, a French-English bilingual school in Arlington,
Massachusetts, has a full day program for 3 and 4 year old English speakers to
introduce them to French so that they can enter the bilingual kindergarten with
some oral/aural facility in their second language. As an independent school
with a largely middle class group of students, the Ecole Bilingue constitutes a
classic example of 'elite bilingualism'--elective bilingualism achieved by
relatively privileged groups through education. While the success of the second
language learning in these cases can be somewhat variable, the high status of
the children's first language ensures that it will not be lost as the second
language is acquired. Another example of the use of immersion with preschool
aged children, one which is not an elite program, is presented in our case
study of the Maori in New Zealand, below. <p>
<p>
Programs which may seem very like those designed for the Maori or the children
at the Ecole Bilingue, except that they serve a less privileged segment of
society, include preschool programs in neighborhoods full of language
minorities. Spanish-speaking parents in New Haven, Connecticut and Turkish
speakers in West Germany send their children to preschool programs conducted in
English or German, languages the children first acquire in those group
settings. Such groups are actually experiencing something closer to submersion
than immersion, though, for a number of reasons. First, their second language
environment has not been planned as a pedagogical environment to be responsive
to their communicative and language-learning needs in the same way that
immersion environments are planned. Secondly, acquiring the second language for
these children is not a privilege, as for the Ecole Bilingue children, but a
necessity if they are to function in their new surroundings. The low status of
Spanish speakers in the U.S. and of Turkish speakers in Germany means, furthermore, that the children are very likely to
stop learning their native languages as they acquire the societal language in
these group care settings.<p>
	<p>
<b>Bilingual Preschools.</b> Bilingual programs are those in which two
languages are used by the teaching staff. Although children may enter speaking
only one language, they in principle emerge competent in both. Bilingual
programs have been used in a wide variety of settings with different purposes:
to ease the children's transition into the school language (transitional
programs), to maintain development of the home language while fostering
acquisition of the school language (maintenance programs), and to enable two
groups of children to both become bilingual (two-way programs). Preschool
programs that are explicitly bilingual are not common. The University of
Lowell, Massachusetts is initiating a program in 1990 which will provide
transitional bilingual classrooms for Cambodian and Hispanic 3-5 year olds; an innovative aspect of
this program is that these children will be in classrooms with each other and
with English speakers. The non-English speaking children will spend part of
each day receiving instruction in their native language and help with English,
while the English speakers receive a culture-language enrichment program. All
three groups of children will spend increasing amounts of time together as the
Cambodian and Spanish speakers learn more English; thus the native English
speakers can help the other children learn English while being exposed
themselves to a rich multicultural educational environment.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b> SOCIOLINGUISTIC DIMENSIONS</b><p>
<b>AFFECTING LANGUAGE CHOICE AND PROFICIENCY</b><p>
<b></b>	<p>
<p>
<p>
Language acquisition always occurs within a sociolinguistic context--a context
of language history, language use, and language planning. In stable, developed,
largely monolingual societies, these sociolinguistic forces may be relatively
transparent, but in multilingual societies and in societies where language
change is occurring they become quite salient. Decisions about language in
educational settings cannot ignore the broader social context in which the
educational program, the family, and the child learner operate. In this
section, we outline a number of sociolinguistic dimensions which may be
relevant to the success or failure of specific educational policies with regard
to language. The ways in which these sociolinguistic factors operate will be
different in every specific situation--we discuss them here simply to bring
them to the attention of those making decisions about language policy in
preschool, since they are almost sure to be relevant. These dimensions can be
divided into those relevant to a) the language itself, b) the group that speaks
it, or c) the language education program. In the next section, we present three
case studies that represent quite distinct and contrasting situations in terms
of these sociolinguistic dimensions.<p>
	<p>
<b>Language Status: Official or Unofficial.</b> More of the countries of the
world are multilingual than are monolingual. Multilingual societies typically
make decisions about which of the languages spoken by their citizens are
'official'--i.e., which language or languages will be used for governmental
functions, on radio and television, and in the schools. Sometimes, the
selection of a language or languages as official reflects an attempt to
downgrade other indigenous languages; in other cases this selection is a matter
of convenience, designed to facilitate nation-wide functioning, and under the
assumption that everyone will continue to use indigenous languages in addition
to the official language. <p>
	<p>
The impact of the status of a language as official or not on its role in
preschool education can be enormous. First, official languages are likely to be
used in later, formal schooling, and good control over them can provide access
to better jobs and higher education. Thus, they have higher status, and seem
worthy of more investment. Educational programs in unofficial languages may
suffer from the absence of an agreed upon writing system, the absence of a
variety of books or educational materials, and the absence of support from the
educational establishment. On the other hand, educational programs in the
official language may suffer from the unavailability of fluent native speakers,
from a history of reliance on rote-learning methods, and from a paucity of
interesting materials that are relevant to the local life.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Robust vs. Dying Language.</b> A number of the interesting cases in which
specific preschool language programs have been developed include cases where a
traditional language is dying. Languages die when their speakers grow old
without having passed the language on to their children. Language
revitalization (see the Maori case discussed below) involves an effort to
maintain a language by passing it on, not from parents to children, but from
elders (the only large remaining group of native speakers) to young children.
Language revitalization becomes necessary in a society where one of the
languages in use has come to dominate the other(s). English in New Zealand
shares the advantages of English in North America, in Scotland and Ireland, and
elsewhere in the world; it is an international language, it gives access to
participation in the international economy, it is crucial in New Zealand for
participation in government and higher education, it has been the language of
schooling there, and it has a long history of literate use. Situations of
bilingualism in which one of the languages has a wider array of uses, a
perceived higher status, a closer connection to the institutions of government
and of education, and a larger number of monolingual speakers may well lead to
death for the other language. Educational programs designed to counteract
language disappearance are revitalization programs if a generation of learners
has already been skipped, as in New Zealand, or maintenance programs if
introduced earlier in the cycle (see case study of the Western Isles presented
below).<p>
	<p>
<b>Written Language or Not</b>. Written languages are more likely to 'win out'
over traditionally nonliterate languages, both for general use in modern
societies and in particular for use in schooling. Much of schooling is about
literacy, and it has often been seen as impossible to conduct lessons in
languages which did not have an official script. For example, the introduction
of Papiamento as a curricular language in Cura&ccedil;ao and Aruba was
postponed for years while the issue of how to spell it was thrashed out--though
newspapers, novels, and poetry had been written in Papiamento and read widely
since the 1800's, the unavailability of an agreed upon spelling system blocked
the production of schoolbooks in the language. An advantage colonial languages
have over vernaculars for use in school is their long history of being written,
and of being used to convey scholarly material.<p>
	<p>
Although it might seem that the absence of a writing system should not be a
serious issue in selecting a language for preschool, it can have important
implications. One of the activities in preschools that prepare children for
success in formal schooling is exposure to books and practice in using the
local writing system (see above); the absence or paucity of materials available
in a traditionally unwritten language may cause problems. Adults may not feel
an unwritten language is appropriate for use in a setting that has any
connection to school. Adults who speak the local language well may still not be
used to reading or writing in it, and be unable to introduce these activities
easily to preschoolers.<p>
<b>Degree of Separateness From/Mutual Intelligibility with Other Languages.</b>
An issue affecting the viability of a local language is its relation to other
languages spoken in the same area. The question of what constitutes a separate
language and what constitutes a dialect is a very difficult one, with more
political than linguistic determinants. Some language varieties referred to as
dialects are not, in fact, mutually intelligible--e.g., the various, extremely
divergent Chinese dialects, which become mutually intelligible only in their
shared written form. Other varieties which for political or social reasons are
defended as quite separate languages are, in fact, fairly similar and generally
mutually intelligible, such as Norwegian and Swedish. The Chinese dialects
remain separate and viable precisely because the lack of mutual intelligibility
prevents the merging of populations at the dialect boundaries; Norwegian and
Swedish, on the other hand, remain separate primarily because of the political
and educational boundaries between them. The degree of similarity of the local
language to the national, official, or written language must be considered in
deciding on materials, on teachers, and on the variety to be used in the
classroom. <p>
	<p>
Another issue related to the degree of variability within a minority language
is whether the speakers of that language can effectively work together for
political, social, educational, or economic ends. In Peru, for example, the
major differences among the varieties of Quechua spoken have been one factor in
hindering the ability of the Quechua to work together.<p>
	<p>
An interesting case in which the issue of related but quite different language
varieties has been faced and resolved in planning preschool education was the
production of an Arabic-language version of Sesame Street. Although Arabic is
widely spoken in the Middle East and Northern Africa, the varieties of
vernacular Arabic used in the different countries vary considerably from one
another. Written Arabic is a representation of a formal, standard version of
the language that is not actually used for oral communication anywhere,
certainly not with preschool aged children, though classroom language
throughout the Arab world approximates the standard variety. It was decided to
use a simplified version of Modern Standard Arabic for Sesame Street, though
its use by characters like the Muppets in songs, verses, chants, and jokes
constituted a major cultural innovation. Nonetheless, the Arabic language
Sesame Street has been a great success, and parents have been pleased that
their children could be exposed at such a young age to the variety of Arabic
they would need in school and for reading.<p>
<p>
Importance of language in the social/cultural identity of its speakers.
Traditionally, a language was associated with a cultural/ethnic group. In the
modern world, a product of colonization, imperialism, multiple redrawings of
national boundaries, mergers of small separate groups into nations, and massive
migrations, such is no longer universally the case. A language that is
intrinsically tied to the social/cultural identity of its speakers cannot be
lost without some loss of identity. Some groups lose their traditional language
but maintain traditional values, ways of thinking, and a sense of themselves as
a separate group, e.g., many North American Indian groups who now speak English
without assimilating to the dominant culture. In other settings, e.g.,
Catalonia, maintenance and use of the traditional language is seen as central
to cultural identity, to the extent that immigrants to Catalonia who become
fluent in the language thereby achieve group membership.<p>
	<p>
<b>Number of Speakers.</b> Languages spoken by a small percentage of the people
in any society are, other things being equal, likely to disappear. Members of
these smaller groups must typically learn the majority language, simply in
order to survive in the larger society. These bilingual minority group members
then very often slip into mostly using the majority language with their
children, or their children refuse to use the traditional language with them.
Smaller groups retain their languages in situations where the speakers are
isolated from the majority community (e.g., Welsh Gaelic was retained in towns
with poor roads linking them to the cities), where they have exceptionally high
status and power (e.g., Afrikaans in South Africa), where the language is
needed for special purposes (e.g., German immigrants in the U.S. retained
German for use in church for several generations), where that language is a
language of wider communication outside the society in question (e.g., English
in Quebec), or where its association with the group's social/cultural identity
is so strong that consistent efforts are made to maintain it across generations
(e.g., Frisian in The Netherlands).<p>
	<p>
The fact that a language is used by a majority of the speakers in a community
does not assure its retention, of course. If those speakers constitute a low
status group, if the range of situations in which they can use their language
is small, and if they must all become bilingual in any case in order to
function in the larger society, then even a majority language can disappear.
Very often schooling in an official, though minority, language has speeded the
disappearance of the majority language. For example, like many upper and middle
class Indians, Rajiv Gandhi, the former Prime Minister, knew no indigenous
Indian language, having spoken English (clearly a minority language in India)
all his life. <p>
	<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Political/Economic Power of Speakers.</b> A language associated with a group
in power is likely to attract speakers, whereas a language associated even with
a large group that has little power is likely to lose speakers. In Quebec, for
example, a province where 85% of the population is French-speaking, immigrants
who spoke neither English nor French almost universally chose English schooling
for their children until the laws were changed to exclude this possibility.
English was a minority language, but the language of economic and political
power in Quebec; only radical legislation could reduce its power to attract new
speakers there. <p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Institutionalized or Grassroots Language Programs.</b> When considering the
choice of language for preschool classes, and the likely success or failure of
programs to teach, revitalize, or maintain languages, a major factor to
consider is the nature of the program. Grassroots language programs have the
support of the community, and are likely to generate enthusiasm and interest.
They may not have adequate financial support, nor access to materials, training
programs, and other sources of improvement. Institutionalized programs may be
more remote, less tuned in to the needs and desires of parents and of local
staff; they may, however, be able to provide more secure funding, an assurance
of continuation, and some links to the formal educational system preschool
graduates will eventually enter.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>THREE CASE STUDIES</b><p>
	<p>
<p>
<p>
In order to make the operation of these sociolinguistic dimensions of language
history and language use more concrete, we present here three fairly extensive
case studies of preschool language programs. All three deal with situations in
which a higher status national language has coexisted with an indigenous
language. In Peru, Spanish is the national language; though Quechua/Aymara (the
indigenous languages) are also official, they clearly have less status, their
speakers have less power, and both have several varieties which are not
mutually intelligible. Success in Peru requires functioning in schools where
Spanish is used; thus, all Quechua or Aymara speakers must become bilingual to
pursue their education or to function in urban areas. The educational programs
we discuss generally acknowledge these sociolinguistic facts; they are designed
as transitional programs, in which Quechua or Aymara and Spanish are both used
with the goal of aiding the children to learn Spanish and to achieve better in
the mainstream educational system. However, the Puno program we present fairly
extensively is a maintenance bilingual program. All these programs are
elementary programs; bilingual preschool education is virtually nonexistent in
Peru.<p>
	<p>
In the Western Isles, the traditional Gaelic has coexisted with English for
several generations. Most of the population is bilingual to at least some
degree. As discussed above, this is a situation in which the local language is
very likely to disappear. However, Gaelic-language preschools have been set up
as part of an attempt to use educational settings (elementary as well as
preschool programs) to strengthen Gaelic and to ensure the maintenance of
bilingualism against the inroads of English monolingualism.<p>
	<p>
The Maori case, in New Zealand, is one in which Maori language preschool
programs have been designed to reintroduce and revitalize a language on the
verge of disappearance. The Maori are a minority group with relatively low
status, little economic or political power, and high risk for educational
failure. Knowledge of the Maori language is widespread only in the older
generation. The language is, however, closely tied to Maori culture and
traditional ways of thinking; thus, the community is heavily invested in its
preservation.<p>
	<p>
We have selected these three cases because they are among the few which are
sufficiently richly documented, and they represent to some extent the different
sorts of situations which can be addressed by 'preschool language
planning'--the need for mother tongue education to promote academic success in
a second language, a program to protect a local, traditional language so as to
ensure maintenance of bilingualism, and a language revitalization program. None
of these cases deals with a situation where the preschool includes children of
heterogeneous language backgrounds (such as the Lowell program mentioned
above). Nor does any deal with a situation in which the community members
prefer their children receive early and exclusive exposure at school to the
majority language, as is the case among Bantu speakers in South Africa. Other
such situations are described more briefly in the annotated bibliography
appended to this report.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PERU: A SPANISH-QUECHUA/AYMARA TRANSITIONAL BILINGUAL PROGRAM</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<b>History</b><p>
<p>
Preschool education in Peru began in the 1930s in Lima as private facilities
for privileged children and was closely associated with "middle class values"
and the church. After the state assumed responsibility for preschool education
in 1941, the number of centers, teachers, and enrolled children increased
rapidly, but remained "irrelevant and unavailable" for "the vast majority of
children, namely those from rural Peru and the new migrants to Lima (van Leer
Foundation, 1986, p. 60). Up to 1969, there were only two higher training
centers for preschool teaching instructors (Iba&ntilde;ez Salazar, 1977).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Preschool Education Since 1972</b><p>
	<p>
With the 1972 Educational Reform introduced by the Revolutionary Government,
preschool education (by now institutionalized as educaci&oacute;n inicial) was
not only given unprecedented weight, but more importantly, a new objective: to
attend to the needs of children from underprivileged populations: the rural
poor and the ever growing number of migrants to Lima. Renamed "initial
education" it has since been provided in two forms: a) the formal mode of
schooling in government run centers called <b>centros de ense&ntilde;anza
inicial</b> (CEI) (initial teaching centers) where "cr&egrave;ches" are for
children up to age 3 and "kindergartens" for children from age 3 - 5; and b)
the non-formal initial education programs called <b>programas no escolarizadas
de educaci&oacute;n inicial</b> (PRONOEI) for 3 - 5 year olds (Ministerio de
Educaci&oacute;n, 1977). These are administered by a "special system which is
highly flexible as regards the aims, content, duration, timetables, staff,
premises, etc., thus affording immense scope for creativity, initiative and a
sense of responsibility on the part of those involved in them (Iba&ntilde;ez
Salazar, 1977, p. 551)." PRONOEI are meant to serve particularly those
communities for whom the normal (formal) teaching services are nonexistent or
inadequate. These include communities in remote rural areas as well as the ever
growing marginal urban settlements which in Peru are euphemistically called
"pueblos jovenes" (young towns). PRONOEI are officially under the supervision
of the Ministry of Education, and their general objectives and content are the
same as those of the formal programs (CEI). However, their organization is
sufficiently flexible to allow for the enormous differences in the various
areas of Peru. Indeed, it is one of their goals to provide an education that is
based on the diverse socioeconomic and cultural conditions of the specific area
or community. These programs are characterized by their emphasis on 
parental and community involvement from building the center to running it. The
latter is largely done by women from the community who have been trained as
so-called "animadoras" (promoters) and who receive continuous training and
support from so-called "coordinadoras," themselves professional preschool
teachers.<p>
<p>
<b>Experimental Pilot Project in Informal Initial Education </b><p>
(Description of this project is largely based on an article by L&oacute;pez,
1988. Quotes not otherwise identified refer to this article).<p>
	<p>
The "Experimental Pilot Project in Informal Initial Education (PROPEDEINE)" in
the Department of Puno has been running for almost 20 years. It marked the
beginning of systematic initial education for 3-6 year olds in Peru. By 1981
about 30% of rural children from the Department of Puno were enrolled. This
ongoing project has been supported by various development agencies, such as
CARITAS, AID and UNICEF. According to Hornberger (1989b), however, support has
consisted mainly of the donation of building materials for the so-called Wawa
Wasi or Wawa Uta (meaning the "children's house" in Quechua and Aymara
respectively, Iba&ntilde;ez Salazar, 1977) and the training of promoters of
community origin to run the program in the community.<p>
	<p>
One of its principal characteristics is parent and community involvement. The
"promotores" (teacher/caregivers) come from the communities and are native
speakers of Quechua or Aymara. But, although they as well as the children speak
an indigenous first language, "neither its maintenance nor cultivation nor that
of the expressions of rural culture are stimulated ... (p. 34)." On the
contrary, the program's objective is to prepare the children for entrance into
the Spanish-language school. As L&oacute;pez points out, "the PROPEDEINE is
based on an ideological concept of cultural and linguistic homogenization and
supports rapid assimilation of the Aymara [and Quechua] individual into the
mainstream society" (p. 39). Not only does this approach mean a tremendous
neglect of these children's rich linguistic and cognitive potential and
creativity, but it moreover constitutes difficulties for those (many)
indigenous "promotores" whose Spanish is not adequate and who are not given any
training in teaching Spanish as a second language. Notwithstanding the
importance of this project must not be underestimated. It is the only of its
kind in this large and poor rural area that provides education for 3 to 6 year
olds. Moreover, it provides them daily with food. <p>

<b>Van Leer Foundation Projects</b><p>
	<p>
A special report (van Leer Foundation, 1986) gives an overview of the
Foundation's involvement in non-formal early education in Peru, in particular
its project in Ate-Vitarte, an area of poor neighbourhoods on the outskirts of
Lima: it helped establish 31 PRONOEI and train more than a hundred mothers as
"animadoras" between 1979 and 1984. Upon request of the Ministry of Education,
a dissemination phase followed in which the project's center was taken as the
basis for a National Center for the training of non-formal preschool educators.
This has become the National Training Center under the Ministry of Education.
<p>
	<p>
<p>
<p>
Articles in the van Leer Foundation July 1989 and October 1989 Newsletters
report on two projects supported by van Leer and in cooperation with the
Ministry of Education. Both are operated by the <b>Centro Nacional de
Capacitaci&oacute;n Docente en Educaci&oacute;n No Escolarizada</b> (National
Preschool Education Training Center, the above mentioned National Training
Center). One is concerned with "Transfer of Preschool Training Methods," the
other one with developing "Strategy for the transition between preschool and
the early years of primary school." Both projects involve training people who
then train preschool staff <b>and</b> primary school teachers. The training
methods used are characterized as "action-reflection-action" and
"investigation-action" and the PRONOEI of Ate-Vitarte help as field sites.<p>
	<p>
Within the larger activities of these projects, the latest has been a small
action/research program specifically concerned with language. It was carried
out in four communities in the Ate-Vitarte area. In three sites, both children
and parents participated in the programs; in the fourth there was no parent
component. We summarize the program's main observations and recommendations in
the following: <p>
<p>
1) <b>Children's and Parents' Language:</b> Language of the children (both in
Spanish and in Quechua) was "very limited" (p.7). One cause was that parents'
language skills were "not so good."<p>
<p>
2) <b>Improving Parent-Child Communication:</b><p>
<b></b>One of the project's priorities is to encourage parents to talk to the
children, tell them stories, stimulate the children's language. The hope is
that this will develop a bond between parent and child and that the child will
communicate more. The aim is to "create the conditions where parents could help
their children to enrich their language." [The report does not specify whether
parents are encouraged to speak in Quechua or Spanish].<p>
3) <b>Spanish as L2:</b> The project would like to "give a form of gradual
learning of Spanish, not forced (p.8)."<p>
<p>
4) <b>Reading and Writing:</b> The team is planning a teaching method for
reading and writing "based on oral Spanish where first the child has a period
in which he or she listens to Spanish words and speaks them and afterwards the
ability [?] to read and write is brought in (p.8)." [This is unclear: the
phrasing seems to indicate that there is an ability to read and
write--presumably in Quechua, but from the context of the article the
reading/writing teaching is in Spanish]. The main point seems to be a change in
methods: from mechanical/repetitive to comprehension-based and situational.
"The method" has been prepared for first grade and the team is working on
adapting it for use in second grade.<p>
<p>
5) <b>Trainers' Language:</b> The person who is developing the methods for
teaching reading and writing speaks Quechua, but "most of the team don't [which
makes it] very difficult to set up this approach."<p>
<p>
6) <b>Preliminary results of actively promoted parent involvement in
child-parent communication:</b> <p>
	 the language of all children improved in some way;<p>
	 five year olds' language improved more than younger ones';<p>
<p>
	 children's language improved more in the three groups where parents  were
involved;<p>
<p>
	 fathers' attitudes towards their children changed (more involvement and
awareness of being role models).<p>
<p>
Except for the fact that this was an action/research approach, details on the
methods of data collection and analysis are not given.<p>
	<p>
Perhaps more important than the results themselves is the fact that here for
the first time in the Foundation's involvement in preschool education in Peru,
"language" is addressed as a major issue, and specific reference is made to the
bilinguality of the children involved. <p>
	<p>
The relative "lateness" of addressing this issue is astounding in view of the
fact that Peru has already had a comparatively long history of bilingual
education programs (i.e. since the early 1970s), some of which have been
described and analyzed in great detail (e.g. the "Projecto Experimental de
Educaci&oacute;n Biling&uuml;e"-Puno, henceforth PEEB). However, this
"lateness" or neglect is by no means limited to the van Leer Foundation: <p>
<p>
Referring to the work in education in the Department of Puno, Hornberger
comments on the "distressing paradox that there has been a major pre-primary
education program with support from UNICEF, and US AID that is <b>not</b>
bilingual, often in the same community with the Bilingual Education Project
(PEEB), beginning in grade 1." (personal communication, 5/19/89) Hornberger,
for example, observed a teacher of one preschool class, who, upon her
supervisor's instructions, conducted her classes only in Spanish (including
teaching rhymes!) although she was fluent in Quechua. The children's response
was "uniformly unencouraging": either they did not respond at all, or they
occasionally repeated the last word of an often repeated Spanish phrase in
chorus (Hornberger, 1989b). <p>
	<p>
<p>
Not all preschool teachers, however, even speak the mother tongue of the
children they teach. This was the case in a preschool in Pichacani, a community
in the Department of Puno, in November 1988:<p>
<p>
<i>We had gone to visit a PEEB school in this community and during lunch break
were spontaneously invited to the preschool, located almost next door. The two
preschool teachers had time and agreed to talk with us. One of them told us she
spoke some Aymara, but only used it in the classroom as a "last resort" (i.e.
if otherwise communication would have broken down completely); the other
teacher spoke no Aymara, but said she wanted to learn it, because it was
necessary. One leaned more towards "Spanish only" - because "the children will
have to learn it any way," whereas the other one saw merit in using Aymara,
because "communication would be better." Neither was, however, fervently
defending her position, and both agreed that "the parents don't want it"
[Aymara in the classroom]. Printed materials in the two rooms were in Spanish
and most pictures on the walls represented non-Indian people and reality quite
removed from that of these Highland Indian children. (Heise-Baigorria, 1988,
fieldnotes).</i><p>
<p>
On a different note, we should mention the results of some psycholinguistic
research of four year olds in Lima and Tacna: Using the <b>Illinois Test of
Psycholinguistic Abilities</b> (Kirk et al., 1969), Zavala Aparicio (1982)
compared psycholinguistic abilities of four year olds in urban areas of Lima
and Tacna, both with and without (or only minimal) access to basic commodities
(such as water, sewerage, electricity, transportation, health services,
schools). The main conclusions of this study were that:<p>
1) "Access" vs. "minimal or no access" to commodities had a significant effect
on all measured psycholinguistic abilities of these four year olds: children
with access scored significantly

higher on all measures than did children without access;<p>
2) Whether the children were from the (coastal) LIMA area or the
(south-eastern-Andean) TACNA area did not make any significant difference.<p>
	<p>
Two additional observations are notable. First, there is no reference to any
kind of preschool program, and whether any of the children of either group did
or did not participate in a preschool program is uncertain. Second, in the
"with access" group, parents were mostly monolingual Spanish speakers, whereas
a large part of parents of the "without/minimal access" group were bilingual
(42% Quechua-Spanish in the Lima sample, 76% Aymara-Spanish in the Tacna
sample). Looking at the "no significant differences" in outcomes when Lima and
Tacna are compared, but at the much higher incidence of bilingual parents in
the Tacna sample, we could conclude that the areas' linguistic composure in
terms of parents' monolingualism or bilingualism did not matter. If this
conclusion were to be accepted, one might go a step further and assume that it
does not matter whether a possible (existent or future) preschool program is
monolingual or bilingual and that the only relevant variable is "access to
services." But then, these [services] include schools [and presumably preschool
centers], which entangles the variables even more. What we can safely deduct
from this research is that a) "access" is <b>one</b> significant factor for
psycholinguistic language ability and b) that it might be quite risky to come
to policy decisions based on a hasty evaluation of research even when this is
experimental in design and based on familiar and generally accepted "Western"
paradigms.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Conclusions</b><p>
	<p>
In some ways, Peru would seem to have outstanding pre-requisites for
establishing language maintenance preschool programs, in fact remarkably more
than other countries with similar multilingual backgrounds and similar levels
of economic development: <p>
<p>
1) Since the early 1970s, preschool education has been considered a priority
for governmental efforts in education and there is a well established system of
preschool education. The importance given to preschool is--in the bureaucratic
realm of the Ministry of Education--reflected by elevating the former Office of
Early Childhood Education to the level of General Department (Direcci&oacute;n
General), the highest ministerial level. <p>
<p>
2) Apart from a formal mode of preschool education, there is a wide-spread
decentralized net of non-formal preschool education centers which stand and
fall with community involvement. These centers' programs are (at least in
theory) based on the socioeconomic and cultural realities of the communities
they serve.<p>
<p>
<p>
3) "Bilingual education" (in conjunction with the officialization of Quechua)
has been one of the cornerstones of the Revolutionary Government's education
reform in the early seventies. Though much of the fervor had been lost in the
late 70s and early 80s, and the Constitution of 1979, for example, markedly
de-emphasized the need for the teaching of Quechua, "bilingual education" has
once again gained status within the Ministry. One indication is the elevation
of the Office of Bilingual Education to the level of General Department
(Direcci&oacute;n General) in 1987. (See the same occurrence under 1). Much to
its advantage, the director of this new General Department is not only an
educator, but a former longtime team member of the PEEB-Puno. Bilingual primary
education is not a rarity any longer in many areas of Peru; a lot of it is
considered successful at least at the classroom level (Hornberger and many
others), and many teachers and teacher representatives from indigenous language
areas testify to the <b>need</b> for bilingual education.<p>
<p>
4) Whereas in many countries, preschool and primary education belong to
different organizations, in Peru, both are part of the Ministry of Education
(and are located in the same building). This should prove an enormous
advantage: as we have pointed out elsewhere, continuity between preschool and
primary education is particularly important for language development, and it is
therefore highly desirable to adopt language policies geared towards language
program continuity. This kind of integrated approach is much more difficult
where the two levels of education are administered by different entities.
Moreover, where the latter is the case, preschool education is usually the
responsibility of the Welfare Department (or a similar entity) and is thus
almost automatically considered not only "compensatory," but of inferior
status. <p>
	<p>
However, being under the same ministerial administration unfortunately does not
<b>guarantee</b> that continuity of programs is achieved (or even planned).
Such is the case in Peru, and we must conclude that there are other factors
which hinder (and conversely might foster) first the acceptance and then the
realization of an "integrated approach." Two such factors are the allocations
of funds and political instability.<p>
<p>
With respect to the allocation of funds, financial resources are severely
limited and must be distributed among different departments in the Ministry of
Education. The priority positions given preschool and bilingual education in
the reform area of the early 70s did not find reflection in adequate financial
support. In the case of preschool education in particular, the government put
into effect a policy based largely on community participation, and bilingual
education projects were to a large extent financed with the help of foreign
aid. Until the mid seventies, the government's investment in infrastructure had resulted primarily in the construction and
outfitting of classrooms, equipment improvement for basic education schools,
renovation of equipment in 22 State Universities and the very costly "launching
of 24 Upper Schools for Professional Education," the so-called ESEPs
(Ministerio de Educaci&oacute;n, 1977). (The ESEPs were abolished within a
decade).<p>
	<p>
By political instability, we mean that the idea of revaluing the indigenous
populations was not followed through, the official positive attitude towards
Quechua as a national language did not last, and inconsistent attention was
given rural (and in particular rural bilingual) education. All this, because
the political outlook changed. With the end of the first phase of the
Revolutionary Government which had--at least on paper--brought about an
educational reform which was researched and acclaimed worldwide, interest in
bilingual education and preschool education subsided. With the last two
governments, preschool education became again a focal point of interest, but it
took much longer for bilingual education to be a priority once again.
Considering the volatile political situation Peru has been in since the early
eighties, it is difficult to make predictions on what will be priorities in
education in the near future.<p>
	<p>
An example from the van Leer Foundation projects gives an indication how the
political situation can force a change not only of strategy, but beyond that of
the core of the program: Instead of continuing to go to the province of
Andahuaylas, a remote area in the Andes, the project started to bring potential
trainers (capacitadores) to Lima. This new approach seems to us to undermine
exactly some of the "beauty" of the project which by being in Andahaylas had
(probably) somehow shown "respect" for and "revalued" this remote rural Andean
area. Typically, in Peru, there is a strong tendency to appreciate things that
come from Lima, and give little or no credit to something from rural areas.
This program had set out to approach things differently, but could not follow
through because of the increasing (real) dangers presented by the ever stronger
terrorist movement "Sendero Luminoso" (Shining Path). Unfortunately, this
change of strategy also directly affects the issue of language: the further
away from remote Andean areas, the less perceived is the need to develop
programs that foster the use of Quechua and/or Aymara. Incidentally, the
PEEB-Puno did not venture any more into all areas where it had gone before,
either. (Heise-Baigorria, 1988, fieldnotes.)<p>
	<p>
At present, the situation in Peru's large Amazonian region (where the
linguistic situation is much more complex than in the Andean region) is one of
confusion, too. This region is attracting more and more migrants from the Andes
because of the promise of employment in the coca-growing business. (Morales,
1989). The language situation for these migrants becomes even more complex, and
any kind of language maintenance model more difficult. <p>
<p>
Moreover, the situation of teachers here is even more precarious in face of the
dominating presence of both the large-scale coca-growers and Sendero Luminoso
which is tied into the coca-growing business. Representatives of Amazonian
provinces restated this over and over at the aforementioned bilingual education
seminar in Lima.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>WESTERN ISLES, SCOTLAND: A GAELIC MAINTENANCE PROGRAM</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
The Western Isles extend over an area of 120 miles from north to south and
consist of many islands of strikingly different size; the two largest being
Lewis and Harris. "Western Isles" became a local government unit in 1975. The
newly formed Islands Council brought together all the islands which had
formerly been administered by two separate mainland authorities. "Western
Isles" is a rural, sparsely populated area, which includes many small and
isolated communities. Access to some communities is quite difficult. Principal
occupations include crofting, fishing and sheep farming. In some areas
unemployment is as high as 20%, and emigration is on the rise. With continued
emigration, the age structure of the population is changing, and this has had
an effect on formal education (see document A), though not [yet?] on the
non-formal preschool provisions which we will discuss here. <p>
<p>
<i>While this area cannot be described as socially or culturally disadvantaged
in terms applied to Third World Countries, the sparsity of population, related
to the absence of a strong economic infra-structure, does mean that children
(and their parents) in the community do not have access to the wide range of
educational opportunities available in other parts of the country. (Document C,
p. 4.)</i><p>
<i> </i><p>
<p>
<b>Linguistic Situation and History of Bilingual Education</b><p>
<p>
(Page numbers in this section refer to Murray, 1984, unless 
otherwise noted).<p>
	<p>
Of a total population of approximately 30.000, 82% of Western Islanders are
Gaelic/English bilingual.  There is considerable variation in the degree of
bilingualism and the use of Gaelic or English as home/community language. The
case studies reported in Murray (1984) highlight this range: in one case, for
example, the children's use of English is confined to the school, whereas in
another one, the children's use of Gaelic is confined to the school (p. 157).
In the past (that is until about 1975 "when Scotland joined the growing list of
countries conducting pilot programmes of bilingual education (p. 1)," schools
in the Western Isles had been an "anglicising force ... alienating children
from their linguistic and cultural background (p. 10)." In schools with
predominantly Gaelic-speaking children, many teachers had been using Gaelic
long before the issue of bilingual education was brought up, but only "[out] of
necessity ... [and] only as a bridge until such time as the children acquired
sufficient English for Gaelic to be abandoned 

as a teaching and learning medium (p. 16)."  The dilemma teachers found
themselves in is poignantly described in Murray and worth quoting here in full,
because it is transferable to teachers in many parts of the world where
children's home language is different from their school language:<p>
<p>
<i>...because the educational system had not in the past considered Gaelic as
one's mother tongue a "positive contribution," schools had been led to regard
strength in Gaelic as weakness in English, to concentrate upon teaching English
and through English from the earliest stage as a means of compensating children
for an imagined 'lack' in their background. Teachers in bilingual areas were
themselves educated in this way; their professional training took virtually no
account of the existence of bilingualism. Thus they found themselves in their
classrooms perplexed by contradictory pressures. On the one hand, they were
being asked to practice a relevant, child-centred method; on the other, they
felt they had to teach through English only, to relegate the stronger language
of the child to a language-lesson compound... (P 16).</i><p>
		<p>
What this 'language-lesson compound' might have entailed is described by one
teacher as follows: "A few years ago [before the bilingual education project]
there were gasps of dismay from the children and sighs of despair from me when
it was time for Gaelic on the timetable (p. 151)." <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Bilingual (Primary) Education</b><p>
<p>
Bilingual (primary) education and community-based preschool emerged at around
the same time (in the middle 70s) in the Western Isles, but not related to each
other. The bilingual education project for <b>primary schools</b>, sponsored by
the Western Isles Islands Council and the Scottish Education Department, began
as a three-year pilot program in 1975 and ended, after a second phase, in 1981.
A detailed account of this project is in Murray, 1984, from which we have
quoted above, as it provides valuable information on the background which is
the same for the preschool education project. As we are concerned primarily
with preschool education, our focus in the following is on the preschool
project. However, we will refer to the bilingual [primary] education project,
when warranted, particularly in light of the fact that dis/continuity between
preschool and primary education is a major issue for language maintenance
programs, as we discuss elsewhere. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Community Education Project</b><p>
	<p>
In 1976, the Bernard van Leer Foundation initiated a project in the Western
Isles which was to become known as the <b>Community Education</b>
<b>Project</b> (henceforth referred to as the "preschool project" to avoid
confusion with the bilingual education project). This project is of interest to
us first of all because of its Gaelic language preschool playgroups and efforts
in Gaelic materials production. In addition it illustrates how difficulties can
arise--and also the potential that is there--when different projects work in
the same area at the same time, and when a community-based project is about to
be incorporated into an institution. <p>
	<p>
<b>Program's Components.</b> In the first 5-year phase, the project
concentrated its efforts on a range of community developments as well as the
establishing and growth of local preschool groups. Initiatives on one island,
for example, included establishing the area's first local Historical Society, a
community co-operative, a club for physically disabled elderly people, a
playgroup, and a mother and toddler group.<p>
	<p>
In the second (and final) 5-year phase, work with adults of the community
remained basic, but the earlier broadly based approach was replaced by one of
narrower focus on parent and early childhood education. Specific efforts during
the course of the project revolved around four areas which we will briefly call
'parent networking', 'Gaelic language playgroups', 'materials production' and
'project-school-linkages'. These are described in the following:<p>
<p>
(1) Parent networking included: an islands-wide network for parents of young
children; establishment of home - school links; and several parents' forums
which drew participants from the preschool groups' parents and served all
islands. Basic to these efforts was the idea to overcome the isolation of
parents with young children. The forums, in particular, served to disseminate
preschool education-related information as well as stimulate exchange of
concerns and ideas regarding practical preschool problems as well as family and
broader social issues (Document A, p. 11). As a culmination to these efforts,
the third annual all-islands seminar in 1986 established the "Guth nam Parant"
(Voice of the Parents), a Western isles association which became a strong
interest group and played a significant role in the final stage of the project
(see below).<p>
<p>
(2) Gaelic language playgroups: During its lifetime, the project helped
establish 52 preschool playgroups. These are run by parents, and emphasis is on
the use of Gaelic. A 1985 external evaluation considered "the network of
preschool groups [as] clearly the major success of the project so far" (as
quoted in Document C, p. 3). Unfortunately, in none of the documents obtained
are these playgroups described in detail, and it is not clear to what extent
the use of Gaelic was systematically supported and enhanced, except that we
know of the specific efforts made in developing Gaelic language materials (see
below). (We will discuss the issue of language further in the conclusions.) <p>
<p>
(3) Materials production: The project developed a scheme for producing
materials of local relevance, "particularly with regard to Gaelic, which can be
used by preschool groups and the early primary classes [and] can provide an
element of continuity for the children and potential common ground for parents
and teachers." (Document A.) In cooperation with local schools and the
bilingual education project (see E), the preschool project developed a series
of Gaelic language materials, including a cassette with Gaelic rhymes and songs
(E). According to (A), "some excellent materials have been produced which have
been welcomed by schools, and are valuable tools for the field staff (p.
12)."<p>
<p>
(4) Project-school linkages:	Besides the above mentioned cooperation in Gaelic
language materials production, the preschool project assisted 13 primary
schools to run a programme of visits by parents and children in 1984 and 1985.
These were visits to the schools in which the children were about to be
enrolled. In 1986, these 13 and further 8 schools were offered the same
assistance, but only eleven pre-entry meetings were held. According to the
Inspector's 1987 report, this low response illustrates the primary schools
varied attitudes towards parental involvement. While this might certainly be
so, another issue might well be an inadequate system of cooperation between the
preschool project and the primary schools. <p>
<p>
<b>The Issue of Language </b><p>
	<p>
The foundation's newsletter states that "The focus [...] has been to encourage
the use of the Gaelic language and culture to overcome many of the problems
traditionally identified with disadvantage (D, p. 15)." However, in the
project's Final Year Work Plan, 'Gaelic language and culture' is not among the
five aims in the 'initial set of Project aims' for the second phase (1983 -87).
(Document B, p. 1.) Although there is no strong goal statement as to the
maintenance of Gaelic, this same work plan refers to former, and suggests
future, specific language-related actions: It mentions the "successful Project
initiative in Breasclete [on the isle of Lewis] which led to the forming of a
Gaelic preschool group [which] in turn [has] led to the creation of the Western
Isles first Gaelic medium primary education unit." This is difficult to
understand in view of Murray's account that the bilingual education project
began before the Foundation's preschool project. The Final Year Work Plan
further states that "the Project will respond positively to requests received
from groups to run Gaelic lessons for mothers and children simultaneously in
preschool groups where there are large 
numbers of Gaelic learners. This, and the pressures coming from parents for
Gaelic medium education are obviously areas where the fullest co-operation is
required between the Project and the Bilingual Primary Staff Tutors." (ibid.)
[These tutors are a component of the bilingual education program, see Murray,
1984.] <p>
<p>
<b>Conclusions</b><p>
	<p>
The evidence gathered from the various kinds of documents consulted, including
the account of the bilingual education project, suggests that this project was
successful in a) establishing sound community-based early childhood provisions,
b) co-producing useful educational materials of local relevance, particularly
with regard to Gaelic, and c) building a very strong parent network across the
Western Isles. <p>
	<p>
During its 10-year existence, there were, of course, some rather usual
difficulties of implementation, such as difficult accessibility to remote
places, initial parents' reluctance to participate, and having to deal with a
variety of actors and institutions. However, apart from these, it seems that
the main problem--and one that was eventually not overcome--was a certain lack
of co-operation between this project and the education authorities [and their
project]. Even the accounts as to when and how the project started differ
depending on who wrote them. According to the Murray account (Document E), a
feasibility study for the preschool project was begun in 1977, and it was
planned within the Education Department of the Western Isles Islands Council
(WIIC) in consultation with the Bilingual Education Project [which itself was
started in September 1975] and other bodies such as the Scottish Education
Department and the University of Aberdeen. Document C also describes the
project as a joint undertaking of the Western Isles Islands Council (WIIC) and
the van Leer Foundation. Document D, however, mentions "partnership with WICC"
as from 1983 on. (A) speaks of a degree of separation between the Project and
the Education Department that has not always been beneficial to either. The
transition and integration of the project into the WIIC's education department
at the end of the second five-year project phase did not work out as the
Foundation had wished for. Not even a compromise was reached; "the Council
kill[ed] off the project (D)." In a final move, the Foundation gave the money
that had been earmarked for the very Council (WIIC) for the transition period
to the recently established parent association ("Guth nam Parant" or "Voice of
the Parents"). Thus, in the end, despite lengthy negotiations for a smooth
transition neither the Foundation itself, nor the Council continued the work of
the project. [Guth nam Parant intended to use the funds "to strengthen the
existing 52 preschool playgroups and improve communications and training
amongst the parents of young children in the Western Isles (D)"]. Synthesizing
information from the various documents, it 
seems to me that two issues were of paramount importance to the 
Council, but not the main issues of the foundation's project: 1) the use of
Gaelic as the first language (including a "bridge programme" to help support
<b>secondary</b> gaelic medium education) and <p>
<p>
2) establishing and enhancing stronger links between the preschool children
(and their parents) and their local primary schools. This apparent discrepancy
in goals and the inability to work out a common denominator might have been
among the main factors that led to the rather unfortunate end of this project.
However, a much more detailed analysis would be needed to substantiate this
assumption. <p>
	<p>
Two final comments: First, if it had not been for the variety of documents
consulted, description of this project might have turned out quite one-sided.
It is a case in point that in general a "one-source-only" view of any project
or program might be limited and that it is important to consider what kind of
source was consulted. Second, reading the account of the bilingual [primary]
education project (Document E) is recommended not only for those interested in
primary education: a number of issues apply similarly to preschool. The "why"
and "how to" of the desired "role changes" for Gaelic (from being a "necessary
evil" in a dual-medium situation to becoming an equally appreciated and
mastered language) are vividly reported and a recurring theme in language
preservation and revitalization efforts in preschool and primary school
alike.<p>

<b>NEW ZEALAND: A MAORI REVITALIZATION PROGRAM</b><p>
	<p>
<p>
<p>
The Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. They are now approximately
10% of the population and a higher percent of the country's children. <p>
	<p>
Since 1982, a network of more than 500 Maori language immersion
preschools--language `nests', Te Kohanga Reo (TKR)--have been established from
an initiative of the Dept. of Maori Affairs. In September, 1988 a bilingual,
bicultural government review team, acting at the request of the Social Equity
Committee of the Cabinet, issued their report, "Language is the life force of
the people." Unless otherwise indicated, our summary here is taken from that
document.<p>
	<p>
TKR was started by the Department of Maori Affairs in response to Maori concern
to ensure the continuing survival of the Maori language. As of March, 1988,
they serve some 8000 children, approximately 15% of Maori children under five,
the age when formal education begins in New Zealand. 7% of the enrollees are
under one year. The aim of the coordinating body, Te Kohanga Reo National Trust
(hereafter, the Trust) is to include 75% of the Maori preschoolers within 10
years. TKR is a significant part of three social movements: Maori language
revitalization, Maori development more generally, and New Zealand preschool
education.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>History</b><p>
	<p>
The 1840 Treaty of Waitangi between Maori chiefs and representatives of the
British crown is now interpreted as establishing a bicultural partnership
between Maori and Pakeha (the non-Polynesian, European, or `white' population).
But that interpretation is an important change from previous governmental
policies of cultural and linguistic assimilation (Kennedy, 1989). During the
1960's and `70's, Maori people began to take stronger action in pressing their
claims to increased rights of self-determination and a fairer share of the
country's resources.<p>
	<p>
By the late 1970's, survival of the Maori language--a single language spoken by
all New Zealand tribes--had become a major Maori concern. Governmental policies
of discouraging or even forbidding use of the language, migration from rural
Maori communities into cities in search of jobs, and television had all taken
their toll. National meetings of Maori elders in 1979 and 1980 affirmed the
importance of language, Te Reo, and asked the Department of Maori Affairs to
make language a policy priority for 1981. In response, TKR was begun: a program
for young children from birth to school age of immersion in Maori language and
values.<p>
	<p>
<p>
Administratively, each TKR and its whanau (extended family in the broadest
sense) is accountable to the Trust, established in 1982 as a charitable trust
to facilitate a partnership between the people and Government. It receives
administrative support from the Department of Maori Affairs and, since 1984-5,
help from the Department of Labor for adult whanau training.<p>
	<p>
The most common center size is 10-19 children. Only 10% of the adults involved
in the centers are paid, and some TKR have no paid staff. Half of the centers
are located on marae, traditional Maori land and building for both religious
and secular functions; others are in community centers, public schools,
churches and private homes. They have been funded by a combination of operating
grants from the Department of Maori Affairs through the Trust on a per center
basis, regardless of number of children or hours open, and koha (donations)
from each family and from the whanau and tribe. <p>
	<p>
Each center is formally and financially accountable to the Trust. In the
mainstream Pakeha world, it is this aspect of accountability that is stressed.
But in Maori culture, accountability has cultural aspects as well. Members of
TKR whanau expressed to the government review team a sense of urgency about the
need to maintain and reaffirm the Maori language and culture. "They feel they
have to get it right, because in the long term there may not be time for a
second chance at this important kaupapa [objectives, principles].... Therefore
they give what is needed, although this is often more than they can afford:
time, labor, food, building materials, educational supplies and money
(Government Review, p. 42)."<p>
	<p>
During 1989, as part of a reorganization of New Zealand government structures
and functions, the Department of Maori Affairs was transformed into a Ministry
of Maori Affairs with power only to make policy. Implementing policies in
actual programs has been devolved and decentralized to tribal structures
throughout the country. These will presumably become the responsible
authorities for TKR operations.<p>
	<p>
As of February, 1990, the funding base will also change. Government allocations
for TKR will be put on the same footing as other early childhood education
programs. Each center will receive funds on a child per session basis, with a
higher rate for children under two years (<i>The Dominion</i>, August 28, 1989,
p. 5).<p>

<b>The Program</b><p>
	<p>
At the time of the government review, no official statement of the philosophy
and principals of TKR existed in written form. The review team concluded from
oral and written testimonies and from available literature that the aims of TKR
are:<p>
<p>
<i>children will learn the Maori language and culture, including the spiritual
dimension, through immersion;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>language and cultural learning will be fostered and supported for all
members of the kohanga reo whanau [the extended family, traditionally based on
kinship, but now often extended beyond such ties in cities];</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>members of the kohanga reo whanau will learn a range of other skills (for
example, administration) within the whanau setting;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>collective responsibility for the administration and operations of the
kohange reo will be fostered through whanau development;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>the content, context and control of learning will be Maori (Government
Review, p. 21).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
It is clear from this list of objectives that the program aims to empower and
re-educate adults as well as nurture and educate children.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Learning for Adults</b><p>
	<p>
To achieve both aims, training programs for adult members of the whanau are
essential. The need for more bilingual and bicultural caregivers is the most
urgent concern. Caregivers must be fluent speakers, native to both language and
culture. In some communities, such caregivers are in short supply. In addition,
some people believe that training in child development and teaching skills
would also be desirable qualifications.<p>
	<p>
Adult members of the whanau also need education in the larger objectives of
Maori development. Sometimes conflicts have arisen between fluent speakers,
usually women elders, and younger parents. "The fluent speakers came from a
secure Maori base and were bilingual and bicultural. The parents wanted access
to this cultural security, but came at it from a monolingual and monocultural
base (Government Review, p. 22)." Such parents often expected that TKR would be
just like mainstream New Zealand preschool except for a change of language from
English to Maori.<p>
<p>
In response to such conflicts, the Trust developed a syllabus to facilitate
adult whanau learning. It outlined modules of knowledge and practical training
that totaled 900 hours. Course objectives are:<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To develop the values inherent in Maori language and culture;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To develop fluency in Maori language;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To gain an understanding of language development in children;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To acquire a sound knowledge of Tikanga Maori (Maori customs) and the
effects of such knowledge on the spiritual, cognitive, and social development
of children;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To enhance the effects of Maori life in contact with Western culture;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To gain experience in the shared care of children in a Kohanga Reo
Centre;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To develop the ability to observe, record, interpret and evaluate situations
relating to child development and whanau management (TKR Trust Certificate
Syllabus, p. 5).</i><p>
<i></i>	<p>
According to the government review, TKR whanau across the country consist
mostly of women. This is of concern for a number of reasons:<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>The women are carrying the load;<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The KR whanau will be denied the skills and expertise of the men;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The men are left behind by the learning of their women and children;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>There is a danger that children will grow up to perceive that whanau means
women;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Most importantly, the kaupapa [principles and philosophy] demands that the
whole whanau, both men and women, should be involved (Government Review, p.
25).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
There is general agreement that Maori women have carried a very heavy load in
the TKR movement during these eight years. But there is also general agreement
that this work, whether paid or unpaid, has entailed great learning about Maori
language and culture, administrative and organizational skills, and a sense of
personal and public empowerment. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Learning for Children</b><p>
	<p>
One observer writing in 1983 summarized her understanding of TKR objectives for
children:<p>
<p>
<i>The philosophy of the kohanga reo revolves around the desire of the Maori
people to `stand tall' and to overcome adversity by producing a generation of
bilingual and bicultural children who are capable of interacting in the Maori
and pakeha world. Within this framework, the primary kaupapa is the promotion
of the Maori language and Maori whanau values in a caring environment where
children are lovingly ensconced by Maori speaking persons. For the child the
ability to speak Maori is seen as stimulating a pride of race, a growth of
personality, character and morals as well as an awareness of a positive
self-image. Alongside the development of language, the kohanga is expected to
develop the practical skills of the child at the social and cognitive level in
order to facilitate entry into school on an equal basis. Taken together, the
ultimate objective of the kohanga is nothing less than the renaissance of the
Maori as an equal but separate component in the mosaic of New Zealand society
(Fleras, 1983, pp. 9-10).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Beyond a shared set of general objectives for children as well as adults, there
has been no attempt to standardize TKR centers around the country. The result
is considerable variation in materials, activities and teaching practices. We
know of only one evaluation of children's learning, and that only of the
acquisition of Maori language skills in one of the first centers after two
years of operation (Smith, 1984).<p>
	<p>
From the outset of the TKR movement, Maori people realized that the transition
of graduates into the public school would pose many problems. The whanau want
schooling to follow on, and build on, the learning experienced in the preschool
centers, particularly the 
learning of, and in, Maori language. But this can only happen with considerable
school support. Otherwise:<p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>The learning environment, linguistically and culturally, ceases to be
Maori;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The children become a Maori minority and experience whakama (shyness) about
their status;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Learning becomes secular and is divorced from its spiritual dimension;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Learning no longer takes place in a whanau context; children are separated
from each other and from siblings and adult members of their whanau;</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The teachers are no longer Maori, so role models are lost (Government
Review, p. 44).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
A Pakeha linguist whose research documented the decline in Maori language
speakers and thus contributed to the initiation of TKR movement put it even
more strongly in 1984:<p>
<p>
<i>If the present ad hoc and token gestures by the Department of Education and
Maori Affairs are not replaced speedily by adequately funded and carefully
thought out policies in support of the language, the bilingual education
schemes ... will be transformed from bold and timely initiatives into a cruel
fraud (Benton, p. 265).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
In a few public primary schools, excellent partnerships have been established
with the kohanga whanau. In a few schools, there is a commitment to bilingual
classes at each grade level. In one community, TKR graduates return to the
kohanga (in this case, on a marae) for part of each school day. In another, the
kohanga is on primary school grounds and there is a close relationship between
it and the Maori bilingual classes, with children visiting back and forth
(Cazden, in press). But in other communities, schools have not been responsive
to the needs of these children and the demands of Maori adults for more
extensive bilingual/bicultural education.<p>
	<p>
One result has been growing demand for primary schools under Maori auspices,
following the precedent of religious schools, which receive public funds while
retaining church control. As part of the restructuring of the entire New
Zealand educational system as of October 1, 1989, comparable status is being
negotiated for Maori schools.<p>
<p>
The Maori linguist who evaluated children's language acquisition in one center
concludes his report with these words: <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Ten years ago, Waiwhetuu and the Hutt Valley were part of this country's
first major socio-linguistic survey conducted by the Maori Unit of the New
Zealand Council for Educational Research. In 11 of the 12 households visited in
Puketapu Grove, everyday communication was carried out entirely in English,
although 9 of the 13 household heads were able to speak Maori either fluently
or quite well. There were no Maori speakers among children under the age of 15
at that time. </i><p>
<i></i><p>
The establishment of To Kohanga Reo in Waiwhetuu has brought many social,
cultural and linguistic changes to this community, and indeed in many homes
these pre-schoolers are the agents of this change. Parents are now attending
night classes at Waiwhetuu Marae, and elsewhere, in order to communicate in
Maori with their own children. This is vital if the children are to develop the
linguistic skills sown within the Kohanga Reo. These skills, as I have tried to
show, are already highly developed. But the experience of many adults today,
who no longer speak (though nominally understand) Maori should remind us that
languages may be lost as readily as they are learnt.<p>
	<p>
Any hesitation on the part of the local schools to accommodate, and to build
upon the foundations laid in Kohanga Reo will be seen by the Maori people as a
disguised form of the "unofficial" suppression of New Zealand's indigenous
language which existed within the state education system up to the 1950s.<p>
	<p>
I encourage all who are involved with this exciting challenge to save the Maori
language from extinction, to consider the wider implications that Te Kohanga
Reo graduates will have on this community in the future. While a bilingual
(Maori/English) unit within the Waiwhetuu Primary School is an obvious
extension of the Kohanga Reo next year, by that time the precedent of an
alternative Maori school might already be established (Smith, 1984, 20-21).<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PLANNING PRESCHOOL ENVIRONMENTS  </b><p>
<p>
<p>
In reviewing descriptions of preschools programs from around the world, we have
noticed an important difference in the attention given to language planning:
Where some kind of language change is a program goal--whether from children's
mother tongue to a national language or to a heritage language that is being
revitalized--then language goals are prominent in the overall curriculum. But
where no language change is intended, language seems to recede in importance.
It then too easily becomes part of the background, taken for granted, something
that will take care of itself, not consciously attended to by planners or
teachers. Because of the importance of language in child development, as well
as in readiness for primary school--as we have discussed in the first
section--we believe that all preschool must give it focal attention, and we
hope this report will be a 'consciousness raiser' in this regard.<p>
<p>
The need to specifically address the issue of a `language-development aware'
preschool curriculum is positively reflected in the new (1980/1981) preschool
curriculum of the Dominican Republic, which was elaborated with cooperation
from UNICEF and UNESCO. This curriculum is structured around four areas of
development, one of which is the "area of communication." It "includes all
those activities through which the child expresses his experiences, ideas and
feelings either through art, music or oral or written language. Getting ready
for reading and writing is also considered part of this area." (Rosario &amp;
Perez de Zapata, 1983, p. 199; translation by CH-B.) <p>
<p>
<b>Planning for Language Learning</b><p>
<p>
Whatever language is being used as the medium of conversation in the preschool,
careful consideration needs to be given to how to create an environment in
which children's language and cognitive development will be nurtured as richly
as possible. Unfortunately, this doesn't happen without such consideration.
Observational studies that compare children's talk at home and at school
consistently find that homes are the richer environment.<p>
	<p>
One such comparative study was carried out in England. Tizard and Hughes (1984;
Tizard, 1981) found that the average child had almost three times as many
conversations per unit of time with a parent at home as with a caregiver in
nursery school, and that the home conversations continued for twice as many
adult/child turns. As Tizard says about these results, <p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>A brief conversation may suffice for demands to be made and either met
or denied, encouragement to be given, suggestions to be made, information or
orders to be given, and even for a question to be answered. But any deep
exchange of meaning takes time to achieve. (1981, p. 20.)<p>
<p>
There are several often converging reasons why adult-child conversations in a
preschool are apt to be so limited: the low adult-child ratio and the way the
adults and children are organized into working groups; and lack of continuity
in the adult-child relationships resulting in teachers' relative ignorance of
each child's out of school life. With careful consideration, these aspects of
the center environment can be made more beneficial.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Adult-Child Ratio, Group Size and Organization</b><p>
	<p>
Adult-child ratio and group size are related, and both are important. Summary
statistics in program descriptions and governmental regulations usually give or
prescribe the adult-child ratio. In the Tizard study, for example, the average
ratio was 1 (adult):10 (children). In situations where infants are in group
care, recommended ratios in the U.S. usually drop to 1:4. In developing
countries, reports of the ratio of adults to young children are much higher:
1:28 in a Bolivian study (Barrera de Martinez, 1985); 1:55 in one preschool in
Kenya (Adhiambo et al, c. 1988).<p>
	<p>
The number of paid staff is a major, probably the major, budget item. But they
can often be augmented by volunteers. In many cases, mothers become the
para-professional teachers, while fathers are primarily involved in building
the centers--e.g. Ate-Vitarte in Peru and Nezahualpilli in Mexico (see
annotated bibliography for those countries). But in an Islamic preschool in
Kenya, construction of two huts was shared by 30 fathers and 60 mothers, who
worked with male and female trainers, respectively (Kenyan Ministry of
Education, Science and Technology, 1986). Older members of the community not
now in the work force are another available group, and their language abilities
are especially valuable in programs of language revitalization.<p>
	<p>
But ratio is not the only number that counts. A large national study of day
care in the United States found that group size mattered as well:<p>
	<p>
<i>Across all sites, smaller groups are consistently associated with better
care, more socially active children and higher gains on developmental tests
(Ruopp, 1979, p. 2).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Thus, 1 adult for 10 children is preferable to 2 for 20 or 3 for 30, even
though the adult-child ratio is the same in all three cases. And a reduction to
200 children in one kindergarten in Mexico (Logan in Lall &amp; Lall, 1983) is
still an unfortunate size, no matter how many care-givers are present.<p>
	<p>
Three influences can be suggested for the importance of group size. First, the
larger the group, the more hectic the environment is apt to be and the more
control adults will need to exert. Under such conditions, adult talk will be
more managerial than informative, and such talk requests compliance and invites
silence, not dialogue. Conversely, in a smaller group, control problems will be
lessened, and adult-child conversations more apt to focus on activities and
ideas than behavioral control.<p>
	<p>
Second, in any group with more than one adult, relationships among the adults
become important. The most obvious danger is that the adults will talk among
themselves and interact with the children only enough to maintain control. But
even where the adults are careful to give their attention to the children,
adult relationships can affect how that attention is expressed. A study of
residential nurseries in England found, for example, that the quality of
conversations was affected by hierarchical relationships among the staff. If
two staff were on duty with a group of children, the junior of the two tended
to interact less with the children than when she was alone, considering her job
only to "mind the children" when her superior was also present (Tizard et al,
1972).<p>
	<p>
We should not be surprised that adults, as well as children, are influenced in
their interactions by relations of interpersonal power within any given speech
situation. Such relationships will be especially important among adults who see
themselves as having unequal status outside of school--for example,
certificated teachers vis-a-vis community adults, community elders vis-a-vis
younger parents, or members of dominant vis-a-vis non-dominant ethnic groups.
In such situations, the particular language ability of the adults with the
lower societal status may be crucial to the preschool objectives. Yet those
very language abilities will only be fully expressed in interactions with
children if all adult speakers are fully respected for their important roles.<p>
	<p>
The third result of the size of group and sheer number of adults is their
effect on the continuity of adult-child relationships.<p>
<p>
<b>Continuity in Adult-Child Relationships</b><p>
	<p>
Group caregivers are inevitably less familiar with their children than members
of a child's family. Family members are superb conversational partners for
young children not only because of a powerful affective relationship but also
because they know the child's world--and therefore what the child is likely to
be talking about--so well.<p>
	<p>
When children in their second year of life can utter only a few meaningful
words, a family member is most likely to understand the child's intent and make
a meaningful response. Later, when children's pronunciation has become
intelligible, their highly individual choice of words can continue to make
communication difficult with strangers. Anthropologist Margaret Mead used her
experience as a grandmother to speak of the importance for children of a shared
world:<p>
<i>I was walking along a Cambridge street with my two-year-old granddaughter,
and we stopped in front of a florist shop. She started in the window and said,
"Never be a cat." What would you say? Most grandmothers would say, "Yes,
dearie, see that nice doggie," but I knew what she was talking about. Because I
knew she was referring to a song that my grandmother sang to me, that I sang to
my daughter, that my daughter sang to her, which said, "Always be a pussy,
never be a cat./ They call me pussywillow, and what do you think of that?"
There was a pussy willow in the florist window. Now, this is what our children
don't have and this is what we have to begin to put together for them. This is
the reason for bringing parents into the child care center and into the nursery
school. It is the reason for bringing the teachers into the homes of the
children. It is an attempt to establish at least a certain degree of
commonality so that people can talk to each other and have some identity (1973,
p. 327).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Mead's recommendations are important: welcome parents in the school and
encourage teachers to visit children's homes--of course, after discussion to
make sure such visits would be welcomed.<p>
	<p>
Then the benefits of such relationships for extended adult-child conversations
in the preschool will be maximized if a teacher is assigned special
responsibility for contact with a small number of children and their families
within the larger group, and if the daily schedule ensures that each adult and
child group will spend some time together each day.<p>
	<p>
The benefits of such parent/teacher relationships go well beyond their
influence on children's language development--for example, in helping to build
networks of families in sparsely populated areas, as in the Western Isles of
Scotland and the Saami in Norway. <p>
	<p>
We have emphasized the importance of opportunities for children to talk with
adults because these opportunities require the most careful planning.
Children's language development is also nurtured by talk with other children.
We assume opportunities for such interactions, whatever activities the children
are engaged in. But talk with adults has special value for all children. This
value is accentuated in situations where the entire child group is learning a
second language that initially only the adults know, as in the Maori immersion
preschools in New Zealand. <p>
<p>
<b>Planning for Emergent Literacy</b><p>
	<p>
Although we are concerned with preschool education for children younger than
formal school age, there is enough research evidence of the importance for
later school success of beginning, or `emergent', literacy experiences during
the preschool years to merit consideration here. The research is admittedly
concentrated in England and the U.S. But to the extent that children in Third
World countries also face western-type educational expectations once they enter
primary school, this research should have general relevance.<p>
<p>
<b>The Importance of Early Literacy</b><p>
	<p>
The most extensive evidence is from Wells' large-scale longitudinal study of
children in Bristol, England (1985). He found that the single most important
influence on children's success in learning to read in primary school was the
extent of their direct experience with print during their preschool years. Such
experience can include both being read to and trying to write. Wells could only
report with confidence about the benefits of regular book-reading to young
children because he found little evidence of their attempts to write during his
visits to the home. But other researchers have documented the benefits of early
writing activities, and of their observations of reading and writing in their
environment.<p>
	<p>
As far as we now understand, there are several specific ways in which preschool
literacy experiences prepare children for primary school:<p>
(1) Deciphering the written language code: Following along as an adult reads
aloud, asking questions about words in books or signs in the social
environment, and trying to write for oneself--even in "invented spelling"--all
serve to focus children's attention on written language symbols, and on how they combine to represent oral language.<p>
<p>
(2) Comprehending text meaning: Discussions about the text being read helps to
accustom the child to deriving meaning from words alone, apart from the
momentary physical and interpersonal context. The fact that books often contain
more varied vocabulary and sentence patterns than everyday conversation is an
added benefit.<p>
<p>
(3) Appreciating the functions of reading and writing: Being read to
contributes to a personal motivation to learn to read; and seeing people
writing helps children understand how writing is a useful activity in their
community.<p>
	<p>
While these benefits of deciphering, comprehension and appreciation are
important for all children, they may be especially important in communities
where having books to look at and materials to write with, and seeing adults
engage in literacy activities, are not widespread outside of school. For these
reasons, if a preschool has as one of its objectives reducing the risks of
primary school failure, we recommend that preschool programs include such
beginning literacy experiences.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Literacy in Which Language?</b><p>
	<p>
Fortunately, the particular language in which children have such literacy
experiences does not seem to matter as much as the fact that they happen,
consistently and regularly, in some language. Canadian psychologist Cummins has
reviewed research evidence in support of what he calls the "linguistic
interdependence hypothesis." In formal terms, considering two languages in the
children's environment, Lx and Ly:<p>
<i></i><p>
<i>To the extent that instruction in Lx is effective in promoting proficiency
in Lx, transfer of this proficiency to Ly will occur provided there is adequate
exposure to Ly (either in school or environment) and adequate motivation to
learn Ly (1989, p. 44).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<p>
Cummins goes on to explain in more detail:<p>
<p>
<i>In concrete terms, what this principle means is that in, for example, a
Spanish-English bilingual program, Spanish instruction that develops Spanish
reading and writing skills (for either Spanish L1 or L2 speakers) is not just
developing Spanish skills, it is also developing a deeper conceptual and
linguistic proficiency that is strongly related to the development of literacy
in the majority language (English). In other words, although the surface
aspects (e.g. pronunciation [and word order] etc.) of different languages are
clearly separate, there is an underlying cognitive/academic proficiency which
is common 	across languages. This "common underlying proficiency" makes
possible the transfer of cognitive/academic or literacy-related skills across
languages (p. 44).</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
Although in principle such transfer can happen from any language to any other,
Cummins suggests that<p>
<p>
<i>Transfer is more likely to occur from minority to majority language because
of the greater exposure to literacy in the majority language outside of school
and the strong social pressure to learn it (p. 44).</i><p>
<p>
This formulation speaks specifically to situations of minority language
communities embedded in a larger majority language society--as is the case of
Spanish-speaking communities in the US. One of Cummins' examples is of a
Spanish-only preschool that had a significant effect on California farm
workers' children's later success in the English-medium primary school through
an intensive program of language and literacy-related experiences (Campos &amp;
Keatinge, 1988).<p>
	<p>
A more dramatic example of children's transfer of an underlying proficiency
from one language to another comes from a primary school immersion program in
the Mohawk language in the Native Canadian community of Kahnawake (or
Caughnawaga, as Mithun and Chafe [1979] transcribe the name) near Montreal.
Local parents and educators started the program in an attempt to revitalize a
language that would die with the current older generation. They then invited
the McGill researchers who had successfully evaluated now well-known French
immersion programs 20 years earlier to conduct a longitudinal evaluation of the
Mohawk children's language learning and academic achievement. (Mithun and Chafe
mention a nursery school as well as primary school program, but the McGill
evaluation started with children in first grade.)<p>
	<p>
The program is conducted entirely in Mohawk in grades 1-3. Then, in grade 4,
instruction during 40% of the day shifts to English (the first language of the
students). An important question for parents, teachers and researchers was how
the children would cope with reading and writing in English.<p>
	<p>
Through the third grade, while all of the children's instruction--orally and in
writing--was in Mohawk, they showed no ability to transfer their proficiencies
to English, their first language. This surprised the researchers, because in
other immersion programs children who learned to read in a second language made
the transfer to their first language easily and usually without explicit
instruction. The fact that English orthography is more different from Mohawk
(which has symbols for glottal stop, vowel length, and vowel pitch) than it is
from Spanish or French seemed the probable reason.<p>
	<p>
So fourth grade, when instruction in English reading began, became the critical
year. And at the end of that year, "After one year of instruction in English,
the Immersion students performed as well [on an English achievement test] as
Mohawk students in the regular all-English program on all measures except
spelling and capitalization (Holobow et al, 1987, p. 3)." Cummins's "common
underlying proficiency" theory thus receives additional support.<p>
	<p>
Most preschool programs that mention preliteracy experiences limit them to
helping children learn to read. But preschool children, especially when 5 or
older, can also enjoy, and benefit from, trying to write--not just copying, but
also composing. Delpit includes samples of original <b>tok ples</b> writing by
children in the vernacular preschool programs in Papua New Guinea (1984,
App.G).<p>
<p>
<b>The Question of Materials</b><p>
	<p>
All this requires materials--especially little books for teachers and/or
children to read--and caregivers who are literate, or interested in becoming
literate, in the language being used in the preschool. In many situations, this
is a tall order, and we can only encourage creativity in devising the best
possible local solutions.<p>
	<p>
A curriculum evaluation of a program for home learning in Gaza by a British
preschool educator for the sponsoring agency (the American Friends Service
Committee) includes important suggestions about materials (Dorling, 1989). In
the program, called MUMS--Mothers Understanding Methods of Schooling--staff
members visit mothers with 4-year-old children, mostly in refugee camps. They
demonstrate activities, centered around books and exercise sheets, which the
mothers are expected to continue between visits.<p>
	<p>
The program began in 1975 and, as Dorling writes, "There is now a greater
emphasis placed on the child's efforts as a thinker, concept former, knowledge
gatherer ... and greater faith in, and value upon, the parents' contribution as
`prime educator' of their child." Dorling recommends, therefore, shifting away
from worksheets that require right answers and copying to materials that invite
more open-ended parent-child conversation, and that engage the child in
prereading and prewriting activities.<p>
<p>
Dorling also raises important questions, that need to be asked everywhere,
about the cultural content of the books. Reporting her observations and her
concerns, she writes:<p>
<p>
<i>Many mothers said how much their children loved the stories, that they were
"the favorite part," and were read frequently to their other children, and
neighbors'children, and were a help in times of curfew.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>However, to an outsider, the stories, although part of an excellent English
series and well translated into Arabic, are so culturally irrelevant as to seem
quite inappropriate. They must surely waste the children's powers of
understanding and usurp an opportunity to enhance their self-image. No one
complains, but people could see, when I introduced the topic, that the children
were muddled by mothers in short dresses--"Is she a girl?" they ask; and by
[red and green traffic lights], hedgehogs, pet dogs, dolls' prams, let alone
friendly policemen (Dorling, 1989).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
In Dorling's memo on a follow-up visit a few months later, she reports with
admiration the new materials illustrated by a local artist that are duplicated,
in black and white, in the program office and then colored in by the mothers
themselves.<p>
<p>
MUMS also encourages children's drawing--on the backs of pieces of paper that
would otherwise be discarded--as an important part of children's symbolic
development.<p>
	<p>
If children become writers, then their own stories can become `books' for other
children to read. In a combined Kindergarten and Grade 1 Hawaiian language
immersion preschool--which follows an immersion preschool, Punana Leo, modeled
after the Maori Kohanga Reo--Slaughter and Watson-Gegeo found 25 of the 42
Hawaiian texts in the book corner in one classroom, and 11 of the 49 texts in
the other classroom, had been written by the children themselves (1988, p. 32).
Teachers themselves, local secondary school students, and accessible tertiary
experts are other possible authors and illustrators.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>The Question of Attitudes</b><p>
	<p>
Attitudes toward reading and writing in the vernacular may pose as much of a
problem as lack of materials, because of the residue of the colonial
experience. Surprisingly, perhaps, the people surveyed in the North Solomons
province of Papua New Guinea were very clear about the importance of the
language of their community, orally and in literacy. This was true of both
"sophisticated tertiary educated with considerable experience of urban
industrial life, and among village parents with limited modern education":<p>
<p>
<i>The impetus behind the call for early schooling in the children's own
language and culture thus appeared to lie in the perceived importance of
establishing a sense of local cultural identity in children, of emphasizing its
continued worth and meaning. This was the point of learning to read and write
in one's own language, using a relatively newly introduced skill (literacy) to
support the transmission of an oral culture. While knowledge of English was
still expressed as a valuable goal, knowledge of the local language was viewed
as essential to a community member's sense of inner dignity. This was not the
reaction of a conservative, traditional society resistant to the modernizing
changes compelling the nation, but rather a reassertion of pride in their own
culture and identity (Delpit, 1984, pp. 80-81).</i><p>
<p>
<p>
	<p>
Where such positive attitudes toward vernacular literacy are not present when a
preschool program is started, then the school may itself become an agent of
attitudinal change. That is what happened in the Navajo community described by
Holm and Holm (1990). Over the years, under the influence of the school and the
church--with Navajo literacy valued and used in both settings--there was what
another educator in that same school calls the "indigenization of literacy
(McLaughlin, 1989)."<p>
	<p>
We emphasize the value, in many settings, of emergent literacy experiences in
the vernacular. But where this is not possible, preschool programs should do
whatever they can to avoid a situation where children with few literacy
experiences outside of school confront, for the first time, both literacy and a
second language when they enter primary school.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>The Preschool Staff</b><p>
	<p>
Because group care of young children of approximately the same age is not part
of traditional community life, adults working in preschools--whether called
`teachers' or `caregivers'--may be in a new situation for which there are no
tried and true cultural models. This is true whether the teachers are men and
women in their 20's or 30's who have had 6 years of primary education, as in
the vernacular preschools in Papua New Guinea (Delpit, p. 161), or whether they
are community elders, primarily women, who may have had even less formal
education, as in the Maori Kohanga Reo.<p>
<p>
The problems that are apt to arise are not due to teachers' lack of formal
education. In Papua New Guinea, Delpit found no relationship between the
classroom performance of teachers and whether they had completed only 6 years
of school or were high school graduates (1984, pp. 164-5). The problem rather
is that their personal experience with formal education may provide an
inappropriate model to fall back on when improvisation is required, especially
with young children. Where that personal experience was in colonial schools
with very large classes and predominantly rote learning of, and in, an
unfamiliar language, remembered models will be especially inappropriate
(Delpit, 1984, p. 245).<p>
	<p>
Where preschool teachers are drawn from the ranks of primary or secondary
teachers now in excess because of a falling birth rate, as in the case of
Thailand (Raudenbush et al, n.d.), the problem will be similar, though for a
different reason. A 1977 study of Kuwaiti preschool teachers revealed that most
had been trained as elementary, or even secondary, teachers. In the absence of
special training for work with preschoolers, they "tended to follow what was
traditionally practiced at the elementary level [as] manifested in overemphasis
on formal instruction and scholastic achievement (Nashif, 1985, p. 180)." <p>
<p>
<b>The Importance of Preservice and Inservice Training</b><p>
	<p>
For all such groups, training courses specifically focused on young children
can be of great value. In Kuwaiti, the in-service (re-training) course extended
over 3-9 months (Nashir, 1985, pp. 180-1). In Papua New Guinea, the pre-service
course for new vernacular preschool teachers was for six weeks, plus in-service
workshops and supervisory visits (when transportation was possible) during the
school year. <p>
<p>
Two reports of successful education in indigenous communities--in Inuit
communities in northern Quebec and on the Navajo Reservation in the United
States--emphasize the importance of arranging for teacher training in the local
community. From the Inuit experience, Stairs describes the benefits of not
removing teachers to a foreign cultural environment for training:  	 <p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Inuit teachers are chosen by community standards, not formal qualification,
and begin immediately as "Teacher"--not as aides or students. Most remain fully
integrated in their communities throughout their training. This avoids (a)
depriving settlement life by removal of what are often key members, (b)
disrupting personal lives with deep cultural shock, homesickness and family
separation, and (c) training Inuit as essentially southern teachers outside of
</i>
<i>their cultural context....Resulting from this is a broad base of educators
with varied experience, still firmly placed in their cultural setting (Stairs,
1988, p. 315).</i><p>
<i></i>	<p>
Writing of their long experience in developing a Navajo school at Rock Point,
Arizona, Holm and Holm discuss the benefits of the resulting indigenous
curriculum development:<p>
<p>
<i>`Navajo teaching' like `Navajo education' has been an <b>ambi</b>valent if
not a <b>multi</b>valent term. Not conceding that there can be any virtue in
teaching in Navajo, some Anglocentric educators seem to have assumed that
`education is education': that teaching in Navajo would involve using the
Navajo language in the same ways and for the same purposes Anglo teachers use
in teaching middle-class Anglo students. Others, who might be termed the
`anthropological romantics', seem to have assumed that there is a Navajo style
of teaching which would-be Navajo teachers need only (re-discover and apply.
Unfortunately, almost all their examples came from the less verbal performance
of traditional skills.</i><p>
	<p>
<i>The Rock Point experience would suggest that while there are certainly
Navajo ways of interacting with others and of transmitting verbal knowledge,
these are not waiting to be simply `discovered' and applied. they must be
integrated with new ways and used with new content. Rock Point teachers
created, over time and by a combination of theory and trial-and-error, not
<b>the</b> Navajo way, but <b>a</b> contemporary way, to go to school. (A Rock
Point Way [in press]).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Both of these examples come from bilingual state schools where the indigenous
language is used exclusively (Inuit) or predominantly (Navajo) in the early
grades. Because preschools are a smaller unit, with fewer staff adults, teacher
training at each school site would not be feasible. But the principle of local
training devoted to the discovery and creation of indigenous forms of
curriculum and teaching suggests keeping the training as close to the local
community as possible. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Language Issues in the Training Programs</b><p>
	<p>
With respect to language aspects of the preschool curriculum, the training
needs to focus on organizing group life so that interaction among the children
and with the adults is as rich as possible. There is no need to strive for
activities typical of western-type preschool centers. Any activities are grist
for conversation and thereby for language learning. In fact, research
consistently finds that where adults and children are active together in some
kind of joint activity, there is more informative talk than when children are
expected to "play" apart from the adults. So, for example, preparing food can
be just as valuable as playing with blocks or painting--as long as
conversation, about the activity or anything else, is encouraged.<p>
<p>
Again because of the influence of teachers' own prior schooling, they may need
encouragement to conduct preschool activities out of doors. Delpit found
reluctance to go outside in Papua New Guinea, even though "natural materials
are readily available for nature study, mathematics, and cultural studies...
[and] outdoor lessons are more likely to make VTPS [the vernacular preschools]
seem less a separate institution and more a part of the village community
(1984, p. 179)." <p>
	<p>
Where objectives of the preschool include helping the children become better
prepared for primary school, then teacher training needs to include specific
work with beginning literacy. Surprising as it may seem, many adults need help
in learning how to talk with children in ways that extend conversation, rather
than cut it off. Greenberg reports on a workshop session for teachers in the
Child Development Group of Mississippi, a Headstart program in the 1960's with
an explicit empowerment goal:<p>
<p>
Talking about children didn't work. If people don't habitually talk lengthily
with children, they don't know <b>how</b> to talk lengthily with children. So
we actually practiced it:<p>
<p>
	Tape plays:<p>
<b>Teacher:</b> Oh, you tease, Tom, what are you telling Winston?<p>
<b>Tom:</b> I tellin' him my brother Gary a bad bad boy.<p>
<b>Teacher:</b> Oh, now that ain't nice.<p>
<p>
The group analyses and discusses this. Then the 	same teacher goes to find Tom,
who is waiting for our staff meeting to be over so one of the teachers will
drive him home. The same teacher runs through the same conversation. I tape
this conversation too, and afterward we discuss it to see if and how the
teacher prolonged and enriched the verbal exchange.<p>
<p>
<b>Teacher:</b> Tom, what was you tellin' Winston this morn' when you was
playin' with the ball?<p>
<b>Tom:</b> I tole him Gary my brother.<p>
<b>Teacher:</b> You like Gary?<p>
<b>Tom:</b> Yeah, I lahk him, but he bad.<p>
...(three Teacher-Tom exchanges)<p>
<b>Teacher:</b> Whay's dat?<p>
<p>
<b>Tom:</b> 'Cause he walked up and set with his friend when they was singin'
'bout Jesus and the preacher was preachin'.<p>
		<b>Teacher:</b> Who whipped him?<p>
		<b>Tom:</b> Daddy--he tuk him outside and whupped him with a red  		belt.<p>
		<b>Teacher:</b> Did Gary cry?<p>
<b>Tom:</b> Oh, yeah, he got tears in his eyes. Mama wiped his eyes with a rag
when he come back in. Then he popped his fingers. That boy can't <b>never
</b>be quiet. ...(and so on for at least five more Teacher-Tom interchanges)
(1969, pp. 165-6).<p>
<p>
Whereas the teacher's first response to Tom stopped the conversation with her
criticism of what he had said, her second response invited him to say more
about an experience that was important to him and that he was eager to share
when invited to do so.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Adult Participation as Community Empowerment</b><p>
	<p>
While the primary objective of preschool education is the development of the
youngest members of the community, it can also contribute to adult development.
In New Zealand, the empowering effect of participation in the Kohanga Reo on
Maori women of all ages is widely acknowledged. A linguist working with a
preschool language renewal program for Native American (Tachi Yokuts) in
California reports how the young teacher from the community became familiar
with a language she had heard as a child and could now help to teach, as she
"began to learn from the elders, who came to be seen as the real teachers in
the program and who in turn learned from each other and from the teaching
process itself" (Britsch-Devany, 1988, p. 298):<p>
<p>
<i>The elders who participated in the Tachi language program...began to create
a community of memory within multiple worlds: the world of the school began to
incorporate the histories of their personal worlds as part of the larger world
of a community</i>
<i>remembered, a community that seeks to reestablish its own rituals, its own
spiritualism, and its own language.</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>This retelling began during the program's weekly planning sessions, at which
the head teacher and the two elders would discuss both the language and the
activities to be used throughout the week. To the teacher's surprise, these
meetings were quite often extended and they began to evolve into discussions of
past experiences evoked by the use of Tachi in discussions of classroom
planning.</i><p>
<i>	</i><p>
<i>During one meeting, for example, the two elder women began to recall various
plants that grew at or near the community when they were younger, the dietary
uses of these plants, and the seasonal experience of gathering plants with
their own mothers and grandmothers. These recollections prompted the inclusion
of a unit in which the children and elders picked fiddleneck and prepared it
for eating in the classroom (p. 300).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
The preschool contributed directly to the reconstruction and enlargement of
this "community of memory" by its need for the elders' knowledge, by the
planning discussions which prompted their recollections long forgotten, and by
the subsequent process of sharing them in activities with the children. <p>
	<p>
This young `Anglo' teacher was ready to learn from the Native American
community elders, and to share planning and teaching fully with them. That is
not always the case where a credentialed teacher is working with
non-credentialed adults--whether paid or volunteer. For example, in the
Nezahualpilli Community Preschool Education Project in Mexico:<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>[One of the numerous problems in curriculum development is] the lack of
acceptance on the side of some teachers and educators of the role of mothers as
teachers of their children. Unfortunately, the educator is used to seeing
him/herself as unique and not as someone who gives an impulse to and pushes on
collective work. [However, as we have seen in our project, persons] with
experience in education (which includes first of all the fathers and mothers)
are capable of working with preschool children if they base their further
training on their own values and experiences, and preschool teachers [can] be
an integral part of community work and become key elements not only for
education but also for community research.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i></i>If the talents of the community adults are to be fully utilized with the
children, and if the adults are themselves to grow, their sense of personal
empowerment is critical. Where the credentialed/non-credentialed difference
among the adults coincides with membership in the more and less powerful 
groups in society, respectively, potential barriers to productive relationships
are compounded. <p>
<p>
In a Native American Navajo/English bilingual school in Arizona, the program
developers worked hard to avoid the typical pattern of Anglo teacher and Navajo
aides. At one point in the development of the school, a new group of Anglo
teachers was hired at the last moment (when last-minute funding became
available) and underwent orientation while the Navajo teachers had charge of
the students alone.<p>
<i>In retrospect, it was one of the best things that could have happened. The
Navajo Language Teachers now knew they could do it; successful education didn't
necessarily depend upon the presence of either Anglos or diplomas (Holm &amp;
Holm, 1990).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
The authors explain that in the particular conditions of Native American
education in the U.S., "few of the Navajo employees had ever had a Navajo
teacher. None had ever had a teacher who used Navajo as the medium of
instruction." And, in a footnote, they generalize to other situations of
de-colonialization:<p>
<p>
<i>This is not written to denigrate either Anglo teachers or diplomas....But
there comes a time in the de-colonialization process in which such symbols must
be de-valued as being causative or effective in and of themselves. Indigenous
people have to come to believe that it </i><cite>is</cite><i> possible for them
to do what theretofore the conventional wisdom had said they couldn't or
shouldn't (Holm &amp; Holm, 1990, fn. 15).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
Although the Holms are writing about a primary and secondary school, what they
say applies to adults working in preschools just as well. And because
interpersonal relationships within any setting have such a powerful effect on
the interaction patterns of the participants, it applies with special force in
any setting where use of language is especially important. <p>
	 <p>
Negative attitudes toward community adults such as teachers may be held, at
least initially, by some parents. One preschool promoter ("animadora") in the
Ate-Vitarte, Peru project described how parents were at first very hesitant to
send their children to the new preschool center because there was no "Senorita"
(a professional woman teacher) and the `teacher' was only a mother from the
community. Such reports only indicate that the de-colonization process of which
the Holms write needs to extend to
parents as well, and that attention to such attitudes should be part of the
conscious objectives of all institutions, including preschools.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>The Administrative Context</b><p>
	<p>
The relationship of preschools to primary education is	an international concern
(Bettelheim &amp; Takanishi, 1977), and there seems to be no ideal arrangement.
We focus here on concerns related to preschool language goals, and how
administrative arrangements affect the realization of language goals through
their effect on program continuity, personnel, and status.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Program Continuity</b><p>
	<p>
It is more difficult to achieve continuity between preschools and primary
schools if they are part of different departments or ministries. Continuity is
a very important issue for language education. It does not make sense to have
an elaborate language maintenance/revitalization program that starts in grade
1, but have a preschool program in which use of the mother tongue is not
promoted or even actively discouraged. (For examples, see Puno/Peru and
Karnten/Austria.)<p>
	<p>
The reverse is just as unfortunate: a preschool language maintenance/
revitalization program that is not continued in primary school. (For an
example, see Maori/New Zealand.) Both cases of discontinuity will work against
both children's readiness for primary school and achieving the social language
goals.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Personnel</b><p>
	<p>
A critical question for preschool education is the criteria for selecting
teachers/caregivers. With respect to language, teachers should be fluent,
ideally native, speakers of whatever language will be the medium of
communication in the program. In the case of language revitalization programs,
the largest, maybe the only, pool of such persons will be older adults,
`elders,' in the community. Such people are not apt to have formal teaching
credentials. Whatever the benefits of having preschools part of the educational
system, such placement may make it difficult, or even impossible, to employ
these adults except in the low status of aides. And then that status of the
speakers of the focal language influences public perception of the status of
the language itself.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Status</b><p>
	<p>
If preschools are outside the educational system--for example, part of the
welfare system--they may be considered `inferior.' Where that is the case, that
perception may be transferred to any special language program, such as for
mother tongue revitalization. A consequence could be stronger resistance to it
because of this perceived low status. <p>
<p>
Similarly, wherever the program is situated, if it seems to be only for
children who usually achieve poorly in school, then the program may become
stigmatized as only `remedial' or `compensatory,' and some parents may shun it
for this reason.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Examples of Different Arrangements</b><p>
	<p>
From India, we know of two experimental models which address the issue of
preschool/primary school continuity. One is a program in the State of
Rahasthan, where preprimary classes are attached to a primary school, and where
the primary school teacher (after a short orientation and with continued
in-service training) also teaches the preschoolers. The second is the Vikaswadi
in the State of Maharashtra for rural `tribal' children. It integrates a
creche, a "Balwadi" (public preschool under the control of the Central Welfare
Board) and a primary school into one organizational unit.<p>
	<p>
From her experience in Papua New Guinea, Delpit includes an extended discussion
of these administrative issues. The vernacular preschools in Papua New Guinea,
called Viles Tok Ples Skul (VTPS) are for children older than usual preschool
age. Until these schools were established on an experimental basis in the North
Solomons Province, children started primary school--called the <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
"community school" but conducted in English--at age 7. After a decentralization
of governmental authority gave communities in the North Solomons more autonomy,
a working group of PNG university researchers and graduate students conducted a
province-wide survey of opinions about education.<p>
<p>
<i>Community wishes and aspirations which emerged were for preschooling for
children before Grade 1 in community school; delayed entry into Grade 1 until
children were nine or ten years old; mother tongue literacy; and an education
for the young in the customs, culture, and acceptable behavior of their local
community and language group....[The children would then be] completing the six
year primary program around age fourteen, when those who were not successful in
attaining a high school place would be mature enough to enter some form of
vocational training or return to take on a useful role in the village (Delpit,
1984,78,82).</i><p>
<i></i><p>
With these goals, Delpit asks, "Should the VTPS be closely affiliated with the
community school--under its rules and the headmaster's supervision--or should
VTPS be a completely separate entity under the full jurisdiction of `the
community,' however that is defined." She goes on to explore the trade-offs of
benefits in possible answers:<p>
<p>
<p>
<i>Initially, VTPS was seen as a completely separate 		institution from the
community school, with separate grounds and separate governance. As the scheme
developed, communities felt it more practical to locate schools on existing
community school campuses ... [and] under the same Board of Management.... They
explained, "After all, it's the same parents, isn't it?"...</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>The benefit of VTPS being completely separate ...lies in its subsequent
ability ...[to] become a school that parents and community would see as their
responsibility and become more involved in its day to day operations. Perhaps
it could also become a more integral part of the village as it was originally
hoped it would be.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>On the other hand, closer affiliation with the community school could
provide some undeniable benefits too. Several </i><cite>tok ples</cite><i>
schools have suffered high teacher absenteeism, leading community members to
eventually complain to the VTPS supervisor or even to the central office in
Arawa....If the community school headmaster took on that responsibility as he
does for the community school teachers, the problems might be prevented before
they become acute. Headmasters could also provide some supervision ...
[although] Such supervision could only be of a limited nature at this time
because headmasters ... are frequently unfamiliar with the purposes and method
of VTPS, and those posted outside of their language areas cannot understand the
local </i><cite>tok ples</cite><i>.</i><p>
<i></i><p>
<i>Furthermore, while VTPS has a specific purpose and aims, most people who
support those aims would like to see them continued into community schools.
Complete separation might prevent the kind of cross-fertilization that could
influence the community school in a more community-sensitive and culturally
responsive direction. The danger to be guarded against, of course, is that such
cross-fertilization leads not to positive changes in the community</i>
<i>school, but to greater bureaucratization and subsequent distancing from the
community of the VTPS. Finally, should the two schools become more closely
linked, coordination of curriculum elements could be undertaken more readily.
Consultation between Grade 1 and VTPS teachers could provide a VTPS curriculum
more relevant in facilitating community school achievement and a Grade 1
curriculum better able to enhance and build upon skills developed in VTPS
(Delpit, 1984, pp. 193 - 5).</i><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
A major item on the developmental agenda for the child aged 0 to 6 is language.
Accomplishments during this period typically include development of control
over one's native language sufficient to enable participation in social
interaction with peers and with adults, to provide the resources for telling
and understanding stories, for giving and getting explanations of interesting
phenomena, and for problem-solving using language.  Furthermore, language
development during this period typically culminates in the development of some
metalinguistic and rhetorical abilities that will contribute to the achievement
of literacy during the early school years.<p>
<p>
Despite the centrality of language achievements in the developmental agenda of
the first five years, language issues are rarely in the forefront of thinking
about how to plan environments for young children.  When designating programs
to provide care and promote development during the preschool period (whether
these programs are formal and classroom based, or more informal, community or
home-based), optimizing the language environment becomes an issue typically
only in cases where complex linguistic situations highlight it.  For example,
in multilingual societies where group care involves native speakers of several
different languages, or in societies where preschool teachers are likely to use
a national language different from that spoken by the children, some form of
language planning for preschools might occur.  We would argue that the quality
of the language environment deserves attention for every young child,
especially those in group care settings, whether monolingual or multilingual.<p>
<p>
There is some basis in the research literature for describing the optimal
language environment for preschool-aged children.  This is an environment in
which children have access to one-on-one interaction with adults as well as
peers, in which adults attend and respond to children's communicative attempts,
in which a rich array of interesting topics of conversation is made available,
and in which real communication (rather than language teaching) is the primary
activity.<p>
<p>
In group care settings for preschool-aged children, a number of factors can be
identified as constituting likely obstacles to an optimal language environment.
Very large groups of children and high child/adult ratios both reduce the
likelihood of the kind of one-on-one interactions between children and adults that are likely.  Repeated failure on the part of the adult to respond to the child's communicative attempts (either because of disinterest, because of commitment to more adult-centered activities, or because of commitment to more adult-centered activities, or becausethey do not share a language) constitutes another environmental obstacle.  Failure on the part of adults to value the child's native language as a useful and
valid communicative system similarly constitutes a risk to the child's language
development.  Failure on the part of the adult to recognize the need to attend
to <b>all</b> children, including those who may seem shy, less interested in
the group activities, less responsive, or less competent, can further diminish
the quality of the environment for them.  A strong programmatic emphasis on
teaching academic skills (letters, numbers, colors, rote memorization of
materials) may absorb energies that could better be devoted to real
communicative activities and language-enriching conversations.  The absence of
appropriate books and materials that provide the context for conversations that
build oral vocabulary and readiness for literacy may likewise reduce the value
of the language environment to the child.<p>
<p>
The prevalence of multilingualism in the world adds a particular urgency to the
recommendation to attend to the quality of preschool care settings as
environments for language development.  It is estimated that 60% of the
children in the world are growing up in situations that will require some use
of more than one language; for many of these, the second language will first be
encountered at school or in a preschool group care context.  Bilingualism does
not constitute by itself any risk to children's development--on the contrary,
bilingual children may have some cognitive advantages over monolinguals, beyond
the obvious advantage of knowing two languages.  But multilingual environments
may represent some risk to optimal development (by which we mean development of
full control over all the modeled languages), simply because the quality of the
information available about each of the languages to be learned may be
compromised.  Thus, multilingual societies in particular must attend to issues
of the quality of the language environments available to preschool-aged
children.  At least in formal preschool programs, the options that have been
chosen to introduce children to a second language include bilingual programs
that utilize the native and the second language, immersion programs in which an
entire group of children from the same language background interact with
specially trained group leaders from another language, and submersion programs
(entailing the greatest risk) in which a few children whose first language is
not known to the staff are literally submerged in a second language setting
without any provisions for language learning support.<p>
<p>
Language development is not normally a perilous matter.  Most children learn to
talk quite easily and efficiently, because traditional patterns of child care
provide adequate access to interaction and other sources of support.  However,
group-care settings for preschoolers, especially when combined with situations
in which acquisition of a second language is expected, constitute 
potential problems; there is need to ensure attention to the quality of the
preschool language environment when the situation is complicated in these ways.
Furthermore, since age-appropriate language skills are crucial to effective
functioning in school, we are threatening children's long-term optimal
development by failing to ensure that they arrive in formal school settings
with a full set of the language resources needed to support further learning.<p>

<b>I.	Introduction</b><p>
<p>
It is a privilege and a challenge to be here this morning and I thank UNICEF,
Cairo for this invitation. As so often with UNICEF invitations, I hope I am
able to fulfill their expectations. It is particularly exciting, as this is my
first visit to Egypt and to this part of the world. <p>
<p>
In my brief presentation this morning, I hope to accomplish the following
objectives:<p>
<p>
a. Provide a rationale for supporting child development programmes.<p>
<p>
b. Review some of our experiences from around the world which have generated a
range of programme strategies. In particular, I will try to highlight parental
education, as an important strategy.<p>
<p>
c. Present a framework for early child development proposed for Egypt.<p>
<p>
d. Describe in more detail a proposed community-based parent education project.
<p>
It is this particular project that will be the topic of discussion for our
working group. <p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A.	Early Child Development: A Definition</b><p>
<p>
Although there is a tremendous knowledge base about how children develop, it is
not always made available to practitioners who care for children or to
policy-makers who make decisions about programmes for children. In fact, there
seems to be a growing confusion about the terms survival, growth, development,
and care. These terms mean different things to different people and are often
used interchangeably. In our discussion today, I will try to provide an
intentionally simple working definition.<p>
<p>
Child development is not the same as growth. While growth is described by
changes in size, development is characterized by changes in complexity and
function. Child development encompasses the unfolding of behaviors from
immature to mature; from patterns of behavior that are simple to those that are
complex; and the evolution of a human being from dependency to autonomous
adulthood. More simply, child development is a process of change in which the
child learns to handle more complex levels of moving, thinking, feeling, and
interacting with people and objects in the environment.<p>
<p>
A child development programme or activity is one that looks beyond a child's
growth and survival needs and focuses on issues related to its needs for
attachment to consistent primary care-givers, its need to explore and
manipulate increasingly complex environments and its need to be praised and
valued for its accomplishments. <p>
By attending to a child's health, nutrition and psychosocial needs, survival
and development are simultaneously enhanced.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	Rationale for Investing in Early Child Development Activities</b><p>
<p>
Over the past decade a growing body of scientific, political programming data
emphasize why governments and NGOs should focus attention on comprehensive
child development programmes. As indicated in your handout the arguments are
vast and varied. Let me simply highlight <p>
<p>
<b>Programme Efficacy Argument</b>  The effectiveness of health, nutrition,
education, and income-generating programmes can be improved through their
integration with programmes of child development. Thus, taking advantage of the
interactive effects of these. Child development programmes are often an
important entry point for community development activities.<p>
<p>
<b>Social/Economic Argument</b>  Society benefits through increased
productivity and cost savings which can result from high quality child
development activities. These preventive programmes can produce savings by
reducing the need for curative health service, by improving the efficacy of
education systems, by reducing the number of dropouts and repetition.<p>
<p>
<b>Scientific Argument</b>  The research evidence demonstrates that the early
years are critical in the development of intelligence, personality, and social
behavior and that there are long term effects associated with a variety of
early intervention programmes.<p>
<p>
Other arguments include:<p>
<p>
<b>A human rights argument:</b>  Children have a right to live and to develop to
their full potential.<p>
<p>
<b>A moral and social values argument:</b>  Through children humanity transmits
its values. That transmission begins with infants. To preserve desirable moral
and social values in the future, one must begin with children.<p>
<p>
<b>A social equity argument:</b>  By providing a "fair start", it is possible to
modify distressing socio-economic and gender-related inequities.<p>
<p>
<b>A political argument:</b>  Children provide a rallying point for social and
political actions that build consensus and solidarity.<p>
<p>
<b>Changing social and demographic circumstances:</b>  The increasing survival
of vulnerable children, changing family structures, country to city migration,
women in the labour force, and other changes require increased attention to
early child care and development.<p>
<p>
Taken collectively we have a compelling and powerful rationale for investing in
ECD. From this rationale we should be capable of eliciting the necessary
support and commitment to these programmes whether they are organized by
individuals, families, communities, non-governmental organizations,
governments, or international funders.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>II. 	Programme Responses</b><p>
<p>
<b>A.	A Typology</b><p>
<p>
As one looks at ECD programmes from around the world, there is an impressive
body of accumulated knowledge and experience. As indicated in the attached
table the wide range of economic, social and political circumstances in which
children live has created a mosaic of different approaches. These can include,
for example:<p>
<p><ul>
Attending to children in centers.<p>
Supporting and educating parents and families.<p>
Promoting community development.<p>
Strengthening institutional resources and capabilities,<p>
Strengthening demand and awareness.</ul><p>
<p>
Although all five approaches are aimed at enhancing early child development,
each has different specific objectives and is directed towards a different
audience or group of participants. The selection of a particular programme
approach is dependent upon a range of factors and circumstances including for
example, cultural patterns and practices, availability of resources both human
and financial, and the range and the intensity of problems confronting
children, mothers, and families. It is hoped that a national policy in favor of
children will simultaneously support the range of alternative strategies, each,
with its attendant strengths and weakness.<p>

<b>B.	Parent Education Models</b> <p>
<p>
Since a major objective of our workshop is to discuss the potential for a
parent education programme in Cairo, I will highlight several examples of this
approach. The main purpose of programmes to educate parents, families and
communities in child development is to strengthen self-confidence, impart
knowledge and enhance parents' existing ability to foster the physical, mental,
social, and emotional development of their young children. Parental education
for ECD can occur in the home or outside, on an individual basis or in groups.
It may be realized through face to face interaction or through distance
education emphasizing the use of mass media. It may be didactic or based on
observation, imitation, and demonstration.<p>
<p>
Several existing parental education projects have been implemented in
Indonesia, China, and Colombia. For example, in Indonesia together with the
periodic weighing of young children and distribution of food, mothers
participate in group discussion sharing experiences and making toys out of
wooden materials. In China, the All China Women's Federation has established
200,000 parent schools. Most of these schools are attached to hospitals and or
primary schools. Lectures are given by trained community residents and focus on
family child rearing issues. Started by the Associate Ministry for the role of
Women, the project aims to enhance the knowledge, awareness, and skills of
mothers of children under 5. Women from the local community are trained in
child development and adult education. They hold workshops at nutrition centers
and emphasize what mothers can do with their children at home.<p>
<p>
In a marginal area of Bogota, Colombia, a parent education programme was
developed. In this project, mothers or primary care-givers met once a week in a
community center where they were provided information on psychosocial as well
as health and nutrition questions. An innovative feature of this project
building on local practice was the creation of a baby book containing messages
from the baby to the mother. The book covering the first two years of life
provides a personal record for the child, at the same time, educating
care-givers and serving as a basis for discussion.<p>
<p>
All of these programmes recognize that parental education is not simply
"outside" experts transmitting pre-determined messages to parents who are
assumed to lack knowledge. Rather, they support common wisdom and local
practices as well as incorporating how information about development that has
not yet found its way into the sphere of common knowledge.<p>
<p>
In summary the enthusiasm surrounding parenting education is recognized by the
following factors;<p>
<p><ul>
  Both children and parents can benefit.<p>
  Reinforces family stability and responsibility as opposed to giving this to
        educational institutions.<p>
  Adds continuity and reinforces what may occur in other programmes.<p>
  Improvements in CD are more likely to be sustained.<p>
  Broad coverage can be maintained at lower costs.<p>
</ul>
<p>
It must be kept in mind however that parent education programmes are timely,
and that the process of transferring knowledge must provide for through
interpersonal exchange. It is suggested that parental education should be one
of several strategies that should be pursued simultaneously.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>C.	Guiding Principles</b><p>
<p>
Through the implementation of child development programmes from around the
world several principles or guidelines have evolved that should be considered.
These include:<p>
<p>
<p><ul>  Priority should be given to families and communities in which children are at
risk of delayed development.<p>
<p>
  Programmes should form part of a complementary multifaceted strategy, build
upon existing infrastructures, and develop partnerships with established
institutions and organizations.<p>
<p>
  Programmes should be community-based and community residents should play a
major role in all aspects of the programme's design and implementation.<p>
<p>
  Programmes should be able to adjust to different socio-cultural contexts, and
the materials and methods should incorporate a range of techniques.<p>
<p>
  Programmes should recognize and strengthen the local child-rearing patterns
and practices that have been devised to cope with problems of child care and
development.<p>
<p>
  Programmes should be financially feasible and cost-effective, and find ways
to address issues related to long term sustainability.<p>
<p>
  Programmes should try to reach the largest possible number of children and
families in need of services.</ul><p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>III.	Strategies</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A.	Goal</b><p>
<p>
Based upon these principles, UNICEF/Cairo in collaboration with its
non-governmental and governmental partners is planning to design, implement,
and evaluate a range of complementary Early Child Development (ECD) activities.
The overall goal of these activities is to empower those who care for young
children including health professionals, teachers, families, and parents with
the knowledge, attitudes, and skills necessary to enhance the development of
Egyptian children from birth through the first six years of life. <p>
In order to enhance the development of young children in greatest need of
services, the proposed National Early Child Development Programme requires a
multi-staged, multi-channeled complementary approach. The following section
outlines four specific projects comprising this approach.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	Multi-Faceted Complementary Approach</b><p>
<p>
Over the next several years UNICEF will develop a National Early Child
Development Programme consisting of several interrelated projects. At the
present time, four projects comprise this strategy and include:<p>
<p>
a. Community-based parent education activities in collaboration with NGOs and
  other community service providers.<p>
b. Enhancing child development through mass media efforts.<p>
c. Integrating child development issues into existing health and nutrition
services.<p>
d. Strengthening existing formal preschools.<p>

</pre>
As shown in the above Figure, the overall goal of each of these four projects
is to enhance the development of young children from birth through the first
six years through the training of existing service providers including
community workers, media personnel, pediatricians, preschool educators, and
parents. <p>
<p>
The specific objectives of each of these four projects are as follows:<p>
<p>
1. <b>Community-Based Parent Education Programmes</b>   The objective of this
project is to work with existing non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and
other community groups in the design, implementation and evaluation of a
parenting education programme. Working with small groups of parents and other
caregivers, trained community facilitators will discuss issues related to the
developmental needs of young children from birth through the first six years of
life.<p>
<p>
2. <b>Mass Media Activities</b>   The objective of this project is to work with
representatives from the mass media to develop a series of television, radio
and print materials on themes related to child development. These programmes
will be targeted to audiences of parents and other caregivers. In addition,
these methods could also be utilized in the design of programmes and materials
for children in the first six years of life.<p>
<p>
<p>
3. <b>Integrating Child Development with Health and Nutrition</b>
Capitalizing on the success of Egypt's child survival efforts, the goal of this
project is to increase the knowledge, attitudes and skills of pediatricians and
other health care providers regarding the developmental needs of young
children. Understanding the relationship between psychosocial, nutrition and
health needs of the young child will result in the delivery of a comprehensive
approach to child health. Thus, young children as well as parents will benefit
from the activities of this project.<p>
<p>
4. <b>Preschool Education</b>   The objective of this project is to strengthen
Egypt's existing preschool education facilities and programmes. Through a
series of training activities and workshops, preschool education teachers will
be exposed to different approaches to early child education. In addition these
activities will improve the ability of preschool educators to work with and
understand the needs of families and parents of young children.<p>
<p>
The success of the proposed National Strategy is dependent upon the close
collaboration of each of the four projects. No one approach is sufficient. The
skills, expertise and commitment of educators, community workers, media, and
health professionals must work together with families and parents to enable the
Egyptian children to reach their full potential. The content of materials and
methods used to accomplish the project objectives should recognize and build
upon the values and strengths of parents in caring for their children combined
with new information on development. To foster and guide this collaboration,
between each of these initiatives it is suggested that an Advisory Committee
comprised of representatives from each of the four project areas be
established.<p>
<p>
I will now discuss in more detail the conceptual underpinnings of the
Community-Based Parent Education Project which will be the subject of the
afternoon working groups.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV.	Project Description: Community-Based Parent Education Programme</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>A.	Introduction</b><p>
<p>
The goal of this project is to collaborate with NGOs and other existing
community services to provide parents and families with information and skills
about the importance of the early child development period (birth - 6 years).
Through participation in this project parents will gain knowledge and skills
enabling them to enhance their child's cognitive, emotional, social development
as well as to foster their learning skills.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>B.	Programme Planning</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Although there is a tremendous amount of material on "how to parent" it
will be important to tailor this information to meet the needs of Egyptian
parents. Thus, the content of the material presented in the programme must
address early child development issues that are important to Egyptian parents.
It is necessary to build upon and recognize the strengths of existing patterns
and practices. New information can then be integrated into this framework.<p>
<p>
Recognizing this need, the first step in the development of this project is to
work with parents and communities in the identification of existing patterns
and practices, problems and concerns regarding early child development, and
factors that inhibit parents from changing their behavior. Using informal data
collection techniques including interviews, observations, and small group
discussion sessions, the needs of parents on topics such as feeding,
discipline, language, development, social and emotional development and early
learning skills will be explored. Information about what parents want for their
young children as well as their current practices will also be obtained.<p>
<p>
The knowledge gained from this research will be used to guide the development
of the content of the parent education curriculum. A joint working group
consisting of members of NGOs, community representatives and technical experts
in the field of early child development will work collaboratively to design and
pre-test the programme content. For example, the parent education programme
could include age-appropriate (infancy, toddlerhood, preschool) information on
various themes including:<p>
<p><ul>
	<li>  Patterns of parent-child interaction
	<li>  Discipline
	<li>  Language and communication
	<li>  The role of play
	<li>  Safety and health
	<li>  Feeding and nutrition
	<li>  Learning, problem-solving and sensory capabilities
	<li>  Self-esteem and social development
	<li>  Gender differences in early development</ul>
<p>
In addition to those cross cutting themes, parents could be provided with
critical information on the timing and sequence of tasks in the normal process
of child development.<p>
<p>
It is also necessary to identify the set of materials and methods to be used in
transferring this information to parents. For example, various formats could be
explored including posters, videos, cartoons, flash cards, story-books. The
methodology for working with parents and families needs to be developed such as
small groups, home visiting and linkages to existing programmes such as
literacy and women's income generating activities.<p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>C.	Programme Implementation</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b></b>Working with NGOs, the community-based parent-education facilitators
will be identified and trained. At the same time, efforts to mobilize parents
of young children about the importance of this programme will be implemented.<p>
<p>
The parent-education facilitator will implement the curriculum working with
small groups of parents with children of similar ages. For example, it would be
necessary to form groups of parents with children of infants, toddlers, or
preschool age. In this way, parents could discuss issues of development which
are most relevant to them.<p>
<p>
It will also be important to closely supervise and co-ordinate the programme
both within and between communities. Thus, a coordinating body should be
established to identify problems, provide immediate solutions and make
necessary adjustments in the content of the curriculum as well as the training
and implementation strategies.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>D.	Evaluation</b><p>
<p>
In addition to monitoring the process of the programme, efforts to evaluate the
ability of the project to improve the parents' knowledge and beliefs as well as
increase their parenting and child rearing skills will be evaluated. It is
expected that children will also benefit from their parents' participation in
the programmes. Thus, changes in the child's development will also be
evaluated.<p>
<p>
<b></b><p>
<b>E.	Expansion and Sustainability</b><p>
<p>
Based on the results of the evaluation combined with the acceptance of the
programme at the community level, issues of programme expansion will be
discussed. Factors relevant to a discussion of programme expansion and
sustainability includes, for example, financing, training facilities,
availability of personnel, materials development, monitoring and supervision.
Of critical importance will be how to maintain quality as the programme seeks
to reach higher numbers of families in need of the services.<p>
<p>
<p>
I look forward to our group discussion this afternoon and to your reactions to
this community-based parent education project. Again, I thank you for the
privilege of being a part of your work. I would like to close with a statement made at a public
lecture recently delivered at a UNESCO Seminar, Urie Bronfenbrenner, a great
friend of children, underlined the importance of our common responsibility when
he stated "the most potent dynamic that will bring success to our effort is the
new hope to families and nations across the world of seeing children, seemingly
fated to a life of failure and pain, bloom into competent and caring human
beings".

     The focus of the world's attention has begun to shift to the 21st century.  Every major
international agency has set goals to be achieved as we head into the Year 2000 and beyond.  It is
important to have a long-term vision of what should happen to support children's development in
the next decades.  But in order to do that we need to have a clear understanding of where we are
now and what can be accomplished during what remains of this century.  In the next five years the
base for the work in the 21st century can be strengthened in much the same way that early
childhood care and development programmes seek to strengthen young children's base for all later
learning.<BR><P>  
     What I would like to do in this presentation is to highlight some of the major
accomplishments internationally during the last 15 years, raise some of the questions that have
arisen in relation to these accomplishments, and present some of the challenges before
us.<BR><P>  
<B>Accomplishment A: Many people have been "sold" on the importance of early childhood care
and development (ECCD), based on an understanding of the economic benefits of the
investment.</B><BR><P>  
     Early childhood care and development (ECCD) has been promoted actively by
practitioners for decades. Those who have taught young children are very much aware of the
value of the experience for the child. Educational psychologists have also been advocates of
attention to children's developmental needs during the early years. But neither the practitioners
nor the theorists have been able to command national or international attention. What finally made
a difference was being able to discuss the benefits of quality early childhood programming in
terms of cost savings and rate of return on investment. <BR><P>  
     The most striking example of these data have come from the High/Scope Perry Preschool
Project.  In that project a group of children from a small community in the USA have been
followed over the past 22 years.  Some of these children experienced a quality pre-school
programme; the other group had no preschool experience.  The experiences of these children have
been recorded as they progressed through school and have moved into adulthood.  The most
recent data were collected when the children reached age 27.  The differences between the groups
are dramatic, not only in terms of school achievement, but more importantly in terms of a variety
of social dimensions.  Those with the pre-school experience as compared with their peers who did
not attend preschool, did better in school, continued their education longer, have better paying
jobs, have more stable families, and are much less likely to require public assistance or have
criminal records.  These characteristics can be assigned economic value.  When this is done, the
study indicates that the public is receiving an estimated $7.16 for every dollar invested in
preschool. (Schweinhart et al., 1993) Data such as these have captured the attention of policy
makers, and national policy in relation to programmes for young children and their families has
changed as a result.<BR><P>  

     Early childhood care and education is also beginning to find its place on the agenda of
major donor agencies. A major boost to the early childhood field came as a result of events that
took place at the World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) held in March 1990 in
Jomtien, Thailand.  During the conference the vision of "basic education" was expanded to
include meeting basic learning needs in the earliest years. This expanded definition reflected a
recognition that early development provides the foundation for learning in primary school and for
productive social contributions in later life.  Within the Framework for Action adopted at the
Conference it was noted that <I>learning begins at birth</I>. Further it stated: <BR><P>  


<CENTER>  "The preconditions for educational quality, equity and efficiency are set in the early
childhood years, making attention to early childhood care and development essential to the
achievement of basic educational goals."  (Paragraph 20)</CENTER><BR>
<P>
The Framework for Action included some dimensions of basic education that countries might
include in their own Action Plans for the 1990s. Among these was:<BR><P>  
<CENTER>  "Expansion of early childhood care and developmental activities, including family
and community interventions, especially for poor disadvantaged and disabled children" (Paragraph
8)</CENTER><BR><P>  


     The endorsement given at WCEFA for early childhood programming was in response to
overwhelming evidence that it is a sound social investment to provide appropriate support for
children's growth and development during the first years of life.  WCEFA spurred new interest
among many governments and some international organizations in creating and strengthening
programmes for the early childhood years.  The ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the
Child (November 1989), and the Summit for Children (September 1991) also brought increased
recognition to the needs of young children.  <BR><P>  


     This international climate in support of programmes addressing the needs of the young
child has opened up new funding.  For instance, the World Bank, which had virtually no loans in
this area five years ago has responded to country requests with at least a dozen loans over the last
5 years.  These loans support such diverse initiatives as programmes of parental education, formal
and non-formal pre-school programmes, home day care, and nutrition programmes that include an
educational component.  And today the majority of UNICEF offices throughout the world have
devoted significant resources to the support of early childhood programmes. The number of such
programmes is increasing.<BR><P>  
     Thus, it is safe to say that political will has improved in response to demand and in
growing recognition of the benefits that come from investments in the early years. 
<B><I>Indeed, it is probably fair to say that attention to children during the pre-school years is
now the fastest growing part of the educational sector.</B></I><BR><P>  
<B>Questions that arise:</B><BR><P>  
     There are essentially two questions that come to mind immediately.  The first is related to
programme quality.  Those programmes that have shown a clear impact are of high quality.  Thus
a primary question is, what is the real value of investment in early childhood programming when
low-cost models of pre-school provision are being implemented?  What level of quality must be
obtained before we can see positive results? <BR><P>  
     We know that the indicators of quality can be divided into two categories.  There are the
static dimensions -- the physical structure, the availability of water and sanitary facilities, the
amount of square footage per child, the kinds of materials the children have to work with -- all the
dimensions that are easily measured.  <BR><P>  
     The other indicators are the dynamic ones.  These include the kind of interaction that the
teacher has with the children, the way children relate to one another in the programme, the type of
supervision the teacher receives, the relationship of the parents and the community to the
programme.  These are the indicators that make a difference, but they are seldom used because
they are difficult to measure.<BR><P>  
     A great deal of work needs to be done to come up with indicators of quality that people
are comfortable using. We need to identify indicators that will allow us to make decisions about
the kinds of programmes that we should be supporting and ones where we can anticipate positive
results from our investment.<BR><P>  

     A related issue is the relationship between cost and outcomes.  We know that there is not
a causal relationship between the cost of a programme and its quality.  However there is a
relationship.  There are data to suggest that increased investment in quality early childhood
interventions is economically valid. That is, the rate of return for investment in the early years is
higher than rates of return at any other level of the education system. Thus it is argued that
governments should increase their spending for such programmes. <BR><P>  
     When policy makers become convinced that investment in ECCD is a sound investment,
they begin to look around for programmes to implement.  They see that early childhood advocates
promote the adoption of "low-cost" models -- implemented by paraprofessionals (hopefully with
some training), paid less than minimal wages or expected to provide volunteer service, using
locally made materials almost exclusively, and operating in makeshift space. Can it really be
expected that these low-cost efforts will allow the same yield on investment as higher-cost higher-
quality programming? Although one would not argue that high dollar investment is sufficient to
guarantee quality, it can well be imagined that there is a minimum investment necessary to yield
positive results.  The question is, what is the minimal investment that should be made in an early
childhood programme so that we can be assured of a positive outcome?<BR><P>  
     Another question is, how do we take current government interest in early childhood
programmes and turn that into policy which will provide sustained support for such programmes?
It is one thing for a government to be 'sold' on the importance of early childhood provision.  It is
quite another to have policies in place from which appropriate programmes can be developed.
<BR><P>  
     Some interesting initiatives along these lines are taking place.  For example, currently the
government of Malaysia is involved in a policy review.  A study has been commissioned to look at
the various programmes that the government is offering that impact on young children. <BR><P> 

     The study was initiated because currently there are six government departments
responsible for the provision of care and/or education to children before they enter the primary
school. These include the Ministry of Education, The Ministry of Land and Rural Development,
The Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Social Development and National Unity and the Ministry
of Human Resources.  There are also several quasi-governmental organizations providing early
childhood programmes. Each has a slightly different mandate and/or population that it serves. 
Yet there is an overlap of services in some communities and no one serving children and their
families in other parts of the country.  The government wants to create greater coherence within
the system.<BR><P>  
     It is anticipated that the main outcome of the study will be a set of essential data and a
"menu" of policy, strategy and financial options which will allow decision-makers to formulate a
comprehensive and cost-effective Malaysian policy for ECD for the next decade. Further, it is
anticipated that the review will lead to proposals regarding arrangements for effective
implementation, monitoring, management and coordination of the programme, and subsequent
identification of broad policy and strategy options for strengthening ECD's contribution to
national development.<BR><P>  
     This type of review of current early childhood provision, leading to a set of policy
recommendations was also undertaken in South Africa, in anticipation of the installation of the
new government.  Increasingly as governments are asking questions about how best to invest in
early childhood programming, groups like UNICEF are in a position to facilitate this type of
linkage between current programming and policy.<BR><P>  

<B>Challenges:</B><BR><P>  
 
     As there were two questions, there are two challenges.  One
challenge is to better understand the economics of creating, implementing and sustaining early
childhood programmes and to be bolder in our statements about the level of resources required if
the investment is going to pay off. The other challenge is for early childhood educators to work
more closely with government to see that appropriate policies are established that will support the
development of programmes for young children and their families.<BR><P>  

<B>Accomplishment B:  This is an abundance of strategies for the provision of Pre-school for
children 3-6 years of age.</B><BR><P>  
     In all corners of the world one can find pre-school programmes for the 3-6 year age
group. Some of these have strong theoretical foundations; others are based on the model for
primary schooling which prevails in the country. Some are well known, documented and
promoted; others are known only to those whom they serve. Many include high levels of parent
involvement and/or are community-based. Almost all attempt to be culturally appropriate,
particularly in terms of curriculum and materials used by and with children. Some have even
successfully integrated traditional religious and cultural activities with more secular learning. Be
cause of the variety of options currently available to a group or community that wants to create a
pre-school programme, it is hard to imagine that someone could come up with a truly
"innovative" approach to pre-school education, at least within the limits of our beliefs, values and
assumptions about learning and the purpose of education.<BR><P>  
<B>Questions that arise:</B><BR><P>  
     One of the reasons new approaches are funded is that we do not know enough about what
can be achieved by the programmes that currently exist.  There are a wide variety of programmes
that claim to support the growth and development of young children.  Most programme
descriptions state that they are child-centered, or activity-based, or some phrase to that effect. But
when you step inside the centre you find the children's attention focussed on the teacher; children
are not actively involved in learning. Thus we need to get  inside programmes to understand the
relationship between the goals of the programme and what is actually happening on a day-to-day
basis, and what that means in terms of child outcomes.<BR><P>  
     We argue for increasing the number of places available in daycare, yet the research would
clearly indicate that not all programmes produce long term positive results for children. 
Kagitcibasi (in press) conducted a comparative study of children who participated in daycare
where little attention was paid to children's overall development, a pre-school with a well-rounded
programme, and children whose mothers participated in a "Mother Training" programme.  She
found that the children who did best were those in the Mother Training group. Those in the pre-
school did almost as well.  However, those in the daycare setting lost ground developmentally as a
result of being in the programme.  Thus, it is important that those programmes that exist are
evaluated systematically and that we make clear choices about the kinds of programmes that
governments should and should not fund.  <BR><P>  
     At this point in time there is a lack of comparative knowledge about what has worked and
what has not.  So rather than trying to identify 'innovative' approaches, attention might more
profitably be focused on testing the efficacy of various strategies.  It would be useful to identify
effective strategies that might be combined to create an integrated programme, creating new, or at
least more clearly defined, models that can usefully be disseminated.<BR><P>  
     In the process, one of the questions that needs to be answered is, what constitutes a
<I>model?</I> A dictionary definition of the word suggests it is "a preliminary pattern
representing an item not yet constructed and serving as the plan from which the finished work,
usually larger, will be produced, or, a tentative ideational structure used as a testing device."
(American Heritage Dictionary of English Language, 1969). From that definition an early
childhood intervention model can be seen as a framework (plan) that provides the theoretical
underpinnings for the creation of a programme that is built upon locally and tested in context for
appropriateness.<BR><P>  
     If this definition is applied to the various early childhood activities available, it is soon
evident that most are not models. Rather, they are a set of strategies that may or may not be part
of a larger whole that could be called a model. For example, in India the Cognitively Oriented
Preschool Programme for Children (COPPC) has been developed. It is seen by some as a pre-
school curriculum. In fact, it consists of a set of games and activities which teachers can use to
engage children in the learning process. During COPPC training teachers are actively engaged in
learning as they construct games and activities to be used with the children. Having experienced
active learning themselves, they are better able to understand its value. And that is the primary
learning they take into the classroom. <BR><P>  
     Even though the COPPC approach is neither a model nor a total curriculum, it is valuable
in that it is able to stimulate a teacher's thinking and behavior, which, in turn, makes a difference
in terms of how children learn. So, in putting together a programme, one would want to include
some of the dimensions of the COPPC effort.<BR><P>  
<B>The challenges:</B><BR><P>  
     One challenge is to make sense of the rapidly expanding set of approaches, techniques and
methodologies designed to affect children's development in their early years, and then determine
what should be disseminated, based on its effectiveness. <BR><P>  
     A further challenge has to do with the age group currently being reached.  As noted, most
early childhood programmes have been created for the 3-6 year old child. Little programme
development has been done for the child from the point of "survival" to the age of 3. Children
within this age group are relatively invisible. Yet, as research to be discussed later indicates, it is a
critical period in terms of health, nutrition and cognitive stimulation. Thus there is a gap in our
experience in developing effective programmes for the youngest children and their families. 
<BR><P>  
<B>Accomplishment C:  There is increasing recognition of the importance of
 the linkage between what happens in early childhood programmes and children's experience in the
early years of the primary school.</B><BR><P>  
 In recent seminars, workshops and international fora one of the main topics of interest has
  been the interface/linkage between pre-and primary schools. Part of the impetus for this came
  from the WCEFA activities where the early years were linked with basic education.  This was
  built on an understanding of the continuity of children's development from birth through the
early  primary years. Carrying this thinking through, policy-makers and programmers are seeing
the
  relationship between children's early childhood experiences and their school attainment and
  performance.<BR><P> 
  
     There is increasing concern about the high drop-out and repetition rates in many Majority
  World countries.  These rates are particularly high during the first three years of primary school. 
  The predominant response is that children are not ready for school, so "readiness" programmes
  have been created.  For example, there is a "Bridging Programme" in South Africa, where
children
  essentially have a year of schooling within the formal school system before they are admitted into
  the first primary grade.  Another example is Promoting Primary and Elementary Education
  (PROPEL), a program which has been developed in India.  Through it children ages 3-6 spend 2
  hours a day in centres designed to help prepare them to enter school. <BR><P> 
  
     These particular readiness programmes make the assumption that children will perform
  better and stay in school longer if the child is better prepared for the school.  However, it needs
to
  be recognized that the child does not stand alone.  
Children's school experiences are based on the

 interaction between the child and the school.  Therefore, another part of the readiness equation
is
  the degree to which the school is ready to receive the child.  For example, many schools operate
  from the assumption that children are empty vessels to be filled.  There is a lack of awareness
  regarding children's developmental differences and the kinds of experiences they bring with them
  as they enter school.<BR><P> 
  
     The importance of the school's readiness is illustrated by the experience that non-
  governmental agencies have had implementing high quality pre-schools and then discovering that
  despite the fact that children are well prepared for learning, they have very negative primary
  school experiences.  This has caused people to question the value of investing in an early
  childhood program if the benefits of that programme are lost when children enter a primary
school
  of questionable quality.<BR><P>   
  
     Within India there is an interesting example of what can happen when a high investment in
  early childhood programming was made without adequate attention to the total context. In
  Gujarat, a state in Western India, the Aga Khan Education Services (AKES) operates a cluster
of
  50 day care centres which are half-day pre-schools providing children with education, health
  services and nutritional supplementation. Further, there is a high degree of emphasis on parent
  education and community control of centres. Over the years these pre- schools have provided
  children with a solid base intellectually, physically and socially as they enter the local government
  primary school. In the late 1980's AKES began tracking what happens for the children as they
  enter primary school.<BR><P> 
  
     While the expectation was that primary school teachers would respond positively to the
  fact that children entering from the pre- schools were well prepared for school, and would
  perhaps be motivated to teach better, that has not been the outcome. In some instances it was
  reported that the children were immediately advanced to primary 2 or 3, even though the
children
  were not prepared to succeed intellectually or socially at that level. In other instances they were
  segregated from the other children and neglected until those without the pre-school experience
  had caught up. In neither instance is this an appropriate response. The strength of the pre-school
  experience is not being built upon; it is being set aside. Unless there are ways of working with
the
  primary school teachers and providing continuity between the pre-school and primary school
  experience, the argument could quite legitimately be made that it is not worth investing in the
pre-
  school.<BR><P> 
  
     While not going to the extreme and arguing that investments not be made in preschool if
  the primary school is not adequately prepared to receive the children, Myers (1988) in a review
of
  the research on the relationship between pre-schools and primary school performance,
concludes:<BR><P> 
  
  <CENTER>   Enrollment, progress and performance in school are influenced both by the
cognitive and
       social characteristics a child brings to the school and by the availability and quality of
       schooling. Either or both of these sets of variables can favor or present obstacles to
       successful school enrollment, adjustment, progress, and achievement... Programme
       decisions about early childhood intervention and about improvements in primary schooling
       should be considered together, not separately. (p.2-3)</CENTER><BR><P> 
  
     Thus, even as programming for child survival cannot be completely successful in isolation,
  focusing on programming for the needs of children from 3-6 cannot be done in isolation. There
is
  an interdependency between what happens in the pre-school and what happens at the primary
  level.<BR><P>  
  
     While fewer in number, some programs have been developed which address both
  children's readiness for school and the school's readiness to receive children (Subaran, in press). 
  One example is the Joint Innovative Project (JIP) sponsored by UNESCO in China.  Four major
  lines of action have been taken within the project. One was to increase pre-school provision, a
  second was to focus on improving teaching methods and teaching materials at the primary level,
  third, teacher training was improved and fourth, there was an attempt to increase parent and
  community involvement.<BR><P>  
  
     Another example of a programme designed to bridge the gap between the child and the
  school comes from South Africa where within the Bophuthatswana school system a pre-school
  programme was developed as part of a larger school reform effort.  As in the China project, the
  focus is on increased pre-school provision, curriculum continuity, teacher training, and
community
  involvement. Thus in both instances the readiness issue is being addressed by focussing on all the
  essential elements in the child's environment -- the family, the community, and the school as well
  as the child.<BR><P> 
  
  <B>Questions that arise:</B><BR><P> 
  
     The primary question is, how do we know when interventions with young children and/or
  interventions in schools make a difference?  The difficulty in answering this question has been
that
  there are no agreed-upon indicators of either children's readiness for school or the schools
  readiness for the child.  <BR><P> 
   To try to fill this void the Secretariat of the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care
  and Development (known as the CG) is coordinating a project within four countries (Kenya,
  Jamaica, Jordan and Colombia). Within each country a group of researchers is attempting to
  create a profile of what children are like when they enter the primary school, and what the school
  is like that is receiving them.  <BR><P> 
  
     The Child Status Profile is intended to reflect a holistic view of the child, to be relevant to
  the particular location in which it is to be used, and to be relatively simple.  It will provide a
  description that can be used to monitor the changing status of a population, to help identify
  groups of children (not individuals) most in need of support, and to provide measures of early
  intervention program effects as well as baseline data for the condition of children as they enter
  schools. <BR><P> 
  
     As noted, there is another side of the equation and that is the ability of schools to respond
  to the children. Because development and learning occur as a child interacts with his or her
  environment, the ability of a child to learn in any learning environment (including school)
depends
  not only on what the child brings to the environment but also on what the environment offers the
  child. Therefore, it is crucial to balance indicators of a child's status with indicators of the
  environment in which a child develops and learns. By creating a "Profile of the Learning
  Environment in Schools", it is possible to monitor the environment's (or school's) part in this
  interactive process.  Thus within the project, a profile for schools will also be created. 
<BR><P> 
  
  <B>The Challenges:</B><BR><P> 
  
     The challenge here is not to be satisfied with a <I>quick fix</I>.  It will not work to simply
  provide children with a 'crash course' to make them school ready.  Neither will the linkage
happen
  through osmosis.  (Some people think they have solved the problem by moving the pre-school
  onto the school compound to make the primary school more sensitive to the population about to
  enter the primary school.)  Concerted effort will have to be made to introduce curricula that
  provides a continuity of experience for children, to provide upgraded and on-going teacher
  training that prepares teachers to work with children from 3 to 8 years of age, and to get the
  community more involved in children's education from the very beginning and continuing on
  through.<BR><P> 
  
  <B>Accomplishment D:  A range of training and dissemination systems has been created in
  order to make early childhood programming available to a wider audience.</B><BR><P> 
  
     For every early intervention strategy developed, there is an accompanying training system.
  The multitude of training schemes can be compared by placing them on a grid (See Figure
1).<BR><P>

     On one axis is pre- versus in-service training. One end represents pre- service training
  only; at the other end is on-the-job training of untrained teachers. In between is every imaginable
  combination. The other axis represents theory versus practice. The predominant model of
training
  being offered today is pre-service training, with a highly theoretical focus (Quadrant I). But this
  does not begin to meet the needs or realities in most Majority World countries. Since the late
80's,
  the movement has been to Quadrant III, where there is greater focus on the practical skills
  provided through in-service training.<BR><P> 
  
     Training falling in Quadrant III is well illustrated by the District Centres for Early
  Childhood Education, DICECESs, developed by the Kenya Institute of Education (KIE). Over
  the last 20 years there has been a boom in the creation of community-based pre-schools in
Kenya.
  The pressures of rapid population growth have meant that there are not enough places in
Primary
  I for all the children who are age-eligible. Recognizing that pre-school education would give
  children a better chance of obtaining scarce places, parents have created their own pre-schools.
  Within the harambee tradition, these schools are built by the community, staffed by untrained
  parent-paid teachers, and operated with sparse equipment and materials.<BR><P> 
  
     KIE began to address the issue of how to provide trained teachers for these community-
  based pre-schools in the late 70s when they created district training centres where local teachers
  receive intensive training over a two-year period during school holidays. In addition, during the
  school year they receive on-the-job training through periodic visits by training centre staff. At
the
  end of training, teachers receive a certificate in early childhood education. After having been
  involved in the district training process since the early 80's, KIE is experiencing two demands.
  One is for additional practical courses for those teachers unable to attend the two-year course
  because of lack of space or lack of minimal academic requirements. And, from those who have
  completed the course, there is a demand for additional theoretical input. In essence, KIE
designed
  a training system to meet a very specific set of needs, and the system is solidly in place.
<BR><P> 
  
  <B>Questions which arise:</B><BR><P> 
  
     From KIE and related training experiences it is clear that when training systems are
  designed to meet the needs of those to be trained and the systems they will serve, it is possible to
  create effective training. When there are too many constraints, the effectiveness of the training is
  more in question. Still other experiences have stimulated questions about the appropriate mix of
  theory and practice, and the limits of in-service training if teachers lack minimal skills.<BR><P> 
  
  <B>The Challenges:</B><BR><P> 
  
     One challenge is to continue to experiment with the more flexible in- service training
  models, the substance and form of which should be developed from needs and sound educational
  practice. Another challenge is to try to establish the threshold between theory and practice that
  gives teachers the practical skills they need to get children actively involved in the learning
  process, while at the same time giving teachers a solid enough theoretical base from which they
  can invent new activities that support children's learning.<BR><P> 
  
     Another challenge is to take those training programmes that have proven to be effective
  and create cadres of trainers who are able to disseminate those programmes to a wider audience. 
     One approach to this is being experimented with by the Bernard van Leer Foundation in
  Africa.  Within this effort master trainers are being identified in a given country. They will
receive
  additional training and then take on the responsibility for training other trainers in their country
  and possibly region.<BR><P> 
  
  <B>Accomplishment E. It has been demonstrated that the most effective programmes are those
  which "integrate" health, education, nutrition, social and economic development
  programmes, and that the younger child benefits from such interventions more than older
  children.</B><BR><P> 
  
     The latest research on the relationship between health, nutrition and stimulation argues
  convincingly that an adequate food supply is not enough to assure a child's survival, neither is
  access to micro-nutrients, neither is education, nor absence of disease.  Children's growth and
  development is fostered when all these variables are present, within a caring environment. 
<BR><P> 
  
     Within the past decade there has been a marked increase in our understanding of the
  interactive relationship between health, nutrition and education. For example, in a review of
  research looking at nutrition and educational achievement, Pollitt (1984) concludes that
  "malnutrition in infants and children is a potent contributor to school wastage." (p.7). He then
  examines a series of studies designed to provide nutritional supplementation. The results of these
  studies were disappointing. Pollitt concludes, "the remedial or preventive effects of monofocal
  nutrition supplementation intervention programmes during early life on the intellectual deficits
  associated with early chronic malnutrition are questionable." (1984, p. 31)<BR><P> 
  
     If that conclusion is valid, then what kind of intervention is appropriate? Research data
  would suggest that a multifocal approach is most effective. An elaborate intervention research
  project was conducted in Cali, Colombia in the early 70s. Children's experience in the
programme
  differed in relation to the age at which they entered and the type of interventions they received.
  The interventions included supplementary foods for the family, regular health monitoring, a full-
  day child care and education programme, and some parent education. This multifocal effort
  yielded positive results in terms of children's health and nutritional status as well as academic
  achievement. Pollitt concludes, "It is apparent... that nutrition interventions per se, as monofocal
  programmes, are not as successful as those multifocal interventions which add educational and
  health services to a good diet." (1984, p.26)<BR><P> 
  
     Another finding highlighted was that the younger the children were when they entered the
  programme, and the longer they were involved, the greater the total benefit to the child. The Cali
  Colombia study, and others reviewed by Pollitt, suggested to him that "there is strong evidence
of
  the plasticity of the organism among young children. The course of their growth and
development
  was heavily determined by the nature of the experiences that the children had." (1984, p. 25)
  Thus, there would appear to be a strong argument for looking at the multiple needs of young
  children and programming accordingly, rather than focusing on only one aspect of development.
  Further, there is a strong argument for providing an enriching environment for children at an
early
  age.<BR><P> 
  
  <B>Questions that arise:</B><BR><P> 
  
     The research cited is but one example of the range of studies currently suggesting both the
  efficacy of integrated programming and intervening early in a child's life in order to make a
  significant difference. The questions that arise are in relation to the nature of integration and
what
  is meant by "early" intervention.<BR><P> 
  
     What does integrated programming mean?  Integrated services  is the buzz-word today.
  For many,  integrated services  is seen as a panacea. Commonly heard phrases include: We could
  use day care centres as a vehicle for offering integrated services to the family... Programmes
  would be more cost-effective if they could provide integrated health and education services...
  Children are already getting an education, why can't we add a health component?... We should
  develop a child care programme in conjunction with the women's income generating activities...,
  etc. In various ways people have been attempting to stimulate cross-sectoral discussion, with the
  goal of creating integrated service programmes.<BR><P> 
  
     One of the problems has been that no one has defined what "integration" means. The
  dictionary sheds some light. According to the Oxford Concise Dictionary, (1987), the word
  "integrate" has two meanings. (1) complete by addition of parts; combine parts into a whole, and
  (2) bring or come into equal membership. If we were to take the first definition, integrated
  programming might be accomplished with relative ease. What tends to happen, however, is that
  people assume that the second definition obtains; there is the implication of "equal" partnership,
  and no one is quite willing to be equal with another. In the final analysis, it comes down to who
  will really be in charge, be responsible, have decision- making power, be held accountable?
  Perhaps a less threatening term should be used. The word, <I>coordinate</I>, for example,
which means
  to bring parts into proper relation, cause to function together. Perhaps <I>coordination</I> is
more
easily
  accomplished.<BR><P> 
  
     However, rather than struggling for a definition of integration or looking for a word to
  replace it, it makes more sense to look at the nature of the relationships that actually occur as
two
  or more sectors attempt to work together. Doing that, it is evident that a variety of words are
  needed. For example, <I>liaison</I> (connection) could be used when groups are at least
meeting
  together to learn more about what the other can provide. <I>Cooperation</I> (working together
toward
  the same end, mutual reinforcement of messages and practices) would describe instances where
  sectors work together to reduce duplication of services, perhaps jointly identifying gaps in
  services that need to be filled and deciding who might best address the gap. <I>Coalition</I>
(temporary
  combination of parties that retain distinctive principles), a stronger word, could be used when
two
  or more sectors actually work together toward some common goal, but the coming together is
  goal specific and/or time-limited. A <I>federation</I> (forming a unity but remaining
independent in
  internal affairs) suggests that separate sectors actually accept each other's goals and together
  focus on the best way to meet community needs. Federation appears to be necessary to
formulate
  national policy guidelines. The ultimate in integration is <I>unification</I> (reduce to unity or
  uniformity), which occurs when there is a single administrative system for the delivery of all
  services. <BR><P> 
  
     At this point there are guidelines for how child care and education programmes might
  <I>cooperate</I> with the health sector to introduce material and child health components
(Evans, 1985
  a), and questions have been raised about how a <I>federation</I> can be created which links the
  intersecting needs of women and children (Evans, 1985).  Further, there are examples of
  <I>unification</I>, where child care is used as an entry point for community development
(Macy, 1985).
  However, it is quite evident that the potential of truly integrated programming has not been
  adequately or significantly explored.<BR><P> 
  
     The second question is, what is the optimal age at which to introduce integrated interven-
  
  tions? As cited above, Pollitt noted that in the studies he reviewed, children who were receiving
  services from a "younger" age benefited more from them than older children involved in the
same  programme. However, the children in the studies he reviewed were no younger than 3. One
of
the  problems is that little longitudinal research has been undertaken to look at the impact of
multifocal  programmes for children 0-3. Thus there remain questions such as, should services be
offered
  earlier than age 3? Would there be an even greater impact if they were? What are the relative
  costs and benefits of such programmes?<BR><P> 
  
  <B>The Challenges:</B><BR><P> 
  
     It is unrealistic to expect that there is going to be one model of "integration"; in different
  situations it is going to mean different things. Thus, as we look toward the creation of integrated
  projects, the challenge is for all actors involved to agree upon a definition of the term as it is to
be  used in that context. Perhaps over time we can create clusters of programmes that exemplify
the
  various ways sectors can work together and have a clearer understanding of the impact of dif-
  
  ferent models of linkage.<BR><P> 
  
     Further, the challenge is to address the potential and nature of interventions appropriate
  for children below the age of 3, in terms of the sectors that should be involved, and the range of
  provision that can and should be provided. <BR><P> 
  
     Most specifically this speaks to the need for much closer work with parents. While
  programmes that educate and enable parents have grown dramatically in some countries, they
are
  virtually non-existent in others, particularly with respect to the psychosocial components of early
  development. <BR><P> 
  
  <B>Accomplishment F.  There is a significant movement toward greater collaboration between
  government, donor agencies and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).</B><BR><P> 
  
     Not only are attempts being made to create programmes which are cross-disciplinary, but
  there are moves for greater collaboration between governmental ministries, bilateral donor
  agencies, and local non-governmental organizations (NGOs).  In particular, bilateral donor
  agencies and international funding organizations are increasingly turning toward NGOs to create
  and implement programmes.  It is only within recent years that we have begun to see examples
of  collaborative arrangements which bring together and build on the strengths of 
 the participating  organizations.<BR><P> 
  
     This move toward greater collaboration has come about for a multitude of reasons. 
  Among them are the fact that: (1) The global economic crisis has put increasing burdens on
  governments.  They lack the resources to provide the range of supports and services required. 
(2)   There has been a serious questioning about the ways in which foreign aid has been provided. 
  There is a realization that traditional forms of aid have not been very effective. Thus new ways
of  working with countries are being sought.  (3) There is a belief that non-governmental
organizations are more in touch with what is going on at the grassroots level and thus have a
wealth of
  insight and experience that would be helpful in national programming.  Further, NGOs have
  greater administrative flexibility and can implement new initiatives more rapidly than
  governmental agencies.   <BR><P> 
  
     There are several trends evident even in these early days of co-operation and
  collaboration.  One is the expansion of successful NGOs to work on a much larger scale.  The
  primary example here is BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Advancement Committee) in Bangladesh. 
  With donor support, BRAC has now created rural development and education programmes that
  rival government programmes in scale and effectiveness. <BR><P> 
  
     The second is for NGOs to be much more sophisticated in their approach to and work
  with donors.  Again, BRAC is a good example. For years BRAC has been receiving funds from
  donor agencies to implement a full range of economic development and education programmes.
  For each agency BRAC has had to generate proposals and write reports (all with different
formats
  and timelines).  Rather than continuing to respond to all these demands, BRAC became
pro-active
  and created a consortium of donors with whom it works as a group, greatly simplifying
  administrative procedures while assuring results for donors.<BR><P> 
  
     Third, a hierarchy of NGOs is developing.  Some NGOs, BRAC among them, have
  become very powerful.  They have attained such a prominence internationally based on their
work
  that it is difficult for the national government to ignore them.  While some have questioned
  whether sizeable funds should be committed to one NGO, others have argued that given there is
  already a proliferation of groups, it is more valuable to provide adequate backing to those which
  are working well than to support numerous small, untried NGOs (Smillie, 1988).<BR><P> 
  
     An important role that the established NGOs are playing is provide technical support to
  other NGOs in terms of capacity/ institution building, dissemination of experience, networking
  and educating the funders in relation to effective programmes and policies.  This work has
  resulted in the strengthening of many of the smaller NGOs.<BR><P> 
  
     A fourth trend is the development of coalitions. NGOs are realizing that they can be more
  effective in working with government and with donors if they can present a united front. 
  Umbrella organizations of NGOs have developed in Asia (ANGOC) and Africa (FOVAD) to
  advocate for greater understanding of and support for NGOs.<BR><P> 
  
     Along with greater collaboration among NGOs, there is also greater co-operation among
  donors.  A notable example is the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and
Development  which was a pioneer in this effort to create collaboration among donors.  
A more recent example
is the Donors for African Education, a group which includes both donors and governments
  seeking ways to work together effectively in Africa.<BR><P>
  
     Thus there is considerable attention to the issue of how non-governmental agencies,
  governments and donors can work together to share experiences and resources to better meet
the
  needs of young children and their families.<BR><P>
  
  <B> Questions that arise:</B><BR><P>
  
     Primarily under question is the nature of the relationship that can and should be established
  between government, NGOs and funders/donors. Answers to the question will come partly from
a
  better understanding of NGOs. While the general belief has been that the more NGOs there are
  working in a given area the better, the validity of that belief is currently under discussion.
  Significant questions about the proliferation of, need for, appropriate size and role of NGOs
have
  been raised in several development sectors. These concerns are reflected in World Bank,
  UNICEF, UNDP and USAID documents developed during the past five years. Some of the
  concerns are as follows:<BR><P>
  
     First, how do we differentiate meaningfully among NGOs?  The term NGO is used to refer
  to any and all non-governmental organizations.  Yet NGOs differ greatly in some of the
following
  ways: <BR><P>
  
    <B> Purpose</B> - some are service-oriented, others provide technical support; some focus on
  charity while more and more are shifting to <I>development</I> as the basis of their approach. 
Still
  others are quasi-governmental and have been established as a way for government to conduct its
  work more efficiently.<BR><P>
  
   <B> Size</B> - some are very large, such a BRAC, others may consist of no more than a
handful of
  individuals.<BR><P>
  
     <B>Philosophy/approach</B> - some derive their activities from a grassroots approach to
  working with communities; others provide services to a community based on the NGO's
  assessment of what is needed.<BR><P>
  
     <B>Experience</B> - some are well established with a wealth of experience to back up their
work;
  others have been newly formed and are struggling to find and/or maintain an identify.<BR><P>
  
     <B>Resources</B> - some are well endowed and can devote their energies to their purpose
with
  minimal regard to fund raising, but most operate from year to year.  A poster seen on the wall of
  an NGO read  "We are tackling problems it will take 20 years to solve.  To do that we have five
  year plans, personnel who have been with us less than two years and one year of funding."  That
is
  not an unusual picture.<BR><P>
  
     <B>Scope</B> - some operate locally, working only within a single community; some are
regional
  or national in their focus; still others operate internationally.<BR><P>
  
     Thus it is as meaningless to talk about NGOs as a group as it is to talk about Majority
  World countries as a group.  One needs to know more about the comparative advantages of a
  given NGO in order to determine whether or not it is appropriate to explore collaborative
  arrangements.  <BR><P>
  
     Second, to what extent does NGO strength, often derived from its small size and
  homogeneity, get lost when the NGO tries to expand to reach a larger number of
people?<BR><P>
  
     There are examples of creative people who have needed to create NGOs in order to
  receive funding. Because of this they have been shifted from creative workers and trainers to
  administrators of organizations. This has not always been a successful shift. Unless the individual
  is willing to give up some measure of control (i.e. let someone else run the organization while
  they continue to do what they do best), there is likely to be a struggle between further
developing
  the ideas which were funded and devoting time to the maintenance of an organization which
may,
  in fact, get in the way of the message. It is important to be sensitive to the needs of individuals
  involved in NGOs. The issue is knowing when people should be supported to do what they are
  currently doing best, and when they are ready to take on new challenges. It is not always
obvious.<BR><P>
  
     Third, to what extent do NGOs see each other and the public sector as competitors for
  scarce donor funding and what does that mean in terms of collaboration and the ability of NGOs
  to learn from one another?<BR><P> 
  
     An illustration of the problem comes from an experience of the Aga Khan Foundation
  (AKF).  In the early 80s, AKF began funding a number of early childhood initiatives in India, all
  of which were focused on developing curricula for children 3-6 years of age. From the donor
  perspective it was possible to see ways in which the models being created came from a similar
  theoretical base, and what the various grantees could learn from one another if they would come
  together and share their thinking. However, despite various attempts, it was not until each of the
  projects was near completion that there was some interest in meeting together. In essence, each
  grantee wanted to maintain its own innovative approach until it chose to "go public".
Foundations
  and donors need to be in a position to assess what can be shared, with whom, and
when.<BR><P>
  
  
     There is clearly the potential for clashes between NGOs and governments as large donor
  agencies with bilateral funds are attempting to channel some of these monies to NGOs.
  Governments that have been in control of how these monies are spent are understandably
  reluctant to lose access to these funds and, in response, are establishing governmental
committees
  to control how and to whom these funds are allocated.  Such a process has been established in
  Kenya, where all grants made to the country must be reviewed by a national body before they
can
  be received by the NGO.  The review process consumes both time and financial resources. 
  Actions such as these will not make it easy for donors to provide grants directly to
NGOs.<BR><P>
  
     Fifth, although NGO projects may have small budgets in comparison to the public sector,
  their costs per beneficiary are often high. Does this mean that successful small-scale projects are
  not necessarily feasible as models for serving large populations?<BR><P>
  
     Some of the issues are addressed by looking at the experience of the Centre for Learning
  Resources (CLR) in Pune, India which produced excellent curriculum materials for use by pre-
  school teachers. A complete set of materials adequate for a teacher's use for one year, with
  minimal replacement in subsequent years, was mass produced at what appeared to be a relatively
  low cost ($16/set).  While all who reviewed the materials agreed on their high quality, it was
clear
  that if the materials were to be adopted on a large scale, (i.e. within the ICDS system which
  served 130 million children by the 1990s), the costs to the government would be prohibitive. So,
a
  compromise was made. CLR produced another set of materials at about half the original cost.
  This brought the costs within a manageable range, and they have now been made available to
  government training centres. However, even that compromise does not get the materials directly
  to teachers.<BR><P>
    
     The COPPC project, described earlier, also includes a set of materials, known as the
  COPPC kit. The kit, made from locally available materials, is created by teachers and/or
  supervisors during their training. The basic cost of the set is about $3. This is about as low cost a
  kit as can be produced. Once costs get to this level there is a real question about the durability of
  the "kit". Games made from newspaper, cardboard, etc; do not last long if they are used as
  teachers are trained to use them.<BR><P>
  
     A legitimate question being asked is, how low can the cost per beneficiary be and still have
  a project that is worthwhile?  A related issue is that of "scale". Not all projects have to be
adopted
  nationally, particularly in a country like India. We might better ask, what is the appropriate
"scale"
  to which a project can legitimately be taken?<BR><P>
  
  <B>The challenge:</B><BR><P>
  
     The primary challenge is to continue to explore ways in which partnerships can be
  developed among and between governments, non-governmental agencies and donors.  To do
this
  there is a need to shift from competition to co-operation.  This is not easy for organizations
which
  historically have been competitive.  But the more the organizations work together and break
  down the barriers, the greater potential there is for advancement on all fronts.  <BR><P>
  
  
  
     In sum, over the past 15 years there has been tremendous growth in understanding the
  needs of young children and their families. Persuasive arguments on the economic benefits of
early
  childhood programming have convinced many policy makers of the importance and necessity of
  early childhood provision.  There are a variety of programme models available to meet the needs
  of the 3-6 year age group, yet few for the 0-3 year old. Further, there have been real inroads in
  terms of understanding the inter-relationship of children's health, socio-emotional and cognitive
  needs and there have begun to be examples of appropriate programming.<BR><P>
  
     As in many other aspects of our lives, the more we achieve and learn, the more we see the
  need for greater achievement and learning. The temptation as we look toward the 21st century is
  to envisage a new <I>landscape</I> -- a radical change in the ways that children's needs are
being met --
  while our real understanding of what can happen for young children and their families will come
  from casting a new eye on what exists today.    <BR><P>
  
     We are poised to make a major improvement in the lives of young children around the
  world.  What is needed now is an extra push that will capture, sustain and add to the momentum. 
  We need to support the social and political will to act.  We need to collaborate in new ways to
  marshall additional resources.  We need to put knowledge and experience to work so as to
  improve programme coverage and quality.  In so doing, coming generations of children will be
  provided with what they need as they grow and develop.  <BR><P>

INTRODUCTION<p></center>
	International organizations, private voluntary organizations, and
non-governmental organizations have long been concerned with the survival and
protection of children in developing countries.  These efforts have contributed
to the remarkable reduction of child mortality rates and increased protection
of children in exceptionally difficult circumstances.  While programs directed
towards these aims must continue with increased commitment, policy makers must
expand their vision and recognize the importance of ensuring the survival of
the child's emotional, social and cognitive development.  While it has been
accepted that good health and adequate nutrition support are necessary for the
psychological and social development of the young child, it is less widely
recognized that early childhood education and development programs have a
direct an measurable impact on both the health and nutritional status of the
child.   Although the implications of the synergistic effect of health,
nutrition, and psychosocial development on program planning are manifold, they
have been generally overlooked.  	<p>
	It is anticipated that comprehensive early childhood education and development
programs might receive greater international and national level attention as a
result of major demographic, economic, social, and political changes which have
occurred in the last several decades (Myers, 1989).<p>
<ul>   <li>	 In 1990, more than 12 of every 13 children born will live to see their first
birthday (as compared with 5 of 6 children in 1960).  Projections for the year
2000 show that 19 of 20 children born are expected to survive.  Many, if not
most, of these surviving children live in conditions that put them at risk of
impaired physical, mental, social and emotional development in their earliest
months and years.  <p>
	<li> The rapid rate of urbanization and the associated disruption of stable family
units, the erosion of healthy traditional child care practices, and the
difficulty of adopting new practices appropriate to new settings have a
negative effect on early development.<p>
	<li> The dramatic increase in participation by women in the paid labor force,
combined with changes in family structures (toward nuclear families or
women-headed households) result in an increasing need and demand for
alternative forms of child care in both urban and rural areas.<p>
	<li> Lingering effects of the worldwide recession of the 1980s have exacerbated
problems of early child development as families living at the margin struggle
to survive.<p></ul>
	In addition to these trends, international donors and governments can justify
investments in programs that enhance development in the early years of life
through a compelling set of scientific, social, and economic arguments which
powerfully demonstrate the long term benefits from early intervention programs.
These include:<p><ul>
<b><li>	 The scientific argument.</b>  Scientific research demonstrates that the
early years are critical to the child's social, emotional, and cognitive
development.  This is based on the evidence of rapid brain growth during the
first two years and the effect of sensory stimulation on the structure and
organization of neural pathways.  Moreover, it is accepted that children
exposed to consistent and responsive environments have enhanced nutritional and
health outcomes.  Finally research has demonstrated the positive impacts of
early intervention programs on children's enrollment, progress, and performance
in primary school.<p>
<b><li>	 The human rights argument.</b>  Children have a right to develop to their
full potential.  Allowing arrested development to occur, when it could be
prevented, violates a basic human right.  The 1959 Declaration of the Rights of
the Child and the 1989 Convention designed to reinforce and extend its
principles, are for many the most convincing and fundamental force supporting
early childhood education and development programming.<p>
<b><li>	 The moral argument.</b>  The transmission of moral and social values that
will guide the future of our children begins in the earliest months of life.
There is a strong incentive to strengthen such values in societies concerned
with the rapid erosion of traditional values.  Early childhood education and
development programs can assist in that effort by supporting parents and
communities, thus providing environments that reinforce positive cultural
values.<p>
<b><li>	 The social equity argument. </b> Stressful conditions that inhibit
development in the early years affect the poor more than the rich, reinforcing
social inequities.  The negative outcomes of stressful environments are
cumulative, and poor children fall quickly and progressively behind their more
advantaged peers.  Moreover, in many countries gender-linked disparities in
patterns and practices of childrearing in the early years work against girls'
development and educational opportunities.   Early childhood education and
development programs have the potential to help correct such discrepancies.<p>
	<b><li> The economic argument.  </b>Society benefits through increased
productivity and cost savings associated with enhanced early child development.
Preventive programs can produce savings by reducing the need for expensive
curative health care; by improving the efficacy of education systems; by
reducing the rate of drop-out and repetition; and by reducing the incidence of
juvenile delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, and other forms of harmful social
behavior.  <p>
<b><li> The birth-spacing and population argument.  </b>The link between fertility
rates and education levels suggests that efforts to improve the educational
level of girls and women will have a strong intergenerational effect on
fertility.  Early childhood education and development programs, linked to
parental education and increasing girls' school attendance, can play a role in
promoting family planning and the decline of fertility rates.  <p>
<b><li> The programmatic argument.  </b>The effectiveness of health, nutrition,
education, and income-generating programs can be improved through integration
with programs of child development, thus taking advantage of the interactive
effects among these variables.  Moreover, early childhood education and
development programs are often an important entry point for community
development activities as well as an extension for primary health care
services.  <p></ul>
	One of the major challenges facing the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF)
and its partners is to integrate a child development perspective into existing
programs that are more narrowly focused on chid health and nutrition. Over the
past decade a wealth of experience in the design, implementation, and
evaluation, of demonstration as well as large scale early childhood education
and development programs in developing countries has accumulated.   Based on
these experiences, the following discussion suggests a comprehensive
programming strategy and high-light the factors known to contribute to as well
as those that curtail the effective implementation of financially feasible,
community-based early childhood education and development programs in
developing countries. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b><center>PROGRAM POLICIES, STRATEGIES, AND REALITIES</center></b><p>
<b>A Typology of Complementary Programming Options</b><p>
	The early development of the child is promoted by a continuous interactive
process between the developing child and the people and objects in a constantly
changing environment.  That changing environment includes the immediate context
of the family and the community as well as a larger social political and
economic context with attendant institutions, laws, policies, and norms, and a
culture providing values, rituals, and beliefs.  Recognition of the wide
variation within these systems both between and within developing countries has
led to the development of five complementary program approaches, including: <p><ul>
<b>1.</b>	<b>Delivering a service.  </b>The immediate goal of this direct
approach is to enhance child development  by attending to the immediate needs
of children in centers organized outside the home.  These are, in a sense,
"substitute" or "alternative" environments to the home.<p>
	<b>2</b>.	<b>Educating caregivers.  </b>This approach is intended to educate
and "empower" parents and alternative caregivers in ways that improve their
care and interaction with the child and enrich the immediate environment.  <p>
	<b>3.	Promoting community development. </b> This strategy stresses community
initiative, organization, and participation in a range of interrelated
activities, to improve the physical environment, the knowledge and practices of
community members, and the organizational base allowing common action and
improving the base for political and social negotiations.  <p>
	<b>4.	Strengthening national resources and capacities. </b> The institutions
responsible for implementing programs require financial, material and human
resources with a capacity for the planning, organization, and implementation of
innovative techniques and models.  <p>
	<b>5.	Advocating to increase demand.  </b>This program approach concentrates
on the production and distribution of knowledge in order to create awareness
and demand.  It may function at the level of policy-makers and planners, or can
be directed to the public by changing the cultural environment that affects
child development (Myers &amp; Landers, 1989).</ul>  <p>
	Although all five of these approaches are intended to enhance early child
development, each has different immediate objectives and is directed towards a
different audience or group of participants.  Table 1 summarizes the
beneficiaries, objectives, and illustrative models for each approach.<p>
	Any overall plan for enhancing child development must pay attention to all
five of the approaches distinguished in this Table.  The emphases to be given
within the overall strategy will, of course, vary considerably, depending on
the conditions of the setting in which the program is being developed.  In
spite of various approaches, the main goal of early childhood education and
development programs is to enhance the competence of children to adjust to,
perform in, and transform their own surroundings.  In some cultures this means
greater emphasis on independence; in others, greater emphasis on group
solidarity.  The ultimate outcome for all programs, however, is to enhance the
child's physical, intellectual, and social development.<p>
<p>
<b>TABLE 1</b> (Not available)
<p>
	Three sets of considerations are helpful in overcoming the piecemeal approach
that has unfortunately dominated policy in the past (Myers, 1989).  In the
first instance, one must consider the five types of program strategies;
delivering services to children, educating caregivers, promoting community
development, strengthening national resources and capacities, and advocating to
increase demand.  A second consideration includes a set of guidelines, which
dictate that programs should seek to be integrated, participatory,
cost-effective, and extended over as wide a population of at-risk children as
possible (UNICEF, 1984).  The third consideration relates to a program's
ability to target specific age groups with developmentally appropriate
interventions.  Thus, the tendency to restrict programming for child
development to a particular age group and to emphasize the simultaneous
character of survival, growth, and development, is counteracted by the need for
programs to cover the prenatal period, the period from birth to weaning, the
toddler period, and the early childhood period which extends from approximately
age 3 to age 6 and includes the critical transition from home to school.  <p>
	Innovative programming efforts incorporating the three dimensions suggested by
this framework are numerous.  UNICEF and its collaborating international
organizations including the United Nations Educational, Scientific &amp;
Cultural Organization (UNESCO), the World Health Organization (WHO), the United
States Agency for International Development (USAID), and the World Bank have
contributed to this mix of complementary strategies.  In addition, private
foundations including for example, The Bernard van Leer Foundation, Save the
Children Foundation, Aga Kahn Foundation, have long supported the
implementation of comprehensive early child development.  For example, UNICEF
is continuing its efforts to establish close linkages between child survival
and development programs.  In many instances, these linkages are made by
incorporating child development activities into existing health and nutrition
activities.  In other instances, support has been given to the development of
curricula, model training courses, and supplementary teaching materials as well
as strategies to stimulate the dissemination of these materials.  These
programs hope to attract large numbers of children, with particular emphasis on
children under 2 years of age.  In Chile, UNICEF is collaborating with the
Ministry of Education to develop low-cost nutrition and language centers that
use community workers to reach mothers.  Several examples of home-based
programs of parental education are functioning in India, and Thailand.  Another
strategy is reflected in the support of child development activities into
Child-to-child programs.  In other cases, including Ecuador, Ethiopia, and
Nepal, early childhood education and development programs have been integrated
into women's income-generating activities, thus responding to the intersecting
needs of working women for child care.<p>
	Summaries of programs in five countries including; India, Benin, Nepal,
Colombia, and Kenya are included in Appendix I - V.  Two of the programs, the
home-based project in Nepal (Arnold, 1989) and the center-based project in
Benin, (UNESCO/UNICEF/World Food Program (WFP), 1988) address the barriers
encountered by small-scale innovative programs in the process of increasing
coverage.  The example from Kenya (Njenga, 1989) describes how a process of
measured growth and a slowly expanding infrastructure, combined with a
well-conceived curriculum and a decentralized training program can sustain a
high-quality center-based preschool system.  The examples from Colombia (Sanz
de Santamaria, 1989) and India (Hong, 1989), indicate how a strong political
commitment and a recognition of the critical importance of providing
comprehensive services to children can result in large-scale efforts to reach
impressive numbers of children in need of services.  From the preschool center
in Benin to the hills of Nepal, these five case studies identified the hopes
and challenges as well as the frustrations and constraints involved in program
implementation.  Based on the experience of these programs, the following
section addresses major programming issues in the design, implementation, and
evaluation of early childhood education and development programs in the
developing world.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b><center>CRITICAL ISSUES IN PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION</center></b><p>
<b>Increasing Program Coverage </b><p>
<b></b>	One of the major issues challenging the implementation of early
childhood education and development programs is the need to respond to the
rapidly growing interest in high-quality and affordable programs that can reach
a significant number of children and families.  As planners and practitioners
become increasingly frustrated with small-scale or pilot projects that have
failed to have an impact on policy and programming despite successful outcomes,
the need to understand the underlying mechanisms for mounting large-scale
efforts is critical.<p>
	While the problems associated with the process of program expansion are varied
and complex, they can be classified into four general categories including (1)
lack of adequate resources; (2) absence of political will; (3) weak demand for
services; and (4) inefficient organization, implementation, and management
systems. Child development activities often suffer from unusually difficult
constraints.  For example, child development projects and programs vary widely,
depending on the social and economic conditions, the mix of program components,
the age group involved, the institutional structure for planning and
implementation, the degree of community involvement, and the methods used to
deliver the program.  Program expansion will be vastly different if a program
focusses on physical development and on immunization in a small country with a
relatively high literacy rate than if it attempts to build a sustained,
community-based service including health, nutrition, and psychosocial
components in a large country with a relatively low literacy rate.  Thus, there
is no one formula for programming that is equally applicable in all locations.
An additional set of constraints in program expansion stems from the fact that
early childhood education and development programs, particularly those focusing
on the child under 2 years of age, do not require large investments in
institutionalized structures and are therefore less attractive to politicians
than building large-scale social service institutions.  Moreover, attention to
the integrated needs of children crosses bureaucratic lines rendering no one
institution with specific programmatic responsibility or commitment.  	More
challenging than citing reasons for failure however, is the systematic
identification of components that account for a program's successful efforts to
move to scale.  Far too little energy has been devoted to documenting solutions
to the organizational, administrative, financial, and management problems
projects face as coverage rates are increased (Korten, 1980).  Insights into
the process of program expansion, nevertheless, are accumulating. Three
strategies for achieving scale have been distinguished: expansion, explosion,
and association (Myers, 1984).  Scale through expansion begins with one model
being tested, adjusted, and then extended to other locations until the desired
coverage has been achieved.  Expansion entails a "learning process approach" in
which program development proceeds through three distinct stages.  In the first
stage, the major concern is learning to be effective, while in the second
stage, energy is focused on learning to be efficient.  The third stage is
concerned with expanding the organizational infrastructure needed to carry out
the program objectives. In this model, the rate of expansion is governed
largely by the availability of organizational and institutional support.  The
Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) School from India (Appendix V) is
an example of a program that has achieved scale by expansion. By way of
contrast, increasing coverage through "explosion" circumvents the pilot stage
and implementation starts on a large scale usually with one model serving many
distinct geographic and cultural groups.  This approach is usually the outcome
of a national political decision that is often motivated by politicians' desire
to attract broad political support.  An example of the "explosion" approach is
the Bienestar program in Colombia (Appendix II) in which the same model is
applied to all parts of the country, and maximum coverage in the shortest
period of time is the primary objective. In an association model, program
coverage is accomplished through independently initiated or coordinated but
distinct small-scale projects, each of which responds to the needs of a given
target population. In countries characterized by a loose confederation of
distinct cultural groups, achieving a large-scale program by association may be
desirable, since it allows each program to respond and adjust to the particular
needs of a homogeneous target group. <p>
	While such conceptual distinctions may blur in practice, analyzing these three
approaches is useful because it forces planners to consider the various
elements and preconditions involved in the complex process of expanding program
coverage.  Interest in child development programs is growing, simple
technologies are underway, and a wide range of alternative delivery systems are
being implemented.  The systematic appraisal of present initiatives provides a
critical opportunity to plan for expansion, and in the process, it raises the
consciousness of both national governments and international organizations. <p>
	Any discussion of expanding the coverage of early childhood education and
development programs necessarily raises a number of related issues, including
analyzing costs and financing, creating political will, utilizing the media,
achieving quality control, training personnel, and program monitoring and
evaluation. The following section attempts to highlight some of the major
issues in each of these topics.<p>
<b>Analyzing Costs </b><p>
	The prospects for expanding the coverage of early childhood education and
development programs are determined to a large degree by the availability of
financial resources.  This brief discussion, while not attempting to unravel
the complex web of issues, underscores the need to focus on the costs involved
in the provision of early child development services.  Cost analysis is often a
particularly weak element of the Early Child Development (ECD) policy analyses
and program evaluations.<p>
	It is no surprise that in these economically volatile times there is no easy
answer to how to mobilize resources for early child development activities.
The field of early child development is particularly vulnerable to the economic
and political forces at play, since children do not wield any political power.
Moreover, the services included in early childhood education and development
programs cross many bureaucratic lines, and no one sector is held responsible,
which diffuses prospects for both financial and political support.  The
processes by which financial decisions are reached by donors, governments, and
non-governmental agencies must be more deeply understood.  <p>
	Unfortunately, by most economic forecasts, magical sources of revenue are not
likely to be discovered, and it is incumbent upon us all to look widely for
alternative sources.  At the level of the family, for example, there is need to
consider not only economic contributions but also time contributions by
mothers, fathers, and other caregivers in the provision of children's health,
nutrition, and education services.  At the level of the community, potential
sources of revenue include the contribution of space, facilities, and provision
for safety and maintenance.  Often untapped is the potential energy behind
community solidarity efforts including family support networking and promotion
of traditional childrearing patterns and practices.  These less formal
variables, while difficult to measure, need to be considered simultaneously
with real resources at the household level.  One must consider, however, the
degree to which these cost-sharing mechanisms are feasible, given the growing
demand for early preventive approaches and the need to increase the quality of
services.  <p>
	In creating resources committed to financing early childhood education and
development programs, non-governmental organizations are critical players and
sometimes potential funders of recurrent costs.  The role of international
donors also needs to be reoriented towards a more flexible, sustained,
action-based capacity-building style of assistance, which most donors are ill
equipped to provide.  Collaboration among non-governmental organizations and
international assistance agencies is required in response to different
financial requirements at different levels of project development.  For
example, non-governmental organizations might play an important role in
defining effective implementation strategies, larger funders such as UNICEF
could support programs in the process of learning to expand and becoming more
efficient, and the World Bank and other large donors might enter the process as
programs struggle to expand.  Such collaboration among agencies at different
stages of program development could allow the various organizations to
contribute in a cumulative fashion to the process.<p>
	Finally, public and private sector commitment must be re-energized.
Economists have elaborately illustrated the play of forces affecting the
availability of public sector revenue for child care and development, including
the national economic rate of growth, inflation rates, competing demands of
politically powerful sectors, and the diversity and elasticity of early child
development revenues in relation to changes in the national economy.  Moreover,
the availability of public sector revenue for early child development is
conditioned by a host of politically volatile and sensitive international
economic relationships. <p>
	In the search for financial partners, the need for clear and understandable
cost analysis becomes ever more critical.  Initial assumptions about costs are
often overly optimistic and underestimate costs associated with the provision
of integrated child development services.  Very rarely are attempts made to
measure any benefits beyond a "head count" of beneficiaries.  Awareness of
costs and benefits should be increased at every level of program planning. The
main objectives of the proposed cost analysis are to determine:<p><ul>
	 <li>	Costs associated with expansion and sustainability;<br>
	<li> Relationship of costs to benefits, as compared with other possibilities for
resource allocation;<br>
	<li> Potential opportunities for cost reduction;<br>
	<li> Ways to enhance program efficiency;<br>
	<li> Possibilities for alternative sources of revenue.<p></ul>
	Effective cost analysis must determine various programming costs, including
national or subnational, community, and  external cooperation.  Additionally,
important funding decisions are based on a clear distinction between capital
and recurrent costs.  External cooperation is more available for capital costs,
while recurrent costs are most often met by parents, communities, governments
and non-governmental agencies. The effective application of cost analysis may
help to de-mystify the unknown costs associated with early childhood education
and development programs (Myers &amp; Hertenbert, 1987).<p>
<b>Creating Political Will</b><p>
	An overall strategy for early child development must include attention to the
political and social commitment needed to create demand and sustain services.
Support must be obtained from politicians and policymakers, since they have the
power to make budgetary decisions affecting the rate and process of program
expansion; from bureaucrats, who must be convinced of the value of child
development strategies to ensure sustainability; and from professionals, who
must be encouraged to improve quality through the application of innovative
techniques.  In addition, if the program delivered is to be accepted and
sustained, it is important to capture the popular will of the community.  To
create demand and achieve the support of these groups, a comprehensive and
convincing rationale for investing in early childhood education and development
programs, tailored specifically to the information needs and level of
responsibility of the audience, must be established.  Government officials must
be convinced by a strong database that documents the positive long-term
benefits to program participants and the resulting cost savings from preventive
programs.  In addition, advocacy campaigns must be firmly grounded within an
overall strategic plan that includes a clear sense of objectives,
implementation strategies, and expected outcomes.<p>
	Successful advocacy campaigns require a careful analysis of the recipient
audience.  They must be based on a sensitive understanding of traditional
beliefs and  modern desires and of the social and economic realities
determining the achievability of these aspirations.  Identifying effective
advocacy strategies involves using an array of qualitative data collection
techniques, assessing social organizations and the formal and informal
decision-making processes and understanding national, regional, and community
administrative structures responsible for program implementation.<p>
	The particular mode of communication, the choice of content, and the form of
presentation are dependent on the perceptions and perspectives of potential
communicators and their audiences, including political leaders; civil servants;
university and professional groups; community organizations and movements;
non-governmental organizations (NGOs); newspapers, radio, and television
editors; teachers; religious groups; and artists and intellectuals. Such an
assessment identifies potential allies and collaborators as well as those whose
collaboration may be detrimental to the achievement of the program objectives.
<p>
	A particularly disturbing outcome of successful advocacy campaigns occurs when
the "supply side" is unable to meet the expectations or deliver the services
created by the demand.  Government promises made in part to stir enthusiasm,
mobilize demand, and spur action bring with them a responsibility to mount the
sustained operations necessary to accomplish the proposed objectives.  If that
does not occur, successful and inspiring communication efforts can be
interpreted as hollow public relations ploys -- a situation all too familiar to
expectant recipients.  <p>
<b>Role of Media in Promoting Early Child Development</b><p>
<b></b>	The international expertise to focus national and international
attention on children's survival needs must be transferred to the area of child
development.  Important to consider are the ways in which survival and
development efforts could be mutually strengthened by simultaneous
consideration through selected media channels.  In using media to create
political will, one could consider, for example, developing a "documentary
series" that features child development as a global issue and includes such
topics as these;<p><ul>
 <li>Country-specific rationale for child development policies and programs;<p>
<li> Forms of developmental stimulation techniques easily provided by parents and
other caregivers with emphases on both the societal need for such activities
and the possible benefits to children;<p>

<li>Effective
innovative service delivery models that could focus on either organizational
models or the  work of individuals, including local or national advocates;   
<p>
<li>Traditional
childrearing practices and patterns known to foster development, as well as
those considered to have a negative impact on the developmental process.<p>
</ul>
	In addition to political will and national awareness created through the
media, caregiver education can also be enhanced through the careful selection
and use of appropriate media channels as well as content and format.
Attributes of successful media applications with caregivers as the primary
audience include a focus on local needs and the presentation of appropriate and
available solutions in a compelling, practical, and demystifying fashion
(Israel, Foote, &amp; Tognetti 1987).  For example, an audience self-test for
radio or television could incorporate brief features on child development,
expanding on or explaining issues raised by a set of questions.  A series of
radio or television vignettes could be developed illustrating children's
developmental progress.  Each vignette could focus on the range of normal
development, the identification of potential problems and a presentation of
activities designed to foster development.  An alternative strategy could be to
design TV or radio programs encouraging the use of traditional as well as
modern patterns of childrearing.  It is firmly established, however, that
applications of media techniques to educate caregivers will only be successful
if audience involvement is maximized through both on-air techniques and related
follow-up activities.  Creative experimentation and field trials are required
in the design of effective interactive media that encourages active viewer or
listener involvement.<p>
	Program developers must also be aware of the increasing potential of media
techniques designed to directly enhance children's development.  Using
television as a medium, <i>Sesame Street</i> (Polsky 1974), developed by the
Children's Television Workshop in the United States, is one example of a
technique whose successful adaptation to countries in the developing world is
dependent in part on the application of a carefully conceived curriculum that
is not only respected by parents but is able to attract and sustain the active
attention of the preschool child.  Ideally programs should be flexibly designed
order to respond to the developmental needs of performing at a range of
developmental levels.<p>
<b>Achieving Quality Control</b><p>
	While it is accepted that high-quality child care programs do positively
affect development, a more complex concern is the potential for negative
impacts of poor quality programs on a child's development.  Without information
about the quality of early childhood education and development programs, claims
of high coverage rates are uninformative.  It is particularly important to
raise questions of quality in conjunction with the increased demand for
services.  While quality is a complex, culturally defined, and relative
concept, program planners and policymakers must begin to generate standard
categories and components of quality against which programs can be measured.
Without some grasp of quality and its associated costs, efforts to move forward
on issues of regulation and standard setting will be curtailed.<p>
	In the past, issues of quality in early childhood education and development
programs have been assessed according to three lines of investigation.  First,
global assessments made of a program's overall climate.  Second, specific
dimensions of an early childhood education and development program have been
assessed: (1) structural program aspects, such as group composition and staff
qualifications; (2) dynamic program aspects that capture children's
experiences; and (3) contextual program aspects, such as type of setting and
staff stability.  A third and relatively new line of investigation assesses a
program's interactive effects -- the relation between child care quality and
children's family environments (Phillips &amp; Howes 1987).<p>
	Global assessments of quality have relied on overall rating scales judging
such factors as personal care, language reasoning, materials, and social
development.  Global assessments of quality, however, are of little use to
practitioners and policymakers seeking to influence specific program features
that are predictive of positive outcomes.  Assessments of the structural
dimensions of child care, including adult-child ratio, group size, and
caregiver training and experience, have generated greater insights into the
relative impact of different program components.  Contextual features of child
care, such as staff stability, provide a measure of the quality important for
such a developmental issue as attachment to primary caregivers.  More recently,
quality of child care has been assessed in terms of the joint effects on the
child of care received in a program and care received in the home.  In applying
various assessment models, one is reminded that children's development is
positively affected by exposure to high-quality programs.  In summarizing the
essential components of high-quality care generated by the large body of
existing data, several components have been consistently indicated and are
listed as follows:<ul>
<li>Developmentally
appropriate curriculum that features child-initiated learning activities within
a supportive  environment.
<p>
<li>Careful
selection of staff, with an ongoing strategy for inservice and on-site
training.  Research has established that compared with formal education, child
related training or experience is a stronger predictor of caregivers
effectiveness. 
<p>
<li>Attention
to appropriate staff/child ratios.
<p>
<li>Ability
of programs to engage and establish a partnership with parents and the
community, empowering them with access to information and an opportunity to
internalize positive childrearing practices.
<p>
<li>Strong
administrative support, with direct provision of or linkages to comprehensive
services such as health, and nutrition.
<p>
<li>Effective
evaluation and monitoring procedures allowing staff to monitor and observe
children's progress.  Evaluation data should also be available, providing
feedback to strengthen operations, understand constraints, and foster the
development of effective solutions (Schweinhart 1987).
</ul>
<p>	In summary, the data suggest that quality is best understood as a blending of
specific ingredients.  For example, a favorable staff-child ratio, in the
absence of parent participation, may ultimately have little impact on
children's outcomes.  It is also important to assess the work environment of
the child care setting.  Child care environments have been largely studied as a
developmental environment for young children, while the quality of the work
environment for caregivers has been largely ignored -- despite well known high
staff turnover rates.  Efforts to understand the factors that affect
staff-turnover rates and the resulting negative consequences for children must
also be undertaken. <p>
	Presently, child care in both the developed and developing worlds consists
largely of unregulated environments.  The growing pressure to expand supply
exists without attention to regulation of quality.  The unrelenting demand for
relatively scarce forms of care implies that more children will be placed in
low-quality programs.  Concluding that high-quality child care is beneficial is
insignificant in light of the question raised about the negative effects of
poor-quality care.  Without attention to the quality of care, enrollment
statistics are of little significance.  Policy analysis must provide insights
into both the range of possibilities for as well as the essential
characteristics of high-quality child care, and it must determine what these
essential characteristics will cost (Clark-Stewart, 1987).<p>     <b>Training
Child Development Personnel</b><p>
<b></b>	As indicated by research, and validated by providers and planners of
early childhood education and development programs, the training component is
perhaps the most important factor associated with implementing and sustaining
high-quality programs.  In spite of its importance, training is often the first
to be cut as administrators struggle with decreasing resources; ineffective
learning materials; didactic and sterile methodologies; lack of adequately
trained trainers; and an infrastructure incapable of providing needed inservice
training, follow-up, and supervision.  The following discussion highlights
several conceptual underpinnings of high-quality training for early child care
personnel.<p>
	Effective training strategies for providers of early childhood education and
development programs must be characterized by a process that enables learners
to acquire skills and knowledge transferable to their particular tasks and
roles.  It is not a self-contained package easily dispersed, but a process
concerned with the growth of knowledge and awareness, the awakening of
understanding, and the acquisition of skills and competencies.  Successful
training programs are those that recognize what people know and that begin by
integrating the required new skills and knowledge into an existing
knowledge-base.  The acquisition of new knowledge and skills is followed by
opportunities for continued reflection and recognition of relevance for the
learner's particular needs.  Information must be internalized within the
learner before it is capable of being translated into action.<p>
	A successful training strategy for early child development personnel is one
that emphasizes the learners' strengths rather than weaknesses; applies active
and participatory training methods; perceives the trainer as a facilitator
rather than a director; and fosters a cooperative rather than a competitive
training environment. Training programs that incorporate these components have
greater likelihood of developing persons capable of self-direction and
confident in their problem-solving abilities.  Though training is moving away
from an information-centered approach towards an interactive method of
experiential learning, training methods must nevertheless be sensitive to the
cultural context.   Finally, it is essential that the training offered be a
continual process providing a balanced mix of structured sessions with
opportunities for follow-up and individually tailored supervision that
reinforces, supports and strengthens the learning process.  This approach,
which is both time- and resource- intensive, is often neglected in the drive to
increase coverage.  If the goal is to create sustainable, high-quality systems
of care, then the training approach described here is essential.<p>
	As suggested by research and confirmed through the analysis of successful
curricula for training early child development personnel, the training content
must be organized around a specific early child development curriculum or set
of learning principles.  A growing body of data supports a child-centered
approach that recognizes children at various levels of development.  The
curriculum should provide opportunities for independent problem solving,
meaningful child-initiated conversations with peers and adults, and ample time
for exploration of the environment.  Within this general approach, the specific
content of activities must emerge from, support, and reinforce the values of a
given cultural setting.  The content of the training program must respond to
the strengths and limitations of a particular group of learners.  While
difficult to achieve, the training required by child development personnel
requires a balance between theory and practice.  Theory should be incorporated
into experience in a way that fosters continuous, systematic analysis.
Opportunities for analyzing therefore need to be integrated into the training
process.  The multiple goals of early childhood education and development
programs are often reflected in the multiplicity of learning objectives that
can overburden personnel with a conflicting set of priorities.  With the
implementation of continuous training schemes, however, new information can be
phased in over time, gradually building on the learner's existing
knowledge-base.  The development of effective curricula and training strategies
based on techniques of experiential learning is encouraging.  Planners would
benefit from reviewing existing materials and identifying ways in which the
available training materials can be adapted and adjusted (Torkington, 1989).
<p>
<b>Program Monitoring and Evaluation</b><p>
	The monitoring and evaluation of early childhood education and development
programs has been hampered by a plethora of factors. These factors include lack
of available expertise, lack of widely acceptable child development instruments
and measures, lack of clearly conceived program objectives, and lack of
financial resources.  The field of program evaluation therefore is wide open
and calls for the concerned and committed attention of professionals working in
collaboration with program providers and participants.<p>
	The need for strong well-designed evaluations of early childhood education and
development programs is underscored when one considers the potential
applications of these results.  For example, documentation of success is a
powerful tool for eliciting the attention as well as sustaining the commitment
of policymakers and planners.  As indicated by the previous discussion of
program expansion, evaluations can provide the necessary information for
administrators about when and how programs should increase scale. Furthermore,
program evaluations can identify which factors are fundamental to achieving
program objectives and therefore necessary components of standards for quality
control. In addition, systematic attention to evaluation needs encourages
comparisons both within and among countries of the relative effectiveness of
alternative programming strategies. The information obtained from the
application of effective monitoring systems can be used to guide the adaptation
and refinement of program goals and objectives. <p>
	Given the multiplicity of programming goals and strategies, innovative
data-collection techniques must be employed -- techniques capable of
documenting both anticipated and unanticipated benefits to participants,
families, communities, and institutions.  As in all fields of scientific
inquiry, investigations must rely on both qualitative and quantitative
data-collection methods. The multifaceted nature of early childhood education
and development programs provides a range of opportunities for the simultaneous
application of both qualitative and quantitative techniques, including, for
example, creating new variables as well as replicating old measures, assessing
process as well as outcome, and  generating as well as testing hypotheses.
Effective evaluations have always required graceful movement among descriptive
analysis, induction and deduction, freely ranging exploration and highly
structured investigation.  If an early childhood education and development
program is successful, it is important to determine how and why; if it is not,
a similar line of inquiry is required.<p>
	Qualitative evaluation methods include such techniques as direct observation,
structured and semistructured interviews, open-ended questionnaires, focus
groups, and analysis of existing literature and documents.  The application of
these techniques is critical to understanding the factors facilitating as well
as those inhibiting program success.  Suggested applications of qualitative
techniques in early childhood education and development could include for
example an analysis of traditional childrearing patterns and practices that
have both positive and negative impact on development; analysis of internal and
external variables associated with stress-resistant children and their
families; identification of culturally appropriate touchpoints for early
intervention; identification of processes and mechanisms for enhancing
community participation; and the exploration of alternative models for training
child care providers.  <p>
	Any general discussion calling for increased program monitoring and evaluation
must at some point confront the complex and culturally sensitive issues
regarding the identification and selection of indicators.  Although the need
for indicators has been accepted, the importance of assuring their adequate
design and validity has not received as much attention.  The failure to use
appropriate measures can cause considerable damage to children and families,
and it is critical to assure that instruments possess the characteristics
necessary to function adequately within the context for which they are
developed.<p>
	The results of considerable efforts to measure early child development have
led to the classification of four major categories of indicators including (1)
description or diagnosis of the child's developmental level, (2) detection or
screening for developmental disabilities, (3) periodic monitoring of a child's
development, and (4) program evaluation (Atkin, 1989).  If the need to develop
instruments to measure the child's development is taken seriously, criteria for
developing new or evaluating existing instruments must be proposed.  The
following discussion summarizes some important criteria for both selecting and
evaluating existing instruments. <p>
	A primary criterion is that the purpose of the instrument be specified and the
instrument's characteristics be congruent with this stated purpose.  Too little
attention has been given to specifying the instrument's purpose, and in many
cases the lack of specification or the ambitious combination of multiple
purposes has created instruments which do not correspond to any particular
purpose. For example, some descriptive instruments are too simple to generate
informative data, while detection and screening tools are too complex.  A
second criterion is the need to clearly define what aspects of development the
instrument is attempting to measure.  A third criterion requires that
instruments be culturally appropriate, which is an issue of extreme importance
and complexity.  Fourth, the instruments should have adequate concurrent and
predictive validity.  This is an area in which the major limitations and needs
are most obvious.  Although greater attention has been given to issues of
interobserver reliability, continued efforts are needed to assure adequate
reliability among practitioners. In addition, little attention has been focused
on the predictive validity of indicators, which is particularly relevant for
detection and screening instruments.  A final criteria in the selection of
indicators relates to the ease with which instruments can be incorporated into
programs.  Instruments have been developed that have simple attractive formats,
easy-to-produce materials, and both practical and simple ways of reporting
results.  The remarkable and painstaking efforts thus far to develop simple
measurement alternatives have shown that it is feasible to incorporate such
tools into a variety of community-based programs.<p>

<b><center>SUMMARY AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS</center></b><p>
<b></b>The scientific evidence accumulated during the past decade powerfully
demonstrates the importance of the early years of the child's life and the
long-term benefits associated with increased investments in well-conceived and
properly managed programs.  In addition to having the confidence provided by
scientific evidence, those involved in the translation of theory into action
should have a sense of optimism.  In the past, policymakers have been forced to
rely on data from the industrialized world to justify their investments in
early child development activities.  More recently, a growing body of data from
the developing world indicates the long term benefits to children and their
families, as reflected by increased primary school enrollments and enhanced
primary school progress and performance.  These data reinforce the assumption
that not only are similarly positive effects of early interventions possible in
the developing world, but the potential for bringing about improvements may be
greatest when social and economic conditions are more severe.<p>
	Since the International Year of the Child (1979), hundreds of demonstration
programs and projects have underscored the possibilities for early childhood
education and development programs to increase and foster children's abilities
to cope with and creatively adapt to their environments.  The expansion of
early childhood education and development programs over the last decade has
been dramatic.  <p>
	As discussed in the previous section, several critical factors can be
identified in the rapid expansion of these successful initiatives.  Of primary
importance is a strong political commitment that enables the identification of
the resources needed to achieve a set of clearly specified program goals and
objectives.  Political support is also critical to ensure stability,
commitment, and continuity of program leadership.  Additional characteristics
of these programs include the application of media channels to create demand,
the development of simple and efficient information systems to monitor progress
and measure performance, and the implementation of flexible interactive
training approaches that combine short-term instruction with ongoing
field-level supervision and follow-up.<p>
	Programming success in early child development activities is consistently
characterized by a well defined of set of variables that recognize the
simultaneous nature of survival and development and the interaction among the
child's physical, mental, social, and emotional capabilities.  Another
characteristic defining success, is the emphasis placed on empowering
caregivers and communities with the knowledge and skills needed to provide for
the survival and developmental needs of their children.  Successful programs
recognize that the primary responsibility for the child rests within the home
and all efforts to foster development must support, complement, and reinforce
the childrearing responsibilities of the family.  Sustainable programs are able
to identify local patterns and practices of childrearing which have for
generations provided culturally appropriate solutions.  Once identified, this
knowledge is used to inform the design of locally appropriate programs,
integrating when appropriate, new information and the creation of innovative
solutions.  Successful programs encourage a level of participation beyond the
formal definitions of community participation and include the child as an
active participant in the creation of its own knowledge.  Moreover, the
fostering of knowledge is not dependent on the utilization of complex
technologies but can be developed through the application of low-cost materials
combined with a caregiver exposed to a creative training curriculum and
motivated by an ongoing system of rewards and incentives. <p>
	As the scientist is humbled by the mystery of development, the policymaker is
awed by the magnitude of the task before him.  In spite of growing experience,
millions of children and families are without services.  Although a detailed
analysis of child development in the developing world is not available, one is
well aware of major areas of inactivity.  The factors influencing national
policies on child development are many and complex reflecting unique historical
conditions, widely differing national attitudes, and a variety of political and
economic realities.  While considerable progress has been made in many
countries in Latin America and Asia, programs are nonexistent in many parts of
Africa.  Many innovative programs find themselves unable to secure sustainable
sources of revenue necessary to expanded coverage while maintaining program
quality.  Often the quality of existing programs is so poor that positive
benefits to the child are minimal, and in some instances negative outcomes may
be apparent.  Moreover, the current set of strategies is less successful in
reaching high-risk mothers and infants during the prenatal period through the
first two years life with integrated programs that provide the appropriate
balance of health, nutrition, and psychosocial components.  The vertical
thinking and sectoral competition characterizing government bureaucracies and
international donors as well as child care providers often conflicts with this
need to provide a comprehensive set of services. <p>
	As revealed by the issues presented in this chapter, the challenges are set
before us. In the first instance, we will continue to face economic questions
that require a major adjustment in the allocation of resources, counteracting
the present tendency for governments and other social services to meet economic
pressures by cutting spending in these sectors.  The manner in which these
decisions are made will dramatically effect the condition of childhood.  A
second issue confronting policymakers and planners is the growing economic and
social disparities among nations which in turn polarize the opportunities for
children to reach optimal patterns of growth and development.  A third major
challenge to meeting the needs of families and children in the early years of
life relates to startling social and demographic changes, including increasing
female labor force participation, rapid urbanization, and the erosion of stable
family-units. <p>
	These challenges require solutions that demand long-term commitment by
professionals across many disciplines to address issues related to actual
rather than theoretical integration and convergence of services.  How and when
to involve governments in the complex process of expansion and how to define
the critical components in program quality are pressing concerns.  Utilizing
the advances in media technology, we must continue in our efforts to create
flexible training strategies that are able to respond to the diversity of
skills and needs reflected by early child development personnel.  As indicated,
without our commitment to the infrastructure needed to supplement intensive
training courses with ongoing supervision and follow-up, the kind of programs
we expect will remain an ideal.  The frustrations resulting from inefficient
monitoring systems must be assuaged by effective information management systems
enabling projects to adjust to a changing array of circumstances.  Finally, we
must continue to allow for the systematic interaction among families, children,
and communities.  Programs should not only incorporate and build upon parental
wisdom but must begin to identify the culture-specific opportunities for
partnerships with parents that are open to us, for a brief amount of time, by
the child during his passage through infancy and early childhood.<p>
	The development of children in both the developed and developing worlds is
jeopardized by a complex set of interlocking forces.  It is a worldwide
phenomenon calling for a worldwide response.  Perhaps UNICEF and its partners'
greatest contribution to the promotion of early child development activities
could be to harness the commitment of governments, non-governmental agencies,
international donors, and public and private interest groups in an Alliance for
children -- an Alliance, however, that is ready to recognize, understand, and
respond to the integrated needs of children, families, and communities.  Their
collective voices, crying for help, demand sustainable programmatic responses
which are capable of preventing the intergenerational perpetuation of failure
by providing opportunities that foster self-esteem and confidence.   It is a
cry the societies of the world can no longer afford to ignore.<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
Developmental change evolves more slowly in early childhood, the period from 2
to 6 years of age, than in infancy. During this time, children lose their baby
fat, their legs grow longer and thinner, and they move around the world with
increasing dexterity. They present a bewildering patchwork of vulnerability and
ability, logic and magic, insight and ignorance.  Children at this age can talk
in endless sentences but are keen listeners when an interesting story is being
told. Their present desires can be curtailed with promises of later rewards,
but they may not necessarily accept the offered terms, negotiating for an
instant as well as a delayed reward. They develop theories about everything,
and these are constantly measured against the world around them. However,
despite their developing independence, 3-

year-olds
need assistance from adults and siblings. They cannot hold a pencil properly or
string a loom or tie a knot. They do not have the ability to concentrate for
long periods of time without a great deal of support, and they wander on
tangents in their games and conversations. Preschool children's thought
processes are characterized by great awareness; yet these islands of
sophistication exist in a sea of uncertainty. Children during this period still
understand relatively little about the world in which they live and have little
or no control over it. They are prone to fears and they combat their growing
self-awareness of being small by wishful, magical thinking.<p>
<p>
Traditionally, scientists have sorted these changes into separate categories-
cognitive, language, physical and social development. Development in each of
these areas, however, affects and interacts with every other type. For example,
cognitive development creates the need for more sophisticated speech in order
to express new knowledge. Language development leads children to master new
words that capture new ideas. Physical development allows them to perform more
complicated tasks than they could earlier, bringing them into greater social
contact with others. The information presented in the following sections
discusses some of the major achievements in each of these areas of development.
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PHYSICAL, MOTOR, AND PERCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
The preschool years are characterized by striking physical and psychological
changes. The brain and nervous system grow rapidly and important parts of the
brain attain their mature form. The child continues to grow, from an average
height of about 33 inches at age 2, to about 45 inches at age 6. Motor skills
also improve substantially. During this age children's baby fat disappears,
their legs lengthen, accounting for a larger proportion of their height, and
the relation of head size to body size becomes more adult-like.  As will be
discussed in this chapter, physical development of the young child corresponds
closely to changes in cognitive, language, and social behaviors. <p>
<b>Physical Development</b><p>
<p>
In general children during the first two years of life quadruple their weight
and increase their height by two-thirds. This rate slows down between 2 and 3
years when children gain only about 4 pounds and grow only about 3.5 inches.
Between the ages 4 and 6, the increase in height slows still further and
children grow about 2.5 inches and gain 5 to 7 pounds on the average. As a
result of the slower growth rate following age 2, most 3 and 4 year olds seem
to eat less food. While causing alarm in some parents, the change in food
intake is normal. Children do not eat less food but rather they eat fewer
calories per pound of body weight.  The decrease growth rate requires less
calories to build their developing muscles, bones, and nerves. Although normal
children follow the same growth pattern, there are wide individual variations.
A child with a slow growth rate may continue to gain in height and weight until
age 20 while a child with a fast growth rate may complete full growth by 16
years of age.<p>
<p>
Physical development results from the interaction between individual factors of
heredity and environmental forces. Abnormal growth patterns often reflect this
interaction. A striking illustration of this effect is the failure to thrive
syndrome in which children suffering from prolonged neglect or abuse simply
stop growing. In these children, psychological stress produced by their social
environment causes the pituitary gland to stop secreting growth hormones. When
the environmental stress is alleviated, and the child receives care, affection,
and stimulation, growth resumes often at a rate that enables catch-up growth to
occur.  In body growth, brain growth, and all other aspects of physical and
psychological development, genes and environment collaborate to produce normal
development. Physical developments are affected by the environment no less than
psychological ones. A healthy environment is necessary for normal growth of the
body, brain, and nervous system.<p>
<p>
The brain continues to grow rapidly during the preschool period. At age 2, the
child's brain has reached 55% of its adult size; by six years of age it has
grown to more than 90% of its adult size (Tanner, 1978). While brain growth
during this period is often uneven, most has occurred before 4 to 4.5 years of
age. There appears to be a spurt in growth at age 2 followed by a major
decrease in growth rate between 5 and 6 years of age. The increase in brain
size reflects changes in the organization and size of nerve cells rather than
an increase in the number of cells. The growth also reflects an increase in the
number of glial cells that feed and support the nerve cells and to the
increasing myelination of nerve  fibers.  Myelin is the coating around nerve
fibers that serves to channel impulses along the fibers and to reduce the
random spread of impulses between adjacent fibers, thus helping the nervous
system to function quickly and accurately.<p>
<p>
In appearance the human brain consists of two symmetrical hemispheres that
specialize in different functions.  The left hemisphere controls verbal,
reasoning, and mathematical skills, while the right hemisphere specializes in
nonverbal skills such as spatial ability, perception of patterns and melodies,
and the expression and recognition of emotion.<p>
<p>
<b>Motor Development</b><p>
<p>
There are significant advances in motor control during the preschool period.
These advances depend both on physical maturation of brain and body systems and
on the increasing skill that comes through practice.  They involve both the
large muscles such as those used in running, jumping and climbing, and the
small muscles such as those used in drawing and tying a knot.  Several factors
contribute to the growth in motor development.  In the first instance, this
development reflects the gradual transition from the reflex behavior of the
newborn to the voluntary actions of the preschooler. A second factor is the
child's increasing ability to accurately perceive body size, shape and position
of its parts.  Increasing bilateral coordination, the coordination of the two
halves of the body, also contributes to increased motor performance. Virtually
every motor skill requires some sort of cooperation between the two sides of
the body, moving in some kind of alternatively timed relationship.<p>
<p>
The capacity to perform activities as walking, running, and jumping does not
necessarily imply the ability to perform them skillfully or smoothly. For
example, the young toddler's steps are awkward. Yet by the end of toddlerhood,
walking becomes a skilled activity. The stride lengthens, speed increases,
balance stabilizes, and the child can walk for long periods without resting. By
the age of 4, the child's walk is essentially the same as the adult's.  In most
cases the development of a motor skill involves the gradual integration of
existing movements into a smooth, continuous pattern.  In other cases new
movements must be acquired. For example learning to throw a ball skillfully
involves the integration of existing movements and the acquisition of new
ones.<p>
<p>
In contrast to large muscle skills, small or fine muscle skills refer to the
use of hands and fingers in the manipulation of objects. Also known as eye-hand
coordination, fine motor control is the ability to coordinate or regulate the
use of the eyes and the hands together in efficient, precise, and adaptive
movements. This coordination enables the development of a wide variety of
skills including writing, drawing, and the manipulation of small objects and or
instruments. Preschool children learn to manipulate objects through visual
feedback which indicate whether or not they are doing what the child wants the
objects to be doing. Thus the preschool period is an important time for the
development of manipulation skills which in turn prepare children to deal
successfully with the challenges of primary school. <p>
<p>
Differences in motor development are striking and some children are simply
better coordinated, stronger and more athletic than others. What accounts for
these individual differences which tend to persist throughout the life-span?
Genes unquestionably play a role and evidence suggests that identical twins are
more alike than fraternal twins in their performance of motor skills during the
preschool years. Nutrition is also critical and children who have been
undernourished for long period of time are likely to be retarded in their motor
development. The capacity to catch up with their better nourished agemates
depends on the duration, severity, and timing of the nutritional deficiency.
Experience and opportunities to practice both the large muscle and fine muscle
skills also contributes to differences in the development and functioning of
these skills.<p>
<p>
In addition to these factors, there appear to be consistent gender differences
in physical development throughout the early childhood period. On the average,
girls are physically more mature while boys are physically more muscular. Motor
differences are also apparent and boys on the average have larger muscles than
girls which enables them to run faster, jump farther, and climb higher. Girls
seem to be more advanced in other aspects of motor development particularly in
manipulation skills such as using scissors and fastening buttons.  They are
also ahead in large muscle activities that require coordination rather than
strength such as skipping, hopping, and balancing on one foot. Despite these
gender differences, there is a striking similarity in the overall pattern of
children's physical and psychological development during the preschool years.
<p>
<p>
<b>Perceptual Development</b><p>
<p>
While the ability to see, hear, and integrate sensory information is well
established by six months of age, more complex and less obvious perceptual
abilities develop throughout early childhood. For example, precision of visual
concepts such as shape and size increases. As a results of these evolving
perceptual mechanisms, a child correctly observes an object's size and shape
regardless of the angle at which it is perceived. While such mechanisms are
present in infancy, they lack accuracy. Infants may know that a distant object
takes up less visual field than a closer object, they must learn how much less.
This type of learning occurs through active and lively exploration of the
environment and is critical in the development of accurate size, shape, and
distance perception. <p>
<p>
Another aspect of perception often taken for granted is the ability to
interpret pictorial representations of objects and people in the environment.
Research indicates that 3 year olds respond appropriately to depth cues such as
shading and the convergence of lines.  Sensitivity to such cues, however,
improves with age. The ability to obtain accurate information from pictures
reflects children's eye movements fixation patterns. Adults use only leaping
eye movements to sweep around the picture as a whole, and short eye movements
when concentrating on particular details. By contrast, young preschool children
tend to have shorter eye movements and focus their gaze to small areas near the
middle or edge thus ignoring or missing much of the information available. <p>
<p>
The study of children's art provides some insight into the integration of their
growing perceptual, cognitive and motor abilities. The 2.5 year old grasps a
crayon in his hand and scribbles while the 4 year old can draw a recognizable
human form know as the "tadpole person." The tadpole person is characterized by
a big head, sticks for legs, and no body.   The transition from drawing
scribbles to the tadpole person usually occurs sometime between the 3rd and 4th
year. Increased motor control and eye-hand coordination is one of the factors
involved in this achievement. Drawing skills undergo a second transition
sometime between the 4th and 5th year and the tadpole person is transformed
into a complete person with a body as well as a head. Like the preschool child
themselves, their art is delightfully full of life, energy, and creativity.
According to one psychologist's review  <p>
<p>
A summit of artistry is achieved at the end of the preschool period... Drawings
by youngsters of this age are characteristically colorful, balanced, rhythmic,
and expressive, conveying something of the range and the vitality associated
with artistic mastery... And the often striking products reinforce a general
notion of the child as a young artist--an individual participating in a
meaningful way in processes of creation, elaboration, and self-expression.

<p>
<b>COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT: PARADOXES OF THE PRESCHOOL MIND</b><p>
<p>
For decades, Piaget's descriptions of young children's thinking dominated
exploration of the preschooler's mental development. According to Piaget,
children's language acquisition reflects their emerging capacity for
representational thought. The ways in which children think about the world,
however, are still primitive -- dreams come from street lamps, we think with
our ears, clouds are alive, and the sun follows us when we move. Piaget
proposed that 3-, 4-, and 5-

year
old children make errors because they are still unable to engage in true mental
operations. This type of thinking therefore was termed "preoperational."
According to Piaget, the key feature of preschool thinking is that children can
only focus their attention on one salient aspect at a time. This limitation is
overcome at 6 or 7 years of age, when the transition to concrete operational
thinking emerges. When this occurs, children are able to combine, separate, and
transform information mentally in a logical manner. They know that the sun does
not follow them and dreams do not come from street lamps.  <p>
<p>
Preoperational intelligence differs in many ways from the thinking of older
children and adults and is sometimes puzzling and confusing to parents and
caregivers. According to Piaget, preoperational thinking not only lacks logic
but it is also egocentric. This kind of self-centeredness is characterized by a
4 year-old's statement; "Look Mommy, the moon follows me wherever I go."
Another characteristic is known as complexive thinking, a chaining of ideas in
which each is linked to the preceding or following one but the whole is not
organized into a unified concept. A third characteristic of preoperational
thought is the capacity for deferred imitation which allows children to engage
in pretend games.<p>
<p>
<b>Representation</b><p>
<p>
The ability to pretend is linked to the capacity for representation-the ability
to think about the property of things without having to act on them directly.
The development of representation is the cornerstone of all cognitive
development during the preoperational period. Recent research suggests that
preoperational intelligence develops through at least two distinct levels,
single representations which occur between the ages of 2 and 4, and the second
between 4 and 6 years when children are capable of combining two or more
representations (Case and Khanna, 1981; Gelman 1978; Kenny 1983). The
transition from one of these levels to the next corresponds to a spurt in brain
development.<p>
<p>
Observation of children in pretend play indicates that children at 2 years of
age can control only one representation at a time. For example, in making a
doll act as a person the child can represent the person doing only one thing at
a time- a child walking, a man eating, a woman washing her hands. As the child
matures single representations begin to include a set of related
characteristics or actions. Children combine characteristics into concrete
social categories. For example, the child can make a doctor doll perform a
series of doctor activities such as putting on a white coat, washing its hands,
taking a temperature and giving an injection. <p>
<p>
At about 4 years of age children begin to understand some of the
interrelationships and complexities of social behavior. For example, the
category man includes as part of its meaning the relation between men and
women. Similarly they begin to understand other social relationships such as
husband-wife, mother-father, mother-child and so forth.  By relating various
representations the child now begins to understand relationships in which
variation in one facet of development depends upon variation in another. This
ability is reflected in the child's new attempts to influence behavior.
Strategies such as; "If you let me play with your box, I'll let you play with
my bucket," are quite common among 4.5 year olds.  The preschool child is
concerned with making sense of the people around them and how they relate to
each other.  <p>
<p>
<b>Imitation </b><p>
<p>
Imitation is one of the most important ways children learn about the social
world.  During the sensorimotor period, before the capacity for representation
develops, infants can imitate an action only at the moment it is observed. One
result of representation skills is the capacity for deferred imitation-the
process by which a child observes represented to themselves, and then at a
later time called up from memory and actively imitated.  Imitation also
requires the ability to take another's point of view. Piaget pointed out that
children often make serious mistakes by assuming that another person shares
their own view of things. Everyone who has spent time with young children is
aware of this egocentrism or the inability to take another's point of view.
Even when preschool children are shown another person's perspective, they
cannot keep it in mind and coordinate it with their own. They are not selfish
but simply captives of their own viewpoint.  <p>
<p>
As cognitive skills increase, perspective-taking skills improve. At 2 and 3
years of age, children can take someone else's perspective only in the sense
that they can understand a characteristic. By 4 and 5 years, children are able
to understand the difference between another person's perspective and their own
as long as they need to keep track of only one or two simple concrete factors.
Thus, by 4 or 5 years of age, most children have taken a major step away from
egocentrism. <p>
<p>
<b>Memory</b><p>
<p>
In order to understand another's perspective, the child must be able to
remember. Memory is the ability to encode information, store it, and retrieve
it. There are two kinds of memory, namely short-term and long-term.
Short-term, or the working memory, processes information retrieved within a few
seconds or minutes of its being encoded. Preschoolers can use both short-term
and long-term memory. For example when they have heard a brief list of words or
seen a small group of pictures presented by an experimenter, 4-and 5-year-olds
can often recall them immediately after presentation as well as older children
can.  Their long-term memory is often quite amazing.  <p>
<p>
Early development is characterized by changes in memory that are related to
changes in cognitive development including; the increasing ability to focus
attention, the ability to connect ideas with each other in a more logical way,
and the ability to devise strategies for remembering.  Although memory improves
throughout childhood, important developmental changes take place during the
preschool years. Just as with perspective taking, a major advance in memory
abilities seems to begin at about 4 or 5 years when children start to recall
items of some complexity and when they begin to monitor and manipulate them own
memories.<p>
<p>
<b>Play</b><p>
<p>
Preschool children love to play and they spend hours building and knocking down
towers, they play house, and act out stories with their playmates. Play in
infancy consists mainly of imitations of repeated actions sometimes with
variations. In the preschool years, play expands into much of the child's life.
Preschoolers love to play games that test and fine-tune their mastery of their
bodies-running, climbing, swinging, throwing. They like to build things with
mud, sand or blocks and they love to pretend. They make believe about all kinds
of things everyday concerns, new things they have learned, and imagined
adventure.  <p>
<p>
During the preschool years, children gradually play less by themselves and more
with other children. At 2 years of age, solitary play is common and social
interaction with other children remains simple. Parallel play is often observed
in 2 year olds and becomes common by age 3. In parallel play a child is
influenced by the activities of other children but they do not actually
cooperate in accomplishing a task. Both children may be playing with sand and
imitating one another's activities, but they are unlikely to work together to
build the same castle.  <p>
<p>
With an increase in thinking abilities, the complexity of children's solitary
and social play also increases. At about 4 years of age cooperative play begins
to predominate. During this form of play several children will create a city of
blocks or play a game in which each child takes the role of a family member and
together they act out the daily events. The content of play assumes a new level
of understanding and the child begins to play games with simple rules. At any
age, children's problems and concerns are reflected in their play.  Play
provides a time when children can control things themselves.<p>
<p>
Piaget's perspective on the preschool child's development places the child at
the centre of his or her universe. Through active interaction, exploration, and
observation of the environment, the child actively creates his or her own
learning. Play facilitates the transition to higher levels of cognitive
development; the "as if" nature of play allows children to perform actions that
are more developmentally advanced than those they can realistically achieve.
Play fosters a sense of self-esteem and competence, supporting and reinforcing
the child's capacity for effective action. As a consequence, in play a child is
always above daily behaviour; in play "it is as though he were a head taller
than himself."  <p>
<p>
<b>Complex Thinking</b><p>
<p>
Because play is mostly under the child's control, it clearly indicates some of
the paradoxes in children's thinking processes. Preschool children usually have
difficulty controlling or coordinating their thoughts. Even when they are
capable of representational relations, they can deal with only simple, crude
connections between ideas, so their thoughts tend to wander. One result of
these difficulties is a thought pattern known as complexive thinking--the
stringing together of ideas without a unifying concept or system. While there
are connections between ideas, a single concept that ties them all together is
lacking. <p>
<p>
Personification, the attribution of human characteristics to inanimate objects,
is often characteristic of children's thinking. Having only recently learned to
separate their own actions from those of other people or objects, preschool
children are not yet able to distinguish clearly between properties of objects
and characteristic of people. <p>
<p>
In summary, during the preschool years, many cognitive-developmental changes
take place. Before this period, infants do not distinguish between themselves
and their actions on the world. Objects exist only when the baby is acting on
them or perceiving them. At about age 2 children become capable of
representation, of thinking about the properties of things without having to
act on them directly. This capacity marks the first level of the preoperational
period. At this level, the child can deal with only one representation-one idea
or thought at a time. At the second level of the preoperational period,
beginning at about age 4, children develop the ability to deal mentally with
more complex things. During the preschool years the child moves through these
two levels, building increasingly complex and sophisticated schemes. The
egocentric, complexive, magical thinking of infancy gradually gives way to more
logical thinking-perspective taking, a better memory, and an ability to
separate oneself mentally from one's immediate surroundings.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>LANGUAGE ACQUISITION</b><p>
<b></b><p>
A dramatic accomplishment during this period is the acquisition of language. In
late infancy children learn to say a few individual words and, by paying
attention to context, they can also understand some of the language used around
them. At approximately 2 years of age, their ability to use language suddenly
increases rapidly. The size of the vocabulary increases and they begin to
string words together in short sentences. The ability to represent objects,
people and events through language, develops at about the same time as
representation in children's imitation, play and other actions. While
representation is not required in uttering simple individual words, it is
neccessary for organizing words into simple statements.<p>
<p>
Despite intensive research, the process of language acquisition remains
elusive, and no single theory has sufficiently uncovered its mystery. What is
evident is that the growth of children's vocabulary and their increased ability
to use complex sentence structures accompanied by a corresponding growth in
their ability to engage in conversation appropriately tailored to the
listener's needs, requires both participation in responsive human interactions
and exposure to a rich language environment (Bruner, J. 1983). Most research on
language development has focused on how children acquire the rules that govern
our use of language. <p>
The two types of rules that have been most investigated are pragmatics, rules
for communicating in social contexts, and grammatical rules for combining
words. Many of the language rules that children learn amount to social
conventions and are so automatic for adults that we are not even aware of them.
In adult speech, for instance, expressive devices, such as sarcasm, tell the
listener not to take what is being said literally. Another device is the use of
a question as an indirect request. Because of egocentric thought and social
inexperience, young children do not fully understand the indirect requests. For
children, the simple pragmatic functions of language are often more important
than the specific meanings of sentences. When English speaking preschool
children meet in small groups with preschool children who speak another
language, they may play together for days without seeming to notice their
language differences. An English speaking 4 year old walked up to a French
speaking 3 year old and spoke in English. The 3 year old answered in French and
they proceeded to play, acting as if they both understood, taking turns,
nodding in agreement, and so forth. This interaction emphasized the similarity
of pragmatic rules between languages while the meaning of words is generally
obvious from the context and from other nonverbal cues such as tone of voice.<p>
<p>
Another conversation convention that is beyond the ability of a young preschool
child is the rule that what is being said should be interesting to the listener
as well as to the speaker.  Because children in the early preoperational period
are prisoners of their own viewpoint, they think that what interests them
interests everyone. This egocentrism leads children to endless self-reporting
and the assumption that other people know what they themselves know. They
frequently conduct a conversation as though it were a monologue, changing the
subject without seeming to be aware of the listener's response. At about 4
years of age, children begin to master some of the more complex pragmatic rules
that were so difficult when they were younger. For example, a well-documented
developmental change takes place in pragmatic skill with the rules for polite
forms of request. To understand what is polite, a child must have the cognitive
ability to consider the other person's viewpoint. <p>
<p>
Children must also learn the grammar and the rules for forming words, phrases,
and sentences. They must be able to express such states and relations as
possession, negation, past action and conditional action. One of the most basic
concepts is organization of words into sentences. In order to distinguish one
sentence from another, each group of words in a sentence has a certain pitch,
and stress, so that listeners can distinguish one sentence from the next.
English speakers generally drop the pitch at the end of a statement and raise
it at the end of questions. Most children recognize and can infer meaning from
intonation patterns sometime in the first year of life. This enormous
accomplishment reflects the special adaptation of the human species for
acquiring language.  <p>
<p>
How do children learn these complicated rules which are unique for each
language?  Some psycho-linguistic researchers believe that we inherit
species-specific strategies, or operating principles, for perceiving speech.
These language operating principles are similar to the newborn's rule for
visual scanning. In a similar fashion, young children listen to the language in
ways that help to discover its meaning. These strategies for perceiving speech
make it easier to understand the rules of speech production. Three important
operating principles have helped to explain two of the best known
characteristic of children's early speech- telegraphic speech and
overregulation (Slobin,1973, 1979). These operating principles include paying
attention to the endings of words, paying attention to the order of words and
word segments, and avoiding exceptions to language rules.<p>
<p>
Telegraphic speech refers to a child's tendency to use only the two or three
most important words to express meaning. For example, a child says; "Mommy
rice," rather than "Mommy, I would like to have some rice." The average length
of sentences steadily increase during the period from 2 to 6 years. Telegraphic
speech in different languages has many differences as well as similarities. For
example in virtually all languages, children's telegraphic speech is
characterized by deletions of certain kinds of words such as articles ("the, a,
an), prepositions (in, on, under, through), conjunctions (and, but, because,
when) and parts of nouns and verbs that indicate relatively subtle changes in
meaning. Since telegraphic sentences are often ambiguous, interpretation often
relies on contextual information.  <p>
<p>
The operating principle of avoiding exceptions to language rules, results in
overregularization as children apply a language rule to a word or phrase that
does not follow the rule.  Statements such as "I goed out and throwed my ball
at those gooses" are common from English speaking children at this stage of
language development.<p>
<p>
Children speaking the same language seem to acquire rules in a similar order.
Rules that are simple and used often are acquired first followed by an
understanding of and an ability to combine more complex rules. Because the
complexity of a given grammatical form differs from one language to another,
the age at which children master the rule for a particular form depends partly
on the complexity of the language. Some grammatical forms that are not
particularly difficult to understand may enter a child's speech late because
they are difficult to hear. Because young children can only listen to language,
they often make mistakes due to the way a word or phrase sounds. <p>
<p>
Preschool children are obsessed with language. They listen to it carefully and
chatter away for hours on end. By the age of six or seven they have acquired
and mastered most of the rules for speaking in their native language. This
amazing feat suggests that there is a critical time, or sensitive period for
acquiring language that begins at one or two years of age, peaks in the later
preschool years, and continues to some degree until 13 to 15 years of age. This
special human sensitivity for learning language in the preschool years seems to
correspond to certain systematic changes in the brain and in the rest of the
nervous system at about this time, which are closely related to speech. The
best documented of these changes are called myelogenetic cycles. Each cycle is
a period in which myelin forms in a particular system within the brain. There
are three myelogenetic cycles in the system that are important to language
(Lecours, 1975). The first cycle, which occurs in the primitive brain (the
brain stem and the limbic system) starts before birth and ends early in
infancy. It seems to be associated with the development of babbling. The second
cycle, which begins around birth and continues until 3.5 to 4.5 years of age,
takes place in a more advanced part of the brain.  This cycle appears to
accompany the development of speech in infancy and the early preschool years.
The third cycle takes place in the association areas of the cortex of the
brain, which play a central role in intelligence. Although myelination of these
areas begins at birth, it is not fully completed until age 15 or later. <p>
<p>
Language develops very efficiently for the great majority of children. Parents
and caregivers can help sustain natural language development by providing
environments full of language development opportunities. With young children,
for example, one helpful style of interaction is a highly responsive one, in
which the adult lets the child decide what to talk about, expands on that
topic, works hard to figure out what the child means, suggests new activities,
and pays more attention to what the child wants to say than whether it is being
said correctly. An optimal language teacher assumes the role of a cooperative
conversational partner rather than taking an explicitly didactic or directive
role.<p>
<p>
The studies on which this picture is based have mostly been carried out in
middle-class, English speaking families, a cultural group within which
responsive, nondirective, child centered parenting is considered desirable. In
this group children and adults have relatively equal social status, and
children are expected from a very early age to function as conversational
partners (Cazden, 1988; Snow, 1989).<p>
<p>
In other cultures, the rules governing parent-child interaction and parental
roles are quite different. In Samoa, for example, social status is closely
connected to age, and the idea of engaging a child in conversation as a social
equal would seem unnatural. Among the Kaluli of Papua, New Guinea, it is
considered better to ask children to talk as adults about adult matters than to
"descend to their level" in talking to them. In these cultures we would not
expect the responsive style of talk that facilitates language acquisition for
American children to function similarly.<p>
<p>
Language teaching is most useful to young children when it is presented in the
context of their own activities and attempts at expression. Older preschool
children, however, can use language to learn language and they no longer need
to encounter each new language skill within a meaningful context. Furthermore,
they become increasingly capable of learning intentionally, of attending to and
benefitting from explicit instruction, and of using models as sources of
learning. At this stage simply responding to the child's interests might not be
sufficient to stimulate optimal language development. Talking about a wide
variety of topics, modelling an enriched vocabulary, engaging in talk about
talk itself, discussing word meanings, challenging children to explain
themselves and to justify their own thinking, setting higher standards for
comprehensibility, and explicitly correcting errors: all these are important in
the language development of 4, 5, and 6 year old children. Children at this age
range are also expected to control certain language-related literacy skills
that probably emerge from being read to, from experience in looking at books
with adults, and from experience with letters, with pencils and paper, and with
observation of adult literacy activities.  Parents and other caregivers foster
such skills when they can organize the environment to provide and encourage the
use of pre-literacy learning materials.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<b></b><p>
Social development is a two-sided process in which children become increasingly
integrated into the larger social community as distinct individuals. The
process of acquiring the standards, values, and knowledge of communities and
society is known as socialization. The way in which individual children develop
a characteristic sense of themselves and a unique way to think and feel is
known as personality formation (Damon, 1983). Socialization which begins as
soon as a child is born is especially important during early childhood as the
first understanding of the child's community is constructed.  It is a process
that requires the active participation of both adults and children. Caregivers
set expectations for children's proper behavior as well as the rewards or
punishments for their conduct. Caregivers also select and create the social
contexts within which children experience their environments and learn the
rules of behavior. Children are active participants in this process. What they
learn depends in part on their interpretation of their environments and on what
they select as important from the barrage of available information.<p>
<p>
Children need to understand the social categories, roles, rules and
expectations of their families and communities in order to function in a social
world. Effective socialization assures that if a child comes to consider
herself a girl, she will acquire the appropriate behavior for girls as defined
by a particular social group. In order to understand the requirements of this
role, however, she must have certain skills and abilities.<p>
<p>
For each child, the combination of characteristics that shape personality is
unique since the particular mix of genetic endowment and personal experience is
never completely shared with another human being. Some elements of personality
are obvious immediately after birth as when infants display a particular
temperament. Personality is more than individual temperament as it includes the
way people conceive of themselves and their characteristic style of interacting
with others.<p>
<p>
Thus individual personality development and socialization are two sides of a
single developmental coin. Social development during the preschool years is
closely linked to achievements in cognitive and linguistic skills. All the
feedback received from the social environment is crucial to development of a
sense of self. One of the most remarkable facts about social development is the
extent to which children adopt as necessary the rules defined by their social
group. By the time children reach their 6th birthday a great deal has been
learned about the roles they are expected to play and how to behave in
accordance with them, how to control anger and aggressive feelings, and how to
respect the rights of others. How does all this learning take place and what
are the elements that enter into it?<p>
<p>
<b>Social Identity</b><p>
<p>
While psychologists agree that socialization occurs by identification -- a
psychological process that contributes to a sense of who one is and who one
wants to be -- they disagree about the mechanisms by which it is achieved. Four
proposed mechanisms have figured most prominently in our understanding of this
basic process: differentiation, affiliation, imitation and social learning, and
cognition. According to Freud, children recognize that some objects in the
external world are like themselves and they therefore "endeavor to mold the ego
after one that had been taken as a model." In other words, having noticed that
a particular adult or older child is somehow similar to themselves, children
"identify with" that person and strive to acquire his or her qualities.
Identification follows a different course for males and females. Male
identification requires differentiation from the mother, while female
identification requires continued affiliation with the mother.<p>
<p>
Social learning theorists have a different perspective on how children identify
and adopt adult roles. According to their beliefs, the process of
identification is not driven by inner conflict but occurs through observation
and imitation. Behavior in their view is shaped by the environment and children
observe that male and female behavior is different. Further, children learn
that boys and girls are rewarded differently and choose to behave in
sex-appropriate behaviors that will lead to rewards. Thus the basic assumption
of social-learning theorists is that sex-appropriate behaviors are shaped by
the distribution of rewards and punishments in the environment.<p>
<p>
The belief that a child's ability to perceive the world is central to
socialization is the basis of the cognitive-developmental approach to sex-role
acquisition proposed by Lawrence Kohlberg (1966). In this view the crucial
factor in sex-role identification is the child's developing ability to
categorize themselves as "boys" or "girls."  This process begins at about 2
years of age as children acquire a distinctive sense of self and the beginning
of complex concepts. According to this viewpoint, once formed, children's
conceptions of their own sex are difficult to reverse and are maintained
regardless of their social environments.<p>
<p>
In an attempt to address these conflicting theories about sex-role
identification, psychologists have sought to trace the developing relationship
between the earliest signs of sex-typed behavior and children's earliest
concepts of what adults mean when the label "girl" or "boy" is applied. The
existing evidence suggests that during the preschool years children gradually
develop a well-articulated concept of what it means to be a boy or girl in
their culture and their behavior is shaped by this knowledge. Between 2 and 6
years children are still piecing this conceptual structure together. Both
biological and social factors seem to play important roles in promoting both
sex-appropriate behaviors and the development of basic sex-role categories
themselves.<p>
<p>
While developmental theorists disagree about the caregivers's power to shape
final outcomes, they do agree on two points concerning the children's discovery
of social categories and initial mastery of behavior appropriate to their sex
and include: (1) children conduct some kind of mental "matching" operation that
allows them to isolate key features that they share with others; (2) later
ideas of sex-appropriate behavior are closely tied to children's ability to
categorize, observe, and imitate. By whatever route, children of 5 or 6 have
acquired the idea that they are members of one sex or the other. Children use
these abilities to learn a vast array of other roles and about the possible
roles they may play in the future. <p>
<p>
<b>Self Regulation</b><p>
<p>
In the process of acquiring a basic sense of identity, children also learn
which behaviors are considered good and those that are considered bad. They are
expected not only to learn and adopt the rules of proper behavior, but also to
follow these rules without constant supervision.  Piaget proposed that
children's beliefs grow out of their experience of the restriction placed on
them by powerful adults. From the child's perspective, older people announce
the rule, compel conformity, and decide what is right and wrong. According to
Piaget as children enter middle childhood and begin to interact with their
peers outside of situations directly controlled by adults, the morality of
constraint gives way to a more autonomous morality--one that is based on an
understanding that rules are arbitrary agreements to be challenged and even
changed, if those governed by them agree.<p>
<p>
By the end of infancy children are sensitive to society's standards of good and
bad and can begin to anticipate adults' reactions and plan their own actions
accordingly. Internalization of adult standards occurs when children both want
to conform to adult standards and can anticipate their reactions. In order to
behave according to social standards, children must acquire the capacity to
control their own behavior. Self-control includes both the ability to inhibit
action and to carry through actions according to preestablished rules even when
one does not wish to do so. Preschoolers are well known for their lack of
self-control and the consequent need for supervision. In so far as behavior is
simply a direct response to the environment, they are being controlled "from
the outside." The direct response to being hit is to be angry and hit back.
Children who inhibit the impulse to hit back and seek an alternative response
are displaying a degree of self-control. Young children's growing ability to
estimate the tradeoffs implied by a change from direct, immediate reactions to
indirect, mediated, thoughtful ones is made possible in part by their expanding
time frame and their increased understanding of the proper forms of behavior.
Children who do not understand short-term versus long-term cannot measure
"short-term" versus "long-term" gain.<p>
<p>
During the preschool period children begin to spend significant amounts of time
interacting with their peers. Through this process children must learn to be
accepted by their social group. In so doing they must at times inhibit their
anger when their goals are thwarted; at other times their personal desires will
be subordinated for the good of the group. Learning to control aggression and
to help others are two of the central processes in preschool social
development. <p>
<p>
<b>Aggression and Prosocial Behavior </b><p>
<p>
Shortly after birth, children begin to display the beginnings of both
aggression and socially constructive behavior. The earliest signs of aggression
are the angry responses of newborns when their rhythmic sucking has been
interrupted. The first signs of helpful social behavior appear just as early
when newborns reacting to the cries of other babies start to cry themselves. It
is believed that this contagious crying is the earliest form of empathy,
sharing of another's feelings which is the foundation for a variety of helpful
or prosocial behaviors.  <p>
<p>
Although aggression is a behavior difficult to define, it generally refers to
situations where one person commits an action that hurts another. As children
mature, two forms of aggression are apparent, namely instrumental aggression
and hostile aggression. Instrumental aggression is directed at obtaining
something desirable, such as threatening or hitting another child to obtain a
wanted object. Hostile aggression is more specifically aimed at hurting
another, either for revenge or as a way of establishing dominance. Observations
across a variety of cultural settings suggest that by 2 years of age children
are concerned with ownership rights. The possession itself as well as the
possibility of winning were new elements in their interactions. Between 3 and 6
years, the expression of aggression undergoes several other related changes.
While physical tussles over possessions decrease, the amount of verbal
aggression such as threats or insults increases. During this stage,
person-oriented or hostile aggression where one child attempts to hurt another
also appears.<p>
<p>
It is a commonly held assumption that punishment suppresses children's
aggressive behavior.  Some child development specialists argue that parents who
control children's behavior through physical punishment or threats of raw power
actually create more aggressive children. Others have suggested that when
punishment is used as a means of socialization, it is most likely to suppress
aggressive behavior when the child identifies strongly with the person who does
the punishing and when it is employed consistently. If punishment is used
inconsistently, it may provoke children to further aggression. Since young
children use aggression to gain attention, one strategy is to ignore the
aggression or to pay attention to children only when they are engaged in
cooperative behavior. Another strategy is engage children in a rational
discussion making them aware of the feelings of the aggressed. In spite of the
diversity of these strategies, the most successful techniques for teaching
self-control of aggression go beyond mere suppression of aggressive impulses.
Rather, children are requested to stop their direct attacks and consider other
ways to behave.<p>
<p>
In addition to aggressive behaviors, prosocial behaviors such as altruism,
cooperation, and empathy are common among preschool children. A major stimulus
for prosocial behavior is empathy, the sharing of another's emotional response.
Although infants seem to be born with an ability to empathize, like other
developmental tasks, this capacity increases with age. Preschool children
become skilled at interpreting and responding appropriately to the distress of
others. Research seems to suggest that the development of empathy in the
preschool period results from the child's increasing command of language and
other symbols (Hoffman, 1975). Language allows children to empathize with a
wider range of feelings that are more subtly expressed, as well as with people
who are not present. Indirect information gained through stories and pictures
enables children to empathize with people they have never met. <p>
<p>
Caregivers, anxious to encourage prosocial behavior, have developed many
commonly used strategies to promote this goal. Two methods that seem to be
helpful include explicit modeling in which adults behave in ways they desire
the child to imitate, and induction, giving explanations that appeal to
children's pride, their desire to be grownup and their concern for others. In
reality, strategies to increase prosocial behavior do not occur in isolation
from efforts to decrease aggressive behavior. Rather a great variety of
techniques are likely to occur in combination with each other, and in the
process a diversity of socialization patterns is created.  <p>
<p>
<b>Factors Effecting Early Development</b><p>
<p>
Theories of child development are challenged by the variation in preschool
children's thinking. For some, the unevenness can be explained by differences
in children's familiarity with specific task settings. Biologically oriented
theorists argue that changes in the brain's structure are the major cause of
unevenness in preschool thought. At the start of the preschool period, the
brain has achieved 50 percent of its adult weight. By the age of 6, the brain
will have grown to 90 percent of its weight. Within this overall process of
growth, myelination -- the process by which neurons become covered by myelin,
which is a sheath of fatty cells that stabilizes the neurons -- appears to play
a particularly important role in preschoolers' cognitive development.<p>
<p>
In light of these varying perspectives, the position most reasonable to accept,
however, is that the context-specific organization of the child's environment
is constantly interacting with the biological properties of the child, which
themselves develop at different rates. Appreciating the immense variation of
these two diverse sources, one from the social world of human existence and one
from biology, we can begin to understand the range and variability that
characterizes development of the preschool child. In this ecological view of
development, the child's environment consists of four interrelated systems
which include the nuclear and extended family; the immediate community of peers
and neighbors; the institutional community of schools and other social service
facilities; and a cultural ethos consisting of values, beliefs, and rituals.
The child's development is conditioned by the frequency and complexity of
interactions within each one of these systems. For example, cognitive and
social development seem to be most affected by factors of the home environment,
including the caregivers' self-image, self-esteem, confidence, and emotional
responsivity; the restrictions and types of discipline imposed on the child;
the language stimulation provided; and the child's opportunities for
exploratory play and appropriate play materials. Factors in the immediate
community impacting on the child's development may consist of community
attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions regarding the ideal child and childrearing
patterns that foster such development.  <p>
<p>
Until recently, emphasis was placed on identifying and overcoming deficiencies
of the "deprived" environments that characterized the rural and urban poor.
Disadvantaged environments have been thought to lack the necessary variety and
quality of human interactions as well as the necessary objects and events for
fostering a child's early development. Poor quality verbal interaction and
absence of toys and were frequently cited as detrimental to a child's language
abilities and visual-discrimination. More recently, however, the strengths of
the environments characterizing the poor which are capable of fostering and
promoting early development have been appreciated. Such features include, for
example,<p>
&#149;Opportunities for play with peers and older children with minimal adult
interference enhancing the development of self-reliance, self-control,
cooperation, empathy and a sense of belonging.<p>
<p>
 	&#149;	Exposure to multiple teaching styles, with emphasis on modeling,
observation, and imitation.<p>
<p>
&#149;Presence of a rich cultural tradition of games, toys, songs, and stories
that provide a culture-specific context for language acquisition.<p>
  <p>
Realization is growing that within so-called deprived environments, children
learn a different set of skills that are functional in their home environments
but that may not be valued by formal institutions such as the school system. In
the design of culturally appropriate, community-based early intervention
programmes, it is critical therefore, to explore, mobilize, and build on these
inherent strengths. The recognition of strengths within "deprived" environments
sheds light on the factors giving rise to "invulnerable," or stress-resistant,
children. <p>
<p>
Past investigations that focused only on vulnerabilities and sources of failure
prevented an understanding of the ways in which protective mechanisms shield
children from risk.  In the past decade, efforts to understand "invulnerable"
children have begun.  Garmezey has proposed three categories of protective
factors, which include (1) personality characteristics of the child; (2) a
supportive, stable, and cohesive family unit; and (3) external support systems
that enhance coping skills and project positive values.  <p>
<p>
Recently, investigators have identified the child's "sense of self" as a key
determinant of successful outcomes. It is suggested that children with positive
feelings of self-esteem, mastery, and control can more easily negotiate
stressful experiences. These children in turn elicit more positive experiences
from their environment. They show initiative in task accomplishment and
relationship formation. Even in stressed families, the presence of one good
relationship with a parent reduces psychosocial risk for children. For older
children, the presence of a close, enduring relationship with an external
support figure may likewise provide a protective function. A child with a
positive self-concept seeks, establishes, and maintains the kinds of supportive
relationships and experiences that promote successful outcomes. These successes
enhance the child's self-esteem and sense of mastery, which leads to further
positive experiences and relationships. The cycle of success can be as
self-perpetuating as the cycle of failure.<p>
<p>
In spite of these strengths, it is clear that the developmental costs of
poverty are high and that poverty is a marker for potential psychosocial risk
factors. Children in poverty are exposed more frequently to a clustering of
such risk factors as medical illness, poor nutrition, family stress, low
education levels, inadequate social-service support, and nonstimulating social
environments. The costs can be measured in terms of school drop-out,
unemployment, delinquency, and the intergenerational perpetuation of failure
and poverty.  <p>
These stress factors additionally or "synergistically" interact with the
child's inherent strengths and vulnerabilities to shape outcomes. A
transactional model developed by Sameroff and Chandler has become widely used
to help define developmental outcomes.  According to this framework, child
outcomes can only be interpreted by considering the transaction between the
content of the child's behaviour and the context in which the behaviours are
manifested. Characteristics of the child shape its response to the environment.
These interactions in turn transform environmental responsivity. Just as the
child is shaped by the environment, so is the environment modified by the
child. The child brings a host of attributes to the interaction, including;
health and nutritional status; temperament; and cognitive, language, and social
skills. The environment in turn brings specific attributes. In an environment
of poverty, more risk factors are likely to be present.  While adding
considerable complexity to the determinates of child outcomes, such a model
also suggests an opportunity for practical intervention strategies. Change in
any aspect of the child's differing environments can create positive
transformations in another. <p>
<p>
The period of early childhood ends at the age of 6 or 7 years, when children
pass through the next biobehavioural shift and assume the accompanying social
roles and demands.  Generally by this age, children's brains have achieved a
level of complexity similar to adults.  It is the age of formal schooling, and
children also gather with friends and peers beyond the family. Developments in
early childhood provide the essential preparation for the new demands and
opportunities to come. <p>
<p>
In bringing this theoretical discussion to a close, it is perhaps useful to
conclude with the insight of a proverb, "As the twig is bent, so grows the
tree." If forces in the environment bend a sapling long enough, the tree may
become so bent that its leaves cannot receive the sun's light, and it will not
flower and reproduce. Yet, if the forces bending the tree cease or if a
gardener stakes the tree upright, the only lasting effect may be a slight bend
in the trunk. The tree will prosper and make a genuine contribution to its
environment.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b><p>
<p>
Infancy is the period of life between birth and the beginning of language,
one-and-a-half to two years later. Indeed, the English word "infant" derives
from the Latin <i>in + fans</i>, which means, literally, "non-speaker." This
early stage of development is of substantial interest because of the dramatic
developmental changes that take place in human beings in this short period of
time. There are great advances in the shape and capacity of the body and its
muscles, substantial growth in complexity of the nervous system, rapid
development of sensory and perceptual ability, achievement of major milestones
in understanding and mastering objects in the world, basic acquisition of
language skills, formation of specific and central social bonds, and emergence
of characteristic personal and social styles. At no other point in the lifespan
do so many aspects of the individual change so rapidly and so fundamentally.
From the newborn, unable to move from the position in which placed and unable
to understand the simplest phrase, emerges the toddler, moving about at
lightening speed and following complex speech commands.<p>
<p>
In this chapter, we will take a close look at how the remarkable
transformations of infancy occur and review what accomplishments are normally
expected in this first phase of life after birth. We will examine the major
milestones and achievements of this period of development in each of several
spheres of growth: physical and motor development, perceptual development,
cognitive development, language development, and social and emotional
development. We will also look at environmental factors -- in the family, the
community, and the culture -- which serve to foster or hamper development. But
first we will briefly review the critical nine months in which development
begins, the prenatal period; they set the stage for development of the total
child in infancy and after.<p>
<p>
There is one caveat to the body of data we rely upon for information about the
child: much of it derives from studies of infants from middle class families
living in Western, industrialized countries. Indeed, 95% of the world's
children are unrepresented in these studies. Wherever possible, we refer to
observations of infant development in other cultures; they serve to highlight
the impact of culture over all facets of development.  <p>
<p>
<b>Prenatal Development </b><p>
<p>
Conventionally, the clock starts ticking on a person's age beginning at birth;
but in fact development is already proceeding at a very rapid pace for the nine
months preceding birth. With the joining of female egg and male sperm, the
genetic makeup of the child is determined, and the interplay between organism
and environment that is to characterize development throughout the life cycle
begins. During the nine-month period of gestation, the child develops from a
solitary cell into a complex organism consisting of billions of cells
differentiated by form and function. In the first two weeks after conception,
the fertilized cell divides rapidly and implants in the uterine wall.
Differentiation of cells is now also underway to create the numerous organs and
systems which eventually make human beings self-sufficient. By the third week,
the head is distinguishable along with primitive circulatory and skeletal
systems. At approximately one month, the heart begins to beat. By the end of
the second month, the embryo is little more than one inch in length and weighs
less than an ounce; but it already has a human form and all of its organs. Now
called a fetus, the organism will experience great changes in size and in
proportions. For example, the head goes from being one-half the total body
length at two months to one-third the body length at three months to one-fourth
the body length at four months at which point it stabilizes until birth. As the
fetus matures, it begins to swallow, urinate, move, suck its thumb, and even
hear, in utero. Indeed, studies show that fetuses learn: infants exposed to
certain sounds in utero appear to remember and respond differentially to those
stimuli after birth. Fetuses may also begin to display individual
characteristics: some are more active than others, favor different positions
and so forth. By the beginning of the third trimester, fetuses can survive
outside the womb.<p>
<p>
Although such an intricate and complex affair as the formation of human being
could only take place under the direction of a fine-tuned genetic program, the
environment is also a key player in the process. A number of environmental
factors influence the course of development in utero, the most prominent being
maternal diet, disease and exposure to environmental toxins and drugs. Maternal
malnutrition is a subject of much concern today because it is so common in many
regions of the world. Studies show that women who eat well and whose diets are
rich in protein experience fewer complications during pregnancy and tend to
have healthier babies. For example, how much protein a mother ingests during
pregnancy has been associated with both the physical length of the infant at
birth as well as with the infant's psychomotor development. <p>
<p>
The deleterious effects of maternal drug use, alcohol consumption, and smoking
are also now well documented as are the harmful effects of exposure to
environmental toxins such as PCBs, DDT, mercury, and lead. But even subtler
factors such as maternal stress during pregnancy can affect growth
deleteriously. Stress can alter hormone levels which in turn can adversely
influence prenatal development. At the moment, the most effective weapon at our
disposal to combat these negative influences is education and good prenatal
care.<p>
<p>
                             <p>
<b>Birth</b><p>
<p>
During nine months gestation, life sustaining functions, such as supplying of
oxygen and nutrients, the elimination of waste, and the regulation of body
temperature, are taken care of by the mother. At the moment of birth, however,
the baby must abruptly take on all these tasks him or herself. Although there
are approximately -- births per minute world wide, it is no less remarkable
each time how all systems come together to produce a living, breathing,
sentient being who immediately begins to act and interact with the environment.
<p>
<p>
Newborns are well prepared to adapt to their new surroundings. At birth, they
are in a high state of sensory preparedness. Moreover, they come equipped with
a set of preprogrammed behaviors which are organized to guarantee their
survival. For example, just minutes after birth, a baby put to the breast will
root and then start sucking and swallowing. Rooting, sucking, and swallowing
are all reflexes -- simple unlearned automatic responses to common stimuli that
prepare the baby for extrauterine life. It is obviously quite adaptive that
babies can perform this integrated set of behaviors without the need for
experience or instruction, since it ensures the immediate ingestion of
nutrients. Another group of reflexes comprising sneezing, coughing, blinking,
and muscle withdrawal help the child avoid noxious or other unwanted stimuli.
Still other reflexes may have had meaning at an earlier point in human
development but continue now without obvious survival value. For example, the
Moro reflex is the tendency babies have to swing their arms wide and bring them
together again in the midline (as if around the body of a caregiver). This
reflex is elicited by a loud sound, or when the baby suddenly falls or loses
support. In nonhuman primates this movement, together with the grasping reflex
(during the first week of life infant grasp is so strong that the infant is
able to support its own weight) help the baby to secure itself to the mother's
body.<p>
<p>
As the infant matures, many reflexes will disappear and give way to more mature
voluntary actions. For example, the grasping reflex, which newborns perform
automatically when an object is placed in their palm, is replaced by
intentional reaching and grasping at around three months of age. One
explanation for this transition resides in the development of the brain's
cerebral cortex. At birth, the subcortex of the brain which controls primitive
reflex behavior is more developed than the cerebral cortex which is thought to
be responsible for higher-level motor behavior and intellectual functioning. As
the cerebral cortex develops, the reflexes drop out and more complex voluntary
behavior takes over. Thus reflexes are not only adaptive, they are an index of
normal development. The absence of a reflex which should be present, or the
presence of one which should be absent, are early indications of neurological
or other problems.<p>
<p>
A number of tests have been developed to evaluate the physical well-being of
newborns and young infants, and reflexes are one of the principal behaviors
evaluated. In most American hospitals, about one minute and five minutes after
birth, newborns are administered a test to determine if they are functioning
normally and whether there is a need for intervention. This test is called the
Apgar, named after Virginia Apgar (1953) its originator, and it rates babies as
0, 1, or 2 on each of five dimensions: heart rate, color, muscle tone,
breathing effort, and reflex irritability. With 10 being the high score and
zero the lowest, the majority of newborn babies score 7 or better on the Apgar;
those who score 2 or lower are at a significant risk (Apgar and James, 1962;
Self and Horowitz, 1980). Other human neonatal tests include the Dubowitz and
the Neonatal Behavioral Assessment Scale, [which measure, indicate...?]<p>
<p>
<b>PHYSICAL GROWTH AND MOTOR DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
              <p>
Physical growth in the first two years of life is dramatic. An average baby
will triple his or her birth weight in the first year and quadruple it by the
end of the second. Moreover, the baby will achieve more than half of adult
height by the age of two. The size of the brain also increases substantially,
reaching approximately 75% of adult weight by the end of infancy. Most of the
brain growth which occurs during infancy can be ascribed to myelinization and
increases in the volume and density of dendritic connections. The rate of
physical growth during infancy is greater than that of any subsequent period in
the life span.<p>
<p>
Observing and charting the course of physical growth in the child is important
because normal physical development gives an indication of the well-being of
the infant as a whole. Developing normal motor skills, for example, depends on
a body which is growing in strength and proportion. Moreover, physical growth
exemplifies certain principles of development which have significance for other
psychological domains. First, development proceeds cephalocaudally; that is
from head to toe. For example, the visual system reaches anatomical maturity
earlier than do the legs; relatedly, babies achieve voluntary visual control
much earlier than they learn to walk.  Second, development proceeds
proximodistally; that is from the center of the body outward. For example, the
head and trunk of the body develop before the arms and legs, and babies learn
to control their heads (neck muscles) before they learn to direct their limbs.
Third, different systems in the body grow and develop at different rates. For
example, if infants grew in height as rapidly as they did in weight, the
average one-year-old would be approximately 5 feet tall. Finally, when we talk
about growth and development generally, we tend to refer to norms. For example,
the average American one-year-old weighs about 20 pounds and is about 30 inches
long. But it is important to emphasize that while norms are handy descriptions,
individuals vary greatly in the timing and course of their development. <p>
<p>
Moreover, as we will see for all aspects of development, environmental factors
play a significant role in the expression of individual variation. For example,
at birth and throughout the first years of life, infants in more affluent
countries tend to be healthier, heavier, and longer than their counterparts in
less affluent countries. Moreover, within more affluent countries such as the
United States, children born into low socioeconomic classes tend to grow more
slowly than those from high socioeconomic classes, and often do not reach
equivalent levels of height and weight (Eichorn, 1970; Tanner, 1978).
Presumably, these differences reflect environmental factors such as prenatal
and postnatal nutrition and care and maternal health and education. <p>
<p>
It is clear that good nutrition in this period of rapid growth is important.
The body needs a variety of nutrients to sustain normal growth and development.
For example, protein is important for growth of tissue, carbohydrates supply
the body with energy, and fat provides insulation. It is not just coincidence
that human breast milk, which has evolved over time to match uniquely human
needs, provides just the right balance of nutrients needed for healthy
development in the first six months of life. Breast milk is higher in nutrients
which promote brain growth and myelinization of nerve cells, important in the
early months of human development, as compared to cow's milk which is higher in
nutrients that promote tissue and muscle development, more important to cows
who grow at almost twice the rate of humans. Moreover, the chemical composition
of breast milk changes over time to suit the developing needs of pre-terms,
newborns, and older infants.<p>
<p>
Numerous studies now show that, especially in less developed countries,
breastfed children are less likely to be malnourished than other children, and
they are less likely to become ill, particularly with diarrhea and respiratory
infections which are common in the developing world. This is especially true
when colostrum (the breast fluid which is produced the first few days after
birth) is given, and the child is exclusively breastfed for the first four to
six months. If breastfed children do become ill, they are less likely to
develop complications or die from diseases. The reasons for these beneficial
effects are many.<p>
<p>
Breast milk is sterile and ready to ingest. It requires no refrigeration, is
not mixed with potentially contaminated water, and is not administered with
potentially contaminated bottles or nipples; it therefore does not contain
bacteria and viruses which cause infections. In addition, breast milk provides
protection to the infant because it passes on immunological factors and other
components produced by the mother to the infant. It is easier to digest, and
especially during bouts of diarrhea provides nutrition in a readily absorbable
form.  Finally, even when mothers are malnourished, breast milk will reduce in
volume more than in nutritional content. With proper nourishment, the brain and
body of the baby grow, and as muscles and the nervous system mature, motor
skills begin to emerge at a dramatic rate. With each new skill, babies attain
greater mastery of their bodies and of their environment. What follows is a
summary of the major motor milestones, divided into two parts, one for gross
motor skills and one for fine motor muscle skills.<p>

<p>
<p>
With the emergence of each new motor skill, a new world opens for the baby,
allowing for the development of his or her perceptual, cognitive, and social
skills as well. For example, once they can crawl, infants are no longer
entirely dependent on caregivers to secure things they desire. This achievement
can foster a sense of control over the environment. Crawling may also help to
refine children's perception of depth, influence their fear of heights, and
changes parents' attitude and treatment of their activities. Obviously, there
is an intricate and organized pattern to this process or unfolding of infant
skills and accomplishments. <p>
<p>
However, motor development is not a function of physical maturation alone. Even
in this sphere of life thought to be largely "biological," experiences also
play a significant role. Infants today, for example, appear to master certain
motor skills earlier than infants born fifty or a hundred years ago, and
infants from different cultures appear to progress at different rates. Hopi
infants begin to walk alone late (Dennis and Dennis, 1940); Balinese infants
follow a different set of stages on their way to walking (Mead and McGregor,
1951); and Ganda and Wolof infants tend to be more advanced motorically
(Ainsworth, 1967; Geber, 1956, 1958; Lusk and Lewis, 1972). Some data suggest
that genetic differences among newborns may be responsible for some of these
differences (e.g., the skeletons of native Africans may be more mature than those of Western Caucasians even at birth;
Tanner, 1970). However, there is much data to support environmental effects as
well. Hopi babies were traditionally constricted on cradle boards which may
explain their locomotor retardation, while Balinese mothers carried their
infants in a manner which Margaret Mead believed might promote the babies'
unique motor performance. Babies in Ganda are raised in an atmosphere of
physical freedom which may explain their accelerated development.<p>
<p>
Kenyan Kipsigis babies have been found to be advanced in some motor skills
(sitting, standing, and walking), but slower in others (head lifting, crawling,
and turning over). A close look by researcher Charles Super at Kipsigis mothers
revealed that 80 percent deliberately taught their infants to sit, stand, and
walk. Super found that such practices were widespread among native Africans;
indeed, he detected a substantial statistical association between the
percentage of mothers who taught their babies to crawl and the average age of
crawling in six African societies. Interestingly, Kipsigis infants who are
reared like European babies tend to lose the advantage that their traditionally
reared compatriots maintain, further suggesting that environmental factors can
have a noticeable impact on psychomotor development (Super, 1976). <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>PERCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
What does the world look, sound, smell, taste, and feel like to the normal
infant?  Is it all a "blooming, buzzing confusion" as a philosopher once
proposed, or does the newborn come equipped with means ta make sense of his or
her new world? Research tells us that infants have many capabilities which
permit them from the start to appreciate the visual, auditory, chemical, and
tactile stimuli in their environment in meaningful ways. We begin by
considering infants' visual perception. <p>
<p>
Even in the first few days after birth, babies appear to have relatively mature
visual capabilities. For example, in the first hours of life, infants look
selectively at parts of stimuli where there is information  --  usually
high-contrast features, such as the angle of a triangle -- instead of randomly
scanning about. Neonates also track a slowly moving object with their eyes, and
are sensitive to changes in brightness in their visual field. What is most
important about visual behavior at this time is that newborns actively seek
stimulation and input in ways which ensure that they will learn something about
what they see. For example, they prefer novel stimuli to familiar ones, and
they prefer patterned to solid colored forms.<p>
<p>
But newborns also have visual deficits. For example, acuity is extremely poor
at birth and the ability to scan is limited. However, these and other visual
capabilities improve dramatically in the first months of life. For example, by
one measure, acuity was found to increase from 20/800 at two weeks to
approximately 20/70 at five-and-one-half months. Infants scanning ability also
improves rapidly. Newborns tend to focus on a single feature of a form, which
is usually a high contrast contour on the stimulus perimeter. By two months of
age, infants are no longer captured by a single feature and can scan more of
the perimeter of a shape and examine the internal features as well. Not
surprisingly, it is also at about two months that infants begin to show a clear
preference for the human face, related to their increased ability to scan the
internal features of a stimulus. Also by two months (and perhaps younger),
infants have largely normal color vision and can discriminate brightness almost
as well as adults. By three months of age, babies recognize their own mothers'
faces and can discriminate between some facial expressions. <p>
<p>
By four months of age, infants not only appear to prefer some colors, but also
to categorize the color world into discrete hues of blue, green, yellow, and
red in way similar to adults. Sometime in the first half-year, infants show
clear evidence that they are perceiving the elements of a complex pattern as
part of a unified whole, rather than as separate elements. Depth perception
seems to develop more gradually. Although some evidence of depth perception has
been reported in infants two months and younger, it would appear to be quite
limited at this age. It isn't until about seven months that children seem able
to take advantage of all the different cues that signal depth (kinetic,
pictorial, and binocular), and some argue that experience with independent
locomotion, such as crawling, facilitates mature perception of depth. Lastly,
infants begin to learn that even though objects move about in space --
approach, retreat, turn sideways -- those objects are still the same. This
ability to perceive constancy in an ever-changing environment help infants to
bring order to the perceptual world. By the time the child is one year of age,
the visual world has come into focus, both literally and figuratively. Acuity
has improved dramatically, and the basics of color, shape, depth, and
orientation in space have been mastered. The other sensory modalities are also
taking shape.<p>
<p>
As mentioned earlier, the auditory system is functioning even in utero.
Immediately after birth, the ears may be filled with fluid which temporarily
impairs acuity. Thereafter, while the acuity of infants is not equal to that of
adults, it is quite good and continuous developmental improvements take place
during the first two years. Notably, infants seem to be specially "tuned" to
human speech sounds. For example, very young infants will alter their behavior
just to hear human speech. Moreover, babies as young as three days recognize
their own mother's voices. Babies as young as one month of age distinguish
among different speech sounds in an adult-like categorical manner; that is,
babies can tell apart sounds like <i>pah</i> and <i>bah</i>, but not sounds
equally different on a physical continuum but within the same speech category
of sounds for adults, like two different sounding <i>pahs</i>. This suggests
that infants may be "primed" in some ways to learn speech. <p>
<p>
Infants may also be "primed" to distinguish among and even favor some tastes
and smell. Neonates, just hours old, display characteristic facial expressions
when sweet, sour, and bitter substances are placed on their tongues.  A sweet
stimulus evokes a relaxed expression, often accompanied by a slight smile and
sucking. A sour stimulus evokes pursing the lips, wrinkling of the nose, and
blinking the eyes. A bitter fluid evokes an expression of dislike, often
followed by spitting or movements preparatory of vomiting. This preference for
sweets is most probably an evolutionary adaption -- breast milk is sweet, many
sour or bitter tasting substances are unhealthy or poisonous.<p>
<p>
Newborns have also been found to respond in qualitatively different ways to
different odors, favoring some and rejecting others. This ability, too, is put
to good use by babies. Breast-fed infants, just days old, orient to gauze pads
worn in the underarm area by their mothers (in preference to pads worn by other
adults). Signature odors can therefore be used to help identify the mother.
Newborns can also locate the source of odors and protect themselves from
noxious smells by turning away from the source.   <p>
<p>
Newborns are also sensitive to touch. We know that gentle pats can sooth a
fussy infant and that a needle prick to draw blood causes distress. We also
know that sensitivity to touch continues to develop after birth.  For example,
the time it takes a baby to react to a needle prick decreases over the course
of the first few months as a result of maturation of the nervous system.  <p>
<p>
Touch is an important source of information for infants. If you gently touch a
newborn near the mouth, he or she will automatically turn its head in that
direction in search of food. The warmth and pressure from contact with the
mother's body also carry a message to young babies of security in moments of
stress. And once the child develops the coordination necessary to bring objects
to the mouth, touch works in concert with vision to inform infants about key
properties of their new world. Infants as young as one month are influenced in
which of two shapes to look at if one of the two matches a shape the babies had
just explored orally. Indeed, observing a five-month-old in action, one comes
away with the impression that in this stage of infancy both vision and reach
are in the employ of oral exploration.  An object is not fully appreciated
until it has been mouthed. <p>
<p>
Although the senses are functioning at a high level even from birth, experience
as well as the lack of experience play important roles in the maintenance,
attunement, and induction of perceptions in infancy. For example, certain
experiences have been found to induce perception. One-month-olds who have a
stabile hung over their cribs have been found to develop a visual defensive
response to its sudden approach in half the time of a comparable group of
babies without a stabile (Greenberg, Uzgiris, and Hunt, 1968). Similarly, it
has been found that introducing an interesting stabile into the environment of
institutionally deprived newborns nearly doubled their visually directed
reaching and visual attentiveness (White and Held, 1966). Conversely, the lack
of experience at a critical time may impair perception. For example, studies of
children who developed strabismus at different ages, and who then had
corrective surgery, found that children who developed the problem after three
to four years of age, or who had corrective surgery within the first few years
of life, were less likely to suffer permanent damage to the development of
binocular vision, than children who were deprived of such experience in the
first two years. <p>
<p>
Speech provides an interesting example of a case where certain abilities
infants have initially can be lost if not promoted by the language environment.
For example, six-month-olds from English-speaking families discriminate pairs
of Hindi speech contrasts (not used in English) as well as Hindi adults do, but
English speakers four years of age and older do not (Werker, Gilbert, Humphrey
and Tees, 1981; Werker and Tees, 1983). In a separate experiment with a
different language group, the same researchers determined that the "loss" in
perception already occurred by the end of the first year of life. Thus, the
perceptual state of the newborn is highly developed, and perception in the
older infant approximates mature, but as we will see in the next section how
the infant interprets and makes sense of incoming information is longer in
developing.  <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>COGNITIVE DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
Newborns, and even fetuses, are capable of learning. For example, infants just
two hours old can learn an association between gentle head strokes and the
subsequent delivery of a sweet solution into their mouths.  Compared with
infants not so trained, neonates who had this training show more head-orienting
and sucking responses. Furthermore, three-day-olds can learn to moderate the
average interval between sucking bursts (either increase or decrease) to invoke
their mothers' voice. Young infants will also increase their sucking to produce
visual displays and music. However, not all associations are equally easy for
infants to learn.  To date, researchers have had the most success "teaching"
associations which have some adaptive or biological significance to the child.
For instance, gentle stroking may naturally accompany nursing and therefore
infants may be prepared to learn an association between the two. The behavioral
state of the child may also affect success on a learning task. Infants have
been found to be most receptive to learning when they are in a period of quiet
alertness, next most receptive during periods of distress, and least receptive
when drowsy or asleep. Also, the economics of the response demanded of the
infant is a factor. If the cost of the response in terms of energy expended
exceeds the value of the reward for performing, the child will not necessarily
perform the response. Finally, it should be noted that while even newborns
demonstrate myriad learning skills in a laboratory setting, it is not clear to
what degree they use these skills in daily life. <p>
<p>
Habituation, the decline in attention to a stimulus that has been presented
repeatedly or is available continuously, also indicates learning in infancy. It
is theorized that habituation involves the construction of some sort of mental
model or internal representation of a stimulus and the ongoing comparison of
new stimulation with that representation (i.e., one learns about the stimulus
and then compares incoming information with what has been learned). Habituation
has also been found to occur in the newborn period.<p>
<p>
Although children may be capable of learning from birth (and even before),
their ability to do so develops throughout infancy. The nervous system is
maturing rapidly in the first months after birth, and this allows for longer
periods of alertness which in turn permits greater opportunity to learn. By six
months of age, almost all the physiological immaturities which limited
attention, perception, and information processing in infants have disappeared.
As a result, between three and six months of age, infants' abilities to attend
selectively to the environment and to encode what they perceive improve
substantially, and these improvements are reflected in infants' performance on
learning tasks. For example, it takes more than six times as many trials for a
newborn to learn than for a five-month-old, and only one-and-one-half times as
many trials for a three-month-old. Similarly, with the habituation paradigm,
two- to three-month-olds required nearly five to six times as much exposure to
a stimulus to achieve habituation as six- to seven-month olds. Thus, as infants
mature, they also become more efficient learners.<p>
<p>
Imitation is yet another way that infants demonstrate learning, although there
is still substantial debate in the literature about the age at which children
are capable of imitating. There is no debate, however, about how powerful
imitation is as a learning tool once it does come on line. Imitation is
generally believed to develop gradually and in an orderly fashion over the
first two years. In the first six months of life, infants seem to be able to
reproduce certain behaviors which they are already capable of producing in
response to similar adult actions.  So, if an adult coos, the baby may coo
back. This is an action which a newborn tends to do spontaneously as well. In
the second half of the first year, babies may try to venture into new
territory. For instance, they are now making sounds, like babbling, which
approximate the sounds of human speech, absent, of course, meaningful words.
Indeed, the six-month-old's babbling may already resemble the parent language
in pitch and contour (as we shall discuss in the Language section). At about a
year, children start to imitate unfamiliar behaviors with accuracy. They will
imitate language with obvious success and will become little copycats,
following their siblings and parents around doing everything they see done,
checking frequently to make sure they get it right. By eighteen months, they
can imitate accurately, even in situations where they can't directly monitor
their own behavior, as for example when imitating facial expressions. Once
imitation is in full swing, it will become one of the major tools of learning
in the early years.<p>
<p>
By definition, all of the types of learning described involve the infant's
remembering certain associations, whether they are associations between the
infant's own actions and their environmental consequences or between two
stimuli. In other words, learning includes memory as well. Even newborns are
capable of remembering although their memory may last only a few minutes. By
one month of age, however, babies are capable of remembering from one day to
the next, and by the time they are two- to three- months-old, they may be able
to remember some things for as long as one month, although perhaps with some
prompting. In fact, memory continues to improve throughout infancy. For
example, when twelve- to eighteen-month-olds are presented with memory tasks of
increasing complexity, twelve-month-olds can remember and imitate only the
simple actions correctly, whereas eighteen-month-olds execute all the tasks
reasonably well. Memory improves substantially after infancy, as children gain
general knowledge which gives their memories context, and as they learn to use
strategies for remembering. In the area of cognition, it appears that as the
children get older their ability to process information improves; they
habituate to a new stimulus more rapidly, they can be conditioned to a wider
range of stimuli, they can retain information for longer periods of time, and
they can process more complex stimuli.<p>
<p>
Learning, by definition, also involves an interaction with the environment --
because that is what children are learning about. But can some environments
promote learning and others retard it?  The answer is yes. For example, infants
who have had experience with responsive or contingent stimulation (e.g., a
mobile that can be activated by a child's kick) have been shown to learn a new,
but similar task more quickly than children who have not had such experience.
It is hypothesized that infants' experiences with contingent stimulation lead
them to develop a sense of effectance. They learn not only to activate the
mobile, but also the greater lesson that they can control aspects of their
environment. They also may become more motivated to learn by their positive
experiences with contingent stimuli. On the other hand, babies who have
experienced primarily noncontingent stimulation, may develop a "learned
helplessness" with regard to their environment and lose their motivation to
master their surroundings. In a slightly different vein, research shows that
different types of caregiving styles and home environments may have
differential effects on infant performance on standardized intelligence tests,
with responsivity and greater variety of stimulation being associated generally
with higher test scores. Thus, environments which are stimulating and
particularly those which contain responsive or contingent stimulation, can
promote learning. Environments devoid of stimulation can retard it.<p>
<p>
Another approach to cognitice development is that of Jean Piaget.<p>
Piaget provides another view of cognition in childhood which attempts to
explain how children come to understand the world. According to Piaget,
children's understanding of the world, including their understanding of such
basic concepts as time, space, causality, and the nature of objects, comes from
acting on the world and not just from observing. In other words, children
construct knowledge initially from their own actions.  For example, the child
takes some action (e.g., starts to suck an object in his mouth); this generates
feedback (e.g., he or she discovers the object is a fist and not a nipple). If
they were to suck a fist successfully, they would have to modify the sucking to
accommodate the different shape and size. This adaptation on the part of the
child, to accommodate the environment, brings the child to a new level of
understanding. Piaget claimed that the child proceeds from one level of
understanding to the next in an invariant sequence of stages which are
age-related, starting with the sensorimotor period in infancy which is itself
divided into six stages.<p>
<p>
At the beginning of the sensorimotor period, children are what Piaget termed
"egocentric". They see the world only from the perspective of their own actions
and their effects on the world, and are unaware that objects in the environment
exist outside themselves. Through chance discoveries, however -- the child
kicks the crib, and a mobile shakes -- the child begins to learn about objects
and their properties, and objects begin to take on an independent existence,
thus beginning to repeat actions to cause effects intentionally. Then they
begin to experiment with cause and effect. For example, if they notice that
milk drips from a tilted bottle, they might systematically vary the angle and
pressure on the bottle to see how fast the milk will drip. And, finally, after
substantial experience with trial and error, they begin to be able to imagine
in their minds what effects different actions will have without the need for
direct experience. This is the dawn of insightful problem solving and the
beginning of the end of sensorimotor egocentrism. The child now has a
sufficient understanding of basic properties of objects that solutions to
problems can be effected through thought instead of action.  The child can now
represent objects in his or her mind and manipulate them mentally. Over time,
this ability will allow the infant to see things from other peoples'
perspective. Although egocentrism is on the wane, it does not entirely
disappear for quite some time.<p>
<p>
Piaget's theory of cognitive growth posits invariant and hierarchical
stage-like progression from infant sensorimotor behavior through formal logic
in adulthood. He applied his theory to different spheres of development. For
example, he posited that the child's development of the concept of objects as
independent entities evolved gradually from <i>out of sight, out of mind</i> to
<i>I know it is still there because I saw you hide it</i> to <i>I know it is
there because I can imagine that is where you hid it</i>. By 24 months and with
the attainment of mental representation, the infant has grasped the concept
that objects have an independent, enduring existence.<p>
<p>
Infant play is another sphere of development which fits nicely into the
Piagetian scheme of development. Importantly, play follows an ordinal sequence
of development which mirrors the decline in egocentrism and the rise of mental
representation outlined in Piaget's six sensorimotor stages. Initially, play
centers on actions generated by the child as opposed to objects (e.g., waving
arms and kicking legs). Then children begin to manipulate single objects (e.g.,
banging a spoon on the table or shaking a rattle). The focus is initially more
on the action than on the object. Undifferentiated exploratory play which is
not specific to the object gives way to functional/relational play which is
tailored to the object and may involve exploration of the relations between
objects (putting a block in a box or a spoon in a cup). With the advent of
mental representation comes pretend or symbolic play which also follows a set
pattern. Pretend play develops from play that involves only the self
(pretending to sleep), through pretense involving self-object relations
(pretending to drink from a cup), to pretense involving objects exclusively
(having a doll pretend to eat). <p>
<p>
Several attempts have been made to predict later success on intelligence tests
from measures of cognitive performance in infancy. Standard
psychometrically-based infant examinations such as the Bayley Scales of Infant
Development have failed to predict future test performance, as have
conditioning measures. By contrast, habituation (and novelty responsiveness) in
infancy have been shown to have a small but significant correlation with
cognitive performance in later childhood. Tests based on Piagetian theory, like
the Uzgiris-Hunt Ordinal Scales of Psychological Development have proved to
have selective predictive validity. A milestone that "ends" infancy is the
acquisition of language, but many aspects of infancy prepare the child for this
triumph.<p>
<p>
<b>LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
One of the most remarkable accomplishments of infancy is  the acquisition of
language. Any adult who has visited a foreign country with a language very
different from his or her own will have some insight into the formidable task
which is set for the newborn. Human language functions on at least three
different but interrelated systems: sound, syntax, and semantics. Moreover,
each level has two components, production and reception. First, sounds that are
intended as language must be produced and perceived as different from other
sounds; intonation, rhythm, and accent must be mastered in this process. Second
is syntax, the rules according to which words are structured and arranged into
meaningful sentences. Third is semantics, the use of words and phrases to
represent real-world or imaginary referents. Consider the young child's task in
deciphering a simple sentence such as: <i>Mommybakesacake</i>. The child must
first segregate the sound stream into meaningful units, decode the grammatical
structure linking the word forms, and match particular word forms with their
real-world referents.  Moreover, all this must take place instantaneously and
simultaneously to be meaningful to the child.  It is therefore quite startling
that children still in diapers have not only cracked the language code, but are
on the way to becoming rule-savvy, interactive conversationalists.  <p>
<p>
Because of the enormity of the task and the remarkable achievements of
relatively immature beings, it has been suggested that infants do not approach
this task with a clean slate, that there are an innate bases for language
learning. For example, as mentioned earlier, infants appear to be primed to
hear and respond to human speech. Moreover, there may be a universal sequence
to the emergence of language (although timing of milestones may vary). Babies
in different cultures still in the very beginning of life appear to be able to
be able to perceive speech sounds in terms of categories (phonemes). Then they
begin to coo (around two months) and then to babble (around four to six months)
and then to produce their first words (at about one year). These one-word
utterances frequently express complex ideas; they may refer to objects, express
moods, or command actions. Context and vocal quality help to differentiate the
child's intention. <p>
 <p>
In the middle of the second year, children tend to experience a word explosion.
When their vocabularies reach  somewhere between 50 and 100 words, also by
about the middle of the second year, they begin to put words together --
<i>more milk, baby sleep</i> -- in what some have termed telegraphic speech.
So-called operations of reference refer to the presence, recurrence, or
nonexistence of objects in the child's world; operations of relations refer to
actions taken on objects. Intonation may be added to this mix to indicate
whether a declaration, interrogation, or imperative is intended. The fact that
children from vastly different language communities follow a similar basic
developmental trajectory in using grammatical operations of reference and
relations gives considerable weight to a biological view of early language
development. By the time that children reach 3+-

word
phrases, their grammars are virtually rule-

governed.
<p>
<p>
What role does the environment play in this developmental process? Although
some aspects of language development appear to follow a more or less fixed
pattern early in life, experiences must be profound since children only learn
the language of their culture. Thus, while babbling in different language
groups shows no great difference in basic sound production repertoires, by the
time infants are six months of age, phoneticians can differentiate the babbling
of infants from one language group from another based on factors like pitch
intonation. Likewise, while certain speech sounds appear to be discriminated in
the first few months of life, independent of language group, by the end of the
first year, children lose the ability to distinguish speech sounds not used in
their language group.<p>
<p>
Studies now reveal a multitude of ways in which the environment exerts its
influence over early language acquisition. For example, on sound production,
middle-class mothers in several cultures have been found to speak more
frequently to their infants and to use a wider variety of sounds than
working-class mothers. Not surprisingly, their babies have been found to
produce more sounds in the first months of life than their working class
counterparts (Field and Pawlby, 1980; Ninio, 1980; Snow, De Blauw, and von
Roosmalen, 1979; Papousek, Papousek, and Bornstein, 1985). In a similar vein,
infants who experience conversational or turn-taking types of interactions tend
to produce a higher ratio of speech-like to nonspeech-like sounds than infants
who experience random responsiveness.<p>
<p>
Experience also influences aspects of early syntax. For example, one study
showed that mothers who used more yes/no questions ("Can you dance?") have
children who use more verb auxiliaries (like "can").  Interestingly, not all
features of child language can be similarly influenced. In the same study, the
number of noun and verb phrases per utterance were uncorrelated with any
measured maternal speech variable, suggesting that there may be less room for
variability and environmental influence with some aspects of language than
others. <p>
<p>
Finally, experience also plays a role in semantics (word-learning). For
example, Americans, French, and Russians achieve the two-word-stage by
one-and-a-half years of age, but certain other cultures do not do so until at
least two years of age, arguably because they have less exposure to language
(Slobin, 1972). Components of the mother-infant relationship also may play a
significant role in language learning.  For example, mothers who speak more and
who encourage their four-month-old infants' attention more to the environment
tend to have one-year-olds with larger productive vocabularies and four-year
olds who score higher on a standardized IQ test, suggesting that maternal
stimulation facilitates the development of infants' language skills. Lastly,
single-word utterances used by mothers tend to appear first in their children's
vocabularies. <p>
<p>
A recurring question about the role of experience in language learning is
whether there is a critical period for language development.  Is there
something special about infancy or early childhood which makes language
learning possible or easier at that time? Studies of children who were deprived
of language experience in early childhood on account of abuse or neglect have
found that, while some of children eventually develop language skills, their
competence never reaches normal levels despite, in some cases, years of
training. This suggests that for learning a first language, there is something
special about childhood. Interestingly, though, it is not the case for learning
a second language. In one study which looked at the acquisition of Dutch by a
group of English speakers ranging in age from three to adulthood, it was found
that twelve to fifteen-year-olds learned the fastest and preschoolers learned
the slowest. <p>
<p>
Infants of the same age vary among themselves on nearly every index of language
development.  The most advanced infants may imitate a word by nine months,
whereas the least advanced only first do so at eighteen months. At about one
year in U.S. American babies, comprehension ranges from 10 to 75 words, and
production from 0 to 45 words; at about two years, individual toddlers range
from 8 to 434 words.  Infants also show extreme stylistic differences. One kind
of child is "referential" with an early vocabulary marked by a high proportion
of object labels and speech organized around information; another is
"expressive" with an early vocabulary comprised of relatively more pronouns and
action words and speech marked by social formulae and routines intended to
communicate feelings and desires. Clearly, these are extremes; most children
exhibit a more balanced picture of referential and expressive speech which they
presumably acquire by participating in a diversity of everyday object-and
social-oriented interactions. Language is at base a social affair, and it is to
the development of social features in the infant that we turn last. <p>
<p>
What follows is a brief summary of milestones in language learning in the first
two years. Milestones in comprehension and production are listed separately,
since they proceed at different rates; virtually all researchers agree that
comprehension precedes production developmentally.<p>

<b>SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
<b>Emotional Development</b><p>
<p>
Humans are innately social creatures. Perhaps this is because at birth and for
a long time thereafter, human infants are entirely dependent on others for care
and sustenance. It is therefore not surprising that infants appear to be
equipped from birth with abilities which help them to establish relationships
with those around them. They are drawn to the sound of the human voice, the
sight of a human face, and the smell of their mother. And they have a
remarkable ability to communicate. For example, the cry which is present from
birth, and the smile and the eye-to-eye gaze which appear shortly after, all
send a message to the mother --  The cry: "I'm hungry," "I'm tired," "I just
need to be held."  The smile: "I like to be near you," "I like when you play."
The gaze: "I like to hear you talk," and an averted gaze, "It's time for me to
rest."  These are just some of the many signals infants use to communicate with
their caregivers. And parents have special ways of communicating with their
children.  They use touch and motion and gentle voices to soothe and calm; they
seek eye-to-eye contact when they want to stimulate and play; they coo in
response to their babies' coos; they simplify and modify speech and gestures
and facial expressions to help the babies learn.<p>
<p>
It is through this give and take or "conversation" between parent and child
that children learn the rules of social conduct. Indeed, parents who respond
promptly, reliably, and appropriately to their children's signals give them
good messages from the start. They tell their children that they matter, that
they can trust their parents to be there for them, and they give their children
a sense of control. When babies cry, they are fed, held or changed by mother.
Rather than feeling helpless, babies already begin to feel they can have an
effect on the world and begin to develop a special relationship for the person
or persons who care for them.<p>
<p>
This special relationship is called attachment, and it develops in phases
gradually over time.  In the first phase, from birth to about eight weeks,
babies signal to adults around them indiscriminately;  they are happy to
receive a response from anyone. They are, however, beginning to recognize their
mother (her smell and her voice) and to associate her presence with the relief
of distress, which leads to the second phase.<p>
Between two and seven months, babies begin to prefer to interact with the
person primarily responsible for their care; the person who feeds, holds,
rocks, and plays with them. This is particularly rewarding to parents who now
feel that they are special to the baby. The baby also begins to learn in this
phase about some of the rules of social interaction. For example, in many
Western cultures adult-infant play often consists of face-to-face games:
Babies coo or smile or stick out their tongues and adults respond with similar
actions. Babies come to expect their partners in play to take turns and respond
with puzzlement or disappointment if they don't. They also learn to expect
their caregivers to respond to their signals of distress or pleasure in a
reliable and predictable manner. From these interactions, babies learn three
things: (1) reciprocity -- partners take turns acting and reacting to each
others behavior; (2) effectance -- babies' behavior can cause their caregivers
to act; and (3) trust -- caregivers can be counted on to respond to baby's
signal. Babies begin to develop a coherent view of the social world and
concepts of themselves as individuals who significantly affect others. The
degree to which children learn these rules probably depends in part on the
nature of the caregiving they experience, with care that is affectionate,
responsive, and attuned to the needs of the child producing better results.<p>
<p>
In the third phase, which lasts from seven to twenty-four months, intentional
social behavior becomes prominent. Infants now have some mobility and can seek
out their caregivers. They tend to initiate interaction more and to protest
when an attachment figure leaves. The onset of separation anxiety or protest
signals a major cognitive as well as social milestone. It has been interpreted
as a signal aimed at bringing the attachment figure back to the baby, and its
emergence can be linked to the child's acquiring an understanding of the
concept of person permanence -- the notion that people have a permanent
existence outside of the infant. Indeed, theorists claim that until the child
has the idea of person permanence and realizes that the caregiver exists even
when he or she is not visible or audible to the child, the child is not capable
of forming a true attachment. So, according to these theorists, Phase 3 marks
the beginning of attachment. Wariness of strange adults also becomes evident in
this period.  Of course, though, there are major changes from the beginning to
the end of this period; infants learn to tolerate growing distance from
attachment figures, and they become more adept at interacting with peers and
unfamiliar adults.<p>
<p>
Social development by definition involves an interaction with the environment,
in this case the environment of people. Not surprisingly, that environment in
turn influences the course of the child's development of social relations. For
instance, the degree to which caregivers are responsive in the early months of
a child's life (the degree to which they respond to the infants' signals of
distress, or the degree to which they reciprocate in play) may influence how
much the child learns about reciprocity, effectance, and trust. This, in turn,
may influence the security of infants' attachments to their caregivers or their
ability to interact appropriately with others. For example, children reared in
institutions with little opportunity to form attachments to one or a small
group of individuals show multiple emotional problems throughout childhood.
They tend to be perceived as too friendly and solicitous of adult attention and
have difficulty forming relationships with peers. On the other hand, children
of mothers who are responsive, and in tune with their children's needs, tend to
have children who are securely attached later in childhood, and securely
attached children have been found to be more cooperative, autonomous, popular,
and socially competent than their insecurely attached peers.<p>
<p>
Part and parcel of becoming a social being is gaining the ability to express
and read emotions of others. Some emotions appear to be present from birth. For
example, two-hour-old infants who were given sour, sweet, salty, and bitter
substances to taste respond to the pleasant stimuli with facial expressions
which adults clearly interpret as positive, and to unpleasant ones with
expressions adults interpret as negative. There are two schools of thought on
the development of emotions. One school proposes that emotions come on line
over time, with interest, disgust, distress, and a precursor of surprise
evident in newborns, anger, surprise, and joy emerging by three to four months,
and fear and shyness emerging sometime in the second half-year of life. Another
school proposes that infants may "feel" the whole range of basic emotions from
birth and that only the ability to express those feelings develops over time.
This view is supported by interviews with mothers of one-month-olds, the vast
majority of whom believe that their babies express anger and fear, a percent
surprise, interest, and joy, and only a few sadness. <p>
<p>
Whether or not "feeling" of emotions develop, there is clearly progress in the
manner in which emotions are expressed and the types of stimuli which elicit
emotions. For instance, the smile develops over time from an involuntary reflex
type behavior at birth, which is unrelated to external stimuli, to one which
can be elicited by a variety of stimuli, including faces, bells, and
bulls'-eyes, to the truly social smile for which the human face becomes the
most provocative elicitor. By two months of age, a familiar face is the best
stimulus of all. Laughter follows a similar progression. It first appears at
around three or four months in response to active stimulation like kisses on
the tummy or to certain sounds. Later, at around seven to nine months it can be
elicited by less intrusive stimuli (a game of peek-a-boo). By twelve months,
unusual or discrepant behavior (a parent sucking a bottle) or the anticipation
of something funny (a parent making overtures to tickle) can trigger a laugh.
Expressions of both anger and fear appear to rise dramatically at around seven
to nine at a time when the child is beginning to become mobile. <p>
<p>
All of these emotions appear to have adaptive value. For example, the smile is
singularly effective in eliciting positive stimulation from a caregiver and
prolonging interactions. What parent is not motivated to repeat an activity
which has caused the child to smile? Fear, particularly of strangers and
heights, emerges at a time when infants are just beginning to venture out on
their own and helps to keep the baby close to the caregiver, who serves as a
secure base for exploration and provides some defense from dangerous
situations, such as stairs and precipices. It is interesting in this regard
that the expressions of some of the basic emotions may be universal.
Individuals from a wide range of cultures, including the United States, Japan,
South American countries, and others, all interpret photographs of happiness,
sadness, disgust, and anger in similar ways. <p>
<p>
Another aspect of emotional development is the ability of infants to "read" or
interpret the emotional expressions of others. This also appears to develop
over time. In the first stage (from birth to one-and-a-half months), infants
pay little attention to the internal features of faces and thus probably do not
discriminate consistently among facial expressions. Between one-and-a-half to
two months and four or five months, babies discriminate facial expressions and
can even distinguish variations of a single expression although it is not clear
that the emotional meaning of the expression is understood then. Only in the
third stage (four or five to eight or nine months) is there clear evidence that
emotional expressions are meaningful. In this stage, infants display emotional
resonance, reacting with appropriate emotion to the emotional displays of
others. In the fourth stage (around eight to nine months), infants begin to
appreciate that others' messages may pertain to specific objects or events in
the environment, and it is at this time that "social referencing" begins. <p>
<p>
Social referencing entails the child's reference to the mother or other
caregiver's emotional expressions to determine how the child should approach an
uncertain situation (a new toy, an unfamiliar person, or a potentially
dangerous situation like a visual cliff). Social referencing brings together a
number of newly-developing skills in the infant and demonstrates the
pervasiveness of emotions. Infants must be able to see and hear their
caregivers, must be able to ascertain that their caregivers are attending to
the environmental stimuli in question (a skill not cognitively possible before
the children reach Piaget's stage 4 of sensorimotor development), must be able
to learn the relation between the stimulus and the emotion for the future, and
must have learned to trust their caregiver's judgment. But once they have
learned these skills, the benefits are indisputable. It would be dangerous for
infants to have to learn to avoid electrical outlets, noxious chemicals, and
poisonous plants only by direct experience. Learning mediated by the emotional
expressions of caregivers seems to be a biologically sensible alternative. <p>
 <p>
While the expression of emotions may be universal and human, the environment
plays a decisive role in determining when and under what circumstances emotions
should be expressed. Even in infancy, parents begin to transmit the social
rules concerning when it is appropriate to laugh, cry, express anger, and so
forth. However, it is not until after infancy that children are expected to be
able to regulate their emotions successfully.<p>
<p>
Socialization plays a key role in the development of emotions within cultures.
For example, social smiling may develop earlier in children reared at home than
in children reared in institutions, fear may develop earlier in abused infants
than in other babies, and girls may be better than boys at understanding
emotions because mothers typically show a wider range of emotions to girls than
to boys. Cultural experiences also function to shape the expression of
emotions: American and Japanese mothers, for example, have contrasting
expectations for their infants, communicate those expectations, and behave in
ways that promote independence and assertiveness of self-expression versus the
acquisition of emotional identity and value from the group.<p>
<p>
The development of the child as a social being is well under way by the end of
infancy. The child is now a fully interactive partner within the family and
ready to form relationships with peers. The child's strong emotional ties to
family members, particularly parents, provides the security and confidence
needed to forge other relationships and explore the world. Children have also
learned from their caregivers some of the basic rules of social interaction
such as turn-taking and how to read the emotions of others.    <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Temperament</b><p>
<p>
From the moment children are born, the process of molding them into functional
members of their family, their community, and their culture begins. But it
should not be forgotten that each child is an individual. One indicator of
their individuality is their temperament, the characteristic style each person
has in confronting the world around him. While everybody has moments when they
are happy or sad or angry or anxious, the intensity and frequency of these
feelings tend to vary dramatically among individuals. Each individual appears
to have a characteristic, recurring set of emotional expressions which help to
define the person -- calmness, anxiety, fearfulness, shyness, happiness,
interest and so forth. Emotionality, along with other related characteristics,
such as activity level, adaptability, distractibility, sociability, add up to
the essence we call temperament.<p>
    <p>
Temperaments can significantly influence the course of a child's development.
First, temperament affects how people respond to the child. An infant who
frequently cries and is difficult to sooth may receive different responses from
his or her parents than a child who frequently smiles and coos, and this may
vary with culture. A very active or highly distractible child may have fewer
opportunities to observe and learn than a less active, more persistent child.<p>
However, temperament cannot be considered in a vacuum. Traits which are
maladaptive in one setting, may be beneficial in another. Therefore, a good
predictor of long-term adjustment of children is the "goodness of fit" between
their temperament and their environment. A highly active, vivacious, but easily
distractible child might have difficulty in a confined and busy environment,
but might do quite well in an environment which provides outlets for his or her
energy and opportunities for quiet concentration. Particular traits may not be
good or bad in an absolute sense; outcome may depend instead on how sensitive
caregivers are to children's needs. So parents should try to understand and
find positive outlets for their children's temperament rather than criticize or
fight their natural expression. Indeed, children themselves play a significant
role in creating a complimentary environment. A quiet, sedentary child, for
example, will more likely cry when confronted with rough and tumble play and
smile when treated more gently, thereby discouraging the former and encouraging
the latter and helping to mold the environment. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
<p>
One of the important questions concerning infancy is whether the environment is
somehow more critical to normal, healthy development in this initial phase of
life than in other times during the lifespan. Do the patterns established at
the beginning of life relating to motor skills, thought processes, language,
and interpersonal relationships set the stage for later growth and stature?
Alternatively, are innate trajectories so strong that they transcend
environmental influences? Are the answers the same for all spheres of
development?  <p>
<p>
We have yet to find definitive answers to these questions. It could be, for
instance, that even in the case of severe language deprivation, some course of
training as yet unknown could restore full language use to deprived or isolated
children. However, from a societal point of view, we would prefer not to have
to marshal extraordinary means to counteract past deprivations, even if it were
possible. The more important issue from a societal point of view is to
determine which environmental conditions are harmful to development and should
therefore be avoided at the outset, and which are beneficial and should
therefore be promoted. Of course in answering this question one must take into
account cultural goals since an environment fostering independence may not, for
example, be beneficial in a society which depends on uniformity of behavior.
The multiplicity of cultures and possible desired outcomes make this task a
difficult one, since almost all of the data collected to date use Western,
industrialized cultural goals as a reference. At this point, then, we can only
provide the data with a caveat as to its source and use it as a base for
expanding our knowledge to the vast majority of children as yet unrepresented
in the databank of infancy.

<b>I.  OBJECTIVES AND EMPHASES OF THIS PAPER</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     This paper builds upon an earlier work entitled, "The Eleven Who Survive:
Toward a Re-Examination of Early Childhood Development Program Options and
Costs," written for the World Bank in 1986 and published in March 1987.<b>[1]</b><p>
     This paper also draws heavily on Chapter 10 from R.G. Myers, <b>The Twelve Who
Survive.</b>  London: Routledge, 1992, and on two papers prepared for the
Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development: R. Halpern and R.G.
Myers, "Effects of Early Childhood Intervention on Primary School Progress and
Performance in the Developing Countries," Ypsilanti, Michigan, High/Scope
Educational Research Foundation, April, 1985. (Mimeo); and, R.G. Myers,
"Effects of Early Childhood Intervention on Primary School Progress and
Performance in the Developing Countries: An Update," Ypsilanti, Michigan,
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, February, 1988  (Mimeo).<p>
  That paper presented an argument for investing in programs of early childhood
development, set out a framework within which to examine program options,
provided some examples of costs and effects of early interventions, and
concluded with some suggested actions.<p>
<p>
     This paper will elaborate and refine somewhat the arguments for investing in
child development that were presented in the earlier document, with particular
emphasis in Latin America.  It will extend our description of complementary
approaches to programming that was sketched at that time.  It will also
characterize changes in the context and climate for investment in early
childhood programs that have occurred over the last five years. Additional
information will be presented, from research and from concrete program
experience, that reaffirms the importance of early childhood investments and
that should help Latin American countries and development agencies such as the
World Bank to evaluate and reorient their strategies.  In a final section,
suggestions will be offered for specific actions that the Latin American
countries as well as the World Bank might take with respect to support for
early childhood development programs.<p>
<p>
     The treatment of issues in this paper is influenced by the fact that it is
being written at the request of the World Bank.  It will, for instance, give
special attention to economic benefits anticipated from programs, but this will
be done within a broad social view of benefits (and costs) to individuals,
communities and societies.  Most examples will come from Latin America.
However, relevant information from programs in other parts of the developing
world will also be included.<p>
<p>
     Also influencing the treatment of early childhood development in this paper is
a particular interest that links early childhood development to basic
education, and, more specifically, to primary schooling.  This interest derives
in part from the World Bank's active involvement in the World Conference on
Education for All (WCEFA), as one of the four main organizers.  At the
Conference, child care and development emerged as an important part of basic
education.  <p>
     In the following pages, the emphasis will be on early care, development and
education.  From time to time the paper will use the phrase, "<b>initial</b>
education" (a phrase invented in Latin America), interpreted as the education
of children occurring <b>from birth</b> up to the point of entrance into
primary school.  The relationship of that initial education (which can occur in
the home or in various forms of preschools) to the entrance, progress and
performance of children in primary schools will also be stressed.<p>
<p>
     Because this paper emphasizes the educational component of early childhood
development and the potential educational outcomes of investments in early
childhood development, three clarifications need to be made:<p>
<p>
     <i>Goals of child development other than improvements in schooling are also
important</i> .  Improved adjustment to and success in primary school is only
one of the hoped-for outcomes for children who participate in programs intended
to enhance early childhood care and development.  It may not be the most
important.  The set of schooling outcomes accompanies and overlaps other
important purposes such as improving a children's physical health, learning to
learn, providing child care that benefits children while parents work,
rehabilitating children who are disabled, inculcating particular moral,
political, or religious values, and generally improving the quality of life for
children.  Even in a program that focusses on preparation for school, it should
be recognized that the benefits to investment in an early childhood development
will be greater than the schooling benefits.<p>
<p>
     Moreover, schools are only one of several learning environments for a child.
Learning, hence education, occurs also in the home and community, for instance.
It is important, therefore, not to lose sight of the broader question of the
effects of early childhood programs on the general ability of a child to
learn.<p>
<p>
     <i>Early childhood development and readiness for schooling involve more than
cognitive and social readiness</i> .  When links are made between early
childhood development and primary schooling, there is a tendency to think
narrowly about child development as if "cognitive" or "mental" development were
its only component.<b>[2]</b>  Instead the
discussion is based on an integrated view of child development that crosses
disciplinary and sectoral lines.  In that holistic view, physical, social and
emotional development are as important as cognitive development.  And, the
nutritional status and health status of a child are as important to early and
later learning and education as the mental and social well-being of a child.
This implies that non-educational dimensions of development should be included
in programs that emphasize educational goals or are located within the
education bureaucracy, just as the educational or psycho-social dimension of
development should be included in programs located within the health sector or
in nutrition programs. <p>
<p>
     <i>Schools as well as children need to adjust</i> .  The idea that children
should be ready for school, and that early childhood interventions can help
that to happen, should not be separated from or subordinated to the equally
important idea that schools should be ready for children.  Often, there seems
to be an assumption (by educators and parents alike) that the characteristics
and methods of schooling are fixed and that children should be adjusted to
them.  However, it may be as reasonable to expect schools to change, for
instance, their initial language of instruction as it is to expect a child to
arrive with mastery of an "official" language that is not the mother tongue.
Or, it may be as reasonable to expect the curriculum to vary from region to
region, as it is to base the curriculum on centrally-determined, standardized
material that is not recognizable or relevant to many children entering the
primary school.  Indeed, investments in preparing children for school should be
considered together with investments that prepare schools for children and that
these not be viewed as part of a "zero sum game."  <p>
<p>
     With these clarifications in mind, we turn now to a description of the
changing conditions that frame our discussion, with emphasis on changes in the
last five years.  In general, these changing conditions: 1) help to explain a
more receptive international climate and increasing demands for early childhood
development programs; and, 2) suggest that program experience has grown
appreciably in recent years, providing us with many examples to be drawn upon
in future program planning and implementation.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>II.  WHY INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT?</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     The argument for greater attention to investing in programs of integrated
attention to the development of young children goes roughly as follows:<p>
<p>
     <i>The need is great</i> .  Millions of children suffer from seriously delayed
or impaired physical, mental, social and/or emotional development during their
first years of life.  As a result, these children are being condemned to
unproductive, unrewarding and dependent lives.<p>
<p>
     <i>Children have rights</i> .  Allowing disability and arrested development to
occur when it could be prevented is a violation of basic human rights.  The
fact that children are dependent on others for satisfaction of their rights
creates an even greater obligation to help and protect them.<p>
<p>
     <i>Scientific evidence is supportive</i> .  It is well established,
scientifically, that the early years are critical in the formation of
intelligence, personality, and social behavior, and that the effects of early
neglect can be cumulative.  Evidence comes from research in physiology,
nutrition, psychology, education and other fields.  To cite a few of the
findings:<p>
<p>
     &#149;Brain cells are formed during the first two years.  Stimulation of a
child's senses affects the structure and organization of neural pathways in the
brain during the formative period.  By age 6, most of these connections are
made (or not, as the case may be).  Thus, providing opportunities for complex
perceptual and motor experiences at an early age favorably affects various
learning abilities in later life and can even compensate, at least partly, for
deficits associated with early malnutrition (Dobbing, 1987).<p>
<p>
     &#149;Children whose caregivers interact with them in consistent, caring ways
will be better nourished and less apt to be sick than children not so attended
(Zeitlin, Ghessemi, and Mansour, 1990).<p>
<p>
     &#149;Establishing a loving relationship in the early months of life has been
shown to affect the ability later in life of a person to love and to establish
permanent relationships (Sroufe and Cooper, 1988).<p>
<p>
     &#149;Longitudinal studies demonstrate long-term effects with a variety of
intervention programs.  These effects go beyond the learning of basic abilities
to include: improved school attendance and performance, reduced repetition,
increased employment and reduced delinquency during the teenage years and
reduced teenage pregnancy (Berutta-Clement, et.al., 1984  and Myers, 1991).<p>
<p>
     <i>Economic returns can be high</i> .  Improving a young child's health and
nutrition, and providing opportunities for stimulating interaction and early
education can bring a high economic return to society as well as to the
individual.  Without recurring to a scientific literature, common sense
suggests that a person who is well-developed physically, mentally, socially and
emotionally will be in a better position to contribute economically to family,
community and country than a person who is not.  Economic returns take several
forms:<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Increased productivity of participating children.</i>  In the long
chain of causation that links early childhood development to later
productivity, early ability affects later ability, educational attainment, and
occupational placement and experience -- all of which influence adult
productivity.  A growing body of empirical evidence suggests that early
childhood programs have the potential to affect early ability by improving both
physical and mental capacity (Maguire and Austin, 1987).  They can also have an
affect on enrollment, progress and performance of children in school (Myers,
1992) and, in turn, bring important changes in skills and outlooks affecting
adult behavior (e.g., Inkeles and Smith, 1974).  Schooling helps build skills
such as the ability to organize knowledge into meaningful categories, to
transfer knowledge from one situation to another, and to be more selective in
the use of information (Rogoff, 1980; Triandis, 1980).  Schooling facilitates
greater technological adaptiveness (Grawe, 1979).  It relates to both increased
productivity by farmers (Lockheed, Jamison and Lau, 1980) and by workers in the
informal sectors (Colclough, 1980).<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Cost savings.</i>  Preventive programs produce savings by, for
instance, improving the efficiency of educational systems through reductions in
dropout, repetition and remedial programs.  Similarly, a program result may be
to lower health costs through early diagnosis and by developing better health
habits.  Or, other social program costs may be reduced such as welfare payments
or judicial and penal costs.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Increased productivity of caregivers.</i>  Child care and development
programs can free up the time of caregivers for productive purposes.  offer
also the possibility of increased labor force participation by women and they
can free older siblings to learn and earn as well.<a
href="c3_fn.html">[3]</a><p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Employment effects.</i>  Related to the previous argument, but
distinct from it, is a potential economic effect that will depend more
explicitly than the others on the way in which early childhood programs are
structured.  First, creating programs can create jobs that are more stable and
productive than, for instance, taking in laundry or street vending.  Second,
most programs require the procurement of food and materials, and the
construction of improvement of the program setting.  These can be contracted
locally, providing some additional income to communities.<p>
     <p>
     <i>Inequalities can be moderated</i> .  Investment in early development can
help to reduce economic and social inequities.  Children living in conditions
of poverty and/or discrimination often fall behind their more fortunate peers
in some aspects of their development at an early age.  This reinforces existing
differences.  In the short run, investments in programs of early childhood care
and development can reduce (but seldom eliminate) the growing gaps in
development, and therefore can reduce the differential consequences.  Indeed,
there is increasing evidence that children from more disadvantaged backgrounds
can profit more from good early childhood programs than more advantaged
children (Myers, 1992).<p>
<p>
     <i>There are other effects as well</i> .  <p>
<p>
     &#149;<i>Inter-generational effects.</i>  To the extent that programs of early
childhood care and development affect subsequent education, the evidence
suggests that they will also have an affect on fertility and population
growth.<p>
<p>
     &#149;<i>Multiplier effects.</i>  Especially in the case of programs of
parental education, the immediate effects on one child will carry over to the
raising of additional children. <p>
<p>
     <i>Effective program options exist</i> .  A set of complementary program
options and of effective program models within each option provides experience
which can be draw upon to help ensure that future programs are effective.<p>
<p>
     <i>It is affordable</i> .  The cost of early childhood programs need not be
high.  In some cases, the programs can pay for themselves.<p>
<p>
     In light of the above arguments, the reasoning that supported neglect of child
care and early education projects by development agencies such as the World
Bank in the past is no longer convincing.  And, "believers" should be able to
make their case, drawing on evidence and examples, including those that were
presented in "The Eleven Who Survive" and that will be presented in this paper.

<b>III.  THE CHANGING CONTEXT</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     <b>Changing Social and Demographic Conditions</b>  <p>
<p>
     Several long term general trends affecting early childhood care and
development have continued over the last five years.<p>
<p>
     <i>Changes in the child survival rate</i> .  The infant mortality rate (IMR)
has been more than cut in half over the last 30 years.  In 1960, 5 of every 6
children born lived to see their first birthday (83%).  By 1986 when the first
paper was written for the World Bank, 11 of 12 (92%) children survived to age
one.  By the end of the century, 19 of every 20 (95%) children born are
expected to survive to age one.  Today, in 1991, that indicator is probably 13
of 14 (93%).<b>[4]</b><p>
<p>
     The continuing decline in infant mortality presses us to think about what
happens to the increasing number of children who "survive," as defined by the
infant mortality rate.  It presses us to change our idea of survival and to
define survival over a longer period and in terms of a continuum that runs from
death to good health.  The closer to good health a child is along that
continuum, the greater the chances of survival.  Thus, survival and child
development are recognized as simultaneous, not sequential.<p>
<p>
     Most children who now survive to age one live in the same difficult
circumstances that put them "at risk" of death; these conditions now place them
at risk of delayed or debilitated development.  In "The Eleven Who Survive" we
argued that the time has come for greater attention to the care and development
of these survivors, and for integrated programs of child survival <b>and
development</b>.  As governments and international organizations look for ways
to extend their successes with programs directed toward survival, they are
beginning, with reason, to look at the "and development" part of the Child
Survival and Development Revolution.<p>
<p>
     <i>Increasing labor force participation by women</i> .  Women continue to
enter the paid labor force in increasing numbers, influenced by such changes as
a shift to a cash economy, economic stagnation, or by changing social beliefs.
In Latin America the female participation rates increased from about 23% in
1960 to about 31% in the early 1980s (see ILO, 1990).  In some cases women must
take on work done by men who have migrated to seek better work in cities or in
mines.  The number of women-headed households is increasing.  These changes
place additional stress on women, to whom society continues to assign the main
responsibility for child care.  They often work a "double day."  In these
stressful conditions, a mother who must work so that her family can survive may
love a child and believe that she should devote time and energy to her, but she
may not be able to do so; she needs help.  Among other things, she needs
alternative forms of child care.  The demand for such alternatives is
growing.<p>
<p>
     <i>Shifting family patterns</i> .  The help that families need with child care
is not as nearby as it once was.  Extended families are no longer as common as
they once were.  As migration and progressive urbanization occur, members of an
extended family -- grandmothers, for instance -- may remain in rural areas or
themselves be at work outside the home.  These changes affect both the
possibility of direct care and the socialization of new mothers that
grandmothers have given in the past.  Nor are there as many sibling caregivers
as there once were; families are smaller and the idea that schooling is a
child's work is increasingly accepted.  Still some older children are denied
the chance to go to primary school because they must care for younger
siblings.<p>
<p>
     These changes in work roles, in location, and in family structures and
organization all require changes in childrearing practices and in childcare
arrangements.  These have not kept pace, to the detriment of young childrens'
development.<p>
<p>
     <b>Changing Economic and Political Conditions</b> <p>
<p>
     Turns in the economic and political fortunes of some countries over the last
two years have had some positive effects on the climate for investment in early
childhood development and related social programs.  In the early 1990s there is
evidence in parts of Latin America that the worst of the recession of the 1980s
may be moderating.  This apparent shift has provided hope, but could be
ephemeral.  Economic change, if it is real, could open up new options.
However, the pace of economic renewal varies significantly from place to place.
In some there is no renewal.  It is unlikely, therefore, that the change will
be great enough to counter the need for continued attention to economic
adjustment policies and that these policies will need to incorporate a human
dimension, including attention to the plight of children who live in conditions
putting them "at risk".  <p>
<p>
     During the last several years, the problem of indebtedness has taken on
increasing importance and a new approach has emerged.  The mechanism of "debt
swaps," in which debt is written off on the condition that a debtor government
makes a local currency contribution to a particular program, has been used in
some cases to support early childhood programs.<a
href="c5_fn.html">[5]</a>  The possibility that additional funds for
social investments can be liberated in this way has given some hope to early
childhood program advocates, among others.<p>
<p>
     Perhaps the most dramatic turn of recent years has been in the political
arena.  With the declaration of an end to the "Cold War," major new initiatives
to reduce arms have also fostered hope that new funds will become available for
social programs, including those directed to early childhood.  Whether or not
this turns out to be a false hope, it has stimulated reflection and creative
thinking about social problems and their possible solutions.<p>
<p>
     <b>Increasing Attention to the Young Child</b> <p>
<p>
     Based on statistics from UNESCO's Regional Office for Latin America and the
Caribbean on "pre-school education", coverage grew from 7.9 percent in 1980 to
15.0 in 1986 (UNESCO/OREALC, 1990).  The annual rate of growth of 10.4 percent
during that period was much higher than that for primary schooling (1.6
percent) or secondary education (3.8 percent).<a
href="c6_fn.html">[6]</a><p>
   In part, the higher percentage of growth simply reflects the lower base from
which pre-primary expansion is occurring.  But in part it reflects a response,
particularly by governments, to increasing need and demand.<p>
<p>
     The overall rate of 15 percent coverage for preschool was calculated by
comparing the number of children participating in identifiable preschool
programs with the population of children ages 0 to 5 even though most
pre-school programs only enroll children ages 3 to 5 or 6 years.  Using the
percentage of children enrolled in relation to the ages 3 to 5 (or 4 to 6)
years of age rather than from 0 to 5, the preschool coverage for the region
would be closer to 30 percent of the age group.  Considering that rapid
expansion of preschooling has occurred during a time of extraordinary pressure
on the economic re-sources for most Latin American governments, this growth is
a particularly significant accomplishment.<p>
<p>
     Moreover, most preschool statistics do not pick up participation in non-formal
preschool programs and they leave out programs that are not the responsibility
of the education sector.  For instance, the more than 800,000 children who are
in the home day care program of Colombia would not be included in the preschool
statistics because that program is not considered an education program, even
though it includes an educational component.  And many private preschool
programs are not picked up in the statistics.  Therefore, the 30 percent figure
is probably a minimum figure.<p>
<p>
     These improvements (at least numerically) in attention to young children in
Latin America are noted here for two reasons.  First, the increases appear to
reflect a political recognition that there must be responses to a new need and
demand arising from the kinds of changes we have described above.  Second, the
figures suggest that <b>this level of education is now beginning to grow to a
size where it must be fully incorporated into discussions of education</b>.  It
is beginning to reach in significant ways into so-called "disadvantaged"
populations.  It is approaching a point at which attention to the quality of
the interventions needs to be followed very closely; with size there is a
tendency for quality to decrease.  For these reasons, the evolution of initial
education it is at a critical point and it would be unfortunate not to seize
the opportunity while there is still a chance to have a major influence on the
course of its development.<p>
<p>
     Moreover, the recent expansion of early childhood programs has produced
important additional experience that can be drawn upon as new programs are
planned.  New ways of dealing with the potential problems accompanying
expansion are being tried out with some success.  The variety of models that
are relatively low in cost and with different degrees of effectiveness is
impressive.  There are many lessons to be learned and applied.  That will be
evident as examples are presented later.<p>
<p>
     <b>Changing International Awareness</b> <p>
<p>
     An important change in climate has occurred since 1986 in the attitude of
international institutions toward investing in early childhood care and
development.  This has occurred in part as institutions have sought new lines
of activity to complement their work on survival, but also because three
specific international events have given new visibility to the child:<p>
<p>
     &#149;In November, 1989, a "Convention of the Rights of the Child" was
approved by the General Assembly of the United Nations, urging signatories to,
"...insure to the maximum extent possible child survival and development"
(Article 6).  It also indicates that, while placing primary responsibility for
a child's upbringing with parents and families, signatory States must help
parents and must "insure the development of institutions, facilities and
services for the care of children." (Article 18.2)<p>
<p>
     &#149;In March of 1990, the World Bank joined with UNICEF, UNESCO and the
UNDP
in organizing a "World Conference on Education for All" (WCEFA), bringing
together governmental representatives from over 150 nations and representatives
from more than 200 non-governmental organizations.  The Declaration approved at
the Conference included the following statement:<p>
<p>
          "Learning begins at birth.  This calls for early childhood care and initial
education.  These can be provided through arrangements involving families,
communities, or institutional programs, as appropriate." (Article 5)<p>
<p>
The WCEFA Framework for Action also set as one of the targets to be considered
in plans for the 1990s:<p>
<p>
     "(1) Expansion of early childhood care and development activities, including
family and community interventions, especially for poor, disadvantaged, and
disabled children;.." (Paragraph 8)<p>
     &#149;A World "Summit for Children" occurred in September, 1990 that brought
together 70 Heads of State to discuss the plight of children and to commit
themselves to improvements.  A follow-up Plan of Action incorporated as a goal
the expansion of early childhood development activities, following the
recommendations of the WCEFA.  The Summit has given additional impetus to
activities underway and is opening the door for new efforts to strengthen
childcare and development.<p>
<p>
     The changing international climate is also evident in the recent discussions
and actions of international organizations,<a
href="c7_fn.html">[7]</a> including the World Bank, to which we now
turn.<p>
<p>
     <b>The Role of the World Bank</b> <p>
<p>
     A review carried out by the Bank of its involvement in early childhood
development as of August 1985 led to the conclusion that, in relative terms,
very little was being done directly within the Bank to attend to child
development and virtually nothing had been done within the education sector
(Brems, 1985).  A number of health and nutrition projects had the collateral
affect of improving overall child development, looked at in an integrated way,
and some of these even included a child care or education component.  At the
time, however, only one project was found that fell within the education sector
and in that project, child development was approached very indirectly by
including a day-care center within the design for construction of rural
development training centers.  The day care facility was provided in order to
facilitate women's participation in training.<a
href="c8_fn.html">[8]</a><p>
<p>
     The 1985 finding apparently reflected decisions taken within the Bank at the
beginning of the decade.  At that time, the prevailing wisdom, as presented in
a commissioned working paper written for the Bank by Moshe Smilansky (1978),
was that, on the basis of the available evidence, giving priority to support
for preschool interventions could not be justified.  Smilansky noted that
"traditional" kindergartens do not seem to protect disadvantaged children from
lagging behind or failing in school and that although preschool programs might
have an effect on IQ, most studies showed a "wash-out" effect in the early
years of primary school.  Programs which might produce longer-term results were
dismissed as infeasible because it was felt that such programs would have to be
too expensive or sophisticated.<p>
<p>
     Since 1985, evidence supporting the above assertions has changed.  Longer term
effects of quality preschool programs have been identified.  Moreover, the view
of program effects has broadened from one centered on IQ to one looking at
educational and social behaviors of children.  Even though IQ effects
associated with some early interventions may be neutralized as children mature,
behavioral effects seem to be maintained.  In addition, experiences now abound
of less expensive, but effective alternatives to the formal, traditional
preschools criticized by Smilansky.  These non-formal programs may be set in
centers outside the home or may involve the education and support of families,
as suggested by  Smilansky. <p>
<p>
     As changes in evidence and in the climate for investment have occurred, the
position within the Bank with respect to early childhood care and development
seems to be changing as well. For instance, two recent education papers have
recognized the importance of the early childhood period for learning by
including the child as one of the important inputs into primary schooling.  In
"Education and Sub-Saharan Africa," the primary school section includes a
statement on "ensuring teachable pupils" (The World Bank, 1988, p. 45).  This
is echoed, but with greater emphasis, in "Improving Primary Education in
Developing Countries" (Lockheed and Verspoor, 1991)  which explicitly
incorporates a child's learning capacity, as determined by prior learning
experience, nutrition and health, into the model used to examine and make
recommendations for improving school effectiveness.  Promising policy options
for improving primary schools that are treated in the paper include targeted
investment in preschools and alternatives to in-school provision of learning
experiences.<p>
<p>
     In 1991, no formal review of the Bank's involvement in early childhood
programs was undertaken to provide a direct comparison with 1986.  However, the
number of activities that might be classified as early childhood care and
development or as "initial education" has increased markedly.  Within Latin
America and the Caribbean, for instance, loans have been approved for Colombia,
Venezuela, Brazil, Chile and Ecuador, and initial education or child
development components are included in discussions being held at present in
Mexico, Uruguay, and El Salvador.  These actions are located variously within
nutrition, social sector, and education loans.<p>
<p>
     <b>Summary</b> <p>
<p>
     There is evidence that demographic and social changes require increased
attention to early childhood care and development.  There seems to be a
favorable shift in the economic and political climate affecting decisions to
invest in early childhood programs.  Countries are investing their own scarce
resources, as indicated by the rapidly increasing enrollments, even during the
difficult economic times of the 1980s.  The climate within international
organizations, including the World Bank, appears to be opening toward new
consideration of early investments.  With expansion, a range of new experiences
is available to be drawn upon when reconsidering policies and programs.<p>
<p>
     Having written the above, it is tempting to conclude that, given changes
occurring over the past 5 years, the main task is no longer to convince people
that investing in early childhood care and development is worthy but is,
rather, simply to provide examples of effective programs and to improve the
basis for choosing one or another program option in particular contexts.  That
conclusion is premature, however.  Recent experience also suggests that the
general level of knowledge and awareness of the potential benefits from early
education investments is still low and in many cases, skepticism is still
high.<p>
<p>
       In the World Bank as well as in most other international organizations, the
importance of investing in integrated attention to young children (going beyond
the effect of nutrition or health on survival), is restricted to a few
"believers" and is not yet captured adequately or broadly in policy and program
documents.  For instance, the education section of the document prepared by the
World Bank for its presentation at the Children's Summit on September 30, 1990,
made no mention of early education, let alone child care and development (World
Bank, 1990).  It is important, therefore, to continue providing a sound
rationale for investment that incorporates economic as well as emotional and
scientific arguments.  With this prelude, we turn to the arguments for
investing in early childhood.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>IV.  COMPLEMENTARY PROGRAM APPROACHES</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     In order to counter the narrow, "institutional," often expensive, and
age-restricted image associated with preschool programs, a typology of five
complementary program approaches to early childhood care and development was
set out in the previous paper.  These approaches focussed respectively on:<p>
<p>
     &#149;    Caring for the child;<p>
<p>
     &#149;    Educating caregivers (particularly parents);<p>
<p>
     &#149;    Promoting child-based community development;<p>
<p>
     &#149;Strengthening social institutions involved in early childhood programs;
and<p>
<p>
     &#149;Creating awareness and demand.<b>[9]</b>  <p>
<p>
     Although improved child development is the ultimate goal in all five
approaches, each approach is directed toward a different set of participants
(beneficiaries).  Objectives can differ as well.  And each approach can be
pursued in a variety of ways, as indicated in the last column of Figure 1,
reproduced here from the previous paper.<p>
<p>
     As argued in the previous paper, each of these program approaches should be
examined with respect to two cross-cutting considerations: "integration"
(running from mono-focal to "holistic") and "community participation" (running
from none to complete responsibility and control).  A "holistic" approach was
important (because child development is a holistic process) and that even if
vertically-organized services could not be integrated, they might be made to
"converge" on the same population in order to have the best effect.  Much
community participation is superficial and is used often in an attempt to
reduce costs to government.  Participation is seldom considered as an end in
itself or as a means of building self-reliance in a community, or in relation
to the organization and motivation needed at a community level for a program to
be sustained.<p>

     The dimension of earlier framework specifying program characteristics can be
extended, as shown in Figure 2.  To integration and participation emphasized
earlier, the following five other characteristics, against which a program can
be judged, should be added:<p>
<p>
     &#149;Focussing on families and communities in which children are at risk of
delayed or debilitated development.<p>
<p>
&#149;Providing flexibility and adjusting programs to different socio-cultural
contexts.<p>
<p>
&#149;Supporting and building upon local ways of coping effectively with
problems of care, development and socialization.<p>
<p>
&#149;Seeking financially feasible and cost-effective options.<p>
<p>
     &#149;Seeking the largest possible coverage for children at risk.<p>

     Figure 2 also includes a third dimension to the previous framework, defined by
the developmental status of children.  It is not enough to think of programming
for child development or learning when a child reaches the age of 3.  Child
development is a continuous process that begins prenatally and extends
throughout the entire period of a child's early life.  Clearly, different
moments in the process will require somewhat different approaches.  If a child
development strategy is to be comprehensive, it should respond to changing
needs during that period.<p>
<p>
     Because child development follows a general pattern (even though the process
will vary from individual to individual and culture to culture), it is possible
to establish program activities appropriate to general stages or levels of a
child's development.  These stages correspond roughly to certain age periods,
but they are more accurately thought of in terms of particular developmental
advances that occur as a child grows older.  Very roughly, it is possible to
think in terms of programs appropriate to the following developmental stages:<p>
<p>
     &#149;a prenatal period;<p>
<p>
     &#149;    infancy (up to about 18 months) that encompasses weaning, learning to
walk and early language development;<p>
<p>
     &#149;    a toddler and post-toddler period (about 18 months to 48 months)
during which a child's coordination, language, ability to think, and social
skills advance by leaps and bounds;<p>
<p>
     &#149;    a preschool period (approximately ages 4 and 5) when coordination is
relatively well-developed, and when cognitive development and development of
pre-literacy skills occur rapidly, along with greater attention to
relationships with peers; and<p>
<p>
     &#149;    a period of transition to school and the world at large (roughly ages
6 to 8).<p>
<p>
     Program responsibility for children in these different stages is often placed
in different institutions, with the period prior to age 3 falling to the health
sector and/or to organizations concerned with family welfare.  From age three
onward, child development is more likely to be associated with education and
preschools.  However, if "learning begins at birth," as stated in the
Declaration of the World Conference on Education for All, age 3 is too late.
The earlier period should also be a concern <b>for education</b>, even if the
institutional location lies outside education.<p>
<p>
     Against this background, we turn now to an examination of evidence of program
effects, concentrating on three approaches presented in the framework -- on
center-based child care, on parental education, and on child-centered programs
of community development.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>V.  EVIDENCE OF PROGRAM EFFECTIVENESS</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     Over the years, a large number of evaluations have been carried out which try
to get at the benefits associated with participation in various kinds of early
childhood programs in Latin America and elsewhere.  A growing number of solid
studies provide evidence suggesting that:<p>
<p>
     &#149;Programs designed to improve health, nutrition and the psycho-social
condition of children in their preschool years can affect significantly
children's development and their readiness for school.<p>
<p>
     &#149;These improvements make a child more likely to attend school, less
likely to repeat or drop out, and a better performer in school.<p>
<p>
     &#149;Through reductions in repetition and dropout rates, the efficiency of
school systems is improved.<p>
<p>
     &#149;Effects can favor children who are at a social disadvantage.<p>
<p>
     &#149;Improved readiness for school does not always translate into
improvements in school progress and performance because of the poor quality of
primary schools (Therefore, lack of a relationship between early intervention
and school variables does not necessarily indicate that an early intervention
is ineffective).<p>
<p>
     &#149;Attention to the quality of early interventions is important, but an
obsession with quality is not necessary.<p>
<p>
     This evidence comes from evaluations of several kinds of center-based programs
focussing on the child, from programs of parental education in which the focus
is on the caregiver, and from community development programs build around child
development.  Some of the programs evaluated are health or nutrition programs
and others are education programs but most have taken an "integrated" approach
which includes several components.<p>
<p>
     <b>Effects on Children</b> <p>
     <p>
     <i>Effects on the development of children and their "readiness for school</i>
."  The development of children and their "readiness for school" can be defined
in many ways.  In the clarifications presented in the prologue to this paper
(pp. 2-3), we suggested that it is more appropriate to talk about the general
development or condition of children prior to their entrance into school than
it is to link that condition specifically to schooling through the use of the
"readiness" concept.  Nevertheless, in many programs and studies, emphasis is
placed on pre-literacy and pre-numeracy skills and on the cognitive development
of children prior to their entrance into school.  When a broader view is taken,
development and "readiness" are also operationalized in terms of physical,
social and emotional characteristics, including nutritional and health status,
a child's ability to relate to others, and self-concept or self-esteem.    <p>
     A long list of academic studies and reviews, not linked to particular
intervention programs can be cited to support 1) the idea that early childhood
development can be enhanced and 2) the position that the early years constitute
the key period for the development of intelligence and behavior (e.g., Hunt,
1961; Bloom, 1964; Bronfenbrenner, 1979; Rutter, 1974; Sameroff and Chandler,
1975; Piaget and Inhelder, 1969).  It is not our purpose to review that vast
literature.  Rather, we focus on the benefits to children resulting from
specific interventions, concentrating on Latin America, but bringing in results
from other countries as well.<p>
<p>
     Looking across many program evaluations, each with its peculiar definition of
the outcome hoped for, there seems to be little doubt that intervention
programs of various kinds designed to improve the early development of
children, including their cognitive ability, can achieve their purpose<a
href="c10_fn.html">[10]</a>.  In Latin America, evidence can be found
in studies of nutrition interventions (e.g., Klein, et.al., 1979; Chavez, 1981;
Cravioto, 1982; McKay, 1982), formal and informal center-based pre-school
programs (Filp, et.al., 1983; Myers, et.al., 1985; Instituto de Economia, 1989;
Feijo, 1982; Pontiere, et.al., 1981; INAN-MS, Forero and Cuervo, 1987; Llanos,
et.al, 1985)  home day care programs (ICBF, 1990; de Ruesta, 1978), parental
education programs (Richards, 1985; Alvarez, et. al, 1982), home-visiting
programs (Llanos and Winkler, 1982), community-development programs (Nimnicht
and Posada, 1985; Chetly, 1990).  The Latin American results are reinforced by
data from programs in other areas of the world (Turkey - Kagitcibasi, et.al.,
1985 ; India - Lal &amp; Wati, 1986; Morocco - Wagner and Spratt, 1984;
Thailand- Raudenbush, Kidchanapanish and Kang, 1991; Philippines - Child and
Youth Research Center, 1988).  <p>
<p>
     Because this evidence is extensive and increasingly accepted, we will not
dwell on it.  We will assume acceptance of the well-grounded idea that early
development and the ability to learn can be enhanced through interventions.
Our concern, rather, will be with the extent to which these developmental
improvements carry over into school, affecting school entrance, progress and
performance.  The evidence we will provide comes from 19 longitudinal studies
from Latin America and elsewhere that have traced students into primary schools
following different early childhood interventions.  Of these, four are studies
of the effects of nutritional interventions and 15 examine educational
programs, many of which also include a nutrition and health component.  Table 1
provides descriptions of the 19 projects or programs whose evaluations have
been included in the analysis that follows.  Table 2 focusses on evaluation
results.  Of the 19 studies, 10 contain comparative information about
enrollment, 14 about school progress (promotion, repetition, drop out), and 14
about school performance.<p>
<p>
     <i>Effects on enrollment, progress and performance in primary school</i> .  <p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Effects on enrollment.</i>  Are children who participate in early
childhood programs more likely to enroll in primary school?  Relatively little
information could be found to answer this question.  The Guatemalan study
showed an effect of the nutrition program on enrollment for girls, but not
boys, as indicated above.  The PROMESA program in Colombia showed a (slightly)
higher enrollment level among children participation in the program.  The lack
of information about effects on enrollment is understandable for Latin America
where enrollment in the first year of primary school is almost universal in
most countries within the region.<p>
<p>
     A more interesting question for Latin America is, "Does participation in an
early childhood program effect the age of enrollment?"  This question is
important because the age of enrollment may, in turn, be associated with
effects on progress and performance.  Sometimes intervention programs provide
the grounding for children and raise expectations for parents so that children
enter school at the age that is recommended rather than at an older age,
thereby helping to regularize the flow of students into and through the system.
However, programs may also lead to pressures to put children into a structured
school environment before they are ready. <p>
<p>
     In six studies, the average age of enrollment was clearly younger for those
who had been in an early childhood development program than for those who had
not.  In only 2 cases where enrollment age was reported were there negligible
differences.  We do not know from the studies whether an earlier age of
enrollment led to improved progress and performance.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Effects on progress (promotion, repetition, drop-out)</i>.  Three of
the four nutrition studies showed an improvement in school progress for program
children; one failed to find a difference.  Of the 10 education studies
including information about school progress, 7 showed less repetition and
better progress through school for children who had participated in an early
childhood program, as compared with similar children who had not.  Three showed
no effect, one of which was carried out in a system with automatic promotion so
no difference would be expected.<p>
<p>
     In some cases, the difference in promotion rates was rather dramatic.  For
instance, in all three of the Brazilian studies, the difference in repetition
was substantial.  In the CEAPE study, the rate was 26 percent vs. 44 percent in
the first grade and only 6 percent vs. 26 percent in the second grade of
primary school.  The lower rates were for CEAPE participants.  In the Alagoas
evaluation of the PROAPE program, repetition in the first grade was only 9
percent for the PROAPE children as compared with 33 percent for children who
did not participate in the program.  Yet another Brazilian study, from
Fortaleza, showed a high rate of 36 percent repetition in the first grade for
children with a kindergarten experience, but an even higher rate of 66 percent
for those without such experience.   <p>
<p>
     Four studies from Colombia are included in the Tables, all of which show
significant differences in progress through the educational system.  The
biggest of these is associated with a program in the impoverished area of the
Choco where 60 percent of the program children reached the 4th grade of primary
school versus only 30 percent of the comparison group.  In Argentina, 36
percent of the rural children from low socio-economic backgrounds repeated if
they had a pre-school experience as compared with 77 percent for those
without.<p>
<p>
     In the case of Peru, no difference in repetition was found between children
who had participated in the PRONOEI program and children who had not.  It was
suggested that this finding reflects the poor quality of the primary schooling
in Peru rather than the failure of early intervention programs to have an
effect.<p>

     <i>Effects on performance</i> <p>
<p>
     <i>Academic performance</i> .  Of the 14 studies reporting on academic
performance, 8 indicated that children from early intervention programs
performed better; 5 found a negligible difference or none at all, and in one
(Morocco) positive effects were found in a rural, but not an urban context.<p>
<p>
     In the Turkish and Philippine studies, there was a suggestion that the results
were stronger during the first two years of the primary school than later on.
What the longer term effects are in these two cases has not yet been determined
(the Turkish follow-up is being continued), but if the pattern established in
the United States holds, one would expect to find that differences begin to
appear again over the years.<p>
<p>
     <i>Social behavior, self-concept, and school adjustment</i> .  Information is
thin regarding differences in the social and personal adjustment of school
children as related to their participation in an intervention program during
the pre-school years, particularly in the Latin American studies.  The
Guatemalan nutrition study demonstrated that program children who received high
caloric supplementation from birth to age 2 years had higher levels of social
involvement than unsupplemented children.  The CADEL evaluation in Chile did
not find a difference.<p>
<p>
     Outside Latin America, the Turkish study found that adjustment was better
among children whose mothers had participated in a parental training program,
but there was no difference in adjustment according to whether or not a child
had been in a preschool center or not.  The Philippine study found significant
differences in the social adjustment of children who had come from the Early
Childhood Enrichment Program, as compared with those who had not.  Both Indian
studies indicated better deportment among program children than among
non-program children. <p>
<p>
     With the accumulation of evidence that has appeared over the last 10 to 15
years, the main question no longer is whether effects on the development of
children and on their "readiness" for school can be obtained, or even whether
it is possible to improve school performance as a result of early
interventions.  More important are the following questions:<p>
<p>
     &#149;    Who benefits from intervention programs?<p>
<p>
&#149;In what kinds of programs and under what conditions do effects occur (the
expected results do not always occur)? and <p>
<p>
     &#149;    At what cost?<p>
<p>
     <i>Which children benefit most?</i>   Let us consider three characteristics of
children that might be associated with differential outcomes: gender, age, and
socio-economic circumstances.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Gender</i>.  Are programs equally effective for girls and boys?  In
the Latin American studies cited above, there does not appear to be a
significant difference between boys and girls in the effect of programs on
readiness for school, measured in different ways.  Although there may be
particular conditions and outcome measures for which there is a difference,
this is not a common occurrence.  In at least one study (Klein, 1979), it was
found that the expectations of parents regarding the education of their female
children were raised considerably so that the program resulted in increased
school attendance for girls, but this was not linked to a difference in the
direct effects of the program on boys and girls.  In other parts of the world,
it may be that differential effects, favoring girls who are more disadvantaged,
will be more prominent (e.g., Lal and Wati, 1986).<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Age.</i>  One of the dimensions of the program framework presented
earlier was an age dimension linked to developmental changes through which a
young child passes.  Are interventions more effective for younger (before age
3) or "older" (ages 3 to 6) children?<p>
<p>
     Evidence suggests that important advances in early development, building
toward readiness for school and life's many demands, can result from programs
at any and all of the different age levels.  At each developmental stage,
different activities are required and different results expected, making
comparisons difficult.  It is difficult, also, to make links between
interventions in the very early years (0 to 3) and progress and performance in
schools because other factors intervene.  It is difficult, therefore, to say
that investment in a program directed to any one age will be more effective or
more beneficial than at another.  From a broad developmental standpoint, and
thinking in terms of life skills and of prevention rather than of "cure," a
strong case can be made for earlier rather than later interventions, but hard
program evidence to sustain this position is scarce.        <p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Social and/or economic disadvantage</i>.  Are preschool programs only
for the advantaged who already have a certain base for learning and therefore
will be able to benefit?  Or can disadvantaged children also benefit?<p>
<p>
     The Head Start program in the United States took its clue from research
indicating that disadvantaged children could benefit from early interventions
(Hunt, 1961; Bloom, 1964).  Evidence from the evaluations of US programs
strongly bears out that position (Berruta-Clement, et. al., 1984; Lazar and
Darlington, 1982).  And yet there is a tendency in some countries and
organizations to shy away from early education programs as general social
investments because they are thought to benefit mainly the rich.  <p>
<p>
<p>
     This crucial point turns on differences that are related to biases in present
program coverage and quality that too often favor the already favored.  For
instance, a recent article reporting results from Thailand (Raudenbush,
Kidchanapanish and Kang, 1991) suggests that the pre-primary sector there
magnifies rather than reduces differences between the advantaged and
disadvantaged in educational attainment because: 1) pre-primary programs are
found disproportionately in urban areas and 2) programs for the more
disadvantaged sectors tended to be of a lower quality.  It is important not to
take this description of the <b>actual</b> situation, with its biases, as
indicative of the <b>potential</b> relative effects of early interventions on
different economic or social groups of children.  Indeed, the article concludes
that,<p>
<p>
 "... these data ... suggest that student achievement can be boosted by
expanding access to pre-primary schools or by increasing the duration and
instructional effectiveness of existing pre-primary programs.  We expect that
such changes, <b>if targeted to rural areas, and areas with large poverty
concentrations</b>, would also reduce inequalities in the distribution of
student achievement."  (p. 271, emphasis added)<p>
<p>
     There is evidence from Latin America (Filp, et.al., 1983; Myers, et.al, 1985)
that children who are at a disadvantage can not only benefit, but that they may
be able to benefit even more than their more privileged peers from programs of
early childhood development.  This idea is supported by findings from other
parts of the World (e.g., India - Lal and Wati, 1986).<p>
<p>
     In brief, if a goal of early education programs is to help to even out social
differences, then extra care must be taken to be sure that programs are
directed specifically to disadvantaged groups.  And, care must also be taken to
see that the quality of the programs provided is good.<p>
<p>
     <i>Program Characteristics?</i>   In general, the evidence is strongest for
smaller experimental programs, suggesting that more intensive, "hot house"
treatment produce the best results.  The smaller more experimental programs are
characterized by:  higher quality, more intensive inputs, and a multi-faceted
approach.<p>
<p>
     But improved readiness is found also in evaluations of larger scale
interventions such as the PRONOEI in Peru (Myers, et.al., 1985) and the
Colombian home day care program (ICBF, 1990).  These are public programs that
are not of as high quality as most pilot programs, and they are run by
para-professionals with relatively little training.  And both involve a
reasonable level of community participation.  <p>
<p>
     Evidence from the Third World does not allow us to say much about the effect
of different curricula that are being used in early education programs.
Evidence from the United States and England suggests that the specific
curriculum used is not the most important variable as long as the application
is consistent and of good quality.  In a study by Osborn and Milbank, the
authors concluded that, "...provided the child receives proper care, has
interesting activities and other children to play with (which are common
elements in the majority of preschool institutions) the actual type of
preschool experiences matters very little," (1987, p. 239). <p>
<p>
     <i>Program cost.</i>   Only rarely have effects been related directly to costs
in a way that would allow informed judgements about the cost-effectiveness of
programs.  We have argued elsewhere (see "The Eleven Who Survive") that because
early childhood development programs have such different goals and apply such
different methods, most cost comparisons between programs are misleading.  We
have argued also that the cost of early childhood programs can be low.  For
instance, the cost per child per month to the government of the home day care
program in Colombia is estimated at about US$13, or about $156 per year.  This
compares with a minimum salary figure of about $110 and a GNP per capita of
about US$1200.<p>
<p>
     In study of the Peruvian PRONOEI, the per child per year cost (covered by
governmental and international resources) in the state of Puno was about US$28.
If that is compared with the prevailing minimum wage at the time, the cost is
about 1/14th of a minimum wage.  If we make the comparison with the GNP per
capita, the costs ratio is about 1 to 40. <p>
<p>
     However, the main point is not how low the cost of a program can be; rather it
is how effective a program is for a given cost in a particular setting.  In the
case of the PROAPE project in Brazil, the reduction in school repetition
associated with participation in the project was costed.  When that was done,
it was found that:<p>
<p>
"The total cost of schooling (including preschool PROAPE services) per second
grade graduate was about US$50 (or 11 percent) less for students who had been
in the PROAPE program than for those who and not been in PROAPE."  (Berg, p.
58)<p>
<p>
     Another evaluation of the same program (the evaluation included in Tables 1
and 2) it was found that:<p>
<p>
  "The average cost per child of producing a first grade graduate is at least
US$41 less for PROAPE children than for children without preschooling.  This
per child savings is higher than the PROAPE cost of US$28.  In these terms, the
PROAPE program not only paid for itself but resulted in a primary school cost
saving in the first year over and above the cost of PROAPE."  (Calculations
presented in Myers, 1992, based on Ministerio da Saude, 1983)<p>
<p>
     <b>Effects on Caregivers and Families</b> <p>
<p>
     Most early childhood programs fail in their evaluations to consider benefits
that accrue to caregivers and family members other than young children as a
result of participation in the program.  However, these benefits can be large
and important from both personal and social standpoints.  They include changes
in skills and abilities (which can be more generally applied), changes in
confidence, a sense of personal satisfaction, and changes in employment and/or
productivity.<p>
<p>
     An example of these kinds of changes comes from Turkey and the project
described in Appendix A.  In this case, the mothers who participated in the
training program were more optimistic and likely to share in decisions and
activities with their spouses.  This change was evident when a comparison was
made to their previous outlooks and actions, and when program mothers were
compared with those who had not participated. (Kagitcibasi, 1987)<p>
     <b>Effects on Communities</b> <p>
<p>
     <i>Social organization</i> .  Many examples can be cited of cases in which
programs of early childhood care and development have brought major
improvements in community organization.  This is often a result of the need to
organize some kind of committee in the community to oversee the program.<p>
<p>
     &#149;In Peru, in the PRONOEI program, parents committees provided a new
opening for the participation of women in community activities (even though it
did not change the underlying social structure in the community).  <p>
<p>
     &#149;In Northern Colombia, dramatic changes occurred in communities along the
coast as an early childhood program took shape. (Chetley, 1991)<p>
<p>
     <i>Services</i> .  When health services or agricultural services, or
sanitation arrangements are strengthened in a community as a result of actions
motivated by a desire to improve early childhood development, the results will
be of benefit to the community as a whole, not just to the children.  This
point may seem obvious but is often overlooked, in part because early childhood
development programs are defined narrowly as education programs for young
children rather than in the broader integrated perspective we have taken in
this paper.<p>
<p>
     &#149;In the PROMESA project in isolated communities along Colombia's Pacific
coast, a host of nutrition- and health-related activities were carried out
under the project, both at the initiative of the community participants and as
a result of attracting government services to the communities.<p>
<p>
     <i>Employment</i> .  Early childhood programs can provide employment in
communities, not only to the specific people who care for the children, but
also through the procurement arrangements that are set up on relation to the
program.  Perhaps the best example of this comes from the Colombian program of
home day care in which there now 50,000 women employed to operate the centers
in their own homes.  <p>
<p>
     <b>Effects on Institutions</b> <p>
<p>
     <i>Efficiency</i> .  It should be clear from the above description of the
differences in age at entrance and in promotion and repetition rates that early
childhood programs can have a marked effect on the efficiency with which school
systems operate.<p>
<p>
     <i>Effectiveness</i> .  Similarly, the effectiveness of institutions seems to
be enhanced in many cases because the performance of children is higher in
those schools.  The idea that better prepared children will enhance school
effectiveness is slowly being recognized. <p>
<p>
     <b>Social and Economic Effects</b> <p>
     <i>Narrowing social gaps</i> .  It would be too much to expect that early
childhood programs can have a major impact on existing social gaps.  However,
in combination with other programs it does seem clear that such programs can
help to moderate differences.  Some evidence to that effect was provided above,
with respect to socio-economic status, caste, and gender.<p>
<p>
     <i>Fertility</i> .  To the extent that early education leads to improved
levels of education, particularly among women, it will have an
inter-generational effect also on the number of children born, given the well
established relationship between women's educational level and fertility.<p>

<p>
<b>VI.  TOWARDS A CHILD DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY FOR LATIN
AMERICA</b><p>
<p>
<p>
     <b>Cautions</b> <p>
<p>
     As individual countries as well agencies such as the World Bank contemplate
setting a child development policy, several cautions should be noted:<p>
<p>
     &#149;As mentioned previously in this paper, first, there is a need to
emphasize the integrated development of children leading to their stable
socialization and their ability to cope with new situations (including the
school) rather than focus on making a child ready for school in a narrow sense.
Second, one should beware the temptation to think of early education and child
development only, or even primarily, in terms of support for formal preschool
projects and programs.<p>
<p>
     &#149;While it is important to attend to quality, it may be counter-productive
to insist on standards that are so high that they undercut worthwhile
initiatives that do not meet the high standards.  For example, setting high
certification standards for preschool teachers may improve the quality of early
education, but may also prevent many talented and capable individuals from
working with young children in less formal early childhood programs.<p>
<p>
     &#149;Beware projects that are too centralized.  If projects are centrally
directed, the possibility of real and continuous participation by communities
is drastically reduced as is the possibility of meaningful adjustment to local
cultural differences.  <p>
     &#149;Think long term.<p>
<p>
     <b>Components for a Strategy for Latin America</b> <p>
<p>
     The most important component in a strategy for investing in childhood
development in Latin America is to expand and strengthen such programs based on
the child and parent centered approach described above; and to integrate such
concerns into other education, health, and multi-sectoral programs.  The other
key elements of a strategy are to emphasize training and communications, to
encourage collaborative arrangements between government, NGOs and communities,
and to support evaluation and research.  These strategies are further
elaborated below:<p>
<p>
<b>Expanding and Strengthening Initial Education Programs Based on Sustainable
and Effective Models</b> .<p>
<p>
     <i>Center-based programs of integrated attention to the young child</i>  in
the years 0-6 should be supported.  As indicated earlier program examples and
models include:<p>
<p>
     &#149;The community-based and predominantly rural PRONOEIs in Peru (30
children with one promotor chosen by the community, assisted by mothers who
cook morning snack).<p>
 <p>
     &#149;The PROAPE model in Brazil (100 children attended by a formally trained
pre-school person assisted by 6 parents of participating children on a rotating
basis).<p>
<p>
     &#149;Home day-care centers in Colombia (see box number 1).<p>
<p>
<b>Box </b>1   The Colombian program of "Homes for Well-Being" is a
community-based, non-formal program providing attention to children ages one to
seven by community day care mothers in groups of up to 15 children.  Since its
inception in 1986, the program has expanded to cover (1991) approximately
800,000 children, with a target of 1.5 million children.  Care is usually for 8
hours per day in the home of the day care mother and consists of providing
children with the conditions necessary to foster their health and their
physical, psychological and social development.  Each community day care mother
receives training in the care and development of children as well as in family
and community relationships and in nutrition and health.  She is assisted, on a
rotating basis, by women whose children are cared for in her home.  Nutritional
supplementation for the children.  Day care mothers are provided with small
loans to be used in upgrading their homes.  <br><br>   Community members
participate in an initial analysis of the communities needs for services,
determines the number of day care homes to be set up and selects local women to
become home day care mothers.  Local management are established which are
responsible for purchases and payments to the community mothers.  Children are
given "scholarships" which are used to pay the home day care mother.<br><br>    A
major share of the funding the coordination of the program falls to the
Colombian Institute of Family Welfare (ICBF), with additional responsibilities
shared with the Ministry of Public Health, the National Apprenticeship Service,
the Institute of Territorial Credit, and other governmental and private
organizations.<br><br>   While meeting directly the care and development needs of
the children, the program seeks also to improve the economic base of a
community by providing paid employment to neighborhood caregivers, by freeing
other women to seek (or upgrade their) employment and by directing funds to
local business for economic activities related to home day care.<br><p>
<p>
     <i>Support should also be provided for parental education programs</i>  that
help parents gain confidence over time and develop skills that will improve
their ability to interact with the child  and lead to more general improvements
in the environment in which a child grows and develops (Bernard van Leer
Foundation, 1986; Myers, 1992, Ch. 7).  Emphasis should be placed on bringing
parents (and other caregivers) together so that they enrich their understanding
and so that they provide support to one another.  This can be done in
conjunction with center-based programs or as a separate activity.  An important
part of such programs may be a social communications component but that
component should not be divorced from group discussion.  Examples:<p>
<p>
     &#149;The PEFADI program in Colombia (in which community promoters call groups
together for discussions based on a set of themes for discussion).<p>
<p>
     &#149;The Peruvian "Portage Project," (a home-visiting model, validated in
both rural and urban areas). <p>
<p>
     &#149;The Mexican program of Parental Education (see box Number 2).<p>
<p>
<b>Box </b>2   In 1982, a national program of non-formal education of parents and
community members was launched by the Secretary of Public Education, oriented
towards low-income families with children ages 0 to 4 residing in poor rural
and urban marginal communities.  The objective of the program is to educate and
"empower" parents to improve their care of, and interaction with, their
children.  On the average, the program has reached about 200,000 children each
year through their parents."<br><br>    The Mexican program of parental education
rests upon a system of successive training in which professionals contracted by
the SEP work together with state personnel to train supervisors who in turn
train up to ten module supervisors, who then train and supervise up to 10 local
promoters, or "community educators."  The community educator, works with groups
of 20 parents, organizing a group orientation at the outset and 40 group
meetings during the year during which parents discuss ideas presented in a
"Parents Guide."  Group meetings are backed by periodic home visits.  Community
educators are "volunteers" who live in the community and who rely on the
community for organization and support and who are given a gratuity for their
service.<br><br>    In 1992, conversations are being held between the Mexican
Government and the World Bank to work out a loan that would strengthen and
extend this program.<br><p>
<p>
     <b>Integrating Initial Education into School Programs</b> <p>
<p>
     <i>A child-to-child component</i>  could be included in primary education
programs.  In this type of program, primary school children (who will all too
soon be parents) are provided, through the curriculum, with information about
health, nutrition, and psycho-social development of young children which they
apply in working with (playing with) younger, pre-school aged children.<p>
<p>
<b>Box </b>3   The Jamaican Child-to-child program, directed to children ages 9
to 12, who are often, at one and the same time, caretakers of younger siblings,
future parents, communicators of information to their parents and other
caregivers, and community members capable of improving conditions affecting
survival and development.<br><br>  The program began on an experimental basis in
1979 in one rural primary school, at the initiative of the Tropical Metabolism
Research Unit of the University of the West Indies.  It was then extended to 14
schools and an evaluation was carried out which showed the program to be
effective and well-received.  Children improved significantly in their
knowledge of all areas covered by the program.  In addition, the knowledge of
parents improved as did their encouragement and support of play with younger
children.  Teachers also imported their knowledge of health and development and
were introduced to new forms of teaching.  Subsequently, child-to-child methods
and material have been incorporated into the regular primary school curriculum
for the entire country.<br><br>    The child-to-child curriculum provides
information about health, nutrition, psycho-social development and dental care.
Among other things, children are taught how to encourage a younger child
development through attention to health and nutrition and through play.  An
action-oriented curriculum includes role play, group discussions,
demonstrations, toy-making, drama and song.  Most of what is imparted in a
child-to-child program was already contained in a primary school curriculum.
However, the Jamaican program showed that adding some emphasis, relating the
knowledge to activities, and presenting materials in a new, interesting and
participatory way can bring major benefits.<br><p>
<p>
     <i>Literacy and adult education programs</i> .  The content of literacy
programs can be directed in part toward topics that will affect the development
of very young children.  The fact that a large number of participants in
literacy programs are women, to whom societies continue to assign the primary
role in caregiving, makes this approach even more attractive.<p>
<p>
     Parental education programs could be funded either under "initial education"
as presented above, or could be funded as a part of adult education programs.<p>
<p>
     <i>Teacher training</i> .  Within programs of support to improve the quality
of teacher training, an early education component could be included to improve
the professional capacity of early educators and to provide them with an
orientation to non-formal as well as formal programs.  In some cases, the
teacher training begins (or even ends) in secondary school.  One line of
activity in these programs could be an early education line (as is done in
China, for instance).<p>
<p>
     <i>Technical training</i> .  Most technical training programs are thought of
in terms of employment and of skills that contribute directly to improving the
ability to work in such fields as carpentry or computer programming.  These
programs are justified in terms of their potential contribution to production
and in terms of their employment potential.  Less attention has been given to
skills that might be used in services that are related to the production of
human resources.  The opening market for early childhood care and development
in many places (including home day care centers formed as part of a large
public program or as a private initiative) suggests a line of technical
training that could be considered in technical training loans.<p>
<p>
     <b>Integrating Initial Education into Health, Nutrition, and Multi-Sectoral
Programs</b> <p>
<p>
     With the broader definition of survival that is evolving and with the
increasing attention being given to growth and psycho-social development, it
makes sense to consider ways in which child development can be incorporated
into on-going health and nutrition programs.  Usually, this means incorporating
a piece that will strengthen attention to psycho-social development because
physical development is already being attended to in such programs.  The
process of integrating this component into health and nutrition is not likely
to cost a great deal.  This very fact may mean it is overlooked when, at a low
marginal cost, it could improve attention to physical health as well as improve
the general welfare of the child.<p>
<p>
     <i>Programs focussing on improvement of health services</i> .  <p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Training</i>.  Perhaps the most important way in which a broad view
of child development (including mental, social and emotional as well as
physical development), can be incorporated into health programs is by
reorienting the training of personnel.  In many health loans, a training
component is included.  Attention should be given to ways in which training
curricula, materials and contracted staff can include a psycho-social
developmental component.  Experience in Thailand could be used as a model.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Maternal and Child Health Care.</i>  MCH programs often do, but
always should, include attention to the psycho-social well-being of mothers and
children.  The periods of pregnancy and lactation are two periods when women
not only need medical supervision and advice, but also need strong social and
psychological support.  These are also times when women, and families are very
open to learning about child care and development.  Examples of specific
activities include:<p>
<p>
     &#149;Introducing the monitoring of psycho-social health into the general
process of monitoring health and nutrition and into statistics that are
produced as a result.  (This is being done in Chile and in Colombia)<p>
     &#149;Introduce measures that facilitate the early interaction and attachment
of the child to the mother, at birth and in the neo-natal period.  This may
involve simple inclusion of information about the nature of the child at birth
(e.g., the state of development of its senses) or the use of the Brazleton
technique for evaluating babies, with mothers present (as was done in Venezuela
within the Proyecto de la Familia), so they can see the possibilities open for
interaction, or it may mean considering a reorientation of current birthing
practices that do not permit immediate contact of the mother and the baby. <p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Health Education.</i>  Health education takes many programmatic forms
and is carried out in hospitals and primary health care centers, in schools and
programs of adult education, and with the population at large through campaigns
using the mass media.  Care should be taken to see that health education
includes a psycho-social component as well as information about how to avoid or
treat diseases.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Home visiting.</i>  In places where a home visiting system is being
developed or is in place, the psycho-social development component can be
incorporated into the work of the health visitor or promotor.  This need not be
done initially because it can over-burden a health worker at the outset, but as
a visitor becomes more familiar with what needs to be done, it is possible to
include an orientation to mental and social development into the visitor's
routine.  Jamaica provides an example of this approach.<p>
<p>
     <i>Programs focussing on nutrition.</i><p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Food supplementation.</i>  When considering the delivery mechanism to
be used for providing food supplementation to young children, it may be
possible (and advisable) to consider delivery in relation to existing programs
of child care or early education.  In the CEAPE and PROAPE projects in Brazil,
an early education structure was created that would provide integrated
attention to children, but the point of departure for the projects and the
related loans was improving the nutritional condition of children.  Similarly,
the present program in Colombia for improvement of day care homes is
fundamentally a nutrition loan concerned with how food is provided to the
children in the program.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Growth monitoring.</i>  When nutrition programs support a growth
monitoring activity, it is possible to incorporate a psycho-social component
into such programs, taking advantage of the fact that caregivers gather
together periodically for weighing.  In Indonesia, this has been done and is
supported by a home visiting program as well.<p>
&#149;    <i>Nutrition education.</i>  Another component included in some
nutrition programs is nutrition education.  For the most part, nutrition
education focusses on diet, i.e., on what children should be fed.  However,
feeding should be treated as a social process as well and attention should be
given to how children are fed.  In so doing, a psycho-social component
affecting development would be incorporated into nutrition.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Promotion of breastfeeding and proper weaning.</i>  In breastfeeding,
a natural combination of a nutritional and psycho-social action occurs.  Both
of these features can be promoted; campaigns that might be funded within a loan
agreement should include information about the importance of breastfeeding in
the process of developing emotional security as well as in gaining weight and
preventing disease.<p>
<p>
     <i>Social development or other multi-sectoral programs</i>.  It may be easier
to integrate various components affecting early childhood development into
programs that are not attached directly to education or health or nutrition.
For instance:<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Social development programs.</i>  Providing funding for early
childhood attention within social development programs, as has occurred in
Venezuela.  Here, the support was related to improvements in the "targeting" of
food support and to improvements in the quality of both formal and non-formal
preschool options.<p>
<p>
&#149;    <i>Urban and Social Development.</i>  Urban development programs, day
care facilities and related expenses.  However, a broader view might be taken
in which integrated attention to children, directed at improvements in their
survival, growth and development could provide  an "entry point" for activities
that would be of benefit to urban communities at large.  The same comment made
for loans focussing on cities can be applied to rural development.  Rural
extension services can play an important role in early childhood development
through their home-visiting programs and home economics branches.  The
Philippines provides an example within its Early Childhood Enrichment Project.
<p>
<p>
<b>Box </b>4<b>Thailand</b>: Integrated Nutrition and Community Development
Project.  Analyses by the ministry of health in Thailand pointed to three major
constraints to significant reduction in the level of protein energy
malnutrition in infants and preschool children; 1) the inadequate coverage of
the health system, 2) the lack of community awareness of the problem, and 3)
the inadequate multi-sectoral input to the nutrition program.  Accordingly, the
government, in 1979, introduced a program of community-based primary health
care together with a program of growth monitoring, accompanied by a
supplementary food program and nutrition education, all within a national plan
for poverty alleviation.  Within this broad framework, the Institute of
Nutrition of Mahidol university carried out a nutrition education project that
was directed toward families with the most vulnerable infants and preschoolers.
An important part of that nutrition education was a psycho-social component
focussing on caregiver-child interactions and on improvements in the physical
and social environment surrounding the child.<br><br>  As a basis for the
project, childrearing attitudes and practices were studied and a number of
nutritional practices and social taboos were discovered that were not
beneficial to the child.  For instance, a misbelief about colostrum and early
suckling was associated with failure to begin breastfeeding immediately
following birth.  In addition it was found that few mothers recognized the
visual or auditory capacities of a baby at birth.  Babies were kept for long
hours in closed cradles.  Mothers displayed little awareness of their own
capacity to make a difference.<br><br>  With these practices in mind, a series
of five interactive videos was created, one of which was specifically oriented
toward creating maternal awareness of her child as an individual with early
perceptual ability and at recognizing the importance of play and mother-child
interaction in that play as well as in feeding.  Health communicators in each
village, who also served as distributors of food, were trained in the use of
the videos which were presented several times in each village.<br><br>     On the
basis of interviews with mothers of the under-two children, and of observations
in the home, evaluators of the project concluded that maternal knowledge and
attitudes improved as a result of the process.  Also, more colostrum was given.
More open cradles were found.  Mothers recognized sensory abilities in their
children.<br><br>   The results suggest that visual messages provided in a way
that permits discussion can bring about significant changes in childrearing
practices and attitudes.  The project also illustrates how both nutrition and
psycho-social education components can be incorporated into a national program
of growth monitoring and targeted supplementary feeding, using a method that
does not depend on literacy and taking into account local practices.<br><p>
<p>
<p>
     <b>Emphasizing Training and Communication Strategies</b> <p>
<p>
     <i>Training</i> .  Training is crucial to reorient many individuals and
institutions to a broader, more integrated view, as well as to provide project
implementors with higher level skills.  Providing support for training at
initial stages in the development of an early childhood program carries with it
the advantage of avoiding support for recurrent expenses that a government
will, later, have to pick up (but may not be willing or able to do) from its
own budget when the loan period is completed.  This report does not try here to
detail the many forms of training that might be incorporated into a program.
These will obviously vary with the context and with the nature of the
project.<p>
  <p>
     <i>Communications</i> .  It has been increasingly common to point to the
important role that the mass media can play in programs of many kinds,
including those directed toward improving early childhood development.  Indeed,
a communications program, including use of the mass media, but calling also on
many traditional forms of communication, will be important in many early
childhood development projects.  Communications strategies will be part of the
general process of creating awareness in the public at large and among those
concerned with the project, and as part of the specific process of educating
parents and other caregivers.   <p>
<p>
     What remains to be understood when considering communications approaches is
that<p>
<p>
 "....even where the mass media are culturally relevant -- and in much of Latin
America this is far from being the case -- individuals exposed to this approach
remain passive receivers rather than active participants.  The phenomenon then
becomes a new version of the 'opiate of the masses' in <b>telenovela</b> form."
(Bernard van Leer Foundation, 1986)<p>
<p>
     Rather, the communications media, of all kinds, should serve as a support to
educators and promoters, helping them carry out a strategy of working in
groups, with parents, and other caregivers and interested members of the
community, to create awareness, impart and exchange knowledge, and build
organization transcending the particular topic and project and helping to giver
permanence to actions taken within the project.   <p>
<p>
     As with training, this report does not pretend to enter here into a detailed
discussion of the many possible methods that might be used in the course of
carrying out such a communications strategy.<p>

Organizations (NGO) and Communities</b> <p>

     In most places, governments will have great difficulty reaching all parts of
the country and all groups with projects or programs of child care and
development.  Moreover, programs that are run by governments (even at state or
district levels) tend to be top-down, top-heavy programs with relatively little
flexibility to adjust to local situations and with little ability to foster
real participation and management within local communities.  In the long run
local communities must take on a coordinating and sustaining role.<p>
<p>
     Non-governmental organizations often (not always) have a greater ability than
governments to accompany communities in developing the organizational
structures and processes that will allow a project to be sustained once special
inputs have been provided at an early stage to get the project going.  NGOs
tend to be more flexible and to respond to the local traditions and
circumstances of particular communities.  These are particularly important
skills when working with early childhood development.<p>
<p>
     For these reasons, one element in a child development strategy is to foster
collaborations between governments and NGOs.  This might occur in a number of
ways, depending on the local conditions and the respective management abilities
of both governments and the NGOs in question.   In some cases, arrangements
might be sought in which funds for agencies like the World Bank would be
transferred directly to NGOs, with, of course, proper agreements beforehand
about how these funds would be used and about accounting procedures.  In other
cases, the government might keep more direct control over funds, but contract
NGOs for particular program tasks or for work in particular areas.<p>
<p>
<p>
     <b>Supporting Evaluation and Research</b> <p>
<p>
     This paper has presented results from a range of evaluations of early
childhood development programs carried out in Latin America and elsewhere.
However, the number of solid, well designed evaluations is not very high,
particularly in light of the wide variety of types of early childhood projects
and programs that are, and can be carried out.  Moreover, many of the
evaluations that have been done are evaluations of smaller pilot or
demonstration programs in which the conditions for success are relatively good.
These help to make the argument that positive results are possible, but we need
a much greater knowledge base to answer questions about who benefits most from
what types of programs under what conditions and at what cost, and particularly
as programs "go to scale."<p>
<p>
     With its technical capacity and its ability to provide funding in areas that
governments might not normally include in a project, the World Bank is in a
particularly good position to make an important contribution to the field of
early childhood development by supporting sound evaluations of the projects
being supported with Bank loans.  Such evaluations would serve the purposes of
the borrowing countries by facilitating adjustments of programs along the way
and providing a firmer basis for their own decisions about programs and budgets
once the Bank's loan has run its course.  They would also allow the Bank to
fulfill its responsibility in monitoring the loans. <p>
<p>
     The Bank is also in a position to fund particular research studies that will
strengthen the knowledge base within the field.  Here we will make reference to
two areas that are in need of funding but which would produce important
results.<p>
<p>
     <i>Longitudinal studies</i>  are needed within various locations in the Third
World that either corroborate or modify conclusions flowing presently from
longitudinal studies in the United States and Europe.  These longitudinal
studies might be started within program evaluations.  However, to serve their
purpose, they should be carried beyond the normal 5-year life of a project
loan.  This may require a special arrangement.  In addition, it would be
necessary from the outset of the evaluation to assure that comparative groups
are established in a way that it is possible to control for a range of
non-project variables when judging outcomes.  <p>
<p>
     <i>Instruments and measures</i>  of a child's developmental status that are
appropriate to the particular countries in which they are to be used are
missing in most locations.  Creating such instruments, validating them and
establishing norms should be a high priority in order for countries to be able
to monitor the psycho-social components of child development as they now
monitor physical development through indicators of health and nutritional
status.<p>
<p>
     <i>Innovative financing schemes should be studied</i> .  The ability of
governments to finance programs has been a stumbling block to growth for early
childhood development, as for other fields in the social arena.  There are,
however, innovative methods of financing that have been applied with apparent
success over the years or that are now emerging.  These need to be examined for
their possible application in other countries and for the general lessons that
can be learned with respect to their application.<p>
<p>
     <b>An Organizational Strategy for the World Bank</b> <p>
<p>
     As the World Bank, and particularly the Latin American Departments, consider
what steps to take to strengthen programs of early childhood care, development
and education, several organizational considerations should be addressed.<p>
<p>
     <i>Organizational policy</i> .  An official document should be written
reviewing policy options and outlining a strategy for investing in the integral
development of children during their preschool years.  Discussion of such a
document would create awareness within the organization and would legitimate
work in the area while providing some technical and strategic guidelines.  The
starting point for the document might be the Declaration and Plan of Action of
the World Conference on Education for All.  However, if that is so, care should
be taken not to restrict consideration to the education sector, leading to our
next point.<p>
<p>
     <i>Integration</i> .  The need to work in a multi-sectoral manner when dealing
with early childhood care, development and learning needs to be confronted and
organizational devices created to facilitate the needed collaboration.  At a
minimum, an organizational mechanism needs to be created to provide information
across sectoral lines as projects are being developed within any one sector.
Particular attention needs to be given to coordination between nutrition and
education programs.  As will be suggested below, this may require locating
projects dealing with the early years within social development projects that,
by their nature combine sectoral concerns, rather than within education or
nutrition or health.  In sectoral projects there is an overbearing tendency to
focus exclusively on one component.  This is reinforced by bureaucratic
divisions and turf battles in the countries with whom the Bank works.<p>
<p>
     <i>Guidelines</i> .  Within education, and in other sectors, guidelines for
sector analyses and project identification exercises need to be re-examined and
rewritten to incorporate explicit attention to early childhood development and
education in its various dimensions.  The result should establish guidelines
with respect to the organizational processes, but should also attempt to
specify characteristics of projects that would be given priority.  The seven
criteria for judging programs set out in the Framework presented on p.   of
this paper might provide a starting point for such a discussion. <p>
<p>
     <i>In-house capacity</i> .  To help determine organizational policy, set
guidelines, and promote integrated programs, the Bank's own capacity to work in
this area needs to be strengthened.  Although considerable work can be carried
out using consultants and in collaboration with such other organizations as
UNICEF, an in-house capacity is needed to help bring people together from
different program sectors to formulate policy, to help locate and supervise
technical assistance, and to provide technical guidance.  The in-house capacity
for analysis, monitoring and evaluation of integrated early childhood should be
improved.  This strengthening should occur in the Human Resources Divisions of
technical departments and in the Population and Human Resources Department.<p>
<p>
     <i>Collaboration</i> .  With the strengthening of an in-house capacity, the
Bank will be in a much better position to seek out and make use of arrangements
with other international organizations that have developed experience in this
field.  First among those organizations is UNICEF.  In addition, the long term
experience of the Bernard van Leer Foundation might be tapped.  As programs are
developed, it would be useful as well in some settings to look to the
experience of such international non-governmental organizations as
Save-the-Children, The Christian Children's Fund, or Plan International. <p>

<b>APPENDIX A: CASE STUDIES</b><p>
<p>
<b>COLOMBIA: The PROMESA Project</b> <p>
<p>
     The PROMESA project, designed to develop a better environment for the healthy
development of young children, began in 1978 in four rural and isolated
communities in the impoverished Choc&oacute; Region on Colombia's Pacific
coast.  Over the years, the project evolved to include:<p>
<p>
     &#149;a program for mothers of preschool children designed to foster the
intellectual development of children 3 to 7 years old during their daily
interactions with the children and through the use of games.<p>
<p>
     &#149;a series of projects to improve the physical environment by building
latrines, disposing of garbage, draining stagnant water, controlling animals
and finding sources of good water.<p>
<p>
     &#149;a community-administered Primary Health Care program to overcome lack of
a doctor.<p>
<p>
     &#149;training of "promoters" as a way of developing local leaders.<p>
<p>
     &#149;adult education and vocational training to improve income-generating
skills as well as formation of production and marketing groups.<p>
<p>
     &#149;an early stimulation program for mothers of 0- to 3-year old.<p>
<p>
     &#149;a nutrition program, providing food to preschoolers and nutrition
education to mothers.<p>
<p>
     In 1986, the effect of the project on school achievement of participating
children using a "cohort design."  With such a design, <p>
<p>
"...the children came from the same population and were only different in their
ages.  Thus, if the program was effective in giving the younger children more
opportunities to learn, then each year, the children in the first grade should
test somewhat better than those children who were in the first grade the
previous year.  This should be true throughout the elementary school as the
project progressed..." (p. 7)<p>
<p>
     Three related achievement tests were developed: one for the first grade, one
for the second and third grades, and one for the fourth and fifth grades, each
with subtests on mathematics, language and problem solving.  These tests were
administered each year from 1980 through 1985.  Children in a public school of
a blue collar neighborhood (Sabeneta) of the Colombian City, Medellin, were
also tested, to provide comparative baseline data.<p>
     In general, the hypothesized improvement in academic achievement occurred over
time.<p>
<p>
"The mathematics, language and problem solving scores for the first grade
[went] . . . from significantly below the Sabaneta group to being on a par with
that group.  . . . the same pattern holds for all five years." (p. 8)<p>
<p>
     A graph illustrating the changes in mean scores at the first grade level is
presented in Figure 3.  The shaded area represents one standard deviation on
either side of the urban childrens' mean score in the first grade.  The white
areas represent one standard deviation on either side of the mean test score
for rural project children.  In 1980, the two means were five points apart; in
1985, rural children had caught up to the 1980 norm.  We do not know from the
study whether the mean for urban children changed from 1980 to 1985.<p>

<p>
<p>
     Persistence in school was studied using information from a sample of mothers
from the project communities who were interviewed in 19809 and in 1986.  (The
evaluation does not report how the sample was chosen.)  In the interviews, the
name, age, and grade level attained in school for each child in the family was
obtained.  From this listing, twelve-year old were selected out for study
because they were old enough to have completed the elementary school and young
enough in 1986 to have been involved in PROMESA.  The comparisons, presented in
Table 3, show that school enrollment and persistence is significantly higher
for PROMESA participants than for others, a strong finding given the high
probability of contamination effects for the non-PROMESA children.  We do not
know, however, how PROMESA children may differ from non-PROMESA children.<p>

<b>TURKEY</b> <p>
<p>
     The purpose of this action research project, carried out over a four-year
period by Kagitcibasi and colleagues (1987), was to study the impact on the
overall development of the child of educational preschool care combined with a
program of parental education and support.   Effects of this optimal
combination were compared with effects of custodial child care and home care,
each taken alone and in combination with parental education.  Accordingly, the
251 children in this project are found in six experimental groups defined by
their preschool environment and by whether or not their mothers received
supplementary support and training:<p>
<p>
  (1) educational preschool with maternal training          [ED-MT]             N = 27<p>
  (2) educational preschool with no maternal training  [ED-NMT]       N = 37<p>
  (3) custodial preschool with maternal training       [CUST-MT]           N = 40<p>
  (4) custodial preschool with no maternal training    [CUST-NMT]     N = 65<p>
  (5) children at home with maternal training          [HOME-MT]      N = 23<p>
  (6) children at home with no maternal training       [HOME-NMT]     N =<u>
59</u><p>
                                             Total   =         251<p>
<p>
Each of these six groups was made up of 3- and 5- year old (132 and 110,
respectively).<p>
<p>
     The project was carried out in five low-income areas of Istanbul with intact
families, most of which were nuclear (74%).  Most mothers (75%) were born in
rural villages or small towns.  The mean years of school attendance by mothers
was 5.4  Two-thirds of the mothers worked, many in factories where the
educational and custodial preschools were located.<p>
<p>
     Educational and custodial preschool environments were chosen from existing
programs on the basis of systematic observations (of centers and teachers), and
of interviews with staff.  Marked differences were evident between preschools
classified as "educational" and as "custodial" -- in staff/child ratios, in
facilities and materials available, and in the approach taken by
teacher-caregivers.  Children were randomly selected from three educational
preschools and three custodial preschools (randomly after dropping out children
from families not intact, children of the wrong age and children who were
recent arrivals at the preschool).  Once the preschool children were selected,
a comparison group of children was located who came from the same neighborhoods
and who matched the preschool children on age, economic, and family criteria
but who did not attend preschool.<p>
<p>
     During <b>year one</b> of the study (1982-83), all mothers were interviewed,
all mother/child dyads were observed at home, all preschool children were
observed and tested at the preschool, and home children were tested at home.
Baseline data included information about mothers' childrearing practices and
patterns and their expectations for their children.  Children were tested using
a wide range of cognitive, personality, and social measures.<p>
<p>
<p>
     During <b>years two and three</b>, mothers of half the children in each
preschool environmental setting were provided with training, through bi-weekly
home visits by trained para-professionals, with group discussions led by
supervising professional staff in alternate weeks.  Cognitive development was
fostered using a Turkish adaptation of HIPPY (Home Intervention Program for
Preschool Youngsters), a home-based enrichment program, with materials provided
for educational activities to improve language, sensory and perceptual
discrimination skills, and problem solving.  Social and personality development
was approached through modelling and discussions of the mother-child
interaction, and by supporting mothers in developing their own feelings of
competence, efficacy and self-confidence.  Beginning with the second year (when
the 5-year-old group entered school), school grades were obtained at the end of
each semester.<p>
<p>
     In the <b>fourth year</b>, children were again observed and tested, and school
achievement data were collected.<p>
<p>
     Over the four years, significant defects of both the educational preschool
environment mother training were found on measures of IQ and other measures of
mental ability and cognitive skills as well as on school achievement.
Preschool environment and home training effects were additive.  Results are
summarized as follows:<p>
<p>
     "The ED [Educational Preschool] group showed a significantly superior
performance on 23 of the measures reported and a non-significant, but positive
trend on five of them.  By contrast, the CUST [Custodial Preschool] group
showed a significantly superior performance on only 3 of the measures, while
the HOME group never had the highest score.  Likewise, the MT [Maternal
Training] group was superior to the NMT [No Maternal Training] group on 12 of
the measures and showed a nonsignificant but positive trend on 15 of them,
while the NMT group was in no case significantly superior." (p. 52)<p>
<p>
     Results for personality and social development were not so clear, with few
statistically significant findings related to preschool environment or to
training.  Bi-modal distributions complicated the interpretation of
autonomy/dependence measures.  There was no difference among groups in school
adjustment.  The MT groups were, however, significantly less aggressive than
the NMT groups.<p>
<p>
     With respect to the mothers:<p>
<p>
     "The mother training program appears to have made a considerable impact on the
mother's style of interaction with the child, leading to a style that is
generally more focussed on the child, more verbal, less punitive, more
cognitively stimulating, and more supportive of the child's developing
autonomy." (p. 61)<p>
<p>
In addition, different outlooks and patterns of family interaction were found
with MT mothers more optimistic and likely to share in decisions and activities
with their spouses.<p>
     Regression analyses were run on the academic average of children, and on their
grades in mathematics and Turkish in the fourth year of the study (third year
of primary for 5-year old and the first year for 3-year old).  The results
indicated that preschool environment, a comparatively high level of
environmental stimulation [as measured by an environmental stimulation index
derived for each home], and the mother's expectation of competence from the
child, are the variables most strongly and consistently related to academic
achievement as reflected in school grades.  (pp. 65-6).<p>

<b>PHILIPPINES: The Early Childhood Enrichment Program</b> <p>
<p>
     The Early Childhood Enrichment Program (ECEP) delivers early childhood
learning opportunities to disadvantaged preschoolers, ages 0 to 6.  The program
was envisioned as an alternative to formal preschool education and a way to
reach out to the 80 percent of the children, 0 to 6, who were not served by any
form of structured early childhood education.  The program was pilot-tested
from 1979-1982 and was implemented nationally beginning in 1983.<p>
<p>
     ECEP sought to maximize the use of existing government and non-governmental
facilities and delivery systems to provide young children with enriching
experiences.  The main implementing organizations were the Department of Social
Welfare and Development (which operates child care centers), and the Bureau of
Agricultural Extension.  These organizations were supported by the Child
Development Center of the University of the Philippines, the Nutrition Center
of the Philippines "Mental Feeding" Program, the Children's Communication
Center, and the Child and Youth Research Center.  Program activities were
coordinated and monitored by an Interagency Committee.  Technical and financial
assistance was provided by the National Economic Development Authority, with
support also from UNICEF.<p>
<p>
     In center-based settings, ECEP was directed toward day care workers and toward
volunteer workers of Rural Improvement Clubs.  Home visits were handled by
social workers or by home management technicians.  Parents were encouraged to
participate through involvement in parental education and through community
projects.  The various education agents and parents were provided with training
and a wide range of materials including a "thinking games" kit, a compilation
of songs, poems and toys for pre-schoolers, books, and a manual for workers and
parents on the effective use of story telling as a medium for early learning.
In the five-year period from 1983 through 1987, it is estimated that 570,000
parents, 4,080 day care workers and 12,000 Rural improvement Club leaders
participated in ECEP.<p>
<p>
     An impact evaluation of the ECEP program was carried out in order to determine
effects of the program during the 1983-1987 period.  The evaluation compared
national samples of children who participated in ECEP (in either the center- or
home-based alternative) with a sample who had not, pre-testing and post-testing
each group.  During the longitudinal study, a third group appeared, of those
children from both groups who entered a formal preschool program.  In addition,
the evaluation questioned parents (180), ECEP workers (60), and community
leaders (124).  An extensive battery of tests and scales was applied to
determine the level of performance or the developmental profile of children.
In addition, some children were followed into primary schools.<p>
<p>
     In general, children who were involved in the ECEP program tested better than
children who had not participated.  For different measures, different modes
seemed to have a greater effect.  For example, children in the home-based ECEP
seemed to develop their motor skills and personal-social behavior more rapidly
whereas center-based programs had a greater effect on cognitive-adaptive
skills.  Children who had participated in early childhood education (including
ECEP and preschools) performed significantly better in Grades I and II.  While
the differences tended to level off in Grade III, the trend still favored those
from early education programs.<p>
<p>
     ECEP workers and parents improved their knowledge, attitudes and practices.
Community leaders were generally aware of the program and supportive, in the
main.<p>
<p>
     The impact evaluation concluded:<p>
<p>
"The results of the impact study of the Early Enrichment Program ...provided
adequate evidence to support the claim that indeed ECEP (whether in the homes
or centers) was worth all the effort and resources poured into it.  Despite the
not-so-orderly fashion of benefits derived from ECEP, it is clear that the
cumulative effects of the program have gone even beyond its immediate
beneficiaries." (Child and Youth Research Center, p. 122)<p>

<sup>2</sup><a name="fn1"></a>     	To be as clear as possible about
child development, as used in this paper, the following characterization is
offered.  Simply stated, child development refers to a process of change in
which children become able to handle ever more complex levels of moving,
thinking, feeling and interacting with people.  Development begins pre-natally
and occurs throughout life.  Development is different from growth; the latter
is characterized by increases in size, the former by changes in complexity or
function.  Development is multi-dimensional: it includes a physical dimension
(the ability to move and coordinate); an intellectual dimension (the ability to
think and reason); a social dimension (the ability to relate to others); and an
emotional dimension (self-confidence and the ability to feel).  These several
dimensions are inter-related and must be considered together.  All children
develop and there is a general sequence of pattern to that development.  But
the rate and character and quality of development will vary from child to child
and from culture to culture.<p>
<sup>3</sup><a name="fn2"></a>     	Although child care programs are
often considered separately from child development or early education programs,
they should be the same in concept.  Child care programs should be more than
custodial and should provide the same kind of stimulation and education that
develop-mentally-oriented programs provide.  All early education programs that
are organized outside the home, per force, have a custodial and child care
dimension which needs to be recognized.<p>

<sup>4</sup><a name="fn3"></a>     	According to statistics from UNICEF,
the IMR rate was 92 per 1000 in 1980, 84/1000 in 1985, and 76/1000 in 1988
(UNICEF, 1988, 1991).  If we project further reductions at a declining rate, it
does not seem out of place to suggest that the actual IMR in 1991, worldwide,
is about 70/1000, or, about 1 in every 14 children.  If one of every 14 dies,
then 13 children (vs. 11 in 1986) manage to live to age one.<p>
<sup>5</sup><a name="fn4"></a>     	For instance, the Netherlands and
UNICEF have concluded a debt buy-back totalling US$6.25 million which will
generate US$13 million in local currencies in Ecuador, Honduras and Jamaica,
with funds earmarked for programs benefitting children.<p>

<sup>7</sup><a name="fn6"></a>     	For instance, UNICEF field offices
are presenting a much greater number of early childhood development initiatives
to the Executive Board in 1992 than in the previous several years.  A full time
program officer has been hired based in New York in order to mount a more
systematic and broader program of integrated child development.  USAID is
actively considering a new early childhood program initiative.  Major NGOs
(Save-the Children and the Christian Childrens' Fund) have given a new place to
early childhood development in their programming.<p>
<sup>8</sup><a name="fn7"></a>     	In all, 35 activities were
identified that provided one of the following: food supplementation, health and
nutrition screening or services, education for pre-schoolers, and creche or
day-care services.  The bulk of these activities were found within Health,
Population and Nutrition (22) and Urban Development (10).  Among the programs
aimed at children, 15 included food supplementation, 20 health/nutrition
screening or services, 5 education for pre-schoolers and 6 creche of day care.
Among programs aimed at caretakers, 4 were training programs, 9 included adult
education on children, and 15 were home visiting programs.  The construction of
child care centers was supported in 14 activities and community centers in 8.<p>
<sup>9</sup><a name="fn8"></a>     	This set of complementary approaches
derives from the ecological model of development presented by Urie
Bronfenbrenner (1979).  In that model, child development is seen as occurring
as a child interacts with the environment at four different levels
corresponding, approximately to the family, the community, social institutions,
and the larger culture or ethos.<p>
<sup>10</sup><a name="fn9"></a>     	In "The Eleven Who Survive," we
examined 18 evaluations of 15 different projects, all but   of which were
carried out in Latin America or the Caribbean.  These projects differed in
their settings, scope, type of delivery, ages of children attended, and stage
of consolidation.  The projects attended to low-income families, included
several components (e.g., health, nutrition and psycho-social components), and
involved some form of community participation. In general, the evaluations
suggested that early interventions can have positive effects on early
development and on the preparation of children for school.  In this paper,
several studies from that earlier set that traced children into primary school
will be put together with others that have come to our attention since, to
examine effects of early intervention on the progress and performance of
children in primary school.

<b>A THEORETICAL BASIS FOR INVESTING IN EARLY CHILD DEVELOPMENT:</b><p>
<b>REVIEW OF CURRENT CONCEPTS</b><p>
	<b>A Rationale for Investing in Early Child Development Programmes (*)</b><p>
<p>
In proposing that international donors and governments turn their attention
towards comprehensive programmes of early child development, a set of
convincing arguments is required.  ECD proponents must recognize the sources of
negativism, disbelief, and skepticism that have previously curtailed
programmatic activity in this field.  Skeptics must be convinced of the
capacity of financially feasible ECD programmes to achieve programme
integration, elicit community support, and provide high quality services to
at-risk children and their families. <p>
<p>
Before turning to the growing body of scientific evidence that powerfully
demonstrates the importance of the early years of a child's life  and the
long-term benefits associated with early intervention programmes, several
compelling lines of social and economic arguments require recognition.  These
include:<p>

<a name="RTFToC1">The
human rights argument.  Children have a right to develop to their full
potential.  Allowing arrested development to occur, when it could be prevented,
violates a basic human right.  The 1959 Declaration of the Rights of the Child
and the 1989 Convention designed to reinforce and extend its principles, are
for many the most convincing and fundamental force supporting early child
development programming.
</a><br><p>
<a name="RTFToC2">The
moral argument.  The transmission of moral and social values that will guide
the future of our children begins in the earliest months of life.  There is a
strong incentive to strengthen such values in societies concerned with the
rapid erosion of traditional values.  Early child development programmes can
assist in that effort by supporting parents and communities, thus providing
environments that reinforce positive cultural values.
</a>

<p>
<p>
<b>III.	The social equity argument. </b> Stressful conditions that inhibit
development in the early years affect the poor more than the rich, reinforcing
social inequities.  The negative outcomes of stressful environments are
cumulative, and poor children fall quickly and progressively behind their more
advantaged peers.  Moreover, in many countries gender-linked disparities in
patterns and practices of childrearing in the early years work against girls'
development and educational opportunities.  Early childhood development
programs have the potential to help correct such discrepancies.<p>
<b>IV.	The economic argument.</b>  Society benefits through increased
productivity and cost savings associated with enhanced early child development.
Preventive programs can produce savings by reducing the need for expensive
curative health care; by improving the efficacy of education systems; by
reducing the rate of drop-out and repetition; and by reducing the incidence of
juvenile delinquency, drug and alcohol abuse, and other forms of harmful social
behaviour.  <p>
<b>V.	The birth-spacing and population argument.  </b>The link between
fertility rates and education levels suggests that efforts to improve the
educational level of girls and women will have a strong intergenerational
effect on fertility.  Early child development programmes, linked to parental
education and increasing girls' school attendance, can play a role in promoting
family planning and the decline of fertility rates.  <p>
<b>VI.	The programmatic argument.  </b>The effectiveness of health, nutrition,
education, and income-generating programmes can be improved through integration
with programmes of child development, thus taking advantage of the interactive
effects among these variables.  Moreover, child development programmes are
often an important entry point for community development activities as well as
an extension for primary health care services.  <p>
<p>
The force of these arguments is strengthened by the negative effects of
worldwide economic recession and changing social conditions, including
increasing child survival and the concomitant need to sustain and support these
gains, increasing female participation in the labor force, rapid urbanization,
and the erosion of stable family-units.  When viewed collectively, these
arguments provide a powerful basis for families, communities, governments,
nongovernmental organizations, and international donor agencies to consider
investing in early child development programmes.  <p>
<p>
The discussion that follows seeks to clarify the scientific basis in support of
increased investments in well-conceived and properly managed early child
development programmes. In this discussion child development encompasses the
unfolding of behaviors from immature to mature; from patterns of behavior that
are simple to those that are complex; and the evolution of a human being from
dependency to autonomous adulthood.  More simply, child development is a
process of change in which the child learns to handle more complex levels of
moving, thinking, feeling, and interacting with people and objects in the
environment.  Early child development refers to the formative early year of the
life cycle-the first six years of life. In this section, the major
developmental tasks and challenges confronting the newborn, infant and
preschool child are highlighted. <p>
 <p>
<p>
<b>Newborn Capacities and Patterns of Early Interaction</b><p>
<p>
Following nine months of growth and maturation in utero, chemical changes
initiate the birth process.  The transition to life outside the mother
fundamentally changes the conditions required for continued development.  Birth
constitutes the first of several major biological-behavioural shifts in
development.  No longer able to receive maternal sources of oxygen and
nutrients to sustain life, the infant must rely on the biological capacities
developed during the prenatal period.  Thus repeats the process in which the
biological forces during conception interact with the culturally organized
environment that awaits the child at birth.  <p>
<p>
Contrary to common wisdom of earlier decades, modern research has demonstrated
the remarkable abilities of infants to seek out and process information about
their environment and to act on that information.  It is increasingly
recognized that infant survival is directly dependent on the social support of
caregivers who respond to and structure, according to prescribed patterns, the
infant's interaction with the environment.  <p>
<p>
At birth infants are equipped with a wide range of capacities that facilitate
both survival and healthy development.  They have reflexes for the basic
biological functions as well as reflexes that lay the foundation for the more
complex controlled behaviours that appear later on, such as grasping, crawling,
and walking.  Their basic sensory capacities for hearing, touching, smelling,
and tasting are mature at birth, and the competence with which most newborns
use these capacities is dramatic.  For example, neonates are able to hear
across the same frequency range as older children, and they display a special
sensitivity to the basic sound categories of human language.<b>[1]</b> Although vision is not fully developed at
birth, infants are able to focus and follow the human face as well as
attractive inanimate objects<b>[2]</b>.  By two months
of age the infant's attention span increases, and more complex, shaded images
are preferred.  At birth, the dermal or touch system is the most mature of all
the sensory capacities.  The skin, the most extensive of all sensory systems,
sends a multitude of sensory messages to the brain through its receptors for
temperature, contact, and pain.  In addition to body contact, taste and smell
play an important role in the early establishment of emotional ties.   Within
the first week, infants are capable of distinguishing the mother's breast milk.
Infants are attracted to what is familiar and express this comfort through
bodily movements and facial expressions.  A calm quiet infant is highly
satisfying to the mother.  The mother-infant communication system, which is
initially established through touch and smell, occupies a critically important
place in the development of emotional ties.<b>[3]</b>
These early expressions of emotional ties lay the foundation for the emergence
of more complex cognitive, social. and emotional development.<b>[4]</b>  In the absence of human contact, infants will
begin to withdraw from their environments.<p>
<p>
Young infants are equipped with a repertoire of communication skills, including
smiles, gestures, and vocalizations, which enable participation in a complex
affective communication system.  For example, an infants has several goals for
interacting with other objects and maintaining close proximity to its
caregiver.<b>[5]</b>  To accomplish these goals, the
infant processes information about its successes or failures and uses that
information to accomplish their goals or to redirect his/her efforts to other
goals.  An infant can effectively signal its interests for interaction through
eye gaze and smiles, and caregivers interpreting the infant's messages respond
through appropriate facilitation of the infant's objectives.  Thus the infant
is an active, not a passive, participant.  <p>
<p>
Social interaction in the newborn and in the early months of infancy appears to
be a rule-governed, goal-oriented system in which the infant and its caregiver
are active participants.  Disruptions of this system command powerful responses
from the newborn.  This has been dramatically illustrated by years of
laboratory investigation of face-to-face interactions by Brazelton and his
colleagues.  In a face-to-face laboratory play situation, mothers were asked to
violate the infant's expectations for interaction by remaining alert but
unresponsive.<b>[6]</b>  The still-faced mothers
remained unresponsive for only three minutes, yet their infants found this
temporary violation greatly disturbing.  This suggests that reciprocity and
mutual achievement of the goals of social interaction form a necessary basis
for the growth of affective well-being in infancy.  The strategies that infants
employ to bring their mothers out of immobility demonstrates their growing
confidence as an effective social partner.  The seriousness of their reaction
when the mother remained unresponsive demonstrates the infant's critical need
for maternal responsivity.  When infants are unable to pull their mothers into
the interaction and finally withdraw, they are reminiscent of Harlow and
Zimmerman's description of the withdrawn behaviour and huddled posture of
isolated monkeys, and of Bowlby's description of the withdrawn behaviour of
children separated from their caretakers.<b>[7]</b>
Sick, malnourished, or brain-impaired babies as well as those infants expecting
to fail will elicit less effective social interaction.<b>[8]</b>  <p>
<p>
Decades of research on infant behaviour, combined with a sensitive appreciation
for the range of cross-cultural contexts in which the child's capacities
unfold, has led Brazelton and his colleagues to develop a model for
understanding the drama of child development during this early period.<b>[9]</b>  An understanding of the forces that propel
the child along the normal path of development, is critical to an understanding
and prevention of failure.  According to this model, there are three sources of
energy for development, including central nervous system maturation, internal
feedback system, and external feedback system (Figure 1).<b>[10]</b>  <p>
The first source of energy is the maturation of the <b>central nervous system
</b>(CNS) which is at the same time the most powerful and most limiting force.
The growth and maturation of the central nervous system in early child
development is dramatic and drives infants from one level of development to
another in relentless fashion.  Brain development is a process characterized by
events that occur in a complex, interrelated way, in a dynamic fashion, at
specific predetermined times.  The brain attains 90 percent of its adult volume
by 6 years of age, whereas the rest of the 6-year-old's body represents only 40
percent of adult volume.  There are two periods of rapid brain growth.  The
first begins during the first three weeks of pregnancy, during the period of
embryogenesis, when the nerves and glial cells are formed.  The number of cells
formed during this period remains stable throughout the life cycle.  The
lifetime  brain potential acquired at that time is approximately
10&nbsp;billion cells.  The second phase of rapid brain growth lasts from the
13th week of gestation until 2.5 years.  During this period many of the brain's
structures and biochemical routes are developed, and a whole system of
interconnections is established.<b>[11]</b><p>
<p>
The second important set of energies in early child development is the
<b>internal feedback system </b>that provides the growing infant with a sense
of inner competence.  These internal programmes of development, reflecting both
genetic endowment and intrauterine shaping, provide the maturational stages
that are genetically programmed.  For instance, when a toddler first learns to
walk its face glows, its body struts and its legs are driven to perform for
long, exhausting periods.  The energy that has been mobilized to achieve the
developmental task of walking now fuels the realization of mastery, and in
turn, the infant is reinforced to move on to achieve the next developmental
stage.  <p>
<p>
The third source of energy propelling early child development is the
<b>external feedback system </b>provided by the parents and the outside
environment.  For instance, as the infant achieves each new goal, it looks for
signs of reward and reinforcement from the outside world.  Thus, infants are
programmed with the energy or drive to reach out for and incorporate cues and
reinforcing signals from the social world, providing a second force for
achieving an inner sense of competence.  While the feedback cycles that are
necessary for normal affective growth are well documented, we have only
recently understood the crucial role of environmental nurturance for all of the
infant's development.  Environmental forces can work powerfully to retard or
enhance the infant's progress.  <p>
<p>
A normal infant has sufficient amount of internal energy as well as mechanisms
for demanding responses from caregivers.  Malnourished infants, however, are
unable to elicit  appropriate responses from already over-stressed, depleted
caregivers.  These infants' capacity for catch-up growth is limited, and the
stage has been set to fuel the cycle of poverty.<b>[12]</b>  In a malnourished infant, one with a
premature CNS system and decreased amount of brain cells, where are the sources
of energy?  These infants expect to fail and before they have reached their
first birthday they have already learned how to fail.  How can one intervene
early enough to interfere with this expectation for failure? <p>
<p>
The design of early intervention initiatives for at-risk infants and their
families requires the identification of critical periods or opportunities.
These opportunities or "touchpoints" refer to "windows" when the
infant-caregiver-environment system is particularly responsive and open to both
receive and provide appropriate information.  The esteemed French psychologist
Jean Piaget first recognized that any developmental progression goes in a burst
of energy, followed by a leveling off and a consolidation, and then another
burst.<b>[13]</b>  This period of disorganization is
what leaves the system open allowing the child, caregiver, and family receptive
to establishing a relationship, as well as to receive and pass on new
information.  <p>
<p>
Several early universal touchpoints have been recognized by Brazelton in his
work with infants and families in both industrialized and non-industrialized
countries.  The first touchpoint occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy when
parents and families seem to be universally receptive to information. A second
touchpoint appears to be the early months of life when the universal language
of the infant can be demonstrated to engage the caregiver's heightened
commitment and capture the sense of hope which surrounds the birth of an
infant.  This hope, however fleeting, is available in even the most stressful
and at-risk systems.  <p>
<p>
Two ingredients seem to be critical if early intervention is to result in
improved developmental outcome.   These include the timing of the intervention
and its quality.  Intervention must be of a kind that fosters the child's sense
of competence and fuels his own internal coping strategies, and it must involve
appropriate caregiver response to recognize, nurture and reinforce the child's
development.  Efforts at early intervention may prevent a compounding of
problems that occur when the environment cannot properly respond.  For example,
premature infants are less able to compensate in disorganized, depriving
environments than are well-equipped infants.   Quiet, undemanding malnourished
infants do not elicit necessary mothering from already over-stressed parents.<p>
<p>
It must be recognized, however, that in spite of desperate socioeconomic
conditions characterizing the environments of many children in the developing
world, families are able to produce children who do not have to be rescued from
protein-energy malnutrition and other forms of abuse and neglect.  Premature
and growth-retarded babies do make remarkable recoveries when placed in
supportive environments.  Only through the careful appraisal of both the
strengths and weaknesses of infants and their environments can we come to
appreciate the mechanisms for failure and the sources of strength.  Thus, an
opportunity and a challenge is offered to practitioners and programmers to
identify critical periods when early intervention strategies will be most
effective.  These touchpoints, when parents are ready to be empowered or
children are about to conquer the next developmental task, must be socially and
culturally determined.  With insights grounded in the knowledge of child
development as well as a realistic appraisal of available resources, each
community of families must identify the timing as well as the content of the
intervention.  <p>
<p>
The following section summarizes the normal developmental process beginning
with a description of the infant from 3 months to 2 years of age and concludes
with a discussion of the early childhood period from 2.5&nbsp;to 6 years of
age.  This discussion, with its attention to developmental stages, attempts to
provide the reader with a firmer foundation to build programs.   <p>
<p>
<b>Developmental Achievements in the First Two Years</b><p>
<p>
The period from 3 months to 12 months of age is characterized by increases in
size and strength accompanied by increases in coordination and mobility.
Sitting appears at about 5 to 6 months; crawling, at about 7 to 9 months; and
walking, at about 1 year.  During this period both memory and problem-solving
abilities improve, providing infants with a firmer sense of their environment
and their ability to act on it.  Sometime between 7 and 9 months the infant's
increased physical ability and intellectual power bring about changes in its
social relations.  During the period between 3 and 12 months there is a steady
growth of memory.  As a result of this cognitive capacity, infants become upset
when left alone and are likely to be wary of strangers.  Monitoring of
caregiver's facial expressions helps them to evaluate their environment.  They
also begin to make their first speech-like sounds, which foreshadow the
beginning of language.  <p>
<p>
At the same time that infants have increased motor capacity, they also show an
increased capacity to understand basic properties of objects and spatial
relations; they perceive different objects as members of the same category and
compare present experiences with memories of past events.  According to Piaget,
development evolves from children's own efforts to master their environments.
In this perspective, infants actively seek to assimilate their environmental
experiences into their existing knowledge base, or schemes.  When they are
unable to do so, they accommodate their existing schemes to the environmental
realities they encounter.  Learning during infancy occurs by sensorimotor ways
of knowing.  Between 4 and 8 months they pay increased attention to external
objects and prolong actions that produce interesting changes in their
environment.  Between 8 and 12 months they are able to coordinate separate
actions to achieve goals.<b>[14]</b>  <p>
<p>
The combined data on the changes in a child's self-concept between the ages of
18 and 30 months is evidenced by children's declined distress at separation
from their caregivers and an increased ability to engage in symbolic play, to
imitate absent events, and to express themselves in elementary words and
phrases.  The changes that converge to create the transition from infancy to
early childhood are summarized in Table 1.  As indicated in the table, these
changes reflect what psychologists refer to as a "bio-social-behavioural
shift".<b>[15]</b>  This shift refers to a process by
which changes in separate domains converge to create a qualitative
reorganization in the overall pattern of behaviour, signaling the beginning of
a new developmental stage.  The accomplishments of this period remind us that
social and cognitive changes are accompanied by changes in physical
development, such as coordinated walking and bladder control, all of which are
controlled by the continued maturation of the central nervous system.  <p>
<p>
When both the environment and internal growth processes are sufficient, the
separate components of development undergo further modification, and a new
distinct stage characterizes the child at 3 or 4 years.  A new configuration of
cognitive abilities is manifested in many domains, including problem solving,
play, imitation, categorization of objects, and communication.  Play evolves
from a concentration on variations in patterns of movement to the pretend use
of objects in imaginary situations.  Pretend play itself evolves, and children
can carry out a sequence of pretend actions in which objects are used as
agents.  Late in the second year, children become capable of imitating actions
seen days earlier, a kind of behaviour known as deferred imitation.<b>[16]</b>  <p>

The complexities and subtleties involved in accounting for how children develop
are well known to those struggling to characterize and define the process.  As
confirmed by research, the contributions of biological and environmental
factors as well as cultural influences and the specific circumstances in which
infants and young children develop must all be considered.  A child's
behaviours develop not in isolation but as components of an integrated system.
The requirement that developing systems must be studied as a whole is expressed
with particular clarity by the embryologist C.H.&nbsp;Waddington: " A new level
or organization cannot be accounted for in terms of the properties of its
elementary units as they behave in isolation, but is accounted for if we add to
these certain other properties which the units only exhibit in relation to each
other."<b>[17]</b><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Malnutrition and the Brain</b><p>
<p>
In many countries of the developing world, the environments confronting the
young child are not able to support the magical unfolding of the child's
potential.  One of the most critical insults to early child development is
inadequate nutrition.  The functional and structural effects of malnutrition on
the developing nervous system are known to impair cognition and behaviour and
to magnify the adverse effects of socio-environmental deprivation on
development.<b>[18]</b>  At any age, undernutrition
need not be severe or prolonged to produce behavioural changes that may have
important implications for both parent-child interaction and the ability of the
child to explore and master the environment.  In studies of infants and
toddlers, iron deficiency, even without associated protein energy deficits,
correlates with lowered scores on tests of mental and motor developments, as
well as with increased fearfulness, increased inattentiveness, and decreased
social responsiveness.<b>[19]</b>  These
developmental deficits may persist after the iron deficiency has been treated.
Protein-energy malnutrition reduces playful and exploratory activity as well as
motivation and arousal and increases apathy and irritability, even before
anthropometric deficits occur.<b>[20,21]</b>  The
physiologic mechanisms of these behavioural derangements are not fully
understood but may be related to alterations in neurotransmitter<b
>[22]</b synthesis and release.<b>[23]</b><p>
<p>
While undernutrition produces alterations of behaviour at any age, the brain is
uniquely vulnerable to structural deficits during the critical period of rapid
brain growth which extends from mid-gestation through the early preschool
years.  The growing brain utilizes nutrients at very rapid rates.  Although it
is only 2 to 3 percent of the child's body weight, it uses 60 percent of the
body's glucose utilization.  During this critical period the brain has
biosynthetic abilities which are inactive after early development making it
impossible to generate new neurons after this critical period.<b>[24]</b>  <p>
<p>
The effects of nutrient deprivation on brain size and structure depend on the
timing, duration, and severity of the nutritional deprivation in relation to
the development of the brain.  When the brain is deprived of an optimal supply
of nutrients there are no discrete lesions.  Rather, generalized distortion
occurs in those areas that were maturing at the time of nutrient deficit.  In
other areas of the brain where the cells have differentiated during prenatal
life, malnutrition in infancy reduces the formation of synapsis<b>[25]</b> and the branching of dendrites<b>[26]</b>.<sup>27</sup><p>
<p>
Nutritional intervention is a necessary but not a sufficient mode of treatment
for infants suffering from early malnutrition.  Data on children from both the
developed and developing worlds clearly demonstrates that medical and
nutritional intervention may restore physical growth but do not bring
developmental functions back to normal.<b>[27,28,29,30]</b>  However, several investigations
from the developing world have indicated the plasticity of the infant's central
nervous system when exposed to interventions that provide developmental
stimulation in conjunction with nutritional and medical care.  Malnourished
children who received focused and sustained centre- or home-based developmental
intervention beginning before 2 years of age and lasting for at least 3 years
showed significantly improved developmental scores at follow-up when compared
to untreated malnourished children.  <p>
<p>
In a study in Cali, Colombia, 180 chronically malnourished Colombian preschool
children were divided into three groups of 60 children each.<b>[31]</b>  Children in Groups I, II and III received
medical care, while Groups II and III received nutritional intervention as
well.  Children in Group III, in addition to receiving medical and nutritional
interventions were exposed to a developmental component consisting of four
hours of activities designed to develop cognitive, language, and social
abilities.  The results of the study indicate that adequate medical care alone
produced no changes in physical growth or intellectual development.
Nutritional intervention was able to increase physical growth.  The group of
children who received a multicomponent set of services, including medical care,
adequate food, and a stimulating environment, exhibited rates of physical and
cognitive development similar to a well-nourished control group.  Thus, while
such studies often suffer from methodological flaws of greater and lesser
magnitude, the overall body of data indicates that the malfunction and poor
growth due to early malnutrition and environmental deprivation are reversible
with interventions with nutritional, medical, and developmental components.
The implications of this research for the design of comprehensive programmes
attending to a child's health, nutrition, and development cannot be
underestimated.<p>
<p>
In summary, infancy as a distinct period in the life span is recognized by all
cultures.  While infancy begins as soon as the child starts to breathe
independently, the end of infancy is not so easily defined.  According to the
ancient Romans, an infant is "one who does not speak."  Developmental
psychologists, to establish that one stage has ended and another begun, look
for converging changes in development among several spheres of physical,
psychological, and social domains.  For example, the acquisition of language is
not an isolated event but is associated with children's social relations,
self-concepts, modes of thought, and physical capacities.  It is an ensemble of
integrated change that transforms the infant into a young child who, though
still dependent on adults, is on its way towards independence.  <p>
<p>
The behaviours that mark the end of infancy do not emerge all at once.  Rather,
they reflect the interplay among the patterned sequence of change in
biological, behavioural, cultural, and social domains of development.  As
described earlier, the first few months of life provide insights into the
processes of developmental change when the major task is to develop a
synchronous pattern of interaction between the infant, its caregiver, and the
environment.  This system of mutual reciprocity is achieved through a wide
range of different cultural systems of childrearing patterns and practices that
respect, respond to, and support the infant's intense drive to learn through
interactions with the environment.  During the first two years of life, in
supportive physical and social environments, the development of critical brain
structures continues to fuel behavioural changes that enhance the child's
abilities to learn from and shape its interactions with caregivers and the
environment.<p>
<p>
<b>Paradoxes of the Preschool Mind</b><p>
<p>
Developmental change evolves more slowly in early childhood the period from 2.5
to 6 years of age than in infancy.  During this time, children lose their baby
fat, their legs grow longer and thinner, and they move around the world with
increasing dexterity.  They present a bewildering patchwork of vulnerability
and ability, logic and magic, insight and ignorance.  Children at this age can
talk in endless sentences but are keen listeners when an interesting story is
being told.  Their present desires can be curtailed with promises of later
rewards, but they may not necessarily accept the offered terms, negotiating for
an instant as well as a delayed reward. They develop theories about everything
that are constantly measured against the world around them.  However, despite
their developing independence, 3-

year-olds
need assistance from adults and siblings.  They cannot hold a pencil properly
or string a loom or tie a knot.  They do not have the ability to concentrate
for long periods of time without a great deal of support, and they wander on
tangents in their games and conversations.  Preschool children's thought
processes are characterized by great awareness; yet, these islands of
sophistication exist in a sea of uncertainty.  Children during this period,
still understand relatively little about the world in which they live and have
little or no control over it.  They are prone to fears and they combat their
growing self-awareness of being small by wishful, magical
thinking<sup>1</sup>.<p>
<p>
A dramatic accomplishment during this period is the acquisition of language.
Despite intensive investigation, the process of language acquisition remains
elusive, and no one theory has sufficiently uncovered its mystery.  What is
evident is that the growth of children's vocabulary and their increased ability
to use complex sentence structures accompanied by a corresponding growth in
their ability to engage in conversation appropriately tailored to the
listener's needs, requires both participation in responsive human interactions
and exposure to a rich language environment.<b>[32]</b>  <p>
<p>
For decades, Piaget's descriptions of young children's thinking dominated
exploration of the preschooler's mental development.  According to Piaget,
children's language acquisition reflects their emerging capacity for
representational thought.  The ways in which children think about the world,
however, are still primitive--dreams come from street lamps, we think with our
ears, clouds are alive, and the sun follows us when we move.  Piaget proposed
that 3-, 4-, and 5-

year
old children make errors because they are still unable to engage in true mental
operations.  This type of thinking therefore was termed "pre-operational."
According to Piaget, the key feature of preschool thinking is that children can
only focus their attention on one salient aspect at a time.  This limitation is
overcome at 6 or 7 years of age, when the transition to concrete operational
thinking emerges.  When this occurs, children are able to combine, separate,
and transform information mentally in a logical manner.  They know that the sun
does not follow them and dreams do not come from street lamps.  <p>
<p>
Piaget's perspective on the preschool child's development places the child at
the centre of his universe.  Through active interaction, exploration, and
observation of the environment, the child actively creates his own learning.
During development, the child's ability to engage in play undergoes important
transformations reflecting and promoting levels of cognitive, motor, and social
capacities.  For example, the infant requires adult "scaffolding" of
activities, the 2- to 4-year-old engages in solitary play while 4-to
6-year-olds have tremendous capacities for socio-dramatic make-believe games
that involve other children and enactment of a variety of social roles.  Play
facilitates the transition to higher levels of cognitive development; the "as
if" nature of play allows children to perform actions that are more
developmentally advanced than those they can realistically achieve.  Play
fosters a sense of self-esteem and competence, supporting and reinforcing the
child's capacity for effective action.  As a consequence, in play a child is
always above his daily behaviour; in play "it is as though he were a head
taller than himself."<b>[33]</b>  <p>
In the past decade, Piaget's work has been challenged for its failure to
account for the variation in preschool childrens' thinking.  For some, the
unevenness can be explained by differences in children's familiarity with
specific task settings.  Biologically oriented theorists argue that changes in
the brain's structure are the major cause of unevenness in preschool thought.
At the start of the preschool period, the brain has achieved 50 percent of its
adult weight.  By the age of 6, the brain will have grown to 90 percent of its
weight.  Within this overall process of growth, myelination -- the process by
which neurons become covered by myelin, which is a sheath of fatty cells that
stabilizes the neurons -- appears to play a particularly important role in
preschoolers' cognitive development.<b>[34]</b><p>
<p>
In light of these varying perspectives, the position most reasonable to accept,
however, is that the context-specific organization of the child's environment
is constantly interacting with the biological properties of the child, which
themselves develop at different rates.  Appreciating the immense variation of
these two diverse sources, one from the social world of human existence and one
from biology, we can begin to understand the range and variability in early
child behaviour.  In this ecological view of development, the child's
environment consists of four interrelated layers including the nuclear and
extended family; the immediate community of peers and neighbours; the
institutional community of schools and other social service facilities; and a
cultural ethos consisting of values, beliefs, and rituals.  The child's
development is conditioned by the frequency and complexity of interactions
within each one of these systems.  For example, cognitive and social
development seem to be most affected by factors of the home environment,
including the caregivers' self-image, self-esteem, confidence, and emotional
responsivity; the  restrictions and types of discipline imposed on the child;
the language stimulation provided; and the child's opportunities for
exploratory play and appropriate play materials.  Factors in the immediate
community impacting on the child's development may consist of community
attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions regarding the ideal child and childrearing
patterns that foster such development.<b>[35]</b>  <p>
<p>
Until recently, emphasis was placed on identifying and overcoming deficiencies
of the "deprived" environments that characterized the rural and urban poor.
Disadvantaged environments have been thought to lack the necessary variety and
quality of human interactions as well as the necessary objects and events for
fostering a child's early development.  Poor quality verbal interaction and
absence of toys and were frequently cited as detrimental to a child's language
abilities and visual-discrimination.  More recently, however, the strengths of
the environments characterizing the poor which are capable of fostering and
promoting early development have been appreciated.  Such features include, for
example;<p>
<p>
Opportunities for play with peers and older children with minimal adult
interference enhancing the development of self-reliance, self-control,
cooperation, empathy and a sense of belonging.<p>
<p>
 	Exposure to multiple teaching styles, with emphasis on modeling, observation,
and imitation.<p>
<p>
Presence of a rich cultural tradition of games, toys, songs, and stories that
provide a culture-specific context for language acquisition.<p>
  <p>
Realization is growing that within so-called deprived environments, children
learn a different set of skills that are functional in their home environments
but that may not be valued by formal institutions such as the school system. In
the design of culturally appropriate, community-based early intervention
programmes, it is critical therefore, to explore, mobilize, and build on these
inherent strengths.  The recognition of strengths within "deprived"
environments sheds light on the factors giving rise to "invulnerable," or
stress-resistant, children.<b>[37]</b> <p>
<p>
Past investigations that focused only on vulnerabilities and sources of failure
prevented an understanding of the ways in which protective mechanisms shield
children from risk.  In the past decade, efforts to understand "invulnerable"
children have begun.  Garmezey has proposed three categories of protective
factors, which include (1) personality characteristics of the child; (2) a
supportive, stable, and cohesive family unit; and (3) external support systems
that enhance coping skills and project positive values.<b>[38]</b>  <p>
<p>
Recently, investigators have identified the child's "sense of self" as a key
determinant of successful outcomes.<b>[39,40]</b>  It
is suggested that children with positive feelings of self-esteem, mastery, and
control can more easily negotiate stressful experiences.  These children in
turn elicit more positive experiences from their environment.  They show
initiative in task accomplishment and relationship formation.  Even in stressed
families, the presence of one good relationship with a parent reduces
psychosocial risk for children.  For older children, the presence of a close,
enduring relationship with an external support figure may likewise provide a
protective function.  A child with a positive self-concept seeks, establishes,
and maintains the kinds of supportive relationships and experiences that
promote successful outcomes.  These successes enhance the child's self-esteem
and sense of mastery, which leads to further positive experiences and
relationships.  The cycle of success can be as self-perpetuating as the cycle
of failure.<p>
<p>
In spite of these strengths, it is clear that the developmental costs of
poverty are high and that poverty is a marker for potential psychosocial risk
factors.  Children in poverty are exposed more frequently to a clustering of
such risk factors as medical illness, poor nutrition, family stress, low
education levels, inadequate social-service support, and nonstimulating social
environments.  The costs can be measured in terms of school drop-out,
unemployment, delinquency, and the intergenerational perpetuation of failure
and poverty.  <p>
<p>
These stress factors additionally or "synergistically" interact with the
child's inherent strengths and vulnerabilities to shape outcomes.  A
transactional model developed by Sameroff and Chandler has become widely used
to help define developmental outcomes.<b>[41]</b>
According to this framework, child outcomes can only be interpreted by
considering the transaction between the content of the child's behaviour and
the context in which the behaviours are manifested.  Characteristics of the
child shape its response to the environment.  These interactions in turn
transform environmental responsivity.  Just as the child is shaped by the
environment, so is the environment modified by the child.  The child brings a
host of attributes to the interaction, including; health and nutritional
status; temperament; and cognitive, language, and social skills.  The
environment in turn brings specific attributes.  In an environment of poverty,
more risk factors are likely to be present.  While adding considerable
complexity to the determinates of child outcomes, such a model also suggests an
opportunity for practical intervention strategies.  Change in any aspect of the
child's differing environments can create positive transformations in another.
<p>
<p>
The period of early childhood ends at the age of 6 or 7 years, when children
pass through the next bio-behavioral shift and assume the accompanying social
roles and demands.  Generally by this age, children's brains have achieved a
level of complexity similar to adults.  It is the age of formal schooling, and
children also gather with friends and peers beyond the family.  Developments in
early childhood provide the essential preparation for the new demands and
opportunities to come. <p>
<p>
Several important ECD programming implications can be derived from the
theoretical perspective presented here.  It is evident that in order to capture
the opportunities in early childhood, programmes must focus on the short-term
learning goals that lead to long-term results.  For example quality early child
programmes must encourage child initiative if they are to be successful
inpreventing long term negative consequences.  One may also conclude with
confidence that only quality early child programmes enhance young children's
development while inadequate programmmes may even increase the risk of school
failure and social problems.  To achieve long-term effects, high quality ECD
programmes are those that stimulate young children's intellectual and social
skills, creative expression, movement and personal initiative.  Programme staff
should be trained in the basic principles of early child development and
receive ongoing supervision including including observational feedback,
evaluation, and staff development.  Finally, group sizes should be as small as
possible, and parents and caregivers should see themselves as partners in the
education of their young children.<b>[42]</b><p>
<p>
In bringing this theoretical discussion to a close, it is perhaps useful to
conclude with the insight of a proverb, "As the twig is bent, so grows the
tree."  If forces in the environment bend a sapling long enough, the tree may
become so bent that its leaves cannot receive the sun's light, and it will not
flower and reproduce.  Yet, if the forces bending the tree cease or if a
gardener stakes the tree upright, the only lasting effect may be a slight bend
in the trunk.  The tree will prosper and make a genuine contribution to its
environment.<sup>1</sup> <p>

<b>IT MAY SEEM OBVIOUS, BUT.,</b><p>
 <p>
 	The world is filled with believers in the value of good care and
attention to children during their earliest months and years. That belief is
embedded in virtually all cultural traditions. Indeed, both common wisdom and
hard scientific research evidence lead to the forceful conclusion that the
earliest years of life are critical in the development * of the intelligence,
personality, and the social values and behaviors that will characterize later
life.<p>
<p>
	But in spite of the seemingly obvious importance of the early years, the
developmental needs of children are being neglected. Millions (perhaps hundreds
of millions) of children throughout the world suffer delayed, debilitated or
distorted mental, social, or emotional development in their earlier years.
These children are victims of social neglect in varying degrees and forms and
for various reasons. Deprived of the chance to develop their abilities, they
find it difficult to cope adequately with a rapidly changing and increasingly
complex world, let alone to help in the construction of a better world They are
condemned to lethargic, dependent, unproductive and unrewarding lives. These
children - and their families - need help if they are to have a fair start in
life.<p>
<p>
	But if the value of the early years is so evident, why is the problem so
widespread? Why is there such neglect by families and social institutions?
Among the reasons that might be offered are the following:<p>
<p>
	   Families living in extreme poverty or victimized by war or famine, may be
so busy surviving 	that they cannot give the loving attention to their children
they would like to give, Families 	living in luxury may be too busy making
money, or spending it, to give needed time to their 	children. At the same
time, some institutions that could help families to help their children take
the position that child development is best left to families.<p>
<p>
          Child development is sometimes looked upon as a natural process that
needs no help. Or, it 	is seen as a by-product. Often, institutions incorrectly
assume that their programs of sanitation 	or income generation or community
development will automatically foster total child 	development.<p>
<p>
<p>
	* Simply stated, child (and human) development refers to a process of change
in which children (people) become able to handle ever more complex levels of
moving and coordinating, of thinking and reasoning, of feeling and expressing
emotions, and of relating to and interacting with other people and with the
natural environment. This differentiates "development" from "growth",
intellectual, social, emotional, and moral dimensions of development are
interrelated; progress along one dimension can progress along others.<p>
<p>
	For a child to develop in a healthy and normal way, it is important not only
to meet the basic needs of protection, food and health care, but also to meet
basic needs for affection, interaction and stimulation, security, and learning
through exploration and discovery. All children develop and there is a general
sequence or pattern to that development. But the rate and character and quality
of development will vary from child to child. Development begins pre-natalIy
and occurs throughout life.  It occurs as a changing child (biologically)
interacts with the people and objects that constitute the changing contexts of
family, community, society and culture.<p>
<p>
	The specific goals to which such development are directed will differ from
culture to culture, some putting more emphasis on physical abilities than on
abstract reasoning, or on social relations than individualism, for instance.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
	   Specialization deters action. Our academic and bureaucratic institutions
are increasingly 	fractured and piecemeal. But children are not made in pieces
corresponding to nutrition, 	health, education and social welfare. Because
child development is best approached in a 	holistic way and requires the
attention of all these sectors, it is at once everyone's concern and 	no-one's
concern.<p>
<p>
	   In a world of limited resources and of demands for hard economic evidence
to justify	budgets,  it is difficult to produce "rates of return" for early
childhood investments as it is for 	any social program.<p>
<p>
	   Young children are certainly not a political force - someone must look
after their interests 	for them.<p>
<p>
	 Delayed or debilitated development is not as dramatic as death or third
degree malnutrition 	and the effect of deteriorating conditions on development
is not as obvious. Accordingly, the 	child development part of the "silent
emergency" is just beginning to be documented and	realized and acted upon.<p>
<p>
	   In brief, we need to be reminded why the early years are so important for
both individual and social futures. We need to have before us a set of
convincing arguments based on something other than feelings or biases,
combining both scientific and political reasons for attending to young
children. That is the intent of the following pages which set out eight reasons
for increasing support to, and involvement in programs that foster early
childhood development.<p>
<p>
<b>EIGHT REASONS FOR INVESTING</b><p>
<b>IN PROGRAMS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD DEVELOPMENT</b><p>
<p>
In summary:<p>
<p>
	1. <b>A scientific argument</b>. Research evidence demonstrates that the early
years are critical in 	the development of intelligence, personality, and social
behavior, and that there are long term 	effects associated with a variety of
early intervention programs.<p>
<p>
	2. <b>A human rights argument</b>. Children have a right to live and to
develop to their full 	potential.<p>
<p>
	3. <b>A moral and social values argument</b>. Through children, humanity
transmits its values. 	That transmission begins with infants. To preserve
desired moral and social values in the 	future, on must begin with children.<p>
<p>
	4 <b>A social equity argument.</b> By responding to the developmental needs of
children and	families who are "at risk", it is possible to modify distressing
socio-economic and gender	related inequities.<p>
<p>
<p>
	5. <b>A political argument</b>. Children provide a rallying point for social
and political actions	that build consensus and solidarity.<p>
<p>
	6. <b>An economic argument</b>, Society benefits economically from investing
in early childhood	programs because its productive capacity increases and
because cost savings result.<p>
<p>
	7. <b>A program efficiency argument</b>. The efficacy of various components of
sectoral programs	(health, nutrition, education, women's programs) can be
improved through their	combination in an integrated child development
program.<p>
<p>
	8, <b>Changing social and demographic circumstances</b>. The increasing
survival of vulnerable 	children, changing family structure, composition and
childrearing practices, urban-rural	migration, the growing presence of women in
the labor force, and other changes create	imbalances that require concerted
attention to early care and development.<p>
<p>
      Some of these lines of argument will be more relevant to one situation
than to another. Different individuals will find appeal in different arguments,
reflecting their particular concerns about deteriorating social values, the
importance of learning to live together, the rights of children, economic
benefits, social equity, etc.<p>
<p>
<b>1. Scientific evidence demonstrates early and lasting</b><p>
<b>effects of early attention to child development</b><p>
 <p>
 	Evidence from the fields of physiology, nutrition, psychology,
education and other fields continues to accumulate to indicate that the early
years are critical to all of later life. To cite a fewof the findings:<p>
<p>
	   Brain cells are formed during the first two years, In addition, recent
research shows that	stimulation of a child's senses affects the structure and
organization of neural pathways in the 	brain during the formative period. By
age 6, most of these connections are made (or not, as 	the case may be). Thus,
providing opportunities for appropriately complex perceptual and 	motor
experiences at an early age favorably affects various learning abilities in
later life and 	can even compensate, at least partly, for deficits associated
with early malnutrition (Dobbing, 	1987.)<p>
<p>
	   Children whose caregivers interact with them in consistent, caring ways
will be better 	nourished and less apt to be sick (therefore, more likely to
survive) than children not so 	attended (Zeitlin, Ghassemi, and Mansour,
1990.)<p>
<p>
	   Establishing a loving relationship with a person in the early months of
life has been shown 	to affect the ability later in life of a person to love
and to establish permanent relationships 	(Sroufe and Cooper, 1988.)<p>
<p>
<p>
	   Longitudinal studies demonstrate long-term effects associated with a
variety of intervention 	programs. These effects go beyond the learning of
basic abilities to include: improved school 	attendance and performance,
increased employment, reduced delinquency during the teenage 	years and reduced
teenage pregnancy (Myers, 1991.)<p>
<p>
<b>2. Children have a human right</b><p>
<b>to develop their full potential.</b><p>
 <p>
 	Allowing disability and arrested development to occur each year for
millions of young children, when it could be prevented is a violation of human
rights. The fact that children are dependent on others for satisfaction of
their rights creates an even greater obligation to help and protect them.<p>
<p>
	The Declaration of the Rights of the Child, adopted unanimously in 1959 by the
UN General Assembly, recognized among its 10 principles:<p>
<p>
	Principle 2: "The child will enjoy special protection and will have at its
disposal opportunities 	and services, dispensed under the law and through other
means<i>, allowing physical, mental, 	moral, spiritual and social development
in a healthy and normal way, with liberty and 	dignity."</i> (Italics added)<p>
<p>
	Thirty years after the approval of the 1959 Declaration, a Convention on the
Rights of the Child was ratified by the UN Assembly that urges signatories
to:<p>
<p>
	"...  ensure to the maximum extent possible child survival <i>and
development</i>." (Article 6)<p>
<p>
	While placing primary responsibility for a child's up-bringing with parents
and families, States must:<p>
<p>
	"... Render appropriate assistance to parents and legal guardians in the
performance of their 	childrearing responsibilities and shall insure the
development of institutions, facilities and 	services for the care of the
children." (Article 18.2)<p>
<p>
Further:<p>
<p>
	"... children of working parents have the right to benefit from child care
services and facilities 	for which they are eligible." (Article 18.3)<p>
<p>
	Signing of the Convention by more than 70 nations, suggests that the right for
children to develop to their full potential is widely accepted internationally,
providing the cornerstone for an early childhood rationale. However, the
rhetoric of human rights needs to be translated into action and children are
not able to make that translation for themselves.<p>
<p>
<b>3. Through children humanity transmits its values.</b><p>
<p>
	We are continually reminded that "children are our future". Transmission of
the social and moral values that will guide that future begins in the earliest
months of life.<p>
<p>
	In societies where there is a concern that crucial values are being eroded, a
strong incentive exists to find ways in which those values can be strengthened.
Early childhood programs can assist in that effort, both by strengthening the
resolve of parents and by providing environments for children to play and learn
that include specific attention to desired values. Attending to the development
of basic values in children must be a high priority in a world racked by
violence but seeking peace, in a world where an economy of waste belies efforts
to seek sane solutions to environmental depredation, and in a world where
consumerism, competition and individualism seem to be winning out over
altruism, cooperation and solidarity as core values.<p>
<p>
	If children are our future, they are the agents of change as well as the
custodians of continuity. For many, that is frightening. But that is all the
more reason to seek grounding in basic values while providing new generations
with the self-confidence and the ability to learn that will help guide and cope
with inevitable transformations.<p>
<p>
<b>4. Programs can help to modify distressing inequalities.</b><p>
 <p>
 	Investments in early childhood development can help to modify
inequalities rooted in poverty and discrimination (social, religious, racial,
gender), by giving children from so-called "disadvantaged" backgrounds a "fair
start". Poverty and/or discrimination produce stressful conditions and unequal
treatment that can inhibit healthy and comprehensive development in the early
years. For instance, children from poor families often fall quickly and
progressively behind their more advantaged peers in their readiness for school,
and that gap is never closed.<p>
<p>
	Boys, traditionally, have been better prepared for schooling than girls and
have had more opportunities to enter and continue in school. The differences
begin with gender-linked disparities in the patterns and practices of early
development that need to be changed if that discrimination is to be overcome.
These are often deeply rooted in culture, but there is evidence (e.g., from
Guatemala; Klein, 1979) that integrated attention to early development can
produce changes in ways families perceive the abilities and futures of a girl
child.<p>
<p>
	By not helping to foster early childhood development where that is needed, we
tacitly endorse and even broaden inequalities. Ironically, one argument used
against early education programs is that they are discriminatory - favoring the
upper class. That is certainly true if no special effort is made to assist the
poor and if programs of early education are left to those who can pay for them.
But evidence shows early childhood programs can moderate rather than exacerbate
social differences (e.g., in Latin America: Filp, et.al., 1983; in India: Lal
and Wati, 1986).<p>
<p>
<b>5. Children provide a rallying point for</b><p>
<b>social and political actions building consensus and solidarity.</b><p>
 <p>
	Mozambique, Lebanon, Peru, Sri Lanka, Fl Salvador, Iraq and a significant
number of other countries are suffering a level of violence that places the
problem of living together in peace highly on the list of social goals. In many
locations, lesser political and social tensions make it extremely difficult to
mobilize people for actions that will be to their own benefit. In such
circumstances, it has been shown that placing "Children First" can be an
effective political strategy.<p>
<p>
	Perhaps the most dramatic, but short - lived examples of mobilization around
programs to benefit young children are those in the case in which cease - fires
have been obtained between warring groups in order to carry out national
immunization campaigns. Children have constituted a "zone of peace", as for
instance in El Salvador.<p>
<p>
	Less spectacular are the many community - based programs that take children as
a point of common interest - as an "entry point" for common action. The welfare
of children is less politically charged than many other social program areas.
Community improvements in health, sanitation and nutrition that benefit
children are likely also to benefit the community at large, while building
organization. Innumerable examples are available of such improvements (e.g.,
the PROMESA project in Colombia, CINDE, 1990).<p>
<p>
<b>6. Society benefits through</b><p>
<b>increased productivity, income generation and cost savings</b><p>
<b>associated with enhanced early childhood development.</b><p>
<p>
	Without recurring to a scientific literature, common sense suggests that a
person who is well developed physically, mentally, socially and emotionally
will be in a better position to contribute economically to family, community
and country than a person who is not. And in most  countries of the world, that
economic contribution begins at a very early age.<p>
<p>
	<b>Increased productivity</b>. Early childhood programs have the potential to
improve both physical and mental capacity (Maguire and Austin, 1987). They also
affect enrollment, progress and performance of children in school (Myers, 1991)
which, in turn is associated with important changes in skills and outlooks
affecting adult behavior (e.g., Inkeles and Smith, 1974). Schooling helps build
such skills as the ability to organize knowledge into meaningful categories, to
transfer knowledge from one situation to another, and to be more selective in
the use of information (Rogoff, 1980; Tirandis, 1980). Schooling facilitates
greater technological adaptiveness (Grawe, 1979). It relates directly to both
increased productivity by farmers (Lockheed, Jamison and Lau, 1980) and by
workers in the informal sectors (Colclough, 1980).<p>
<p>
	<b>Income generation</b>. Economic benefits from early childhood programs may
occur also through effects on the employment and earnings of caregivers. Child
care and development programs can facilitate increased labor force
participation by women and they can free older siblings to learn and earn as
well. They can provide employment for some individuals as caregivers and as
suppliers of materials and services needed to make a program function.<p>
<p>
	<b>Cost savings</b>. Another way in which investments in health, nutrition,
and psycho - social development during the early years can bring economic
return is through cost savings - by reducing work losses, by cutting the later
need for social welfare programmes, by improving the efficiency of educational
systems through reductions in dropout, repetition, and remedial programs, and
by reducing health costs.<p>
<p>
	In a review of 17 longitudinal studies examining the effect of early
interventions on school progress and performance in primary school (Myers,
forthcoming 1991), 12 studies contained information about effects on
repetition. Of these, 8 pointed to lower repetition among children who had
participated in early childhood programmes (education, nutrition or health, or
combinations), as compared with children who had not. Of the 4 studies in which
no difference was found, one involved a system following an automatic promotion
procedure.<p>
<p>
	More specifically, an evaluation from Brazil shows that reducing the extra
primary school costs associated with repetition, a program of integrated
attention to Preschool children more than paid for itself (Ministerio de Saude,
1983). Another often - quoted example of an economic pay-off to an investment
in early development comes from the United States where a longitudinal study of
the effects of participation by children from low income families in a pre -
school program produced benefits (primarily through cost savings related to
reduced educational failure, unemployment, and crime), estimated at seven times
the original costs of the program (Berruta - Clement, et.al., 1984).<p>
<p>
	<b>A rate of return?</b> It is difficult to calculate a ratio of program costs
to program benefits or an economic "rate-of-return" for social investments of
any kind, including programs of early childhood care and development. But when
such estimates have been made, they suggest that a high return on an investment
in early childhood is possible. For instance, Selowsky using Latin America
data, concluded that:<p>
<p>
	"Yearly investments per child in programs that can induce a change in ability
equal to one 	standard deviation can be "justified" if they cost between 0.37
and 0.51 the yearly wage of an 	illiterate worker". (Selowsky, 1989; p. 342)<p>
<p>
Both the hoped-for increase in what Selowsky calls "ability" and the costs
cited are well within the realm of possibility to achieve.<p>
<p>
<b>7. The efficacy of programs can be improved</b><p>
<b>through joint investment for early childhood development.</b><p>
 <p>
	At least as important as the cost savings suggested above, are the increases
in effectiveness of health, nutrition, and education programmes if they are
brought together in integrated programmes of early childhood development. There
are, of course, logistic advantages to such combination. Pre - school
programmes are potentially useful as vehicles for extending primary health
care; nutrition programmes are useful to attract family participation in
pre-school or parent education programmes; primary health activities can serve
to detect delays in mental. and social development as well as improve attention
in homes, But more important than the logistic advantage, combining programmes
takes advantage of the synergistic relationships among health, nutrition, and
early stimulation or education.<p>
<p>
	If children arrive at primary school better prepared, physically and mentally,
they can make better use of the school. Not only will dropout and repetition
decrease, affecting costs, but the quality of education will rise because one
of the most important "inputs" into the school system is the child. When
children are better prepared, teachers can be more effective, facilities and
materials can be better used, and children can learn more from each other. In
the aforementioned review of longitudinal studies, the academic performance of
children who had been part of early intervention programmes was found to be
superior in 8 to 12 studies. In three others, no significant differences were
found between the intervened children and others and in one, effects were found
in a rural, but not an urban context (Myers, forthcoming 1991).<p>
<p>
	In a different vein, income generating programmes for women that respond to
child care and development needs are likely to be more successful than
programmes that do not. Women will not only be able to seek steadier and better
paying employment if adequate child care is available, but also, studies show
that if proper care for their children is assured, women (parents) will lose
less work time as a result of child - related concerns (Galinsky, 1986).<p>
<p>
<b>8. Changing social and economic circumstances</b><p>
<b>require new responses.</b><p>
<p>
	In a category somewhat different from the above is a set of changing
conditions that add urgency to the need for increasing attention to the young
child. Over the last decade, the effects of a world recession magnified
difficulties of individual families and governments, increasing levels of
poverty, affecting income distribution, shaping budgets and negatively
affecting the development of young children (Cornia, et.al., 1987). But even
Prior to the recession, and in some settings, independently of it, major social
changes have been occurring that call for new approaches to early childhood
care and development.<p>
<p>
	<b>Rapid change and childrearing practices</b>. Moves to the city, a shift to
crash cropping, civil wars, construction of darns and other major changes in
the contexts in which children are brought up often require changes in
childrearing practices, What worked before does not necessarily work now, and
effects on children's welfare can be negative. At the same time, these changes,
together with the increasing reach of the mass media and the arrival of
government services into rural areas, often introduce new childrearing
practices that are not only culturally foreign and irrespectful of traditional
practices that work, but may even be harmful (e.g., bottle feeding).<p>
<p>
	<b>Increasing participation of women in the labor force.</b> The increased
pressure for women to work for wages and sometimes the need to take over men's
farming chores as they have migrated to cities, has brought additional burdens
affecting child care and creating a need for alternative forms of care (Leslie
and Paolisso, 1989; Bonilla, 1990; Carloni, 1984). The trend toward increasing
labor force participation pre - dates, but has been strengthened by the world
recession. These trends are likely to continue, and even to increase in the
coming years,<p>
	<b>Modification of traditional family patterns</b>. Extended families are no
longer as common as they once were. As migration and progressive urbanization
occurs, members of an extended  family are not as available for child care as
in the past. Grandmothers may remain in rural areas or work outside the home in
wage - earning jobs, The number of women - headed households has increased,
sometimes reaching high levels (Youssef and Hertler, 1984). In these
households, women must work, creating a major need for complementary care. If
care is available, and the earnings of women increase, these earnings are more
likely than would be the earnings of men to go toward improving the welfare of
the children in the household.<p>
	<b>Increased primary school attendance</b> has decreased the availability of
older siblings to act as supplementary caretakers. Or, siblings have been
forced to drop out of school to provide such care, in which case there is a
strong argument for child care initiatives that will help the sibling
caregivers (most of whom are girls) continue their education, at least to the
point of literacy.<p>
<p>
<b>	Changes in mortality and survival rates</b>. Over the last 30 years, the
infant mortality rate has been more than cut in half. More children are
surviving who in the past who have died an early death. Worldwide, survival to
age one has increased from 5 of 6 in 1960 to 12 of 13 in 1990 (Grant, 1990).
More and more countries of the Third World are reaching a point at which 19 of
20 children survive. The pressure increases to mount programmes for those who
survive, even as efforts continue to further reduce the mortality rate. The
moral obligation grows to look beyond survival to ask, and to try and answer by
deed as well as by word, the question, "Survival for What?"<p>
<p>
<b>BASES FOR ACTION</b><p>
<p>
	Fortunately, we are in a much better position to act on this rationale and to
respond to the growing need and demand for programmes of child care and
development than we were two decades ago. Recent advances in the state of the
art have been impressive. We need not wait for further research to Provide
additional or magical answers, These may be in the making but to wait for them
would be to deprive today's child of the urgent and sound assistance to which
she is entitled. Moreover, advances in the state of the art have not been
accompanied by similar advances in the state of the practice, For instance:<p>
<p>
	We know that development occurs as children interact with their caregivers and
that the child 	must be an active partner in the process; <i>but</i> the state
of the practice continues to place great 	emphasis on one-way "stimulation" of
the child.<p>
	We know that there is a synergistic (mutual interaction and effect)
relationship among good 	health, sound nutritional status and psyche-social
well-being; <i>but</i><b> </b>a mono-focal approach to 	programming still
dominates.<p>
<p>
	We know that indigenous childrearing practices are often very healthy;
<i>but</i> emphasis is placed 	on imported solutions.<p>
<p>
	We know that development begins pre-natally; <i>but</i> programme emphasis is
placed on	children ages 3 to 6.<p>
<p>
	In short, we know more than we think we know, we have not applied all we know
and we have an adequate knowledge base for action,<p>
<p>
	We are also in a better position today than 20 years ago because programme
experience has accumulated during that period, providing a range of potentially
effective and financially feasible models. These include programmes of centre -
based care and education (creches, home day care, integrated development
centres in the work place, etc.),programmes of home - based support and
education for parents and other caregivers (beginning with pre- natal education
and including home visiting, programmes of adult education combining health,
nutrition, and psyche - social concerns, mass media presentations, child - to -
child programmes, etc.), and broader programmes of community development built
around integrated attention to the child.<p>
<p>
	In some countries, attention to early childhood education and development has
grown dramatically and has gone well beyond a demonstration stage. Examples of
such growth can be found in the expansion of the <i>Integrated Child
Development Service</i> in India, the non - formal community - based pre -
schools for children in Kenya, the home day care programme in Colombia,
parental education in China, the incorporation of a child's right to care into
the Brazilian constitution and the inclusion of child development content into
the primary school curriculum in Jamaica. These examples suggest that moving
from pilot projects toward larger scale programmes is possible.<p>
<p>
	From these examples and many others, we see that low - cost, effective
programme options exist. In many cases an integrated child development
programme can result from folding an additional component into an existing
structure at marginal cost. Focusing efforts on particular groups can keep
costs within reason. Cost savings can even off - set the investment costs. A
variety of innovative financing schemes and cost - sharing arrangements between
governments and communities are possible.<p>
<p>
	We have then, a strong and multi-faceted rationale for investment, a growing
need and demand, a knowledge base that is ahead of practice, and a multitude of
experiences that can be drawn upon. What, more specifically, needs to be
done?<p>
<p>
<b>WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE</b>?<p>
<p>
1.   <b>Create awareness.  Demystify.  Inform</b>.<p>
<p>
	A great deal of energy must be put into raising awareness about what the
process of child development is, about the deteriorating conditions affecting
early childhood development, about the long - term effects of developmental
faltering on individuals and societies, and about the options that exist.<p>
<p>
	An effort is needed to demystify child development and to overcome
misconceptions that impede actions. For instance:<p>
<p>
	   Child survival and child development are perceived as sequential processes
(rather than 	simultaneous one). As a result, programming to save lives,
usually defined in terms of treating 	diseases, comes first; Programming for
child development, with mental and social and 	emotional components comes
later. They can and should come together.<p>
<p>
	   Health and nutrition are known to influence psyche-social well-being, but
the reverse is 	seldom recognized as true. This one-way view favours programmes
concentrating on health 	and nutrition, with psyche-social development left
aside, or vice versa.<p>
<p>
	   The myth  that mothers are the sole, and always, the best caretakers of
their children 	throughout the early years is associated with the idea that
programmes of care outside the 	home or with other people must be
detrimental.<p>
<p>
	   The naive notion that real learning and education begin at school seems to
have grown 	stronger as the system of schooling has expanded. Therefore
education ministries do not see 	the earliest months and years of life as
falling within their charge, despite strong evidence 	indicating that, even at
birth, children are learning. Educational investment continues to go	first to
educational institutions, beginning with the primary school years,<p>
<p>
	   Related to the previous point is the misconception that investments in
early childhood care 	and education represent a direct "trade off" against
investments in primary school.  Because 	this is incorrectly seen as a "zero -
sum game" a choice seems necessary, and because learning 	is seen as beginning
in primary school, investment begins there.<p>
<p>
	   There is a tendency to think that so - called "traditional" childrearing
practices and beliefs 	are out-moded and need to be corrected or replaced with
modern practices. This biases early 	childhood programmes toward a
"compensatory" model rather than toward a supportive and 	constructive one,
working with the strengths of families and communities.<p>
<p>
	This awareness - raising must involve a range of individuals and groups
approaching child<p>
development at different levels and in different ways. The means used to reach
and involve each<p>
group will vary and the content of the exercise must be appropriate to each.
For example:<p>
<p>
	<b>Politicians</b> need to understand the problem, potential solutions and the
broader social, 	economic and political implications of action or inaction.
Awareness of technical details is not 	so important for this group.<p>
<p>
	<b>Planners</b> require a greater technical understanding, must have a feel
for the specific options 	open to them and need to know about costs. They must
be shown that intellectual, social and 	emotional development of young children
is not simply a by - product of other programmes. 	They need examples of
integrated attention.<p>
<p>
	<b>Professionals</b> may need to be helped to redirect their thinking toward
more supervisory roles 	and toward actions that draw upon experience as well as
on their academic preparation. 	Curricula will need to be reviewed and revised
so that medical doctors in training learn about 	child health and nutrition.<p>
<p>
<b>	Programme implementors</b> (in communities, NGOs, and governments) need to
be versed in 	the art of the possible, in thinking holistically, and in the
various ways in which real 	participation can be incorporated into
programmes.<p>
<p>
	<b>Families and other caregivers</b> need concrete information about actions
they can take in the 	home, They need to know they are the first child's
teachers, They need to be supported with 	knowledge about what they do that is
right as well as about what they should do that they do 	not.<p>
<p>
	<b>National and international funders</b> need examples that help to debunk
myths about costs 	and which show outcomes. They need also to be made aware of
the interdependence of 	survival and development.<p>
<p>
	Mass media can play an important role in helping to raise awareness, correct
misconceptions, and providing basic information about child development. But
more than dissemination of information is required for changes in awareness and
attitude to occur. An active strategy is needed creating opportunities for
discussion, dialogue, experience with alternatives, and participation in all
phases of programming for child development. Such a strategy must build on both
academic knowledge and experience.<p>
<p>
2.  <b>Establish a comprehensive strategy</b><p>
<p>
	Very few countries have a national policy with respect to children, much less
a comprehensive strategy for approaching the integrated growth and development
of young children. The same is true for most international organization. As a
step toward developing a comprehensive strategy, the following framework is
offered, setting out five complementary approaches, identifying criteria that
might be applied when establishing programmes, and distinguishing several age
groups of young children requiring different treatment.<p>
<p>
	2.1. <b>Five complementary approaches</b><p>
<p>
		<b>Strengthening awareness and demand</b>. This approach which concentrates
on the production, distribution, and use of <b>KNOWLEDGE</b> and
<b>INFORMATION</b>, has a degree of urgency, reflected in the emphasis given to
it in the first point under "What Can Be Done?" Unless political understanding
and will are present, unless programmes planners and implementors have a broad
vision backed by solid knowledge and experience, and unless the population at
large is aware of options, actions will continue to be deterred, biased, or
ineffective.<p>
<p>
		<b>Strengthening institutional resources and capacities</b>. Efforts to
strengthen governmental and non-

governmental
<b>INSTITUTIONS </b>working to improve early childhood care and development may
involve setting proper legal bases (including constitutional and legal reforms
as well as strengthening the financial, material and human resources available
to plan, organize, implement and evaluate programmes). New forms of
organization may be necessary to tie together various institutional efforts.
Training will be a key activity, both to provide the kind of awareness and
knowledge stressed above and to strengthen specific capacities,<p>
<p>
		<b>Promoting community development through an emphasis on early childhood
development</b>. This approach stresses community initiative, organization and
participation in a range of inter - related activities to improve the physical
environment, the knowledge and practice of community members, and the
organization base allowing common action and strengthening the base for
political and social negotiations. These activities, although centered around
the healthy development of the young child will be of benefit to the community
more broadly.<p>
<p>
		<b>Supporting and educating caregivers</b>. This approach focuses on
<b>FAMILY</b> members and is intended to educate and empower them in ways that
improve their care and interaction with the child and enrich the immediate
environment in which child development is occurring, rather than substitute for
it. Education and support for parents and other caregivers may be provided
through home visits, in adult education courses, through the mass media or in
child-

to-
child
programmes.<p>
<p>
		<b>Attending to children in centers</b>. This direct approach, focusing on
the <b>CHILD</b>, seeks to Provide conditions for healthy development of the
child outside the home, compensating for or enriching what occurs in the home.
These programmes can take such diverse forms as that of a creche, home day
care, formal and informal pre-

schools,
play groups, kindergartens and child care centers in the work place.<p>
<p>
	Each of these approaches is directed toward improvements in a different level
of the environment influencing development of the child, each at a different
distance from the child. Each approach is directed toward a different audience
or group of participants although all share the over - arching goal of improved
child care and development. The balance among these complementary approaches
will differ according to particular situations, but some attention to each one
is probably warranted in all settings.<p>
<p>
	2.2  <b>Programme guidelines</b><p>
<p>
	A comprehensive strategy requires a set of guidelines to be followed as
programmes are  formulated and implemented, These might include:<p>
	A focus on children and families whose living conditions put them most at risk
for delayed or 	debilitated mental, social and emotional development.<p>
<p>
	Taking a multi-faceted view of child development, seeking integration (or
convergence) of 	programmes in order to take advantage of the synergism among
health, nutrition and early 	education.<p>
<p>
	Seeking community participation that goes beyond superficial or one - time
donations to real 	involvement in planning, management and evaluation of
programmes.<p>
<p>
	Being flexible enough to respect and adjust to different socio-cultural
contexts, reinforcing	local ways to cope effectively with problems of child
care and development, even while 	introducing new ideas.<p>
<p>
	Adopting approaches and models that are financially feasible and cost -
effective, taking 	advantage of appropriate technologies that have proven to be
effective.<p>
<p>
	Trying to reach the largest number of children in conditions that put them "at
risk".<p>
<p>
<p>
	2.3. <b>Different ages and stages require different treatments</b><p>
 <p>
 	A comprehensive strategy must take into account the major differences
that are related to the child development process itself These can defined
roughly as the pre - natal, infancy, "toddler" and post - toddler, pre - school
and primary school periods. Different kinds of programmes will have to be
fashioned for these different periods.<p>
<p>
	3. <b>Work toward partnership</b><p>
<p>
	The responsibility for the healthy development of young children is not a sole
responsibility of families or of governments or of communities or of non -
governmental organizations constituting a "civil society". In order to make the
best use of resources and to cumulate efforts, there is a need for mechanisms
that will facilitate working together by these different institutions and
groups. At a national level, this may mean, to use the term favored by UNICEF,
creating a "Grand Alliance" that mobilizes many groups to work together in
common cause.<p>
	In the long run, however, working toward partnership requires something less
glorious and more difficult than mobilization of many people and organizations
in common cause at a national level. It means creating lasting forms of
cooperation in the field, at the level of the village or neighborhood. For that
to happen, important shifts need to occur that take one beyond simply 'working
together". It means establishing conditions favoring dialogue and mutual
learning (as contrasted with the imposition of ideas). It means joint
participation at all points in a project or programme, beginning with diagnosis
and planning, and carrying through to implementation and evaluation. It means
recognizing that both academic knowledge and experiential knowledge have
validity. It means selecting and training professional and technical personnel
who believe in and know how to work in a participatory way with community and
other grassroots groups. Unless these shifts in the form of work occur, the
empowerment of local groups necessary to work in true partnership will be slow
to appear and quick to disappear, and we will be left with yet another
slogan,<p>
<p>
	Among the challenges implied in the above treatment of "What Can Be Done?"
are:<p>
<p>
	   Moving from a negative and compensatory programme view to a Positive and
constructive 	view, beginning with the strengths in a given environment.<p>
<p>
	   Thinking in a holistic way and translating that thinking into combined
actions. This involves 	using "child development" not just as a concept for
creating new programmes, but as a screen 	through which to look at existing
programmes - to see how new components can be integrated 	into those
programmes.<p>
<p>
	   Avoiding blueprints and magic solutions. Programming to enhance the
physical, mental, 	social and emotional development of young children cannot be
built around the hope of 	discovering a child development vaccine. Fortunately,
a range of available technologies exist 	that can be called upon, some more
appropriate to one context, some to another. In 	approaching this challenge, it
is obvious that a decentralized organization will have an 	advantage over a
centralized one.<p>
	   Reconciling a desire for "scale" with the need for flexibility and the
importance of local 	participation. To help meet this challenge, it is useful
to think of scale as the sum of many 	local or regional programmes, each
distinct, and each directed toward the same end: 	improvement in child
development. In this jigsaw puzzle view, it is possible to envision 	program
effects for large numbers while incorporating the ideas of flexibility and
local 	participation.<p>
	   Monitoring and evaluation. Better ways of monitoring and evaluating child
development are 	needed, at project and programme levels as well as at a
national level. Most countries, for 	instance, cannot provide a profile of the
condition of their children at the age of 5. Such a 	profile might include
indicators of child's health and nutritional states, of pre - literacy and
numerical skills, of self - esteem.<p>
<p>
*******<p>
<p>
	The above treatment of "What Can Be Done?" has been at a very general level. A
fuller treatment would include examining specific ways in which existing
programmes might incorporate missing components onto their on-going activities.
But this paper has  already grown longer than intended. Consequently, the
interested reader is referred to chapters 9 (pp. 193-204), 10 (pp. 258- 262),
and 11 (pp. 302-309) of <i>The Twelve Who Survive</i>. In these chapters,
specific suggestions have been set out, respectively, for incorporating psyche
- social components. into health and nutrition programs, for combining early
interventions with primary schooling, and for integration child care and
development with various women's programmes. In Chapters 6 and 7 of the same
volume, approximately 50 examples are given, illustrating the five
complementary programme approaches distinguished above.<p>
<p>
	Yet another level of reply to the question, "What Can Be Done?" involves a
specification of particular technologies that have proven useful. In the
approach that has been outlined here, little attention has been given to
specific technologies or to trying to identify an equivalent of the "GOBI"
package that helped to drive child survival efforts. Instead, the emphasis is
on identifying local technologies and supporting or adjusting them.
Technologies will not only differ according to the particular environments and
cultural contexts in which children are being brought up but will also differ
according to the age or stage of development of children.<p>
<p>
	It is not difficult, however, to provide examples of particular technologies
that are low - cost and that do work, including those health and nutrition
technologies that affect development as well as survival. Developmentally -
oriented technologies, focusing on the psycho - social development of children,
may be as simple as giving a newborn to the mother immediately at birth,
opening a closed cradle so a baby can see (example from Northeast Thailand),
stressing interaction between mother and child during the breast - feeding
process, or providing para-professionals in a non-formal preschool with
training in the use of a "cognitive kit" (example from Karnataka, India). Or,
part of the "what" and "how" may involve a developmental monitoring instrument
- somewhat similar to that of a growth chart - or a system of lending toys
linked to discussions held when children are brought to a central spot for
weighing (an Indonesian example).<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>A CONCLUDING COMMENT</b><p>
<p>
	In this final decade of the 20th century, we are in an excellent position to
make a major and sustained advance in programming for improved early care and
development. We have sound knowledge and experience and technologies to draw
upon. Consciousness of the importance of care and development is growing
-albeit slowly. That consciousness is indicated by the recent expansion of
early childhood programmes, even in a time of economic retrenchment and
adjustment.<p>
<p>
	In spite of these advances, the level of investment by many national and
international organizations is still low, and their stance is lukewarm at best.
But the fact that we are still at an early stage means that we have room to
shape the process of programming for early childhood care and development,
learning from and avoiding mistakes that have been made in other programme
areas.<p>
<p>
	If a new and conscious and broad - base initiative fails to materialize, we
will continue to drift toward greater, but not necessarily improved, attention
to the developmental needs of young children. Meanwhile, the measured and
dilatory pace of that drifting will deprive generations of "at risk" children
of a fair start in life.<p>
<p>
	But more, failure to act could easily prejudice future generation by allowing
an out-moded, monolithic, socially biased, bureaucratic, centralized, formal
and uncreative model of early childhood care and development to expand, taking
its cue from of a problem - riddled primary school. This trend must be
arrested. Action must be taken to place much greater effort on development in
the earliest years, on social as well as physical development, on family and
community involvement, and on "constructive" rather than "compensatory"
programming. These shifts in focus and organization will not happen by
themselves. And, if they do not begin now, we will soon pass the time we are
early enough in the process to be able to make a real difference in the
organizational outcome.<p>

	The challenge in building strong programmes of child survival, care and
development is at once immediate and long term. In the remaining years of the
century, many pages will be written about preparation for the 21st century.
Many assessments will be made, accompanied by dreams for a better future. In
all of this it would be well to remember that the primary school graduates of
the Year 2000 have already been born and are being prepared for their future
lives. They have already, for the most part, passed the critical period from
ages O to 6. We are then, already thinking well into the 21st century as we
talk about the newborns who will be the dreamers, builders and leaders of
tomorrow. They will be responsible for seeking economic and social justice, for
halting the devastation of our environment, and for building a world in which
neighbors and nations can live together in peace.<p>

<center><b>A Framework for Examining Effects of Early Intervention Programmes on What
Happens in School</b></center><br><p>

	Improved primary school progress and performance is one of the
hoped-for outcomes in many programmes of early intervention. That outcome
accompanies and overlaps such other important purposes as improving
children&#146;s physical health, providing child care for working parents,
rehabilitating children who are disabled, inculcating particular moral,
political, or religious values, and generally improving children&#146;s quality
of life.<br><p>
	 Although it is only one among many desired outcomes, the potential effects on
schooling of early intervention programmes capture the attention of policy
makers and planners seeking ways to increase educational performance and reduce
costs through reduced repetition and dropout. And, parents often expect these
programmes to give their child a  "headstart" easing the transition from
the social world of the home to that of the school and the larger society.
Whether or not intervention programmes really have the schooling effects hoped
for is, therefore, a critical question.  One would like also to know which
programmes have effects and what are the financial and social costs?  These are
particularly pressing questions in the context of dramatic social and economic
adjustments that have occurred in recent years. (Cornia, Jolly and Stewart,
1987)<br><p>

	For children from poor families in developing countries, evidence continues to
accumulate slowly about effects of early childhood intervention programmes on
primary school progress and performance. The purpose of this paper is to
provide an update on that evidence.  A review paper by Halpern and Myers in
April 1985 provides the starting point. That earlier review sets out a
framework for examining the causal logic of investment in early childhood
programmes, and includes a selective examination of basic research, meant to
illuminate that logic. However, the focus of the 1985 review and of this update
is on results of planned interventions designed specifically to enhance the
physical, mental and/or social development of a child in the early years, from
birth to 6. The interventions examined are diverse, ranging from small-scale
nutritional supplementation and stimulation programmes beginning at birth and
involving home visitors, to large-scale public programmes of center-based
preschool education for children from 4 to 6 years of age.  All programmes
reviewed focus on service to poor families.<br><p>

	In this update, the framework used In the earlier paper will first be
discussed and extended. Then, a summary of evidence reviewed in 1985 is
followed by presentation and assessment of additional evidence from studies and
interventions carried out in Turkey, India, Nigeria, Brazil, and Colombia. The
paper ends with a restatement of conclusions.<br><p>

    A long chain of events links early development with adult outcomes such as
employment , productivity, social participation, and family formation. With
increasing frequency, one of the major events in the sequence is participation
in school. One representation of this chain of events is depicted below in
Figure 1, taken from the 1985 paper by Halpern and Myers. The Figure suggests
that enrollment, progress, and performance in school are influenced both by the
cognitive and social characteristics a child brings to the school and by the
availability and quality of schooling. Either or both of these sets of
variables can favor or present obstacles to successful school enrollment,
adjustment, progress, and achievement. In this review we are particularly
interested in a child's cognitive and social characteristics which are shaped
by nutritional and health status and by child rearing goals and practices.
These, in turn, are influenced by the particular family and community situation
in which the child lives as well as by the larger social and economic
context.<br><p>

<img src=fxfig1.gif><br><p>

	Even while focussing on early intervention programmes designed to effect what
children bring to school (as contrasted with interventions designed to improve
primary schools), the framework, backed by a wealth of research results leads
to the position that programme decisions about early childhood intervention and
about improvements in primary schooling should be considered together, not
separately.  Investment in children before they arrive at school helps to
maximizes the investments made in school, especially if there is continuity
between the two in purpose, philosophy, and pedagogy.  The review of programme
evaluations in 1985 strongly reinforced that conclusion and policy implication.
This update will provide additional support for considering early interventions
and primary school interventions together.<br><p>

	<b>A Note on Nutrition, Health Status, and Childrearing Patterns</b>.  Since
the original paper was written in 1985, a number of excellent studies and
review have appeared that further illuminate various parts of the framework.
Of particular note are several reviews that reinforce the importance of
nutritional status in the chain of events, linking nutrition synergistically to
both health and psycho-social development, particularly as affected by
caregiver/child interactions.<br><p>

	In a compact, well-documented review titled,  "Beyond Survival: Children&#146;s
Growth for National Development," McGuire and Austin (1987), focus on
growth promotion, and include sections on mental development, intelligence and
school behavior, school enrollment and grade completion and repetition.  The
authors conclude that,  Better growth is associated with better pre-school and
school-age IQ.  It is also associated with learning-relevant behavior, early
enrollment in school and better school achievement, all of which enhance the
educational efficiency of an economic return on primary schools.&#148; (p.
16).<br><p>

	Another nutrition-related review, by Zeitlin and Mansour (1986), looks at
reasons why some children who live in conditions putting them at high risk of
becoming malnourished, nevertheless, manage to thrive nutritionally.  The
review supports the view that feeding is a social and developmental process as
well as a nutritional one.  It helps to establish the importance of the
relationship in Figure 1 running from  parental childrearing goals and
practices&#148; to  child nutritional and health status.&#148;   A mother needs
to know how to interact with a baby.  And,  The baby&#146;s ability to make its
desires known and to respond to feeding opportunities offered by the mother in
a manner that is not apathetic, excessively distracted, or self-assertively
rejecting, may effect its growth.&#148; (Zeitlin and Mansour, p. 61)  These
observations are supported strongly also in longitudinal research by Adolfo
Chavez and Cecilia Martinez, carried out in a rural Mexican community.<br><p>
	Another area of nutritional research, slighted in the 1985 paper, links
micro-nutrient deficiencies to children&#146;s cognitive and social
characteristics, and beyond, to their performance in school.  Increasingly,
iodine, iron, zinc, vitamin A, and other micro-nutrients are recognized as
having an important effect on the progress and performance of children in
school (Berg and Brems, 1986).  For instance, Soemantri, Pollitt, and Kim,
investigating the effect of a 3-month iron supplementation intervention on
measures of performance among iron-deficient anemic children in an economically
deprived rural area of central Java, concluded that,  "Changes in the iron
status of iron-deficient anemic children were associated with significant
changes in their performance on school achievement and concentration
tests." (p. 1127)<br><p>
	The evidence describing relationships among nutritional status, health status,
and the education or childrearing components of early development, strongly
cautions against focussing exclusively on early cognitive stimulation or
preschool education in programming intended to improve progress and performance
in school.<br><p>
<b>An Extension of the Framework: Three Approaches to Intervention</b><br><p>
	There are at least three ways in which programming can be approached, each
related to a different view of home and school environments and the transition
between them.  Programmes may be directed toward:<br><p>

<ol>		1.	Compensating for deficits and deficiencies<br>
		2.	Overcoming differences and discontinuities<br>
		3.	Recognizing strengths and mobilizing resources<br></ol>

<b>1. Deficits and Deficiencies.</b>  The predominant view guiding
intervention programmes has been a compensatory one, based on theories of
physical, psychological, and social deprivation.  This view stresses
identification of deficits and deficiencies and leads to actions that
compensate for missing elements.  In focussing on what is missing, the
compensatory view tends to overlook the virtues of common wisdom and local
competence.  Often this approach leads to placing solutions outside the home
by, for instance, providing food supplementation or putting iodine in salt or
gathering children together in preschool centers for stimulation.<br><p>
	Deficits and deficiencies are, of course, relative to a set of desired
outcomes.  For example, if improved schooling outcomes are desired, then a
premium may be placed on the ability of a child to speak in a language that is
not her mother tongue or to handle abstract concepts and classification skills.
If these abilities are not present, the child is labeled as deprived --
relative to the school environment.  However, if the same child, at home, is
expected to speak her mother tongue and to handle classification tasks in
concrete situations (please pick the large green leaves), and if she does these
well, she is not considered deprived.  This relativity of purpose is more
important when discussing programmes of early stimulation and socialization
than it is when discussing survival or even nutritional status where expected
outcomes are clearer and less culturally tied.  A compensatory view applied to
psycho-social development and tied to a concept of deprivation defined by what
is desired in school can, therefore, lead to injustices.  That view can also
produce a shift in the focus of social responsibility -- from the family to
institutions outside the home -- and may favor solutions that are inappropriate
to the particular cultural circumstances.<br><p>

<b>2. Differences and discontinuities.</b>  As the field of early childhood
development has evolved, another view, emphasizing differences and
discontinuities between home and school environments has begun to replace that
focussing on deficits and deprivation.  This view does not establish one
environment as superior to the other but, rather, recognizes that different
environments require different skills.  Emphasis is placed, therefore, on
overcoming discontinuities between home and school.  When this view is
translated into programme actions in an enlightened way, changes may be sought
in the home <i>and in the school</i>, in order to buffer possible traumatic
effects of discontinuities and to smooth the transition.  In practice, however,
this approach leads to many of the same results as a compensatory view,
emphasizing only changes in the home or leading to creation of a transitional
institution that is expected to bridge home and school.<br><p>
<b>3. Strengths and Resources.</b>	A third approach to programming, much less frequently taken, places emphasis
on <i>the ability of children to cope</i> with recognized differences between
home and school rather than on overcoming deprivation or smoothing
discontinuities in what is desired and practiced at home and in school.
Indeed, differences and discontinuities may be functional, providing
complementary learning and helping to motivate children to learn.  In this
view, a premium is placed on recognizing strengths in the home environment, on
mobilizing resources relevant to promoting growth and learning in both home and
school, and on  "empowering" individuals and communities to act.  Credit is
given for traditional health and nutritional practices that have positive
effects and for learning that occurs in natural and supportive settings.
Primary responsibility for building a strong physical, psychological and social
base remains in the home and in the community, assisted however by resources
and services arriving from outside.  From this perspective, the family and
community become the focus for action.<br><p>
	In the 1985 review paper, the same attention was given to the important role
of parents and the family in providing children with a proper start and in
programmes designed to enhance early development. 
In this updating of information, however, that role, as represented in
parental expectations and childrearing practices and patterns, needs even
greater emphasis.  Parents not only help to determine the initial success of
specific interventions, but also bear responsibility for sustaining those
effects.<br><p>
	In this updated review of  "early intervention programmes" and their
effect on progress and performance in school, it is particularly important to
keep in mind the three distinctions that have been made.  The point deserves
emphasis because the term,  "intervention" (used in the title and taken
from the previous review), implies an action originating outside the home and
leads too easily to thinking exclusively in terms of  "socially deprived
environments," and of  "compensatory" programmes.<br><p>
	With this extended framework in mind, we turn now to the evidence found in
studies of planned interventions.  A summary of conclusions from the 1985
review of programmes will be followed by addition of many evidence.<br><p>

<center><b>Assessing the Evidence:<br>
A Summary of Findings from the 1985 Review</b></center><br><p>
<b>Evidence from the United States.</b><br><p>
	Their 1985 review of programme interventions in the United Sates led Halpern
and Myers to the following conclusions:<br><p>
<ul><b>Prenatal and infant interventions.</b>   "Evidence from reviews of these
[prenatal and infant intervention] programs suggests that they do have
beneficial short-term effects on parent childrearing behaviors and coping
skills, and somewhat less consistently on pregnancy outcomes, infant health and
development (Anderson, Fox and Lewin, 1983; Halpern, 1984; White and Castro,
1984). Only a few prenatal and infant intervention programs have followed
children into their school years (e.g., Epstein and Weikart, 1979). The little
evidence available suggests that intervention prenatally and in infancy,
without continued intervention in the later early childhood years, does not
affect school progress and achievement. (p.15)<br><p>

	<b>Early Childhood Interventions.</b>  "The evidence suggests that in the
United States context, small-scale experimental early childhood intervention
programs for poor children provide a variety of short- and long-term benefits
to participants and to society.  When monetarized these benefits exceed costs
by a factor of at least 3 to 1.  It is uncertain whether more typical early
childhood service programs, notably Head Start, have the same magnitude and
kinds of effects as experimental programs.  Evidence . . . suggests that the
kinds of effects obtained are the same, but the magnitude is smaller. (p.15)<br><p>
	<b>Primary School Interventions.</b>   "With respect to an investment strategy
focused on improving the quality of primary school instruction for poor
children, in the United States context of a generally well-developed primary
education system, the marginal improvements from such extra investment appear
to be modest.  it does appear, though, that within the K-6 framework, extra
investment is more effective in the lower grades that in the higher grades.
(p.15)</ul><br><p>

	Although this evidence of programme effects is encouraging, generalization
from experience in the United States to developing countries is not warranted.
Why?<br><p>
<ul>	 "The debilitating health and developmental effects of poverty on young
children in developing countries are more powerful and pervasive than the
effects of poverty on young children in the United States.  Poor children and
their families in the developing countries do not have access to the variety of
medical, social and income support programs that buffer the effects of poverty
for families in the United States,  In other word, the preventive and
compensatory work that an early childhood intervention program has to undertake
in the developing countries I greater than that of a similar program in the
United States.<br><p>

	 "The conditions of schooling in the developing countries -- large classes, few
instructional resources, often poorly trained teachers, an inadequate number of
'places' in each grade -- are such that the newly acquired skills that
preschool participants bring to primary school may be less influential than in
the United States in shaping the course of children&#146;s school careers.
When promotion policies are only loosely tied to children&#146;s abilities,
when there is no special education to be  'avoided', and when there are
resources for only 10 or 20 percent of primary school participants to complete
secondary school, positive long-term effects on the course of children&#146;s
careers found in the United States may not be replicated in developing
countries.<br><p>

	 "Nevertheless, it is reasonable to expect that developing country primary
school systems are at least modestly sensitive to the kinds of skills and
characteristics children bring with them; and conversely, that children are
differentially adaptive (due both to physical health and psychological make-up)
to the demands of the school setting.  In other words, the causal mechanism at
work in the United States context may work in similar ways in the developing
countries, albeit much more weakly, and wit many more pre-conditions attached.
Among these pre-conditions would be relatively greater attention to current
health and nutritional needs of children; some minimal level of early
intervention program quality; likelihood of enrolling in primary school soon
after early childhood program participation; availability of a complete primary
school, and at least minimally adequate learning conditions."(p.15)</ul><br><p>

<b>Evidence from the Developing Countries</b><br><p>

	Having reviewed results from the United States and having discarded direct
generalization of these results to developing countries, a major part of the
1985 paper was devoted to reviewing evidence from developing countries.  Most
of the programmes and studies included took place in Latin America.  Three
groups of studies were reviewed.  The first was a group of experimental
nutrition-related interventions with relatively sophisticated designs
reflecting academic concerns regarding the effects of protein energy
malnutrition on behavioral development.  The second group consisted of six
evaluations of preschool experiences, both formal and non-formal, and ranging
form small-scale demonstrations to municipal or nation-wide programmes.  These
were non-experimental evaluations of naturally occurring service or
demonstration programmes in which programme children were matched with peers
who were as similar as possible but for participation.  A third group of five
studies were included as  "programme notes". This evidence came from
reports of what appear to be promising programmes.  However, the reports were
not of sufficient detail to allow the reviewers to examine in depth the
evaluation methodology used.<br><p>

	The 1985 review of evidence from developing countries led to the following
conclusions:<br><p>

<ul>	 "The available evidence of the effects of early childhood intervention yields
a picture of modest positive effects on initial adjustment to the demands of
primary school.  The particular mechanisms enhancing this adjustment appear to
reflect some combination of earlier age of enrollment, improved school
readiness and, more selectively, improved health and energy level (thus,
presumably, attendance as well).  Changes in parental knowledge and attitudes
are hinted at in a few studies, but their contribution to children&#146;s
initial adjustment is largely undocumented.  Only one study reports positive
effects on absolute likelihood of school enrollment; most studies had no data
on this variable.<br><p>
	"The most striking finding suggested by the present review is that structural
features of the primary school systems (promotion quotas, teacher attitudes,
low quality instruction, resource inadequacies, and so forth) seemed rapidly to
overwhelm any early childhood intervention effects.  Children&#146;s individual
abilities and physical integrity still played a role in influencing early
school progress in studies reviewed, but within a much narrower and absolutely
lower range of variance in possible outcomes.<br><p>

	 "The evidence is not sufficiently broad or detailed at this point to draw
conclusions regarding the kind of early childhood intervention most likely to
benefit children (holding quality constant) under the circumstances found in
most developing countries.  A daily educational program, with nutritional
supplementation and health surveillance, were the most common elements of
programs reviewed.  Since individual studies addressed different questions, the
findings across studies were not cumulative with respect to preferred
combinations of inputs and procedures.<br><p>
	 "The evidence discussed . . . reconfirm that for many children in the
developing countries the transition to primary school is a difficult one.  Both
the personal and social costs of this adjustment include continued high primary
school repetition and drop out rates, and consequently another generation of
functional illiterates, an expanding base of minimally flexible and adaptive
human resources, and a reproduction of the survival-oriented parenting that the
current generation received." (pp.28,29)</ul><br><p>
<p>
<center><b>Additional Evidence</center></b><br><p>

	The evidence to be presented below complements earlier results by adding cases
from Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Middle East, and by broadening the
types of interventions reviewed.  Some information is added regarding the role
of parental expectations and practices (see particularly the Turkish study).<br><p>
<ul><b>	1. Istanbul, Turkey</b></ul>

	The purpose of this action research project, carried out over a four-year
period by Kagitchibasi and colleagues (1987), was to study the impact on the
overall development of the child of educational preschool care combined with a
programmed of parental education and support.  Effects of this optimal
combination were compared with effects of custodial child care and home care,
each taken alone and in combination with parental education.  Accordingly, the
251 children in this project are found in six experimental groups defined by
their preschool environment and by whether or not their mothers received
supplementary support and training:<br><p>
<pre>
(1) educational preschool with maternal training     [ED-MT]	N= 27
(2) educational preschool with no maternal training  [ED-NMT] 	N= 37
(3) custodial preschool with maternal training	     [CUST-MT]	N= 40
(4) custodial preschool with no maternal training    [CUST-NMT]	N= 65
(5) children at home with maternal training	     [HOME-MT]	N= 23
(6) children at home with no maternal training       [HOME-NMT]	N= 59
							 Total  N=251
</pre>
Each of these six groups was made up of 3- and 5-years olds (132 and 119,
respectively).<br><p>
	The project was carried out in five low-income areas of Istanbul with intact
families, most of which were nuclear (74%).  Most mothers (75%) were born in
rural villages or small towns.  The mean years of school attendance by mothers
was 5.4.  Two-thirds of the mothers worked, many in factories where the
educational and custodial preschools were located.<br><p>
	Educational and custodial preschool environments were chosen from existing
programmes on the basis of systematic observations (of centers and teachers),
and of interviews with staff.  Marked differences were evident between
preschools classified as  "educational" and as  "custodial" -- in
staff/child ratios, in facilities and materials available, and in the approach
taken by teacher-caregivers.  Children were selected from three educational
preschools and the custodial preschools (randomly after dropping out children
from families not intact, children of the wrong age and children who were
recent arrivals at the preschool).  Once the preschool children were selected,
a comparison group of children was located who came from the same neighborhoods
and who matched the preschool children on age, economic, and family criteria
but who did not attend preschool.<br><p>
	During <i>year one</i> of the study (1982-83), all mothers were interviewed,
all mother/child dyads were observed at home, all preschool children were
observed and tested at the preschool, and home children were tested at home.
Baseline data included information about mothers&#146; childrearing practices
and patterns and their expectations for their children.  Children were tested
using a wide range of cognitive, personality, and social methods and
measures.<br><p>

	During <i>years two and three</i>, mothers of half the children in each
preschool environmental setting were provide with training, through bi-weekly
home visits by trained para-professionals, with group discussions led by
supervising professional staff in alternate weeks.  Cognitive development was
fostered using a Turkish adaptation of HIPPY (Home Intervention Program for
Preschool Youngsters), a home-based enrichment program, with materials provided
for educational activities to improve language, sensory and perceptual
discrimination skills, and problem solving.  Social and personality development
was approached through modelling and discussions of the mother-child
interaction, and by supporting mothers in developing their own feelings of
competence, efficacy, and self-confidence.  Beginning with the second year (when
the 5-year-old group entered school), school grades were obtained at the end of
each semester.<br><p>
	In the <i>fourth year</i>, children were again observed and tested, and school
achievement data were collected.<br><p>
	Over the four years, significant effect of both the educational preschool
environment and mother training were found on measures of IQ and other
measures of mental ability and cogntive skills as well as on school
achievement.  Preschool environment and home training effects were additive.
Results are summarized as follows:<br><p>
<ul>  "The ED [Educational Preschool] group showed a significantly superior
performance on 23 of the measures reported and a nonsignificant, but poistive,
trend on five of them.  By contrast, the CUST [Custodial Preschool] group
showed a significantly superior perforamnce on only 3 of the measures, while
the HOME group never had the highest score.  Likewise, the MT [Maternal
Training] group was superior to the NMT [No Maternal Training] group on 12 of
the measures and showed a nonsignficant but postive trend on 15 of them, while
the NMT group was in no case significantly superior.&#148; (p.52)</ul><br><p>
	Results for personality and social development were not so clear, with few
statistically significant findings related to preschool environemnt or to
training.  Bi-modal distributions complicated the interpretation of
automony/dependence measures.  There was no difference among groups in school
adjustment.  The MT groups were, however, significantly less aggressive than
the NMT groups.<br><p>
	<ul>With respect to the mothers:<br><p>

	 "The mother training program appears to have made a considerable impact on the
mother&#146;s style of interaction with the child, leading to a style that is
generally more focussed on the child, more verbal, less punitive, more
cognitively stimulating, and more supportive of the child&#146;s developing
automony." (p.61)</ul>
In additional, different outlooks and patterns of family interaction were found
with MT mothers more optimitic and likely to share in decisions and activities
with their spouses.<p>
<p>
	Regression analyses were run on the academic average of children, and on their
grades in mathematics and Turkish in the fourth year of the study (third year
of primary for 5-year-olds and the first year for 3-year-olds). The results
indicated that preschool environment, a comparatively high level of
environmental stimulation (as measured by an environmental stimulation index
derived for each home}, and the mother's expectation of competence from the
child, are the variables most strongly and consistently related to academic
achievement as reflected in school grades. (p.65-6)<p>
<p>
	<ul><b>2. India. The Programme of Integrated Child Development Services
(ICDS)</b></ul>
	The Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS} programme started in 1975-76
in 33 experimental areas. Focussed on tribal, rural, and urban marginal areas,
the scheme was designed to render supplementary nutrition, immunization, health
check-ups, health and nutritional education, and non-formal pre-school
education to children under 6 years and to women of child-bearing age,
especially pregnant and lactating mothers. The service now reaches several
millions of children and mothers, mainly through <i>anganwadi</i> centers
(literally, courtyards) where para-professionals are charged with providing
early education to groups of children ages 3 to 6 and with helping to monitor
growth, distribute supplementary food and vitamin A, maintain immunization
records, and, sometimes, to educate mothers. In these activities, the Anganwadi
Worker is assisted by a helper and is supported by a Child Development Project
worker.<p>
<p>
   A. <i>The Dalmau Project</i>. S. Chaturvedi and colleagues (1981) have
carried out an evaluation of the impact of the ICDS scheme on the psychological
and social development of children in one of the original 33 areas, Dalmau,
located in Utter Pradesh. Children in the Dalmau community development block (N
= 214) were compared with children in an adjoining block, Lalganj, which was
not covered by the scheme (N = 205) and which "is almost similar to Dalmau
block in socio-cultural, geographical, anthropological factors, etc. and the
welfare services available to the community, except the ICDS scheme." (p. 154)
Three villages from each block were selected by simple random sampling. The
study population consisted of all children aged 6 to 8 residing in the selected
villages. These children had been exposed to ICDS for a continuous six-year
period. The 214 and 205 children from the respective blocks represented 97
percent of all the 6- to 8-year olds in each block. Children in ICDS and
non-ICDS blocks ". . . were well matched according to the parental education,
parental occupation, number of educated members in the household,
socio-economic status, period of parental company and some other bio-social
characteristics which have an association with child&#146;s mental and social
development." (p. 158)<p>
<p>
	Children were tested using the Raven Colored Progressive Matricies Test and
the Seguin Form Board Test.  Their attendance at school was taken from the
school register and academic performance was rated by averaging marks on the
two previous main school examinations taken (or by the school entrance
examination score if the child had just entered school).  A behavior score was
obtained from teachers using a specially constructed rating scale (maximum
20).<p>
<p>
	Results presented in Table 1 below show that children in ICDS areas were
significantly better than non-ICDS children in school attendance, academic
performance, and general behavior in school. There was also a statistically<br><p>

sigificant difference in the intellectual status of the two groups which,
however, held only for ages 6 and 7. A finding not immediately evident from the
tables is that a significantly higher percentage of ICDS vs. non-ICDS children
went to school (89 vs 78 percent), and entered school at an earlier age (85 vs
69 percent had entered by age 6). The researchers report also that the
differences in school going occur only among girls. In both groups and in all
ages, the percentage of school-going children was higher among males than
females. Male children also entered the school at an earlier age. Gender
differences were more pronounced in the non-ICDS group.<p>
<p>
	B. <i> Lal and Wati</i> (1986) evaluated the effect of the ICDS programme on
enrollment, drop out, and performance of primary school children from 14 rural
villages in the state of Haryana. The 1271 children studied were enrolled in
ICDS in the period between 1977 and 1981. They were compared with 436 children
from the same district who had not been enrolled.  We are not told how the
children were selected for study and for comparison. There is a major bias in
the sample; two-thirds of the 1271 children and 77 percent of the 436 children
were classified as higher caste. Enrollment was operationalized in terms of
whether children were in the right grade for their age. School performance was
assessed by interviewing 28 teachers who were asked to categorize students into
3 groups using a 15-point scale. Teachers did not have knowledge of which
children had attended ICDS.<p>
<p>
	A comparison of enrollment (right age for grade) and drop out of the ICDS and
non-ICDS children is presented in Table 2, within three main categories of
caste. The ICDS children are more likely to be enrolled and less likely to drop
out, within all three of the caste groups. Major differences in drop out are
found within the "scheduled" and "backward" castes; however, the numbers in
these two groups are relatively small. Because the 436 children with whom the
comparison was made came from the same ICDS block as the ICDS children, a
"contamination effect" could be at work to mute differences associated with the
programme.    <p>

<p>
		If, as seems to be the case in this study, the ICDS program can result in a 5
percent reduction in the drop out rate and improve efficiency by increasing the
percentage of children in the right grade-for-age by 20 percent, the program
could affect considerable savings for the educational system.<p>
<p>
   	On the basis of teachers performance ratings, the authors conclude:<p>
<p>
		<ul>"Overwhelmingly, the majority of the children in top ten and middle
twenty were those who had 2-3 years of exposure of early childhood at angawadi
centres. The children who had the exposure in angawadis picked up faster in
the first two years of schooling. Their attention span and retention power was
much superior to their unexposed peer groups. There were observable differences
in memory power, vocabulary, and writing power as also legibility. Housekeeping
qualities in these children were also  par-above.  General discipline,
attendance, cleanliness, behaviour with    teachers and classmates and ability
to express positively better in the  exposed group."<p>
<p>
    3. <b>Colombia, Project PROMESA</b></ul>

   Nimnicht (1988) reports on the intellectual development of children in a
project carried out in four small, rural, isolated, and extremely poor
communities on the Pacific Coast of Colombia. The PROMESA project, designed to
develop a better environment for the healthy development of young children,
evolved over the years since its beginning in 1978 to include:<p>
<p>
<ul>	o	a programme for mothers of preschool children designed to foster the
intellectual developoment of children 3 to 7 years old during their daily
interactions with the children and through the use of games.<p>
<p>
	o	series of projects to improve the physical environment by building latrines,
disposing of garbage, draining stagnant water, controlling animals and finding
sources of good water.<p>
<p>
	o	a community-administered PHC programme to overcome lack of a doctor.<p>
<p>
	o	training of "promotors" as a way of developing local leaders.<p>
<p>
	o	adult education and vocational training to improve income-generating skills
as well as formation of production and marketing groups.<p>
<p>
	o	an early stimulation programme for mothers of O- to 3-year olds.<p>
<p>
	o	a nutrition programme, providing food to preschoolers and nutrition
education to mothers.</ul>
<p>
A "cohort design" was used to evaluate the effect on school achievement of this
multi-faceted programme.<p>
<p>
<ul>" . . .the children came from the same population and were only different in
their ages. Thus, if the program were effective in giving the younger children
more opportunities to learn, then each year, the children in the first grade
should test somewhat better than those children who were in the first grade the
previous year. This should be true throughout the elementary school as the
project progressed . . ." (p. 7)</ul>
		Three related achievement tests were developed: one for the first grade, one
for the second and third grades, and one for the fourth and fifth grades, each
with subtests on mathematics, language and problem solving. These tests were
administered each year from 1980 through 1985. Children in a public school of
an blue collar neighborhood (Sabaneta) of the Calombian city, Medellin, were
also tested, to provide comparative baseline data.<p>
<p>
   In general, the hypothesized Improvement in academic achievement occurred
over time. "The mathematics, language and problem solving scores for the first
grade [went] from significantly below the Sabaneta group to being on a par with
that group. . . . the same pattern holds for all five years." (p. 8) A graph
illustrating the changes in mean scores at the first grade level is presented
in Figure 2. The shaded area represents one standard deviation on either side
of the urban childrens' mean score in the first grade. The white areas
represent one standard deviation on either side of the mean test score far
rural project children. In 1980, the two means are five points apart; in 1985,
rural children had caught up to the 1980 urban norm. We do not from the study
whether the mean for urban children changed from 1980 to 1985.<p>
<p>
<img src=fxfig2.gif><p>
<p>
		Persistence in school was studied using information from a sample of mothers
from the four project communities who were interviewed in 1980 and in 1986.
(The evaluation does not report how the sample was chosen. ) In the interviews
the name, age, and grade level attained in school for each child in the family
was obtained. From this listing, twelve-year olds were selected out for study
because they were old enough to have completed the elementary school and young
enough in 1986 to have been involved in PROMESA. The comparisons, presented in
Table 3 show that school enrollment and persistence is significantly higher for
PROMESA participants than for others, a strong finding given the high
probability of contamination effects for the non-PROMESA children. We do not
know, however, how PROMESA children may differ from non-PROMESA children.<p>

		In the 1985 paper, information was provided (Halpern and Myers, Note 3, p.
21) about a combined nutrition and non-formal preschool programme, called
PROAPE, and carried out with loan funds from the World Bank. In PROAPE,
children ages 4 to 6 are brought together in centres during weekday mornings in
groups of about 100 children for supervised psyrcho-motor activities and a
snack. A health component is also included in the programme. The children are
attended by trained personnel assisted by mothers or other family members on a
rotating basis. The programme was implemented, with some variations, in several
locations. An evaluation showed that 13.5 percent of the project children pass
first and second grade compared to 59.5 percent among non-participants. <p>
<p>
		Several other pieces of information can now be added to that finding. The
first is taken from a review of World Bank nutrition projects (Berg, 1987).
"The academic performance of children with two years' exposure to PROAPE was
consistently better than that of the nonparticipating group, ranging from 2 to
21 percent in three variants of the model." (p. 20) An evaluation of one
variant produced the following figures for performance, drop out and costs: <p>
<ul>		"Of the children who had been in PROAPE, 93 percent in a sample group
completed the first year of school and 68 percent of that group passed to the
second; in the second grade 94 percent of the remaining children completed the
year and 79 percent of these passed. Non-PROAPE children did less well [See
Table 4]. The total cost of schooling (including preschool PROAPE services per
second-grade graduate was about $US50 (or II percent) less for students who had
been in the PROAPE program than for those who had not been in PROAPE." (p.

	A second piece of information comes from reviewing an analysis of the PROAPE
project, carried out in Alagoas in the Northeast of Brazil. The model as
implemented in Alagoas included education, health, and nutrition components.
Children, ages 4 to 6, were brought to centers operated in spaces donated by
the community. For every 100 children there are three <i>estagiarias</i>
(trained para-professionals ) who are paid 70 percent of a minimun salary for a
3-hour workday. The <i>estagiarias</i> were assisted by family members.
Supplementary feeding consisted of a glass of milk, and bread with jelly or
margarine. The project provided training, educational materials, supplementary
food, dental treatment, vaccinations, vitamin supplementation, and visual
exams.<p>
<p>
 	The Alagoas evaluation is of particular interest because it includes
comparative dropout and repetition information for children from first grade
who attended (1) formal kindergartens, (2) an alternative form of pre-school
called a Casulo, or (3) PROAPE, and similar information for (4) children who
did not participate in any preschool experience. As shown in Table 5, 73
percent of the children from PROAPE and 76 percent of the Casulo children
passed the first grade in 1982, as compared with only 63 percent of the formal
kindergarten children, and 53 percent of those without a preschool experience.
Only 9 percent of the PROAPE children actually failed (vs. l6 percent for the
Casulo, 28 percent for kindergarten, and 33 percent for nonpreschool children).
This is so despite the fact that the PROAPE children attended for only 78 days
as compared with a 180-day period for Casulo children and a 2-year programme
for kindergarten children.<br><p>

The Alagoas evaluation also presented cost figures for the various programmes
and for the first year of primary school. These are combined in Table 6 with
the adjusted costs for the first year of primary school (using the differential
pass rates applied to the overall per student figure) to calculate the relative
cost of producing a first year graduate for each of the groups. If the figures
are correct, the combined preschool and primary school cost per first grade
graduate for PROAPE children (including the PROAPE costs) is 17 percent lower
than for a child with no preschool experience and 32 and 39 percent Iower than
the combined preschool and primary school costs for the Casulo and kindergarten
children, respectively. In these terms, the PROAPE program not only paid for
itself but resulted in a primary school cost saving in the first year of 17
percent over and above the cost of PROAPE.<br><p>

<p>
    Before accepting these data at face value there are several questions one
would like to see answered. Do the children in the various groups come from
similar social and economic backgrounds? (In a personal communication assurance
was given that the children all came from the same catchment area and were
therefore very close in their backgrounds.) Is dropout related to differential
background of children and to a differential probability that the children
would have passed had they remained? What percentage of the dropout is really
due to moving to  another location where reenrollment occurred? How long did
children actually attend the various preschool programmes? (It may be that
children classified as kindergarten children actually attended for a year or
less rather than two years so that the cost per student would be lower than
calculated.)  These questions notwithstanding, the evaluation strongly suggests
that non-formal early childhood programmes can have an impact on progress in
primary school and can result in cost savings for the education system.<p>
<p>
<ul><b>5. Nigeria, four studies.</b></ul>
		Table 7 provides information about four studies
carried out in Nigeria, each examing the relationship between preschool
attendance and subsequent educational performance in primary school. All four
studies found that students attending preschools performed better than
non-preschool students in the first year of primary school. Two studies carried
their analysis to differences in the third year of primary.<p>
<p>
		Results from these four studies were mixed, depending on whether the outcome
variable was an IQ test, a researcher-prepared test, or an official test for
year-end promotion. There seemed to be a lasting effect of the early
interventions on tested mental ability (Olatuni). A significant difference on
research-constructed achievement tests was found by two researchers, Imoagene,
Roberts), but not by the third (Olatuni). One found a significant difference
on official tests in favour of those with preschool experiences (Roberts),
another did not (Imoagene). In general, researchers suggested that preschool
effects weakened over time.<p>
<p>
 	Three of the four researchers found strong relationships between social
background, measured in several ways, and primary school performance; one did
not (Imoagene) because the group studied was so homogeneous.  Preschool
experience did seem to improve  "school readiness" significantly (as indicated
by 1. the differences found by Onibokun using an adapted, translated, and
back-translated version of the McCarthy Scales of Children&#146;s Abilities and
2.  the differences found by Olatuni using Raven's matrices). However,
preschool  could not seem to compensate for deficiencies in primary school
environments,  particularly in the poorer quality schools.<p>
<p>
    The results of these four studies are suggestive, but do not help very much
to advance the understanding of relationships between provision of preschooling
and later performance and progress in primary school. Unfortunately, the small
samples and the relatively high correspondence between having gone to a nursery
school and middle/upper social status made it impossible to untangle the two
variables. This has also true for attendance at public and private schools.
This inability to untangle variables is a weakness of many studies that try to
relate preschooling to primary school performance.<p>
<p>
		Another weakness of all four studies their cross-sectional rather than
longitudinal nature.   Nor did the studies take into account repetition and
drop  out, although Olatuni notes, "If preschool education can help pupils to
profit  maximally from the first year -- and the findings of the study suggest
that it  can -- then it could be instrumental in curbing the drop out and
failure rates  which are highest in Primary I, and in helping pupils to remain
bouyant at what  appears to be one of the most difficult stages of their
schooling." (p. 104)<p>

<p>
<center><b>Summary and Discussion</b></center><br><p>

		The evidence reviewed in this paper provides additional support for three
conclusions drawn by Halpern and Myers in 1985:<p>
<p>
		<b>1.</b>	Early intervention programmes can have a positive effect on the
probability of enrollment, on initial adjustment (as represented by repetition
and drop out rates), and on achievement in the early years of primary school.<p>
<p>
	<b>	2.</b>	The mechanisms producing improved enrollment, progress, and performance in
primary school appear to reflect some combination of earlier age of enrollment,
improved school readiness (as indicated by tests of mental and social
development), and improved health and energy levels.<p>
<p>
		<b>3.</b>	Poorer children and children from social groups that have been
discriminated against may benefit more than more privileged peers from early
intervention programmes that are multi-faceted.<p>
<p>
		The update also provides examples hinting that:<p>
<p>
		<b>4.</b>	There may be gender differences in programme effects, helping girls catch
up to boys in circumstances where their primary school entrance and progress
lags.<p>
<p>
		<b>5.</b>	Parental education and changes in parental expectations can play an
important role in aiding improvement in primary school. Supporting parental
confidence and self-esteem may be at least as important in the process of
working with parents as the provision of specific informattion about
parenting.<p>
<p>
		<b>6.</b>	Early interventions can effect cost savings in primary school.<p>
<p>
<p>
		The update provides some evidence that effects might persist rather than be
rapidly overwhelmed due to poor primary school quality as was found in the
previous review. However, only one study looked at school progress and
performance beyond the third grade, and that was a cohort study that did not
follow individuals. Thus, the durability of effects and the conditions under
which they persist or deteriorate, remains to be documented.<p>
<p>
		The evidence uncovered is encouraging. It provides the kind of hopeful
conclusions that should stimulate additional experimentation and evaluation. At
the same time, the available information is still not sufficiently broad or
detailed to draw conclusions about the kinds of early childhood interventions
meet likely to benefit children in the difficult and varied circumstances found
in most developing countries. The different questions addressed, evaluation
methods used, and combinations of programme inputs examined make it impossible
to add up, or even to compare outcomes.<p>
<p>
   There continue to be a number of methodological questions that evaluations
of early childhood programmes need to address.  One of the most difficult of
these is the question of a comparison group.  As long as evaluations continue
to be after the fact, cross-sectional, without an appropriate comparison group,
and inattentive to such basic intervening variables as the differential
backgrounds, economic circumstances, and attitudes of parents, we will have to
continue qualifying heavily interpretations of results.<p>
<p>
		Several inventive ways were devised in the studies reported above for
choosing groups of children with whom programme children could be compared.
However, the choice of comparative groups remains a weak feature of most
studies and reported results too often (as in the Nigerian case) fail to
untangle possible differences between programme children and comparison
groups.<p>
<p>
		In addition, studies do not adjust for "dosage," i.e., for differences in the
amount of exposure to the particular treatrnent(s) being studied. It is seldom
appropriate to lump together children who have been participating in a
programme for two years with those who have spent only six months. It is
incorrect to analyze together effects for those who are present every day and
those who attend only occasionally.<p>
<p>
		We continue to lack evidence derived from longitudinal studies, tracing
particular children over time.<p>
<p>
		In addition, we could profit from evaluations that take an anthropological
view and that follow the process of moving from home to preschool, looking, for
instance, at what a child may lose by attending a preschool (rather than being
at home) as well as at what is gained in terms of preparation for school.<p>
<p>
     From the current research and evaluations, we have little idea how much of
the improvements that seem to be associated with preschool interventions might
be replaced, or increased, or sustained as a result of simultaneous reforms
within primary schools. There is certainly room for experimenting with changes
within the primary school system, in combination with preschool
interventions.<p>
<p>
		Much more work is needed to sort out the effects of "empowering" parents,
much as was done in the Turkish study reported on above.<p>
<p>
<center><b>Looking Ahead</b></center><p>
<p>
		Children who will graduate from primary school in the year 2000 have already
been born. Looking ahead to their progress and performance through primary
school systems and beyond means acting today to assist them in their
development.  The present knowledge base is sufficient to begin constructive
work: on that task, learning as we go.  Sounder studies of programme effects
would enormously help that process, not only by helping adjust efforts along
the way, but by providing a more systematic and convincing information base for
policy makers and planners to call upon when they want to begin or need to
defend such efforts.<p>
<p>
	<ul>	Returning to a previous conclusion,<p>
<p>
		"It is possible to imagine an integrated early childhood-early    primary
programme that has as a central objective hooking children into the formal
educational process [and regularizing their passage through it]. Such a basic
reorientation would require a research and development programme ... beginning
with an examination of what happens to children currently during the
transitional years (4 to 8); what teachers do, why they do it, and the effects
of their behaviour on children."<p>
<p>
       "An integrated early childhood-primary programme could serve as a
vehicle for linking family and communty interests and strengths to the
formal schooling system; for example, infusing the values and content of the
local culture into the curriculum, at first at the pre-primary level, then at
the primary level; serving as a focus for community development energies that,
once organized, could also be focussed on other issues; involving teachers in
the solution of community problems linked to child development but not
obviously part of the formal school system's mandate; reaching parents and
their children with educational services before the perceived costs of
children's participation in a process with ill-defined returns becomes too
high."</ul>

<center><b>Introduction</b></center><br>
	In this paper we review evidence of the effects of early childhood
intervention programs on primary school progress and performance of children
from poor families in the developing countries. The paper begins with a
discussion of the logic underlying investment in early intervention, based on
the situation of children, the nature of the typical primary school experience,
and the value of completing a primary education. We then examine evidence from
the United States that demonstrates some rather dramatic long-term effects of
early interventions, and discuss its generalizabilty to the developing
countries. Finally, we review the data we were able to find from early
intervention program evaluations in the developing countries, and then set out
policy suggestions geared toward establishing a sound program of investment in
early childhood care and development,<p>
<p>
	Before turning to the review itself, several preliminary points require
emphasis:<p>
<p>
	1. We recognize that improving primary school outcomes is only one of many
purposes early intervention programs can serve, Improving children's physical
health, providing child care for working parents, rehabilitating
developmentally disabled children, inculcating particular moral, political, or
religious values, and generally improving children's current quality of life
are other important purposes for supporting programs for young children. But it
is the promise of easing the child's transition from one social world to
another that remains most compelling as an argument for investment in early
childhood intervention programs.<p>
<p>
	2. Ours is a programmatic focus on the results of planned interventions. Our
review of basic research is selective, and is meant to illuminate the causal
logic of investment in early childhood programs. We define early intervention
as activities designed specifically to enhance the physical, mental and/or
social development of a child in the early years, from birth to 6. The
interventions reviewed in this paper are diverse, ranging from small-scale
nutrition supplementation and stimulation programs, beginning at birth and
involving home visitors, to large-scale public programs of center-based
preschool education for children from 4 to 6 years of age; all focus on service
to poor children and families.<p>
<p>
	3. A review of early childhood intervention effects is particularly timely at
this moment, for a number of reasons:<p>
<p>
  a. Programs of early childhood care and development have mushroomed in number
in recent years (Mauras, Latorre, L Filp, 1979; Halpern, 1980; Prakasha, 1984;
King L Myers, 1983). Experimentation is widespread, and in many countries
interventions are already "going to scale. In Brazil, for instance, it is
estimated that coverage for child cafe programs has increased from 1 to 3
million children during the last four years (UN UNICEF/Brazil, 1984), In India,
the Integrated Child Development Service, which began in 1975 in 33 districts,
expanded to more than 800 districts by 1984. By the end of 1985 the program is
expected to have reached 3 million children with preschool education
(UNICEF/India, 1984). From 1968 to 1984 enrollment in Kenyan self-help
preschool institutions increased from 180,000 to 500,000 children (Bernard Van
Leer Foundation, 1984), In Peru, coverage formal and non-formal programs of
"initial Education" increased
from about 140,000 children in 1914 to over 500,000 in 1984 (Fujimoto, 1984).
With literally hundred of small-end large-scale initiatives underway or being
planned, the demand has grown for information about the kinds of programs most
likely to be effective,<p>
<p>
  b. The massive push to universalize primary education in the developing
countries has brought with it renewed concern about dropout, repetition,
differential enrollment (by sex), and generally low performance levels
(UNESC0,1984). Some critics place blame on the child and family, and,
accordingly, seek interventions that would better prepare the child for school.
Others blame the schools, and feel that early intervention investments are not
warranted until primary school systems are improved. We will examine both sides
of this question, as we review the evidence and policy dilemmas,<p>
<p>
  c. Throughout the 1970s international donor interest in early intervention
was considerably dampened by negative or inconclusive findings from the first
round of American evaluation studies. A standard interpretation was that
short-term effects "washed out" (Bronfenbrenner, 1974). However recent US
evidence suggests that important long-term educational and social benefits do
accrue from some kinds of early interventions. As impressive as these results
may be (see later discussion), the question remains whether, and under what
conditions, similar outcomes can be expected in developing countries.<p>
<p>
	4. We view this paper as a point of departure, rather than as a definitive
statement. In the coming months, we hope the paper will both stimulate
discussion and help to uncover relevant sources of information we have missed
in our search. The section of the review dealing with developing country
evidence, for instance, depends far too much on Latin American program reports.
With feedback and additional evaluation results in hand, we expect to update,
broaden, and re-interpret what appears here,<p>
<p>
<p>
<center><b>The Logic Underlying Investment in<br>
Early Intervention Programs<br>
</b></center><p>
	Before directly examining evidence of the particular role early intervention
programs might play in improving school and life outcomes in the developing
countries, we will review briefly the debate on the relationships among child
and family background, school inputs, school progress and performance, and
adult success. In general, this debate concerns the relative importance of
child characteristics and school characteristics in influencing children's
school careers in the developing countries; and the value of schooling in
determining adult outcomes. Figure 1 presents a schematic view of the
relationships to be examined.<p>
<p>
  <b>Determinants of Primary School Enrollment, Progress, and Performance</b><p>
<p>
	A large number of variables have been identified in the literature as
important influences on children's school progress and performance in the
developing countries. We list those variables in Table 1, and then describe how
they intereact in the discussion on the following pages.<p>
<p>
<b>  Child and Family Characteristics</b><p>
<p>
	There is considerable evidence that the physical, cognitive, and social
characteristics a child brings to the schooling experience are important
determinants of the success of that experience. These child characteristics are
the sum of many influences. But for children in the developing countries they
are shaped most powerfully by the consequences of poverty in early childhood--
malnutrition, morbidity, and parental care-giving focused on survival. <p>
<p>
	It has been estimated that 40 percent of the 500 million children under 6
years of age in the developing countries suffer from chronic protein-energy
malnutrition, and 12 percent from severe, acute malnutrition (Rhode, 1983).
Both forms of malnutrition impair children's physical growth, and cognitive and
social development in ways that are relevant to their adjustment to school
demands (Pollitt, 1984, Richardson, 1980). Malnutrition, often acting
synergistically with infection, reduces the amount and quality of learning time
in the early years. Malnourished children are less active, less able to
concentrate on learning activities, and less interested in the environment than
are well-nourished peers (Pollitt &amp; Thompson, 1977). They may also be less
socially attractive to caregivers, further reducing their ability to evoke
positive and stimulating responses from those caregivers and the broader social
environment. For most malnourished children in the developing countries, the
associated loss and reduced quality of learning time in early childhood results
in impaired school readiness.<p>
<p>
	Parents can play a crucial role in ameliorating or exacerbating the effects of
malnutrition in their young children, Decisions to breast or bottle feed in
infancy, management of diarrhea, follow-through with immunizations, and a host
of related parental behaviors contribute significantly to the variance in
growth and health found within populations of impoverished children (Grant,
1985). The way income is distributed<p>

within the family can affect the child's welfare, including nutritional status,
Unfortunately, malnourished children are also likely to come from the most
socially deprived home environments in a neighborhood or community (Richardson,
1980).<p>
<p>
	The cognitive skills that parents inculcate in their children are not always
consonant with those skills that school will demand, For example, parents may
promote primarily concrete use of language and concrete classification skills,
whereas schools demand relatively more abstract and representational use of
language, and classification skills based on more abstract qualities of objects
(Haglund, 1982). There is evidence that explicit literacy-nurturing
activities are not a part of most poor children's early childhood experience in
the developing countries (Pollitt, 1984). To the extent that this is true, the
transition to the abstract and disembedded learning that is typical of
schooling will be a traumatic one for these children.<p>
<p>
	A team of researchers in rural Guatemala has examined the interaction of child
and parent characteristics, as these affect primary school progress and
performance (Irwin, et al, 1978). This basic research was part of a
longitudinal study that examined the effects of nutritional supplementation in
4 rural villages (to be described later). The researchers in this study found
that parents' perceptions of early intellectual ability in their children,
which generally seemed to be accurate, led to earlier enrollment (for girls and
boys) and greater likelihood of enrollment at all (for girls).<p>
<p>
	It was found that parental education levels and mothers&#146;
&#147;modernity&#148; were also associated with parents' schooling decisions
for their children. In a more dynamic vein, the quality of children's home
stimulation during the early years was strongly associated with primary school
performance, especially for boys. (Because a more select group of girls
attended school, there was less variance in their achievement,) It was found in
these generally poor villages that even slight differences in economic status
affected family ability to cope with the costs of children's education. In
summary, the researchers found that under the marginal socio-economic
conditions found in rural Guatemala, parents simultaneously juggled many
variables to estimate the costs and benefits of different uses of their
children's time. Parents appeared to select children for particular roles and
particular futures, in an attempt to optimize inadequate household resources.<p>
<p>
	Child and family characteristics do not just affect the child's initial
adjustment to the demands of schooling, but continue to be influential during
the school years, Poor nutritional and health status during the primary school
years, for example, has been found to affect negatively the child's level and
quality of activity in school, as well as school attendance patterns (Moock
&amp; Leslie, 1984; Popkin &amp; LimYbanez, 1982). The irritability,
listlessness and distractibility of the hungry, malnourished school child have
been widely noted. Berg (1981) reports that in some Latin American countries
children miss as much as a third of scheduled school days a year due to illness
and poor health.<p>
<p>
<b>School Characteristics</b><p>
<p>
	School characteristics also have been reported in numerous studies to have a
significant effect on children's primary school progress and performance in the
developing countries (Heyneman &amp; Loxley, 1983; Haddad, 1979; Schiefelbein
&amp; Farrell, 1978). Regardless of what physical, cognitive and social
characteristics a child brings to school, he or she will not learn much in a
class of 50 children with no textbooks, and a teacher with the equivalent of a
high school education-- a situation not atypical at the primary school level in
developing countries. <p>
<p>
	The constraints on children's progress due to school characteristics are often
straightforward: for example, when there are fewer "places" in each succeeding
grade in a primary school. Empirical research has demonstrated that such
concrete interventions as increasing the number and improving the quality of
textbooks can significantly enhance aggregate learning and school performance
(Heyneman, Jamison, &amp; Montenegro, 1984). What we do not adequately
understand is how teachers, schools, and school systems select some children
for promotion, others for retention; and we know relatively little about
teachers' understanding of their roles and their responsibilities to individual
children.<p>
<p>
	For example, teacher grades are commonly used to promote some children, and
retain others. How do teachers arrive at these grades? There is anecdotal
evidence that criteria are not solely, or even largely based on achievement.
Number of days absent, skin color, dress and social behavior have all been
found to be factors (Filp, et al, 1983). In some settings the child's first
year in first grade may be viewed as a preparatory year, the second year in
first grade as the &#147;real" year (Myers, 1985). It would seem that teachers
have to consider the number of available places in the next grade in school, in
assigning children grades above or below a cut-off point for promotion.<p>
<p>
	Teachers apparently do not blame school conditions--including their own lack
of skills- for high repetition rates (Toro, 1983). They tend to blame parents
or the children themselves. Nonetheless, in one school-level study an
association was found between teachers' observed skills and numbers of children
in a class repeating: the better the skills the fewer the repeaters (Pozner,
1983), Teachers may be more willing to blame school conditions, especially
class size and scarcity of textbooks, for children's lack of learning.<p>
<p>
	In sum, in developing country contexts, both the individual effects of poverty
on children and the macro-effects of societal poverty on the amount and quality
of school resources, seem to affect negatively children's primary school
progress and performance. Which is more important? And therefore how plausible
is early intervention as an approach to improving children's primary school
progress and performance? In our view, both are important. We would argue that
under the conditions described above investment decisions should not be taken
in an either-or framework. Early childhood and primary education investments in
the developing countries will be closely linked in their usefulness and
productivity, Investment in one maximizes the productivity of investment in the
other, especially if there is continuity between the two in purpose,
philosophy, and pedagogy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<center><b>Effects of Schooling on Child and Adult Characteristics</b></center><p>
<p>
	The next important link in our causal chain proceeds through schooling to
changes in individual psychological and social traits; and ultimately to
increased adult productivity. Even if investment in early intervention
programming can be demonstrated to improve children's school progress and
performance, the benefits in adulthood of that improvement in school attainment
are crucial to the logic of that earlier investment.<p>
<p>
	The larger society-level relationship between educational expansion (i.e. more
graduates at each level) and economic development is not straightforward. In
fact, the evidence suggests that educational expansion tends to increase the
number of credentials required for a particular job, and has little effect on
the occupational structure (Waiters, 1979). Nonetheless, for the individual
even minimal quality schooling appears to make a significant positive
contribution to cognitive flexibility and social skills; and to occupational
attainment, particularly initial attainment (LaBelle &amp; Verhine, 1975;
Colclough, 1979).<p>
<p>
	Among the skills attributable to schooling are: selectivity in use of
information; ability to work alone, without family or friends; the ability to
transfer knowledge from one situation to another; the ability to organize
discrete bits of information into meaningful categories; the ability to shift
to alternative dimensions of classification or explanation (Rogoff, 1980;
Triandis, 1980), Schooling may contribute to, and conversely demand, what
Raizen and Bobrow (1974, p, 127) call metacognition in the child: &#147;an
awareness of what one knows, needs to know, and how to get needed knowledge
from external sources (parents, peers, teachers, books, displays, etc.) and
internal sources (memory search strategies)." in other words, schooling may
make a difference in what children do with available information.<p>
<p>
	The usefulness of the kinds of cognitive abilities enhanced through schooling
depends on their usefulness in the child's everyday life, in the present, and
the likely future. For many children "formal schooling is, to a large degree,
the struggle to substitute one kind of tradition (or knowledge) for another
within the mind of the child" (Wax L Wax, 1971, P. 15), It cannot be assumed
that such a replacement is desirable as a social goal (for example, increasing
children's willingness/motivation to achieve, inevitably at the expense of
others). it is a question each society must ask itself, in the context of
ongoing processes of social change and development. It does appear,
nonetheless, that when a child interacts with a greater variety of
developmental settings, he or she has an opportunity to develop a greater
repertoire of skills and abilities.<p>
<p>
	In a review of economic effects of primary schooling, Colclough (1979) finds
that for the individual a modest amount of schooling affects social and
motivational traits in ways that employers find attractive. (At lower levels of
both employment and schooling, traits like punctuality, obedience and respect
for authority may be most important. At higher levels, traits like initiative
and self-reliance
become important.) Colclough notes also Inkeles' work on societal modernization
and its relation to a &#147;modern&#148; outlook in individuals. In this work
Inkeles found both that schooling was the most important contributor to a
modern outlook in individuals, and that schooling effects are "cumulative and
continuous"; even small amounts have noticeable effects.<p>
<p>
Completion of primary education appears to have a positive effect on farmer
productivity (especially combined with other changes in the farming
environment); and on productivity in the informal market sector, It increases
the likelihood of migration to urban centers, a phenomenon rational for
individual families, but often irrational from society's perspective
(Colclough, 1979; Lockheed, Jamison, 6 Lau, 1979). Schooling may also
contribute, in individuals and in the aggregate, to greater technological
adaptiveness (Grawe, 1979).<p>
<p>
	Attention has been paid recently to the effects of schooling on the nature of
parental investment in their children. Completed primary education is
associated with decreased fertility (Birdsall, 1980; LeVine, 1980). Mothers
with a primary education have been found to engage in more appropriate infant
and child health care practices than peers with little or no schooling. Mothers
with more schooling tend to have teaching styles more congruent with those
their children will experience in school. As Laosa notes (1982, p. 800)
&#147;the family and its children develop a characteristic way of dealing with
each other in teaching-learning
situations....to the extent that relational systems of family and school
differ, the child and the school teachers will be unable to draw on a shared
process of teaching and learning.&#148;<p>
<p>
	In sum, a complete primary education is associated with a variety of social
and economic benefits to individuals in developing countries. Most generally,
it provides a credential that is an essential pre-requisite to many jobs; under
some circumstances it also inculcates skills and attitudes that improve
opportunity for occupational advancement, Thus, to the extent that early
childhood intervention programs could improve poor children's chances of
completing primary school, such programs are an investment that is likely to
yield meaningful returns.<p>

<p>
<center><b>Review of the Evidence of<br>
Early Childhood Intervention Effects</b></center><br>
<p>
	Before proceeding to a discussion of the effects of early intervention
programs in developing country contexts, we will review the evidence from the
United States, and examine its generalizability to the developing countries.
Long-term effects found in US studies pose a challenge to international donor
and developing country decision-making,
given severe resource constraints on public budgets, in the face of a variety
of important development needs, in developing countries, Moreover, the US
findings are based on a much more mature body of experience than the available
evidence from the developing countries. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<center><b>Evidence from the United States</center></b><p>
<p>
	While belief in the compensatory value of early childhood intervention has led
to a proliferation of programs throughout the industrialized world, only the
United States has supported a sustained program of empirical research on the
effects of early childhood intervention, At the heart of this research
tradition is a group of small-scale
experimental and quasi experimental studies that have managed to follow both
treatment and control children through their school careers (Clement, et al,
1984; Gordon &amp; Jester, 1980; Gray, Ramsey &amp; Klaus, 1982; Levenstein,
O'Hara L Madden, 1983; Palmer, 1983). Supplementing this group are two studies
with somewhat less convincing research designs, that have also managed to
collect data on children's progress through their school careers (Monroe &amp;
McDonald, 1981; Irvine, 1982).<p>
<p>
	Also relevant to the present review is short-term
evidence from evaluations of Head Start (the major American early childhood
service program) that have followed children into primary school (Harrell,
1983). And we will review evidence of effects of Title I "K through 3"
compensatory education programs (Carter, 1983).<p>
<p>
<b>Longitudinal Studies</b><p>
<p>
	Program descriptions and research designs for each of the longitudinal studies
cited above is presented in Table 2. The experimental/quasi experimental group
of studies were all initiated in the 1960s. Most have managed to limit
attrition, and assure the continued comparability of program and control
groups, The initial emphasis in these evaluations was on IQ effects, and in
fact immediate post-treatment I.Q. gains of one half to one standard deviation
(8 to 16 points) were found for many children in these programs. But these
gains disappeared within two to three years of program completion. This lack of
sustained IQ effects for the experimental programs was highlighted in the
political arena by an early negative evaluation of Head Start by the
Westinghouse Learning Corporation and Ohio University (Cicirelli et al,
1969).<p>

<p>
	Nonetheless, as the children in the experimental studies proceeded through
primary school, evidence of positive effects on adjustment to the demands of
formal schooling began to mount. Now, with the majority of children in early or
late adolescence, there is strong evidence that participation in well
implemented early childhood education programs can have significant long-term
effects on progress through the school career, as measured by promotion, need
for special education, and high school completion. This evidence is summarized
in Table 3,<p>
<p>
	There is little evidence in these studies--except in one, the Ferry Preschool
Project--of enduring effects on school achievement. The Ferry investigators
were the only ones to administer achievement tests themselves in a standardized
manner to study children during their school careers, In the other studies
differences in tests used, timing and procedures of testing may have diluted
what achievements effects there were, Cenerally, there is no clear explanation
in the study reports for the discrepancy between school progress effects and
school achievement effects.<p>
	Likewise, there has been little analysis of the causal mechanisms leading to
those long-term
effects that have been found. One reasonable, but speculative, causal
explanation is provided by Later, et al, (1982, p.64):<p>
<p>
<ul>	Many factors influence and are influenced by school performance, including
children's 	ability, their level of motivation, teachers' expectations and
treatment, and children's 	self-esteem and feelings of autonomy and control. It
is possible that early education 	gave the children just enough of a
&#147;boost" that all these mechanisms tended to operate 	positively. Perhaps
early education taught these children some concrete cognitive skills 	and also
exposed them to some school-relevant non-cognitive skills such as
attentiveness to teachers, ability to follow instructions, and task
perseverance, When 	the children entered first grade they had positive
attitudes towards classroom activities, 	were able to adapt to classroom
procedures, and were able to learn and do the 	schoolwork, The public school
experience, in short, was also positive. The children's 	positive attitudes
toward school were reinforced; they felt competent. In all probability 	their
teachers identified them as competent and treated them as such. Once set in
motion, success tended to breed success....</ul><p>
Short-term cognitive gains were not irrelevant, in this view, In fact, along
with certain enhanced social skills, they were the catalyst that evoked from
children a commitment to schooling, and set children on a positive
transactional course,<p>
<p>
	One of the longitudinal studies, the Ferry Preschool Study, also measured
social adjustment of program and control children on non-school variables.
Program children were found to have less self-reported delinquent behavior,
fewer contacts with the juvenile justice system, and fewer arrests, At age 19,
45 percent of the program group were supporting themselves by their own (or
spouses') earnings, versus 25 percent of control group, Mean annualized welfare
payments to the program group members was $633, for control group members
$1509, Pregnancy rates for women were such that, if there had been 100 women in
each group, program group women would have had 64 pregnancies and control group
women 117 pregnancies during their teenage years (Schweinhart, et al, 1984).<p>
<p>
	The Perry Study was also unique in that it has conducted a cost-benefit
analysis of investment in early childhood intervention. The analysis included
costs of the program (in 1981 dollars, discounted at 3 percent annually) and
costs avoided for reduced repetition, special education, welfare and crime
through age 19; benefits calculated included actual earnings up to age 19, and
projected lifetime earnings based on educational attainment, among other
factors. The analysis found that benefits (to society and the individuals)
exceeded costs by a factor of 7 to 1 for 1 year of early childhood education,
3.5 to 1 for 2 years.<p>

</pre>
<b>Evaluation of Head Start</b><p>
<p>
	A number of short-term
evaluations of "typical" Head Start programs throughout the United States have
followed children into primary school. Harrell (1983) conducted a meta-analysis
of 71 reports of research on such programs, selected from a much larger number,
based on adequacy of documentation, Using mete-analytic
techniques, she examined effects on IQ, on developed. abilities at point of
entry into school (school readiness) and on achievement at the end of the early
grades. She found evidence of positive Head Start effects in all 3 domains,
with the largest effects on school readiness measures (such as the Caldwell
Preschool Inventory), the smallest on achievement at the end of grades 1, 2 or
3.<p>
<p>
	Harrell concludes that Head Start "does, indeed, enhance the cognitive
development of children" (p. 4). But her own data undermine this conclusion.
Harrell reports that the majority of studies employed pre-post designs with no
control group, and that effect sizes found for these designs were 7 times
greater than those found in treatment-control comparisons (.61 vs. .09).
Harrell herself notes (p. 60): "Although controls for maturation were included
in calculating the effect sizes [in studies with no control group] the
magnitude of this gain relative to the others suggests either that the children
gained extremely rapidly or, more plausibly, that the controls used were
insufficient."<p>
<p>
<b>Evaluation of Title I</b><p>
<p>
	Complementing the investment in preschool compensatory education in the United
States has been an investment in compensatory education in the primary grades
under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (now called
Chapter I), Under Title I children in grades K-6 who test below certain
criterion in school readiness and later achievement receive special
instruction, generally in math and reading, principally through "pullout"
sessions with small instructional groups. Poor and non-poor children are
eligible, although monies are targeted to schools with high percentages of poor
children. The cost of Title I per year per participating student is about $500.
(Head Start, a much more comprehensive program, costs an average $2700 per
student annually.)<p>
<p>
	The major evaluation of Title I was the so called "Sustaining Effects" study
(Carter, 1984), actually a compilation of 5 related studies, The heart of this
evaluation was a longitudinal study of achievement for a sample of about 3000
Title I students and about 2500 regular students (some eligible for Title I,
others ineligible). Title I participants demonstrated a significantly greater
rate of gain than eligible, non-participating peers in math skills throughout
the primary school years, and in reading skills until the end of grade 3,
Participants' rate of gain was at least equal to that of "regular" (non-needy)
students, although their absolute achievement scores remained much lower.
Relatively lower-achieving Title I participants benefited less than relatively
higher-achieving ones. Carter reports (1984, p, 7):&#148;By the time students
reached junior high school there was no evidence of sustained or delayed
effects.&#148;<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Infant Interventions</b><p>
<p>
	We will touch on one further group of US studies, those examining effects of
investment in prenatal and infant intervention programs. The majority of these
programs work with parents in the home, and they tend to have a relatively
greater focus on parent education in health, nutrition and home stimulation
than do preschool programs. Evidence from reviews of these programs (Anderson,
Fox, 6 Lewin, 1983; Halpern, 1984; White 6 Caste, 1984) suggests that they do
have beneficial short-term
effects on parent childrearing behaviors and coping skills, and somewhat less
consistently on pregnancy outcomes, infant health and development, Only a few
prenatal and infant intervention programs have followed children into their
school years (e.g., Epstein &amp; Weikart, 1979). The little available evidence
suggests that intervention prenatally and in infancy, without continued
intervention in the later early childhood years, does not affect school
progress and achievement.<p>
<p>
<b>Summary and Generalizability of the US Evidence</b><p>
<p>
	<b>Summary</b>, The US evidence suggests that in the US. context small- scale,
experimental early childhood intervention programs for poor children provide a
variety of short- and long-term benefits to participants and to society, When
monetarized these benefits exceed costs by a factor of at least 3 to 1. It is
uncertain whether more typical early childhood service programs, notably Head
Start, have the same magnitude and kinds of effects as experimental programs.
Evidence from the Harrell review and the two longitudinal evaluations of
service programs (Rome, Georgia Head Start; New York State Pre-kindergarten)
suggests that the kinds of effects obtained are the same, but the magnitude is
smaller.<p>
<p>
	With respect to an investment strategy focused on improving the quality of
primary school instruction for poor children, in the US context of a generally
well-developed primary education system, the marginal improvements from such
extra investment appear to be modest, It does appear, though, that within the
K-6 framework, extra investment &#147;is more effective in the lower grades
than in the higher grades" (Carter, 1984, p. 7).<p>
<p>
	<b>Generalizability</b>, A variety of factors limit the generalizability of
the US evidence to the developing countries. The debilitating health and
developmental effects of poverty on young children in the developing countries
are more powerful and pervasive than the effects of poverty on young children
in the US. (This is not to minimize the harm that growing up in poverty does to
American children,) Poor children and their families in the developing
countries do not have access to the variety of medical, social and income
support programs that buffer the effects of poverty for families in the US, In
other words, the preventive and compensatory work that an early childhood
intervention program has to undertake in the developing countries is greater
than that of a similar program in the US<p>
<p>
	The conditions of schooling in the developing countries-- large classes, few
instructional resources, often poorly trained teachers, an inadequate number of
"pieces" in each grade-- are such that the newly acquired skills that preschool
participants bring to primary school may be less influential than in the US in
shaping the course of children's school careers. When promotion policies are
only loosely tied to children's abilities, when there is no special education
to be "avoided", and when there are resources for only 10 or 20 percent of
primary school participants to complete secondary school, positive long-term
effects on the course of children's school careers found in the US may not be
replicated in developing countries,<p>
<p>
	Nonetheless, it is reasonable to expect that developing country primary school
systems are at least modestly sensitive to the kinds of skills and
characteristics children bring with them; and conversely that children are
differentially adaptive (due both to physical health and psychological make-up)
to the demands of the school setting. In other words, the causal mechanisms at
work in the US context may work in similar ways in the developing countries,
albeit much more weakly, end with many more pre-conditions attached. Among
these preconditions would be relatively greater attention to current health and
nutritional needs of children; some minimal level of early intervention program
quality (to be discussed more fully later); likelihood of enrolling in primary
school soon after early childhood program participation; availability of a
complete primary school, and at least minimally adequate learning conditions.<p>
<p>
<p>
<center><b>Evidence from the Developing Countries</b></center><p>
<p>
	In this section we review evidence from the developing countries examining
whether participation in early childhood intervention programs-- principally
those with an educational focus-- can increase children's chances of enrolling
and staying in school, and perhaps school achievement, We will discuss studies
in 3 groups. The first is a group of nutrition- related interventions with
relatively sophisticated designs and less assailable internal validity. The
second group, largely preschool interventions, are weaker methodologically, but
more generalizable as models. Within the second group are a variety of program
types, ranging from small-scale demonstrations to municipal of nation-wide
service program s, A third group of studies are included that we call
&#147;program notes", These represent partial reports from what appear to be
promising program s, that we were not able to verify or learn more about. As
noted earlier, most of the studies to be reviewed took place in Latin
America.<p>
<p>
<b>Nutrition-Related Interventions</b><p>
The three intervention studies to be reviewed here were born &#147;from
academic concerns regarding the effects of PEM (protein energy malnutrition) on
behavioral development" (Pollitt, Halpern, &amp; Eskanasy, 1978, P. 52). Two of
the three--the Cali Study (McKay &amp; McKay, 1983) and the Bogota Study
(Ortiz, 1983; Herrera, et al, 1980; Super, et al, 1983) included health
surveillance, nutritional supplementation and an educational intervention. The
third, the INCAP Guatemala Study (Klein, 1979; Balderston, 1981), involved only
the health surveillance end nutritional supplementation,<p>
<p>
<p>
	<b>1. Cali, Colombia</b><p>
	In the <i>Cali Study</i> 333 children were selected from a population of 449
potential subjects in the city's lowest income area, on the basis of (1) lowest
height and weight for age; (2) highest number of clinical signs of
malnutrition, (3) lowest per capita family income. These children received
either 1 year of treatment beginning age 6, 2 years beginning age 5, 3 years
beginning age 4, or 4 years beginning at age 3. Treatment consisted of 6 hours
a day of center-based
preschool education, with nutritional supplementation, health surveillance, and
nutrition/health education integrated in to the daily program. Two control
groups were established, one low income, normal weight and height (N = 116),
one high income (N = 38).<p>
<p>
	All four treatment groups in this study demonstrated significantly greater
growth than low income controls in general cognitive ability during and
immediately after the treatment periods. Magnitude of gains was related to
amount (and age of onset) of treatment. Modest, albeit diminished IQ, effects
were found to persist at least up to age 8.<p>
<p>
	The Cali investigators managed to follow the majority of treatment children
and a minority of low income controls up to age 10. Although attrition was a
problem in all treatment groups, particularly the low-income control group,
the Cali investigators report that it did not change the original
characteristics of each group. The McKays report that children followed up (N =
274) have attended a total of 93 schools, many switching schools more than
once, Part of the treatment group had a special primary program designed for
it. Many children, particularly low SES controls, have attended private
"backyard" and &#147;bench" schools, being unable to enroll or stay in the
public system. In these settings children are likelier than in public settings
to be "promoted," even though they may have the least academic ability. In
other words, the demands of formal schooling in this study were not a constant,
with which children with different entering characteristics interacted.<p>
<p>
	With all these provisos, the McKays report that treatment group children were
slightly more likely than low income controls to be promoted through the first
three grades. Tables 5 and 6 summarize school progress for the different groups
through age 10. The Cali investigators also found a significant relationship
between IQ at age 8 and grade level at age 10, independent of treatment
condition. In general, the magnitude of school progress effects was very
modest, in relation to the magnitude of the investment in the early
intervention treatment.<p>
<p>
	<b>2, Bogota, Colombia</b><p>
	In the <i>Bogota Study</i> 443 families from the Bogota barrios, with women in
the first or second trimester of pregnancy, and previous malnourished children
under age 5, were assigned randomly to 1 of 6 treatment conditions: (1) no
treatment, (2) supplementary nutrition from the 6th month of pregnancy to age 6
months, (3) supplementary nutrition from the 6th month of pregnancy to age 3
years; (4) supplementary nutrition from age<p>

6 months to age 3; (5) early stimulation (through maternal tutoring) from birth
to age 3, and (6) supplementary nutrition from the 6th month of pregnancy to
age 3, plus early stimulation from birth to age 3. All families received
medical care. The food supplement was provided in store-like neighborhood
feeding stations, in amounts that would meet all family members' daily needs,
and assure targeting where aimed. (Substitution and re-distribution nonetheless
did occur,) The early stimulation/maternal tutoring consisted of twice-weekly
home visits by trained para-professionals, who focused on modeling of
parent-infant interaction for the mother, suggested play activities, and
engaged in direct stimulation of the infant or child. Attrition left a sample
at age 3 of 339 children.<p>
<p>
	Supplementation and maternal tutoring in different combinations were
associated with improved cognitive abilities in various domains at ages 18
months and 3 years, with the strongest effect found for the full supplemented
and home visited group. prenatal supplementation had a very modest (60 gram)
effect on birth weight. Supplementation was also associated with improved
physical growth at 3 years, The home visiting program had significant positive
effects on the quality of mother-infant interaction (e.g., verbal interaction,
contingent responsiveness, affect) in both supplemented and unsupplemented
groups. Behavioral effects were greatest for supplemented infants, who
theoretically had more energy with which to respond to their mothers' new
skills.<p>
<p>
	The Bogota investigators (Herrera L Super, 1983) report findings for 269
children in an age 7 follow-up
that included anthropometry, administration of a school readiness test (reading
readiness, math, basic knowledge), and data collection on school enrollment,
progress, and performance. Attrition from age 3 to age 7 was not random:
families in which there were higher levels of paternal education were
systematically more likely to have been lost, The follow-up
apparently focused on treatment groups (1), (3), (5), and (6).<p>
<p>
	The school readiness test was administered to 174 children aged 5,6 to 8.7
(scores were adjusted for age). The investigators found a small, but
significant overall positive effect of nutritional supplementation on readiness
test scores (with or without maternal tutoring), Effects were larger at lower
levels of father's education. There were no independent effects of maternal
tutoring on test scores.<p>
<p>
	There was an important effect of maternal tutoring on age of initial primary
enrollment. Mean enrollment age was: 5 years for the maternal tutoring group;
5,6 years for the maternal tutoring/nutritional supplementation group; 5.9
years for the supplementation group; 6 years for the control group. There were
also significant positive effects of supplementation and tutoring, alone and
combined, on 1st grade repetition. Children in all 3 intervention groups
repeated at about a 4 percent rate, in the control group at a 13 percent rate.
There were no significant overall intervention effects on teacher-assigned
grades in 1st grade.<p>
<p>
	Significant positive effects at age 7 were found for supplementation and
maternal tutoring, alone and combined, on height-for-age and weight-for-age.
The positive effect of maternal tutoring alone on growth at age 7 was a new
finding; there had been no effects at age 3. The maternal tutoring effects on
growth were greatest at the lower levels of father's education, Maternal
tutoring alone and with supplementation was also associated with higher levels
of protein and to a lesser extent calorie intake at age 7.<p>
<p>
	Reviewing the whole pattern of findings at age 7, the investigators speculate
that nutritional supplementation has more general long-term effects on
children-for example on level of activity, alertness, social cooperation;
whereas maternal tutoring has more selective effects--perhaps (through effects
on maternal-child
interaction) on children's &#147;familiarity with a school-like
learning paradigm of interaction with adults." They reiterate that the largest
effects in most domains appeared to be found among the most disadvantaged
children.<p>
<p>
	<b>3. Guatemala</b><p>
	While the Cali and Bogota interventions were a mixture of education,
nutritional supplementation, and health surveillance, the <i>Guatemala INCAP
Study</i> was exclusively a nutritional supplementation intervention. It is
included here because it has managed to follow children into their school
careers and because it represents another legitimate early intervention option.
In the INCAP Study (Klein, et al, 1972; Klein, 1979) nutritional
supplementation was begun during the first trimester of pregnancy, and
continued for index children up to age 7, Two rural villages in Guatemala were
assigned a high-protein, high calorie supplement; two villages a no-protein,
modest calorie supplement. The supplement was administered daily at the feeding
stations (in Bogota families took it home), and amounts ingested were recorded.
Total sample size was originally 671 children; about 450 children were followed
longitudinally.<p>
<p>
	The INCAP team report that high supplement intake had significant effects on
birth weight; on children's physical growth (height and weight) up to age 7;
and on children's cognitive development up to age 3. (There is some debate
about whether the calories or protein were more important.) Cognitive effects
appeared to decrease in magnitude and generality beyond age 3, High supplement
intake had no significant effect on verbal development at ages 5, 6, or 7, on
early school progress, or on school performance. In 3 of the 4 participating
villages in which parental education levels were moderately higher amount of
supplement intake was predictive of likelihood of school enrollment. (Klein,
1979; Balderston, 1981,) The apparent mechanism at work here was parents with a
more positive perception of the utility of schooling, selecting their bigger,
healthier children for enrollment,<p>
<b>Preschool Intervention Studies</b><p>
<p>
     The next group of studies to be summarized were non-experimental
evaluations of naturally occurring service/demonstration programs, In these
studies children were not assigned to treatment conditions. Rather, the
investigators identified groups of children already participating in an early
intervention program; attempted to match them to peers  who were similar but
for participation; and prospectively or retrospectively followed both groups
into the early primary school years. The findings of these studies should be
viewed cautiously. Frequently, participating children and comparison group
peers seem to be drawn from different populations, and thus may be initially
different in important characteristics. Measures used are often not identified;
when identified, psychometric properties and administration procedures are
often not described, Children are often dispersed non-randomly to many primary
schools: thus differences in promotion criteria may bias findings. Finally; the
studies tend to focus only on initial adjustment to primary
school.<p>
<p>
	In spite of the design limitations this group of studies sheds light an many
of the factors that influence children's early school careers in developing
countries. As with the nutrition-related interventions, most of the studies to
be reported here took place in Latin America, We also report results from
Morocco and Althone, South Africa,<p>
<p>
	<b>1. A Four-Country Study: Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Colombia</b><br>
<b>Filp and Scheifelbein</b> (1982) report on a study coordinated
across Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia, in which children who were
enrolled in preschools and kindergartens were compared with 1St grade peers who
had not participated. Outcomes examined included age of enrollment, readiness
at start of grade 1, promotion, and reading/writing ability at end of first
grade, The investigators also examined whether the &#147;socio economic status"
(SES level) of preschools and primary schools--based on students' family
backgrounds--was associated with particular kinds of teaching/learning
experiences; whether teaching/learning approaches were generally different in
preschool (or kindergarten) and 1st grade classrooms; and what prior
characteristics of children generally affected the outcomes being examined.<p>
<p>
	To construct their samples, the investigators in each country started with
preschool and kindergarten <i>classes</i> that operated either half- or full- day; 40
classes from Argentina, 52 from Bolivia, 62 from Colombia, and 40 from Chile.
This gave them an original sample of 2595 children ages 4-7, about 40 percent
of whom were poor. Between the end of the preschool/kindergarten year and
enrollment in 1st grade the investigators lost half of their original sample of
children. In 1st grade they identified an additional sample of children who had
participated in preschool, and a sample of non-participant peers, drawn from
the same and other 1st grade classes.<p>
	Given this general design and the enormous attrition from preschool to grade
1, it is probable that the treatment and control samples of children differed
significantly on prior characteristics, Indeed, Filp and Scheifelbein note that
participants in Chile and Argentina were at slightly higher SES levels within
general SES groups than non-participants. Nonetheless, this was a relatively
rich and complicated study, with a number of interesting findings.<p>
<p>
	Preschool observations revealed that the socio-economic make-up of the
population served in each country affected the nature of children's experiences
somewhat differently. In Argentina, preschools serving wealthier children had
smaller class sizes, and more active, child-centered learning, In Chile there
were no class size differences, but as in Argentina, teachers assumed a more
didactic role in preschools serving poor children, In Colombia, preschools
serving the poor had less well-prepared teachers, In Bolivia there were few
differences by children's SES. Preschool in Chile and Argentina tended to
reflect rehersal for first grade. In Bolivia especially, but also in Colombia,
children's health and nutritional needs, being more pressing, received
relatively more attention. In general, the higher the per capita income of the
country, the greater the differentiation in preschool services by students'
SES.<p>
<p>
	In all 4 countries, preschool/kindergarten was more child-centered, and
children received more individualized attention, than in first grade, There was
greater similarity in teaching/learning processes in first grade across all 7
countries, than in preschool, Filp and Scheifelbein also report that even when
located in the same building preschool/kindergarten and 1st grade classes were
very different in atmosphere.<p>
<p>
	Participation in preschool/kindergarten was found to have significant positive
effects on age of 1st grade enrollment across social class (but especially for
lower SES children) and urban/rural populations in Argentina and Chile;
negligible effects were found in Colombia and Bolivia. Participation likewise
bad significant positive effects an school readiness at entry into first grade
in Argentina and Chile, but not in Colombia and Bolivia. (Preschool
participants in Colombia and Bolivia appeared to be significantly more likely
than those in Argentina and Chile to have to wait 1-3 years to enroll in 1st
grade after participation in a preschool program.) Within the lower SES groups
of children, other predictors (than preschool) of school readiness included
number of siblings, birth order, housing, and nutritional status.<p>
<p>
	Preschool/kindergarten participation had a significant positive effect on
promotion in Argentina: among low SES urban children 12 percent with preschool
versus 27 percent without were retained in 1st grade; among low SES rural
children 36 percent with versus 77 percent without were retained. There was
also a significant positive effect on dropout rates. Findings from Colombia
were also positive: among low SES children in 3 cities an average 10 percent
with preschool versus 27 percent without preschool were retained in 1st grade
(Chile had a policy of automatic promotion at the time of the study. There were
no Bolivian data,)<p>
<p>
	Preschool effects on reading and writing ability at end of 1st grade differed
from country to country, The Argentine investigators found significant positive
effects of preschool participation across social class levels. Positive effects
were also found in Bolivia, except for marginal urban neighborhoods. In
Colombia and Chile preschool effects on developed abilities were negligible.<p>
<p>
	In summary, participation in preschool, while it did not eliminate or even
narrow social class differences, did appear to affect positively age of
enrollment and promotion, within social class, with benefits being greatest for
low SES rural children. There were significant effects on school readiness at
beginning of 1st grade, although these were more selective. There was also
selective evidence of effects on developed abilities. Important covariates of
all four dependent variables were family size, parental education, and physical
health of the children. Preschool effects were attenuated, not surprisingly,
when children had to wait 1 or more years to enroll in 1st grade,<p>
	<b>2. Fortaleza, Brazil</b><br>
	<b>Feijo</b> (1983) reports on a study in Fortaleza, Brazil, similar to but
better designed than the 4 nation study discussed above, She followed until the
end of 1st grade 57 low income children who attended part-time public
kindergarten (at ages 6 and 7) for a year and 70 who tried to enroll in the
same kindergartens but could not, due to lack of space. She was able
retrospectively to match treatment children with control peers on sex, age,
birth order, and number of siblings. Pre- and post-tests (language, reading,
math) were administered to all children during the kindergarten year and in 1st
grade. There was almost no attrition, but upon entry into 1st grade the
children were scattered among 8 schools and 26 classes in different parts of
the city. Fourteen control children were converted into a second treatment
group, receiving a short preparation course before 1st grade.<p>
<p>
	No significant group differences were found on pre- or post-test scores in
kindergarten or 1st grade for most measures. One test, an "Interactive Beading
Assessment" yielded modest differences in favor of the kindergarten group.
Significant findings were found for promotion to 2nd grade: in the kindergarten
group 64 percent were promoted; in the short-training group 50 percent were
promoted; in the control group 34 percent were promoted. Females seemed to
benefit most from the kindergarten experience,<p>
<p>
	<b>3. Peru: The Puno Project and Its Extension</b><br>
<b>Myers and colleagues</b> (1985) report on a multi-faceted evaluation
of a large-scale, government-sponsored
preschool education program in Peru. In the program, 3 to 5 year old children
are brought together for 3 hours, 4 or 5 mornings a week in centers called
PRONOEI (Programas No-Formal de Education Inicial). They receive education and
care from a minimally trained community volunteer as well as a snack and/or noon-time
meal, Mothers prepare a daily snack and/or noontime meal. The volunteer, who is
selected by the community and receives a modest stipend, is supervised by
Ministry of Education staff.<p>
<p>
	The PRONOEI program, which originated in the early 1970s, was seen by the
Peruvian government as a realistic means of reaching Peru's poor children with
preschool services, and as a catalyst for broader community participation.
PRONOEI coverage grew steadily from 1975 to 1985, with coverage currently
approaching 200,000 children in 6000 small centers, served by 8000
"promotores," and 800 "coordinadores&#148; Current coverage represents about 10
to 15 percent of the 3 to 5 year old population.<p>
<p>
     In 1984, an evaluation was carried out of approximately 2000 PRONOEI
receiving assistance from USAID and UNICEF (as well as from the Peruvian
government). The evaluation found a modest, but significant impact on the
cognitive, social and motor development of participating children in some,
though not all, of the communities studied (see below). Moderate and indirect
effects were found on the nutritional status of children, There were also some
community-level effects; specifically, the program served as a catalyst for
creation of new community groups-- mothers' clubs, parent associations, and
nutrition clubs; and also affected the topics of discussion in community
meetings. However, no significant effects of PRONOEI participation were found
on primary school repetition rates.<p>
<p>
	The evaluation design included: interviews with parents, volunteers and
community leaders in 148 PRONOEI communities; detailed observations of daily
activity in 12 PRONOEI; tests administered to 334 children in 26 matched
PRONOEI and non-PRONOEI villages in 3 states, including a sample of formal
preschool participants; analysis of children's PRONOEI and lst grade school
records; height and weight measurements; and parent interviews for tested
children. Communities were selected using a stratified random sampling
procedure; stratification was based on accessibility, socio-economic
characteristics, and program duration, The test used was criterion-referenced,
and was specially designed to reflect PRONOEI curriculum objectives, as well as
general developed abilities in the psychomotor, intellectual and social
domains.<p>
<p>
	Children attending PRONOEI were compared with children of the same ages from
non-PRONOEI villages in each of three Peruvian states-- Puno, Cuzco, and San
Martin. An attempt to match children in terms of their social backgrounds-was
successful for the Puno children; but in the latter two states parents of
non-PRONOEI children were more apt to have completed primary school. Results of
the PRONOEI/non-PRONOEI comparison were most promising for Puno, where the two
groups were matched, and where the program is the most mature (11 years in
operation) and most widespread (in over 1000 rural communities). In Puno, in
both Aymara- and Quechua- speaking areas, PRONOEI children performed
significantly better than non-PRONOEI children on the intellectual, social, and
motor sub-scales of the test administered. These differences were found in
spite of an evaluation finding that the quality of the PRONOEI program was
generally low, as judged by the teaching skills of the promoters, the time
devoted to educational activities, the availability and use of materials, and
the quality of supervision of the promoters by Ministry of Education staff,<p>
<p>
	No effects of PRONOEI participation were found on promotion from 1st to 2nd
grade, or from 2nd to 3rd grade. Effects favoring PRONOEI participants were
found on age of enrollment. Repetition of 1st grade was extraordinarily
high--over 50 percent--in the PRONOEI and the control villages in the sample,
Moreover, 25 percent of children who repeated did so more than once. In some
communities, repetition rates for 1st grade approached 100 percent. The
evaluation team was not able to examine the reasons for these extraordinary
repetition rates, These were largely rural regions, where repetition is usually
highest, As discussed earlier, repetition rates like these are often
structural--inherent in the local school situation, minimizing the role of
individual characteristics or abilities in determining children's promotion.<p>
<p>
	The above findings are largely, but not wholly, consistent with results from
two earlier studies in Puno (Aliaga, 1981, 1983). The first of the studies
examined grades assigned by teachers to PRONOEI and non-PRONOEI children, and
found no differences. The second involved administration of a special test of
mathematical and language ability to primary school children who bad
participated in the PRONOEI program and a control group of peers. No
differences were found between the two groups.<p>
<p>
	The PRONOEI experience illustrates the importance of a coordinated investment
strategy linking expansion of preprimary education to qualitative improvement
of primary education. It also illustrates the complex relationship between
quality and coverage in the growth of early childhood intervention programs in
the developing countries. Is it appropriate, for example, to promote a national
early childhood service program, even one based on significant community
contributions (i.e., the volunteer teachers), when the technical resource
back-up for that program is not dependable? What quality and quantity of work
is reasonable to expect of the community volunteer, in any case? Could a
community-based program target particular children for service, and deny
others? Among the more interesting recommendations of the evaluation team:
establish an intermediate, paid role--the assistant teacher/coordinator--for
volunteers to aspire to; use early morning radio spots to help the volunteers
plan daily activities; use experienced volunteers to help adjust the curricular
guides.<p>
	<b>4. Morocco: Modern and Quranic Preschools</b><p>
	Wagner and colleagues (1984) are currently conducting a longitudinal study of
literacy acquisition in Morocco, for which they have followed children with
different early childhood experiences into their primary school careers, Their
sample consists of 378 children from 5 groups: an rural group and an urban
group who participated in Quranic preschool programs; an urban group who
participated in modern preschool programs; and an urban group and a rural group
with no preschool program experience. In constructing their original samples
the investigators controlled for social class; they report that the modern
preschool group comes from families more likely to be employed in the modern
sector, (The "preschool" programs involved typically serve children 5 to 7
years old, in that sense being more like kindergarten. In Morocco, about 30
percent of children 5 to 7 are enrolled in Quranic preschools, and about 15
percent in modern kindergartens.<p>
<p>
	The investigators are administering a battery of achievement and general
ability tests to children at the end of each grade, as well as documenting
promotion patterns. They are currently analyzing data from the second year of
primary school. Analyses of 1st grade achievement data indicated that rural
Quranic preschool children performed significantly better than non-preschool
peers on most achievement/ability test scales, In the urban setting group
differences were less clear-cut; the modern preschool group performed
moderately better than the other two on most tasks, but few differences were
found between Quranic preschool and non-preschool groups. Second grade
analyses, currently underway, suggest some attenuation of the findings in both
rural and urban areas, though the investigators warn that these findings are
tentative.<p>
<p>
	With respect to promotion rates, the investigators found no group differences
among the five groups. This was somewhat surprising, given differences between
the two rural groups and between rural and urban groups more generally in
reading readiness and other test scores, The investigators suggest that the
politics of schooling and a quota system for promotions may "obscure all but
the most general differences in academic achievement and skill development"
(Wagner &amp; Spratt, l984, p, 9).<p>
<p>
	<b>5. Althone, South Africa</b><p>
	Short (1985) reports on a Bernard van Leer Foundation supported initiative in
Althone, South Africa, The program, called the Early Learning Center (ELC),
served mainly disadvantaged "colored" children (classified as mixed race), Its
main component was a daily 6 hour center- based preschool program for 3 to 6
year olds, that included health surveillance and nutrition supplementation,
Children participated from 1 to 3 years. At the end of 1st grade ELC
participants and untreated school peers (selection strategy and number sampled
not reported) were administered the Pupil Behavior Inventory (Sarri and Radin).
Positive effects favoring ELC children were found on inquisitiveness, social
adjustment and motivation, but not on academic-task-related behavior. By age
15, 40 percent of a sample of 60 ELC participants had reached Standard 8 (grade
10) without repeating a grade, compared with a national norm for coloreds of 25
percent. By age 17, 32 percent had entered Standard 10 without repeating,
compared with the colored norm of 10 percent, Girls benefited from the ELC
program more than boys, and moderately deprived children more than severely
deprived children.<p>

	<b>6. Osorno. Chile</b><p>
	Walker (1983) and Richards (1985) report; on an evaluation of the Parents and
Children Program (Programa Padres Hijos) in Osorno, a rural area of central
Chile, In the program, which has been implemented in 52 rural communities,
locally chosen volunteers, acting as facilitators, brought participating
parents together on a weekly basis to discuss problems related to childrearing,
The problems and concerns raised by parents were then used as the basis for
preparation of a series of radio dramas. Ongoing weekly meetings were keyed to
radio broadcasts designed to complement discussions. Local facilitators also
were provided with worksheets for parents to use with their children. The idea
underlying the program was to improve child development through improved
community organization and personal development of parents, as well as through
parent education for childrearing.<p>
<p>
	The evaluators report that in 1st grade, teachers (who did not know the
children's history) were asked to rate the reading skills (not specified) of a
sample of 29 children of participating mothers and 49 peers (selection
procedures not described). Nineteen percent of the treatment children were
rated as excellent readers versus II percent of controls; 52 percent were rated
as good readers versus 35 percent of controls; 31 percent as fair readers
versus 44 percent of controls; and none as poor readers versus 12 percent of
controls. Treatment children also performed better than untreated peers on a
Draw-A-Figure test,<p>
<p>
<b>Program Notes</b><p>
<p>
	Thus far, we have reported evidence from evaluations whose methods as well as
results could be examined. In the course of our inquiries, however, we
encountered brief reports of evaluation findings for which we were not able to
acquire full reports that included program descriptions and research designs
(at least in time for this review), We nevertheless present these unverified
reports here. Taken together they suggest the same uneven, but promising,
pattern of results reported thug far.<p>
<p>
	<b>Note 1: Haiti</b><p>
	A follow-up study was undertaken of children who participated in a preschool
project funded by USAID and implemented by CARE-Haiti. The preschools were set
up as an element of Community Integrated Nutrition and Education Centers
(CINEC), themselves created in communities where the World Bank was funding the
construction of new primary schools, The CINEC project team reports that 86
percent of the preschool participants have completed the 4th year of primary
school, compared with a &#147;general" completion rate of 30 percent, An
earlier progress report from the same project indicated that CINEC (not
differentiated from preschool) children had a promotion rate of 87 percent,
compared with a &#147;general&#148; rate of 37 percent. Moreover, "school
directors and the first grade teachers unanimously agree that the CINEC
children are more alert, more eager to learn, and better assimilate the
different concepts of math, reading, and writing" (CARE, Haiti, 1982).
Nonetheless, one reviewer of the earlier progress report suggested that CINEC
and non-CINEC children attending the same primary school had about the same
repetition rate, suggesting that primary school effects may be attributable to
differences in primary schools as much as differences in children.<p>
<p>
	<b>Note 2: Brazil</b><p>
	An audio-visual presentation from the UNICEF office in Brazil dealing with
preschool education includes figures from a study carried out in Rio de Janeiro
involving approximately 1000 children. The researchers in this study apparently
found that 28 percent of children with preschool program experience failed
first grade versus 60 percent without preschool experience. Again, we do not
know how these two groups compare in background characteristics.<p>
<p>
	<b>Note 3: Brazil</b><p>
	Since 1977, a portion of a World Bank nutrition loan to Brazil has been used
to support early childhood education and supplementary feeding for 4 to 6 year
olds, These activities have been carried out through PROAPE (Programa de
Alimentacao do Pre-escolar), with the goal of enhancing  school participation
rates and school achievement, The following comes from a report on the lessons
learned from this World Bank project: "A careful evaluation of the CEAPE
program (the prototype for PROAPE) in the Municipio de Leme in Sao Paulo)
suggested that....school performance scores were better and repetition rates
were lower among CEAPE children" (p.13),<p>
<p>
	Further: "The percentage of former PROAPE participants who passed in the first
and second years of elementary school was 73.5 percent compared with only 59.5
percent in the control group. In terms of academic performance, children with
two years exposure to PROAPE performed consistently better than control
groups."<p>
<p>
	<b>Note 4: Malaysia</b><p>
	A study carried out in Malaysia by the Ministry of Education (with funds from
UNICEF)to examine the effects of preschool attendance on primary school
achievement &#147;,..seems to have established that children attending
kindergartens perform better than other children in the early stages of primary
schooling. How much this is due to what they learn in the Kindergarten and how
much can be attributed to the fact that they are a selected group is not clear
at present" (Crellin, , p.2).<p>
<p>
	<b>Note 5: Bangladesh</b><p>
	The following comes from a USAID project identification document discussing
females' access to education: &#147;The Meher Universal Primary Education
Project in Bangladesh expanded educational opportunities by establishing
small-scale feeder schools serving as preschools and early primary centers,
employing local women teachers thus lessening the burden on the crowded first
grade of the established primary school, increasing female participation rates
and reducing wastage rates" (USAID, 1984, P. ).<p>
<p>
<b>Summary of Evidence from the Developing Country Studies</b><br><p>
As we noted at the outset, this review is a first attempt at drawing
defendable generalizations about the effectiveness of early childhood
interventions in enhancing children&#146;s school careers in the developing
countries. We have pointed out many of the limitations of available evidence,
and will not reiterate them here, except to note that these limitations imply a
need for international donors to support a careful program of research and
development in this general area. Limitations not withstanding, we are able to
draw some "first order" conclusions.<p>
<p>
	The available evidence of the effects of early childhood intervention yields a
picture of modest positive effects on initial adjustment to the demands of the
primary school. The particular mechanisms enhancing this adjustment appear to
reflect some combination of earlier age of enrollment, improved school
readiness and more selectively, improved health and energy level (thus,
presumably, attendance as well). Changes in parental knowledge and attitudes
are hinted at in a few studies, but their contribution to children's initial
adjustment is largely undocumented. Only the INCAP study reports positive
effects on absolute likelihood of school enrollment; most studies had no data
on this variable.<p>
<p>
	The most striking finding suggested by the present review is that structural
features of the primary school systems (promotion quotas, teacher attitudes,
low quality instruction, resource inadequacies, and so forth) seemed rapidly to
overwhelm any early childhood intervention effects. Children's individual
abilities and physical integrity still played a role in influencing early
school progress in studies reviewed, but within a much narrower and absolutely
lower range of variance in possible outcomes.<p>
<p>
	The evidence is not sufficiently broad or detailed at this point to draw
conclusions regarding the kind of early childhood intervention most  likely to
benefit children (holding Quality constant) under the  circumstances found in
most developing countries. A daily educational  program, with nutritional
supplementation and health surveillance, were the  most common elements of
programs reviewed, Since individual studies addressed different questions, the
findings across studies were not cumulative with respect to preferred
combinations of inputs and procedures.<p>
<p>
	There is suggestive evidence in a few studies that relatively more deprived
children benefited more cognitively and socially than their less deprived
peers, Unfortunately, these same children were also more likely to attend the
poorest quality primary schools, making these effects short-lived.<p>
<p>
<b><center>Policy Dilemmas:<br>
Toward a Reasonable Program of Investment</center></b><p>
<p>
	The evidence discussed in this review reconfirms that for many children in the
developing countries the transition to primary school is a difficult one, Both
the personal resources that children bring to school and the conditions of
primary schools themselves present obstacles to a successful adjustment, The
personal and social costs of this poor adjustment include continued high
primary school repitition and dropout rates, and consequently another
generation of functional illiterates, an expanding base of minimally flexible
and adaptive human resources, and a reproduction of the survival-oriented
parenting that the current generation received, This likely scenario leads us
to suggest that improving poor children's adjustment to primary school should
be a central policy goal of developing country governments and international
donors during the remainder of this decade at least.<p>
<p>
	Within such a framework, early childhood intervention programs have a number
of modest, but crucial, roles to play, The first and most obvious is to improve
poor children's skills and energy to cope with the cognitive and social demands
of formal schooling as a developmental setting; as in the US case, to assure a
more positive initial school experience, A positive initial school experience
can boost a child's psychological capacity to cope with subsequent school
demands, including those created by school system dysfunctionalities. <p>
<p>
	A second role for early childhood interventions is to provide pedagogical
models for early primary practice; to extend the early childhood practitioner's
view of children's needs, and consequently the role of the teacher implied by
such needs, into the first two years of the primary school.<p>
<p>
	In a more ambitious vein, it is possible to imagine an integrated early
childhood-early primary program that has as a central objective hooking
children in to the formal educational process. Such a basic reorientation would
require a research and development program-- funded by international donors in
most cases-- that that began with an examination of what happens to children
currently during the transitional years (5 to 8); what teachers do, why they do
it, and the effects of their behavior on children.<p>
<p>
	An integrated early childhood-primary program could serve as a vehicle for
linking family and community interests and strengths to the formal schooling
system; for example, infusing the values and content of the local culture into
the curriculum, at first at the preprimary then at the primary level; serving
as a focus for community development energies that, once organized, could also
be focused on other issues; involving teachers in the solution of community
problems linked to child development but not obviously part of the formal
school system's mandate; reaching parents and their children with educational
services before the perceived costs of children's participation in a process
with ill-defined returns becomes too high.<p>
<p>
	Beyond envisioning an integrated early childhood-primary program lie a number
of thorny problems: Should the early childhood program fall under the
jurisdiction of the primary school establishment (i.e. the Ministry of
Education), running the risk of becoming simply a downward extension of current
primary school practices? Should experienced child development specialists and
early childhood educators be placed in positions of authority within the
primary system's bureaucracy, and be asked to re-think and re-design an early
primary program from the ground up? Should private early childhood programs be
integrated into the formal educational system? Should two separate systems be
maintained, with mechanisms such as a common curriculum and common teacher
training courses being used to encourage continuity?<p>
<p>
	We believe that it would be premature to urge an integration of early
childhood intervention programs into Ministries of Education; there are too
many dangers in such an approach. But we feel strongly that the first two years
of primary school present too radical a departure from prior experience for
many children, Creating a transitional level of formal education that served
children in the 4 through 7 age range would only work if an autonomous unit
linked to but with some independence from the Ministry of Education could be
established. Perhaps structures currently used in England-- for example the
Infant Schools-- could serve as a model.<p>

</h3>   PREPARING CHILDREN FOR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOLS FOR CHILDREN<p>
   <p>
   <p>
<b>Introduction</b><p>
   <p>
When we are considering the effectiveness of primary school systems, there is a
tendency to overlook the important education, growth, and development that
occurs in the earliest years before a child enters formal schooling. This is so
even though a growing body of evidence shows that early childhood development
programmes can have important effects on a child's primary school readiness,
enrollment, progress, and performance. This review provides a critical
examination of that evidence, within a framework positing an interactive effect
between the readiness of children for schools and the readiness of schools for
children. In this review, "readiness" refers to individual characteristics of
children and schools as well as to family and community characteristics,
values, expectations, structures, and organization. The review suggests that
the most basic education of all begins during the preschool years and that
attempts to strengthen primary schools must therefore include interventions
developed for the preschool years.<p>
<p>
Evidence supporting this perspective is drawn from evaluations of early
childhood development programmes in Third World countries. Since readiness for
school has health and nutritional as well as educational dimensions, programmes
focusing on these components are also presented. The discussion raises and
provides insights into a set of complex issues surrounding the impact of early
child development programmes on primary school performance, including the
following:<p>
<p>
  Under what circumstances do programmes designed to improve early education
and socialization have a positive and lasting effect on primary school
enrollment, progress, and performance?<p>
<p>
 How does the preparation of children for school interact with the preparation
of schools for children, to ultimately influence primary school enrollment,
progress, and performance?<p>
<p>
 How do family and community characteristics, values, structures, and
organization affect early learning and the successful movement of children
between home and school?<p>
<p>
 What operational mechanisms can bridge home and school, preschool and primary
school, nutrition and education, so that basic education at home and in school
can be fostered and the potential benefits of both early education and of
primary schooling can be realized?<p>
<p>
 What successful early education programmes can be found to serve as examples
to be adapted to other settings?<p>
<p>
An analytical model is presented to guide the interpretation of evidence
gathered from two groups of longitudinal studies. The studies which compare
primary school enrollment progress and performance of children who have
received early childhood interventions with that of similar children who did
not receive such interventions. Finally, a set of recommended actions are
presented and, where possible, examples of such actions are provided.<p>
<p>
This article is based on Chapter 8 of a manuscript in progress, <u>The Twelve
Who Survive</u> by Robert Myers, Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and
Development UNICEF, 3 United Nations Plaza, New York, N.Y.<p>
<p>
<b><u>An Analytical Framework</u></b><p>
<p>
Figure 1 depicts analytical framework in which the readiness of children for
schools and the readiness of   schools for children both affect the enrollment,
progress, and performance of children in primary school.<p>
<p>
As indicated in the Figure, a "child's readiness for school" is defined in
terms of physical capabilities and activity level, cognitive ability, learning
style, and knowledge base, and social and psychological competencies. These
characteristics reflect the child's nutrition and health status as well as
psychosocial development at the time of school entry. This psycho-social
development results from the child's interaction within a number of
environments, including the family; the immediate community of friends and
neighbors; the institutional community of formal service programmes (which
provide support through such channels as health centres, child care and pre-

school
programmes); and the larger society with its predominant ethos, economic and
political conditions, and social organization.<p>
<p>
These environments affect a child's developmental progress in two interrelated
ways. First they determine the physical and social conditions of the child's
interaction with the environment. Second, they operate indirectly through their
influence on the assignment of childrearing responsibility and on the
knowledge, beliefs, and expectations of caregivers as reflected in childrearing
and child care practices.<p>
<p>
Characteristics that define the "readiness of schools for children" considered
in this framework include the school's availability, accessibility, quality,
and most important, responsiveness to local needs and circumstances. These
readiness characteristics of schools are influenced by the actions of families
and communities as well as well as by the economic, social, and political
conditions of the wider environment.<p>
<p>
The following discussion describes the child's readiness for school and
readiness for children. It also describes the impact of the interaction between
these two factors on a child's school enrollment, progress, and performance.<p>
<p>
<b>Readiness of Children for School</b><p>
<p>
A growing body of research supports the idea that health, nutrition, and
psycho-social processes interact to affect survival and development in the
early years of life. The outcomes of these interactions conditions the
readiness of the child for school, which in turn influences the child"s chances
of enrollment and success.<p>
<p>
Poor health negatively affects the level and quality of a child's activity in
school, and also the child's school-

attendance
patterns (Moock &amp; Leslie, 1984; Popkin &amp; Lim-

Ybanez,
1982). Berg (1981) reports that in some Latin American countries, children miss
as much as a third of scheduled school days a year because of illness and poor
health. The result may be a need to repeat a school year and/or early drop-

out.
Thus, the child with a history of illness is not as ready for school as a
healthy child is, and subsequent progress and performance in school is at
risk.<p>
<p>
Nutritional status also affects activity levels. Malnourished children,
suffering from protein-

energy
malnutrition or vitamin and mineral deficiencies, are less active, less able to
concentrate on learning activities and less interested in the environment than
their well-nourished peers are. (Pollitt &amp; Thompson, 1977). The
irritability, listlessness, and distractibility of the hungry, malnourished
school child have been widely noted.<p>
<p>
More specific recent research clearly identifies a causal relationship between
iron deficiency and school performance and concludes that programmes to provide
iron can have a positive effect. Soemantri, Pollitt, and Kim (1985), working
with children in economically deprived rural areas of central Java, Indonesia,
have shown that a 3-

month
iron-

supplementation
intervention was associated with significant changes in performance on school
achievement and concentration tests. Similar results are now available for
programmes in India (Seshadri &amp; Gopaldas, 1989), and Thailand (Pollitt
&amp; Metallinos-

Katsaras,
1989).<p>
<p>
<p>
The effect within the school environment of the variables under discussion is
not as clear. The same principle may apply to the teacher-

child
relationship that applies to the caregiver-

child
relationship. Teachers in primary school may be more inclined to work with
children who are alert and demanding than with those who are listless and
socially withdrawn. However, there is a great deal of anecdotal evidence
suggesting that teachers often perceive active, curious young students as
behavior problems who cause difficulties rather than present opportunities. In
such cases, the improved activity levels could have a negative effect. Here is
a good example of the interaction between the readiness of children for school
and the readiness of schools, in particular teachers, for children.<p>
<p>
Readiness for school also includes the child's acquisition of social and
cognitive competencies. The cognitive skills that parents and various preschool
inculcate in children are not always consonant with those skills required by
schools. For example, parents may promote primarily concrete language and
classification skills, whereas schools demand relatively more abstract and
representational use of language and classification skills that are based on
more abstract qualities of objects (Haglund, 1982).<p>
<p>
There is evidence that explicit literacy-

nurturing
activities are not a part of most poor children's early childhood experience in
the developing countries (Pollitt, 1984). To the extent that this is true, the
transition to abstract and disembodied learning, which typifies the majority of
schools in Third World settings, is further complicated.<p>
<p>
A family's knowledge, attitudes, beliefs, and practices will have important
effects on the nutrition, health, and psychosocial condition of their children.
Constricted by economic factors, parents make decisions about feeding and diet,
about preventive and curative health care, and about the frequency and quality
of psychosocial interactions they will have with their children. These
decisions can lead to enhanced or impaired school readiness.<p>
<p>
In summary, the readiness of children for school reflects the child's condition
as well as the family's knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and practices.<p>
<p>
<b>The Readiness of Schools for Children</b><p>
<p>
The readiness of schools for children is determined by a combination of
factors, including availability and accessibility; quality; and recognition of
and adaptation to local needs and circumstances. The mechanisms by which these
factors influence the readiness of schools for children will be discussed.<p>
<p>
<b>Availability and Accessibility</b>. When schools are unavailable because
they have not been built, clearly they are not ready for children, no matter
how alert and ready the children might be. However, the simple existence of
schools is not always enough. Even when schools have been built and children
are enrolled, the accessibility of schooling may be low because the schools are
not open on a regular basis. Examples abound of teachers who have other jobs,
who arrive on Tuesday and leave on Thursday, who are out because they are on
strike, all of which leaves the child with a drastically reduced number of
school days per year.<p>
<p>
Timing, distance, and cost factors also affect a child's access to schooling.
The school that operates during harvesting and sowing seasons curtails
accessibility for children actively engaged in agricultural activities. Schools
located at great distances or on the opposite side of streams that swell in
rainy season may prohibit children from taking advantage of what is
theoretically available. Although most primary schools do not require tuition
or formal fees, there are many hidden costs, including, for example, the need
to purchase a slate or shoes and clothes. If a family cannot afford the hidden
costs, for all practical purposes, the school is not accessible.<p>
<p>
<b>Quality</b>. Regardless of the physical, cognitive, and social
characteristics of a given child, little knowledge will be acquired in a
classroom that has 50 children, no textbooks, a leaky roof, and an uninspired
teacher with little more than basic literacy -

-
a situation found all too often in developing countries. To no one's surprise
research dictates that the quality of schooling will also have a significant
effect on children's primary school progress and performance (Heyneman &amp;
Loxey, 1983; Haddad, 1979: Schiefelbein &amp; Farrell, 1978).<p>
<p>
A primary factor associated with school quality is the teacher. The ability of
the teacher to take advantage of existing materials and to create others, to
respond to children's needs, and to maintain enthusiasm and hope in unfavorable
conditions can create a quality learning environment. It would be a digression
to enter into a discussion of the various factors affecting the quality of the
teacher, but it is clear that the personal qualities, technical skills, and
motivation of the teacher are central elements in determining the readiness of
the school for the child. In addition to teachers, another important component
of school quality is the availability of books and materials. Many children
never have a book to call their own. Quality is, of course, a relative concept.
What is considered quality schooling in one setting may not be so classified in
another.<p>
<p>
<b>Responsiveness to Local Needs and Circumstances</b>. A school may be
available, accessible, reasonably well equipped, and staffed by certified
teachers and yet remain unresponsive to local conditions. Potential problems
result from such factors as poor scheduling or a language of instruction that
differs from students' mother-

tongue.
Although some examples of curricula adjusted to local circumstances are
available, examples abound of children using materials foreign to them.<p>
<p>
Perhaps the most difficult task of all is to improve the responsiveness of
teachers to the unique needs of children, families, and communities. The
selection and assignment of teaching jobs often results in hiring people from
outside the local area who are not familiar with local language, customs, and
traditions. Moreover, the concept of the teacher as a "facilitator" who uses
locally available experiences and materials to help children construct their
own knowledge, is a foreign idea to many cultures. Rather, the accepted image
of the teacher, an image that applies as much to the primary school as to the
university level, is that of a custodian and dispenser of knowledge. Teacher-

training
programmes reflect this view and provide a centrally controlled curriculum,
which in turn inhibits adjustments to local conditions and styles of learning.
Moreover, low salaries provide little incentive for teachers to take
responsibility for making needed curriculum adjustments. Under these
circumstances, it is not surprising that teachers are not "ready" for the
children they will receive.<p>
<p>
<b>Enrollment, Progress, and Performance</b><p>
<p>
As indicated in Figure 1, the framework suggests that the readiness of children
for schools and the readiness of schools for children interact to directly
influence school enrollment, progress, and performance. The mechanisms by which
this occurs are suggested in the following discussion.<p>
<p>
School enrollment is influenced by the availability and accessibility of
schooling and by parental decision. The decision to enroll and keep a child in
school involves balancing a complex set of variables including; non-

school
demands on time, perceptions of the child's readiness and ability, and parental
beliefs and expectations about the value of schooling. Parental expectations
may differ for boys and girls. Moreover, parental decisions may also be
affected by their perception of the kind and quality of the schooling the child
will receive.<p>
<p>
In addition, parents make decisions about the age at which enrollment should
occur. The child's age of entrance can be significant for three reasons. First,
a child could enter school before the necessary learning competencies have been
achieved exposing the child to failure, repetition, and early drop-

out.
Second, entrance at an older age is often correlated with increased drop-

out
rates. This occurs in part because of the inability of the older child to catch
up and because the school competes with the potential contribution of the child
to the economic survival of the family. Thirdly, variations in the age of
school entrance results in classes of mixed age groupings, which create, in
some ways less than optimal teaching environments.<p>
<p>
"Progress" in school, as used in this framework refers to promotion from one
grade to the next. From the standpoint of the child and the family, many of the
same factors that influence enrollment will influence progress including
health, parental perceptions of perceived ability, and competing demands on
time. Progress, however, also depends on enrollment quotas and promotion
policies.<p>
<p>
The ways in which school systems, schools, and individual teachers select some
children for promotion and others for retention are not adequately understood.
In some systems, children are routinely held back, even though automatic
promotion is mandated. In others, the child's first year in first grade may be
viewed as a preparatory year, and the second year in first grade as the "real"
year, even though there are no changes in the curriculum content (Myers, 1985).
This increases both repetition rates and the child's sense of incompetence and
disinterest.<p>
<p>
Apparently, neither parents nor teachers attribute high repetition rates or low
achievement to the inability of schools to inspire and respond to the child's
needs, (Toro &amp; de Rosa, 1983). Teachers may point to large class sizes or
lack of materials but not to deficiencies in their skills or teaching methods.
Teachers also blame the home environment, and both teacher and parents blame
the child's poor performance on the child's laziness or lack of interest
(Pozner, 1983).<p>
<p>
A child's performance as measured by formal testing presumably indicates how
well the child has mastered the content of the school curriculum. The
curriculum, however, may not have been adjusted to local circumstances, so
grades may inadequately reflect the child's general knowledge or abilities.
Moreover, as suggested with respect to promotion, a variety of factors can
influence grading systems, further distorting their validity as an independent
assessment of mastery. In spite of their inadequacies, these measures of
performance are used to label the child's abilities and to determine likelihood
of promotion. Unfortunately, little attention is paid to measuring social
skills, such as, the child's level of participation and cooperation.<p>
<p>
The discussion will turn now to an examination of the evidence regarding the
effects of various early child development programmes on readiness for school
and on primary school enrollment, progress, and performance.<p>
<p>
<b>Effects of Early Childhood Programmes:</b><p>
<b>A Review of the Evidence</b><p>
<p>
The most broadly disseminated, systematic, and mature body of data regarding
the effects of early childhood programmes on primary school progress and
performance comes from longitudinal evaluations of "compensatory" programmes
for children aged 3 to 5 from "disadvantaged" backgrounds in the United States,
Europe, and Australia. As children in these studies moved through primary
school, their progress and performance was evaluated. Data from the evaluations
of children in early or late adolescence indicates that participation in well-

implemented
early childhood education programmes can have significant long-

term
effects on school progress as measured by increased promotion, decreased need
for special education, and high school completion (Lazar, 1982, 1989; Halpern
&amp; Myers, 1985).<p>
<p>
What are the implications of these findings from studies in industrialized
countries for programming initiatives in Asia, Africa, and Latin America? The
schools, families, and social institutions in Third World countries differ in
many ways from and those in industrialized countries where the programmes and
studies described above were carried out. Accordingly, a simple generalization
of results would be inappropriate. The causal mechanisms that seem to be at
work in the United States or Europe may or may not work in the varied and
distinct countries of the Third World. Comparative findings may be weaker or
stronger.<p>
<p>
For instance, one is more likely in Sub-

Saharan
countries than in the United States to encounter large classes, scanty
instructional resources, minimally-

trained
teachers, and an inadequate number of "places" in each grade. Because of such
adverse conditions, the newly acquired skills preschool participants bring with
them to primary school may be of less consequence than in the U.S. in shaping
the course of children's school careers. When promotion policies are only
loosely tied to children's abilities, when there is no special education to be
"avoided," and when there are resources for only 10 to 20 percent of primary
school participants to complete secondary school, the "positive long-

term
effects" found in the U.S. may not be relevant.<p>
<p>
On the other hand, it is reasonable to expect that primary school systems in
the Third World can be sensitive to the unique skills and characteristics of
the children they inform and instruct. At the same time, it is reasonable to
expect that children whose health and psychosocial development has improved
will be better equipped to adapt to, cope with, and even change the realities
of the school system that they confront.<p>
<p>
One could argue that the severe nutritional and cognitive deficits
characterizing the status of many children in the Third World raises the
possibility that early interventions can exert an even more-

powerful
effect than that found in the industrialized world. Thus, the results from
industrialized countries do provide hope. Let us further explore that optimism,
therefore, by turning to the research evidence available from early child
development programmes implemented in the Third World.<p>
<p>
<b>Evidence from the Third World:</b><p>
<b>Nutrition Intervention Programmes</b><p>
<p>
In the 1970's, academic interest in the relationship between malnutrition and
behavioral development ]ed to a series of widely quoted studies in Latin
America. At the time, emphasis was placed on protein-

energy
malnutrition and on supplementation, with little or no attention being paid to
the effect of vitamins or minerals on growth and development. Table 1 provides
information on location, sample sizes, treatment, and design for 4 nutrition-

related
interventions as well as 13 education-

related
interventions which will be discussed in the next section. The following
section describes the results from these two sets of investigations.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b>Guatemala.</b> A team of researchers at the Nutrition Institute for Central
America and Panama (INCAP) found that high supplemental intake had a
significant effect on birth weight, physical growth up to age 7, and cognitive
development up to age 3. The cognitive effects appeared to decrease in
magnitude and generality beyond age 3.<p>
<p>
Supplementation had no significant effect on the child's verbal performance at
ages 5, 6, and 7 or on early school progress and performance. However, in three
of the four participating villages in which parental education levels were
moderately higher, the amount of supplemental intake predicted the likelihood
of school enrollment (Klein, 1979; Balderston, et. al., 1981). Parent's
perceptions of the children's early intellectual ability led to earlier
enrollment for both boys and girls and to a greater likelihood of enrollment
for girls.<p>
<p>
Although nutritional supplementation seemed to have no effect on school
performance, the quality of home stimulation during the early years was
strongly associated with primary school performance, especially for boys
(Irwin, et. al., 1978). It was found in these generally poor villages that even
slight differences in economic status affected family ability to cope with the
costs of children's education. For the same group, Barrett and Radke-

Yarrow
(1981) found effects of the nutritional supplementation on the social
development of children as indicated by their adjustment and behavior in
school. The results suggest that a more comprehensive assessment of the
effects, rather than assessment by traditional IQ or cognitive tests, is
required to determine the impact of early intervention programmes.<p>
<p>
Cali, Colombia. An investigation in Colombia (McKay, 1982) found that children
in all of the experimental groups when compared to a low-

income
comparison group, demonstrated significantly increased physical growth and
enhanced cognitive ability during and immediately after the treatment periods.
These cognitive gains were related to age of entry into the programme as well
as to duration of treatment. Increases in IQ scores were maintained until at
least 8 years of age when the last measurement was made.<p>
<p>
Results of the follow-

up
study of these children into primary school were complicated by the fact that
the children attended 93 different primary schools, many switching schools more
than once. Thus, only some of the children in the treatment group received a
special programme. In addition, many children, particularly the low-

status
control group children, attended private "backyard" or "bench" schools, and
were unable to enroll or stay in the public system. Children in these settings,
are more likely than those in public settings to be "promoted," regardless of
academic ability.<p>
<p>
In spite of these constraints, results indicate that the low-

income
children in the treatment-

group
were slightly more likely than low-

income
children in the control group to be promoted through the first three grades.
Thus, at the beginning of the fourth year, the average grade-

level
for each of the groups improved, in accordance with the length of time spent in
the preschool. Whereas for the control group, the average grade-

level
was 2.9 years, for those who were exposed to 4 years of preschool, the average
grade level was 3.2 years, a 10 percent improvement.<p>
<p>
<b>Bogota, Colombia.</b> In this investigation, maternal and child
supplementation and maternal tutoring in different combinations were associated
with improved cognitive abilities at 18 months and 3 years. The strongest
effects, however, were found when the intervention consisted of maternal and
child supplementation as well as home visiting. Maternal supplementation had a
very modest (60 gram) effect on birth weight and was also associated with
improved physical growth at 3 years. The home visiting programme had
significant positive effects on the quality of mother-

infant
interaction in both supplemented and unsupplemented groups. Behavioral effects
were greatest for supplemented infants.<p>
<p>
A school readiness test including reading readiness, math, and basic knowledge
was administered to 174 children, 5-

9
years of age. Results indicated that nutritional supplementation had a
significant positive effect on readiness test scores, with or without maternal
tutoring. Effects were greater at low levels of father's education. Maternal
tutoring had no independent effects on test scores.<p>
<p>
However, maternal tutoring was found to have an important effect on age of
initial primary school enrollment. Mean age of entry was 5 years for the
maternal tutoring group; 5.6 years for the maternal-

tutoring/nutritional-
supplement
group; 5.9 years for the supplementation group; 6 years for the control group.
There were also significant positive effects of supplementation and tutoring,
alone and combined, on first grade repetition rates. Children in all three
intervention groups repeated at about a 4 percent rate, compared with a control
group repetition rate of 13 percent.<p>
<p>
Reviewing the developmental pattern of results during the first 6 years, the
investigators speculate that nutritional supplementation has long-

term
effects on such factors as children's level of activity, alertness and social
cooperation. Maternal tutoring has indirect effects, perhaps through effects on
maternal-

child
interaction, on children's "familiarity with a school-

like
learning paradigm of interaction with adults." The largest effects are greatest
for the most disadvantaged children.<p>
<p>
<b>Puebla, Mexico.</b> This follow-

up
study carried out over a 10-

year
period reported that supplemented children whose mothers received
supplementation during pregnancy walked at an earlier age, exerted early
sphincter control and demonstrated language superiority when compared to an
unsupplemented control group (Chavez &amp; Martinez, 1983).<p>
<p>
Using direct observation, open field tests, and time sampling to quantify
behaviors, the authors found that after 6 months of age, the undernourished
children had lower activity levels when compared with the supplemented
children. This difference increased with time and was evident in the amount of
time spent sleeping, number of steps per hour, and quantity of time playing. In
the second year, supplemented children smiled significantly more and cried
significantly less than did undernourished children in the control group.<p>
<p>
Moreover, supplemented children were not only better nourished, they also
received more attention. Mothers responded more readily to children's demands.
Fathers were more likely to participate in feeding. These differences appeared
in the early months, as supplemented children were given toys, clothing, and
rewards for good behavior. It is suggested that in the sequence of events
leading to these differences, the demand for care by the child is as important
as the offer of care from the caregiver, since better-

nourished
children demand more. The investigators also indicate that these differences
can be transitory and that stimulation of malnourished children can have a
positive impact on developmental outcomes.<p>
<p>
<b>Early Childhood Education Programmes</b><p>
<p>
The second group of studies focusses more directly on preschool and early
education programmes and provides evidence regarding the potential effects of
early interventions on enrollment, progress, and performance in primary
schools. Table 1 summarizes the information on 13 studies carried out in Asia,
Latin America, and the Middle East. These 13 studies differ along several
dimensions, including rigor of experimental design setting and type of
intervention. However, they all have attempted to compare, over time, children
who have received the programme with those who have not. Several of the studies
may be characterized as research projects; others, as evaluations of small-

scale
demonstration projects; and others, as evaluations of larger-

scale
programmes. Generally, the designs of these 13 studies are weaker
methodologically than those of the 4 nutrition studies described earlier. For
instance, in only one study are children randomly assigned to treatment and
control groups (Kagitcibasi, Sunar, &amp; Bekman, 1987). Comparison groups
comprised of children with similar characteristics are not always appropriately
or effectively identified.<p>
<p>
Several of the studies followed preschool aged-

children
with and without participation in specific preschool programmes into primary
school. These children attend a variety of schools, meaning that criteria used
to judge promotion and progress will vary, uncertainty into the comparisons. In
other studies, preschool antecedents of selected primary school children are
identified retrospectively in order to define the comparison groups. When
working retrospectively, a possible bias is introduced by the nature of the
particular primary schools chosen for study and by the possibility that some
children will not have enrolled in primary school.<p>
<p>
In spite of these limitations and in spite of some need for caution in
interpreting the results, this group of studies sheds light on factors that
influence children's early school careers in developing countries. As a whole,
the studies clearly demonstrate the positive effects of early intervention on
children's progress through the educational system.<p>
<p>
<b>Early Intervention Programmes: Impact on School Enrollment, Progress, and
Performance</b><p>
<p>
Tables 2 A and B present a summary of the evidence regarding the effects of
both nutrition and education intervention programmes on enrollment, progress,
and performance in school. As indicated in the Tables, the nutritional studies
showed a definite advantage in terms of children's readiness for school. Better-

nourished
children had an advantage physically, mentally, and socially. A similar result
emerges from the several studies of education interventions. Each study
involved a different indicator or set of indicators defining school readiness,
usually focussing on cognitive development as it had been affected by the
particular intervention in which the child participated.<p>
<p>
Of the studies summarized in Tables 2 A,B, 10 provide comparative information
about children's enrollment; 12, about school progress; and 12, about
performance. The following discussion summarizes the impact of these programmes
on children's enrollment, progress, and performance in primary school.
(Detailed programme descriptions can be found in Halpern and Myers, 1985, and
Myers, 1988).<p>
<b>School Enrollment.</b> Are children who participate in early childhood
programmes more likely to enroll in primacy school? Relatively little
information could be found to answer this question. In one of the Indian
studies, enrollment was higher for children who had passed through the
Integrated Child Development Service programme than for those who did not. An
interesting finding of this increased enrollment a that it was significant for
girls, but not for boys, who already had a high percent enrollment rate. In
Guatemala, the programme also showed an effect on enrollment for girls but not
for boys. The early childhood programmes seemed to have an equalizing effect.
The Colombian (PROMESA) study also showed a (slightly) higher enrollment level
for children participating in the programme.<p>
<p>
Can one assume that participation in an early childhood programme is associated
with enrollment at an earlier age. In six of the studies reviewed, the average
age of enrollment was younger for those who had been in an early childhood
development programme. We do not know from the studies whether an earlier age
of enrolment led to improved school progress and performance. It seems
reasonable to assume that the earlier age of entry regularizes the child's
passage through the system.<p>
<p>
<b>School Promotion, Repetition, and Drop-

out.</b>
Of the 4 nutrition studies, 2 showed an improvement in school progress for
programme children; 1 failed to find a difference. Of the 13 education studies
6 showed a difference in promotion rates, 3 showed no effect (one of these was
carried out in a system with automatic promotion so no difference would be
noted). Four studies did not contain information on repetition or drop-

out.<p>
<p>
In some cases, the differences in promotion were rather dramatic. For instance,
in the Brazilian (PROAPE) the PROAPE children had a first-

grade
repetition rate of 9 percent as compared with a 33 percent rate for children
who did not participate in the programme. The study from Fortaleza, Brazil
found a first grade repetition rate of 36 percent for children who had received
the intervention. This figure was significantly lower than the 66 percent first
grade repetition rate reported for children who did not receive the
intervention.<p>
<p>
The four studies from Colombia all show significant differences in progress
through the educational system. The strongest effect was associated with a
programme in the extremely impoverished area of the Choco, where 60 percent of
the programme children reached the fourth grade of primary school, compared
with only 30 percent of the comparison group. In Argentina, 36 percent of the
rural children from low socioeconomic backgrounds repeated if they had a
preschool experience, as compared with 77 percent for those without preschool
experience. Moreover, these results consistently suggest that differences are
more pronounced for children from the most disadvantaged environments.<p>
<p>
<b>Performance.</b> In two of the three nutrition studies for which information
was available, no differences in academic performance were found between the
programme children and the comparison children. In six of the ten education
studies with available information, children from early intervention programmes
performed better; in two, the effect was negligible; and in one, there was no
difference between the two groups. In Morocco, positive effects were found in a
rural but not in an urban context.<p>
There was less information regarding differences in social behavior of school
children as a result of their participation in an intervention during the
preschool years. The Guatemalan nutrition study found that programme children
who received high caloric supplementation from birth to age 2 years had higher
levels of social involvement than unsupplemented children had. Both Indian
studies indicated better behavior among ICDS than non-

ICDS
children. The Turkish study found that adjustment was better among children
whose mothers had participated in a parental training programme, but there was
no difference in adjustment according to whether or not a child had been in a
preschool centre or not.<p>
<p>
<b>Readiness of Schools for Children</b><p>
<p>
As one may have expected, this body of evaluation research provides little
insight into the readiness of schools for children. No analyses are available
of what happens to children of similar backgrounds who go to primary schools of
different quality. The unspoken assumption, in more than one of the studies, is
that children who go to poorer quality schools will not make the same progress
in spite of their involvement in the early intervention programmes.<p>
<p>
The affect of "availability" seems to come into play in the four-

country
Latin American study. In Colombia and Bolivia, no differences were found
between preschool and non-

preschool
children in their readiness at the time of entry into first grade. In these two
countries, there was often a lag of 1 to 3 years between preschool attendance
and entry into primary school. In the Moroccan example, promotion quotas come
into play. In the Peruvian study, the poor quality of the primary schools was
suggested as the reason why improved readiness for school did not seem to have
an effect on progress or performance.<p>
<p>
It is interesting that only in the cases where school readiness did seem to
improve as a result of being in an early childhood programme that the
"readiness of the school" was looked to as a possible explanation why the
preschool result did not continue. But it is logical to think that to some
degree, the readiness of schools for children was operating  in all cases, for
good or for ill. What did not occur to researchers was the need to examine the
interaction between early interventions in the preschool years (as they affect
the readiness of children) and the differential availability and quality of
primary schools.<p>

<b>PROGRAMME REVIEW</b><p>
<b>India</b><p>
   <p>
<b>Integrated Child Development Services</b><p>
   <p>
Started by the Indian government in 1975, to improve the quality of life of
poor children
aged 0 to 6, and their mothers in urban-slum, rural, and tribal areas. In 1989,
approximated 40 percent of the targeted areas were reached, accounting for
approximately 11.2 million children.<p>
<p>
The Service functions primarily through anganwadi centres (literally,
courtyards) run by Anganwadi Workers (AWW) who gather together 20 to 40
children for approximately 3 hours each weekday for supplementary feeding and
preschool educational activities. Anganwadi workers are selected according to
uniform criteria by the Central Government, based on education and experience
and are given pre-

service
training by existing academic institutions and non-

governmental
organizations. In addition to providing the early education and supervizing the
supplementary feeding, the AWW are responsible for a wider variety of tasks
including growth monitoring, vitamin distribution, record keeping and maternal
education.<p>
<p>
Two relatively simple studies show effects of the ICDS programme on enrollment,
progress,
and performance of children in primary school. Each of these will be
summarized.<p>
<p>
Chaturvedi and colleagues (1987) randomly selected three villages from
adjoining ICDS and non-

ICDS
areas, and studied all children aged 6 to 8 in those villages. These two groups
of children were " well-

matched
according to the parental education and occupation, number of educated members
in the household socio-economic status, period of parental company and some
other bio-

social
characteristics which have an association with child's mental and social
development."<p>
<p>
The researchers found that children who had participated in the ICDS preschool
programme scored significantly higher on the Ravens Progressive Color Matrices
than those who did not. School attendance, academic performance, and general
behavior in school were all significantly superior for ICDS participants.<p>
<p>
<b>Lal and Wati</b> (1986) compared ICDS and non-

ICDS
children from l4 rural villages with respect to enrollment, drop-

out,
and school performance. When drop-

out
figures were examined by caste group, results indicate that drop-

was much higher by grade 3 for non-ICDS children than for ICDS children in the
lower and middle castes. Such differences were not observed for children in the
higher castes, as indicated below:<p>

<b>Programas No-

Formal

   <p>
<p>
The Programs No-

Formal
de Education Initial, is a centre-

based
program for 3-

to
5-


year-

old
children. Children attend the centre for 3 hours, four or five mornings per
week. Education and care is provided by a minimally trained community
volunteer. A snack and/or noontime meal is also provided by mothers, on a
rotating basis. In some villages, this nonformal preschool programme was
associated also with income-

generating
projects.<p>
<p>
<p>
An evaluation by Myers, et.al., 1985, examined the impact of the programme on
school readiness in terms of a criterion-

referenced
test that was linked specifically to the behaviors that the PRONOEI nonformal
preschool curriculum guide defined as denreable. The test had intellectual,
motor, and social sub-

scales.
Results differed among: the 3 geographic regions in which the programme was
applied. In Puno, which had the most extensive programme PRONOEI children
performed significantly better than non-

PRONOEI
children did on all three of the sub-

scales.
This occurred m spite pf evaluation reports indicating low quality of the
PRONOEI programme -

-

quality as judged by "promoters" teaching skills, time devoted to educational
activities, availability and use of materials, and quality of supervision.<p>
<p>
Although school readiness seemed to be positively affected, no effects of
PRONOEI participation were found on promotion from 1st  to 2nd grade or from
2nd to 3rd grade. Effects favoring PRONOEI participants were found on age of
enrollment. A high rate of repetition in the lst grade (over 50 percent) seemed
to be linked to structural conditions inherent in the local school situation,
minimizing the role of individual characteristics or abilities in determining
children's promotion.<p>
<hr width=85%>
<b>Summary and Policy Recommendations</b><p>
<p>
What are the implications of this evidence from programmes implemented in Third World
settings? The following section highlights several conclusions which can be
drawn from this 
review and suggests actions for programme implementation.<p>
<p>
 The data clearly indicate that early intervention programmes can have a
positive effect on the probability of enrollment, progress, and performance in
the early years of primary school.<p>
<p>
 The mechanisms that produce these improvements appear to reflect a combination
of factors including earlier age of enrollment; improved school readiness
related to enhanced health and nutritional condition; improved cognitive
skills; and changes in parental expectations and perceptions of their child's
potential.<p>
<p>
 This review also suggests that structural conditions and the quality of
primary schooling can moderate the potential effects of improved school
readiness on school progress or performance.<p>
<p>
 Poor children and children from socially discriminated groups may benefit more
than their more privileged peers from multifaceted early intervention
programmes. It is also apparent that in contexts where gender differences are
operating, preschool programmes can raise the primary school entrance rates of
girls making them more similar to those of boys. It is difficult to determine
from the existing data, however, whether the gains achieved are maintained over
time. Moreover, the durability of these effects and the conditions under which
they persist or deteriorate remains to be documented.<p>
<p>
In summary, these conclusions are encouraging and provide a sense of hope that
should stimulate additional programme design, development and evaluation. When
compared against results from the United States and Europe, these data
reinforce the assumption that not only are similarly positive effects of early
interventions possible but that the potential for bringing about improvements
is greatest where social or economic conditions prejudice a child's entrance,
continuation, or performance in primary school. When placed against the
potential cost savings of reduced repetition rates, these results provide an
important argument in support of investing in early childhood care and
development programmes.<p>
<p>
<b>Implications for Policy and Programming</b><p>
<p>
The personal and social costs of a poor transition from home to school are such
that improving the transitions should be a central policy goal of developing
countries' governments and of international donors, particularly in countries
where primary school repetition and drop-

out
rates are still high. The evidence reviewed indicates that early childhood
interventions can improve this transition.<p>
<p>
Policy-

makers
need not wait, therefore, for more refined and detailed studies. On the basis
of available evidence, this review suggests several important policy
implications regarding programming integration, operations, and evaluation. The
following are some recommendations for each of these three areas.<p>

<b>Programme Integration.</b> The importance of combining health, nutrition,
and education interventions is highlighted by the evidence presented In this
review. It is clear that in Third World settings, programmes must place greater
emphasis on the health and nutrition needs of children than is required in the
industrialized world. That emphasis must go beyond simple "food
supplementation" to incorporate solutions to the problems of micro-

nutrient
deficiencies.<p>
<p>
To improve the transition, and thereby have a positive effect on schooling,
programmes must focus jointly on improving children's readiness for school as
well as on improving the school's readiness for children. There is a need,
therefore, to integrate early childhood programmes within existing primary
school systems.<p>
<p>
Programming integration requires a reorientation of the programming process. It
means bridging the artificial separation between preschool and primary school
children which occurs when children enter school. Combining programmes requires
accepting the responsibility that schools must also adjust to the needs of
children rather than only requiring children to adapt to the system. As
concluded by Halpern and Myers:<p>
<p>
&#147;An integrated early childhood-

primary
programme could serve as a vehicle for including family and community interests
and strengthen to the formal school system; for example, fusing the values and
content of the local culture into the curriculum, at first at the pre-

primary
then, at the primary level; serving as a focus of community development
energies that, once organized, could be focussed on other issues; involving
teachers in the solution of community problems linked to child development but
not obviously part of the formal schools system's mandate; reaching parents and
their children with educational services before the perceived costs of
children's participation in a process with ill-

defined
returns becomes too high (1985).&#148;<p>
<p>
<b>Organization.</b> An integrated programming approach raises a series of
questions regarding the organizational structure and operational mechanisms
required for its survival. If early childhood programmes become the exclusive
responsibility of Education Ministries, there is the danger that the formal
primary school system may be extended downward to children between the ages of
3 to 6. This would reinforce the apparent inflexibility of primary schools
while also creating programmes for younger children that are inappropriate to
their needs.<p>
<p>
One organizational alternative would be to create a semiautonomous unit within
the Ministry of Education with responsibility for programming related to
children from age 3 to age 8 or even from birth to age 8. This multi-

disciplinary
Unit might include individuals with expertise in health, nutrition, education,
psychology, and community development. Under the auspices of an inter-

ministerial
committee, this unit could be staffed with personnel "loaned" from other
ministries, with the understanding that each of these persons would serve as a
liaison with the loaning ministry. The activities of this unit could include
for example:<p>
<p>
 The development of "Parental Education" programmes that could be linked to
preschool and/or primary school through parents' committees or other
organizations.<p>
<p>
 The integration of childrearing content in ongoing adult literacy and post-

literacy
programmes.<p>
<p>
 The placement of preschools and primary schools near each other, enabling
primary school children to bring siblings to the preschool and to return home
with them at the end of the day. In addition, the primary school curriculum
might incorporate a child-

to-
child
component in which older primary school children were not only encouraged to
take child care messages home but were also required to participate as helpers
in the attached preschool, as part of their school activities.<p>
<p>
 In communities that expect a preschool environment to provide formal learning,
arrangements could be made to have a primary school teacher affiliated with
each preschool to work in particular with the 4-


and 5-


year olds on formal learning activities. 'This arrangement could be facilitated
through joint working groups of pre-

school
and primary school teachers. These working groups could also discuss ways to
ease and monitor the transition of preschool children into the primary school
setting.<p>
<p>
 Radio, television, and video programmes for both preschool centres and early
primary grades could be created. The content could include heath and nutrition
and play activities relevant for children between 3 and 8 years of age. A
series of booklets, with suggested activities to reinforce the concepts
transmitted through the audiovisual channels, could also be developed.<p>
<p>
Undoubtedly there will be reasons why the suggested activities will not be
appropriate in a particular location and the need to adjust to local
circumstances is obvious. The intention here is to provide examples of ways in
which the programming process might be conceptualized to create and facilitate
opportunities for integrating preschool activities into the primary school
setting.<p>
<p>
<b>Evaluation.</b> Another implication of this review is that evaluation
designs should be built into early child programmes, with opportunities for
longitudinal follow-

up
studies of these children into the early years of primary school. In carrying
out these studies, more attention must be placed on the development of
indicators and instruments for measuring the process of child development.<p>
<p>
In line with the framework describe earlier, one could consider creating a
Child Readiness Profile (CRP) and a School Readiness Profile (SRP). A Child
Readiness Profile would provide a description of children at age 5 as they
prepare to move beyond the confines of the family and face the new environment
of the school. It is known that involvement and success in school
 as well as in
later life is affected by the child's health and nutritional status, language
competence, ]earning skills and facilities, self-

esteem
and confidence, as well as by the expectations for success held by the family
and community. On the basis of these and other variables, it would be possible
to construct a "Readiness Profile" that incorporates health and nutrition as
well as cognitive and social dimensions of development. This profile, which
should be simply constructed for easy administration, could measure for
instance, morbidity in terms of sickness during the last three months,
nutritional status as indicated by iron deficiency, cognitive skills as
indicated by the ability to manage pre-

literacy
and pre-

numeric
concepts and skills, and a social dimension as indicated by family expectations
for the child. The validity of the profile could be measured by comparisons
with other indicators of culturally accepted social behavior. The CRP could
provide both programme developers and evaluators with an instrument to identify
the school readiness of a population of children.<p>
<p>
Finally, as the studies reviewed indicate, there is a need for systematic, well-

designed
longitudinal evaluation research that follows children exposed to an Early
Child Development programme into primary school. In  the Third World, there is
an absence of the kind of rigorous longitudinal studies that apparently have
had such an influence on policy development in the industrialized countries. If
such studies were available, Third World decision-

makers
would not have to refer apologetically to research from the industrialized
world to justify investing in Early Childhood Development interventions. Access
to such a body of research, would support the development, implementation, and
evaluation of integrated programmes of early childhood development that cross
bureaucratic demarcations and consider, in a holistic fashion, the first eight
years of a child's life.<p>

     What future would you like to see for your child?  The way parents answer this
question may determine whether or not the child survives.  When parents see a
future for their child, they will do their best to provide the child with the
care required for survival, even in circumstances where very little food is
available.  However, if parents are hesitant or cannot give a response to the
question, the child may not survive. <b> The latest research on the
relationship between health, nutrition and stimulation argues convincingly that
an adequate food supply is not enough to assure a child's survival, neither is
access to micro-nutrients, neither is education, nor absence of disease.
Children's growth and development is fostered when all these variables are
present, within a caring environment</b>.<p>
<p>
     In the following pages we will explore the dimensions of a caring environment,
and look at ways that early childhood programmes can strengthen all dimensions
of <b>Care</b> including health, nutrition, education, and family support. <a

<p>
<u>The Situation of Young Children
</u>
<p>
<p>
     One and a half billion children will be born in the decade of the 1990s.
Given economic conditions worldwide, these children will increasingly be born
into poverty and situations which threaten their chances for optimal human
growth and development.  The quality of the environment in which millions of
children are growing up is inadequate by any number of criteria. Overcrowding,
lack of potable water and sewage facilities, lack of adequate food, and
inadequate caretaking characterise the environments of many young children.
Frequent infection (most commonly diarrhoea) and malnutrition account for over
50% of all infant mortality in developing countries.  <p>
<p>
     These statistics are likely to worsen as the numbers living in urban areas
increase, which they will.  It is estimated that by the year 2000, urban
populations in the developing countries will increase from the 1 billion in
1980 to 2.1 billion.  This represents a 110 percent increase, compared with a
projected increase in the world's population during that same time period of 38
percent.  A further expansion of urban slum and squatter settlements is
inevitable.<p>
<p>
     This situation is of concern to many.  In recent years there has been an
attempt to focus the world's attention on the needs of children, as evidenced
by the <i>Summit for Children</i> convened in September 1990, and the fact that
the <i>Convention of the Rights of the Child</i> was brought to the General
Assembly of the United Nations in 1989, calling for universal standards for
children in relation to survival, protection and development.  But the
<i>Convention</i> and other documents can only articulate desirable outcomes.
They do not guarantee what will happen in the life of an individual child.
Therefore it is necessary to develop policies and programmes at the regional,
national and local levels to turn the wording of Conventions into reality.  The
various United Nations organisations whose mandates include children have taken
on the challenge, as have a wide range of non-governmental and donor agencies.
<p>
<p>
     With the year 2000 in mind, specific targets have been set.  For example in
terms of micro-nutrients<a href="cn12_fn.html">[2]</a> the challenge is
to eliminate vitamin A and iodine deficiencies and to reduce by a third
iron-deficient anemia in women (World Bank, 1993).  The World Summit was not
the only arena within which these targets were discussed.  They were endorsed
by the <i>Ending Hidden Hunger Conference</i> in October 1991, and at the
<i>International Conference on Nutrition</i> in December 1992.  <p>
<p>
     In terms of education one goal set forth was to achieve universal primary
education by the year 2000.  This goal was endorsed at the Education For All
world conference in Jomtien, and reinforced at the follow-up EFA conference in
New Delhi, where several related aims were proposed and debated. (These will be
examined more fully in the next issue of the <i>Coordinators' Notebook</i>).<p>
<p>
     Are these goals realistic?  Only if we take a good look at the complex
realities of people's lives and what we know about successfully meeting their
needs.  <p>
<p>
     To begin with, we know that survival and healthy development cannot be
achieved without significant attention to young children, from their conception
through age six. The basis for good physical health and cognitive functioning
in later years must be established during the early years.  The dependence and
rapid growth typical of infancy and early childhood make children vulnerable to
a variety of health, nutritional, psycho-social and other environmental
conditions.  Those living in poverty are particularly at risk of poor physical
and psycho-social development.  <p>
<p>
     Second, we know that children cannot be viewed in isolation.  It is necessary
to recognize that they are part of an ever-changing society.  By understanding
more about changes in the family and community it is possible to identify the
impact of those changes on children's growth and development.  Such an
understanding can then provide the basis for intervention programmes that meet
the needs of children <i>and</i> their families. <p>
<p>
     Third, we are able to identify programmes that are effective, and those that
are likely to fail.  Successful programmes generally require an interactive,
integrated, culturally-sensitive approach and a breadth of understanding of
people's beliefs, perceptions, needs and concerns.  In contrast,
mono-dimensional programmes, which may meet short term goals, are not likely to
be sustainable. It is rarely helpful to impose a single solution which ignores
the need for individuals and communities to control their own destinies.  <p>
<p>
     Building on what we already know, this article examines the latest research
which provides us with a greater understanding of the relationships between
nutrition, health, care, education and developmental outcomes for children.  We
begin with a look at the key needs of young children in section 1. This is
followed in section 2 with data on the importance of the environment of
<b>Care</b> that surrounds the child in terms of the immediate family and in
terms of the wider culture. In section 3 we look at the health care
requirements of young children, including reports on current research which
identifies the powerful relationship between micro-nutrients and cognitive
functioning and development.  Section 4 provides guidelines that should be
followed when creating new programmes or introducing health, nutrition,
<b>Care</b> and/or education components into existing programmes that seek to
support children's growth and development. <p>
<p>
1.  <b>The Child:  Key Needs from Conception through the Early Years</b><p>
<p>
     In terms of physical, intellectual, emotional and social well-being, the
period from conception to age 6 is the key to subsequent growth, development
and ultimate productivity.  Pre-natally through the sixth year there are
several distinct stages.  They include: intra-uterine, intrapartum (the birth
itself), postpartum (birth to 1 month), early infancy (the first six months),
late infancy (6-12 months), toddler (1 to 3 years), and the pre-school child
(3-6 years of age).  <p>
<p>
     Children have different needs, depending on where they are within these
stages.  The younger the child, the more difficult it is to disentangle the
physiological and psychological factors within the environment that govern
health.  The youngest children are completely dependent on adults.  As they
become toddlers environmental cleanliness, encouragement of eating and
vigilance in terms of the child's safety are of utmost importance.  The
pre-school child is more self-reliant.  As noted by Engle (1992) these children
"are initiated into the culture of children, and may even become fledgling
caregivers themselves... they may have developed skills to obtain food for
themselves, and the wisdom to protect themselves a little from pathogens in the
environment." (pg. 25)<p>
  <p>
     While the general description of differences across the ages is important, in
order to create a programme for young children, it is critical to have more
specific information on their needs.  A delineation of developmental
differences is provided by Donohue-Colletta (1992) for three age groups.  She
defines the needs as follows:<p>
<p>
     Infants (birth to 1) need:<p>
            protection from physical danger<p>
            adequate nutrition<p>
            adequate health care<p>
            adults with whom to form attachments<p>
       adults who can understand and respond to their signals<p>
            things to look at, touch, hear, smell, and taste<p>
            opportunities to explore the world<p>
            appropriate language stimulation<p>
<p>
     Toddlers (1-3 years of age) need all the above and also require:<p>
  support in acquiring new motor, language and thinking skills<p>
  a chance to develop some independence<p>
  help in learning how to control their own behaviour<p>
            opportunities to begin to learn to care for themselves<p>
  daily opportunities to play with a variety of objects<p>
<p>
Children ages 3-6 (and above), in addition to the above, also need:<p>
  opportunities to develop fine motor skills<p>
  encouragement of language through talking, reading, singing<p>
  activities which will develop a positive sense of mastery<p>
  opportunities to learn cooperation, helping, sharing<p>
       experimentation with pre-writing and pre-reading skills  (pg. 65)<p>
<p>
     A wide variety of inputs is required to support children's growth and
development.  An important thing to note is that all the inputs require someone
to interact with the child.  Very young children are not capable of obtaining
what they need on their own.  The importance of adult-child interaction is
underscored by the latest research which addresses specifically the
relationship between nutrition, care and development.<p>
 <p>
2.  <b>Children's Requirements for Care</b><p>
<p>
     The quality of <b>Care</b> the young child receives determines his/her
development.  Engle (1992), defines care as <i>the provision in the household
and community of time, attention, and support to meet the physical, mental and
social needs of the growing child and other household members.</i>  <b>Care</b>
includes much more than keeping the child safe and free from harm.  Caregiving
behaviours include breastfeeding; providing emotional security and reducing the
child's stress; providing shelter, clothing, feeding, bathing, supervision of
the child's toilet; preventing and attending to illness; nurturing and showing
affection, interaction and stimulation; playing and socializing; protecting
from exposure to pathogens; and providing a relatively safe environment for
exploration (Zeitlin, 1991, Myers, 1992).  A second set of caregiving
behaviours includes the use of resources outside the family, including curative
and preventative health clinics, prenatal care, the use of traditional healers,
and members of the extended family network (Engle, 1992).  All of these
behaviours are a part of supporting the development of young children.<p>
  <p>
     The type of caregiving behaviour which is required depends to a large extent
on the child's developmental age and the health and nutritional risks the child
is facing.  For example, during the first year of life the child is at the
greatest risk of mortality.  During late infancy (or when complementary foods
are introduced) and during the toddler period the child is at greatest risk of
growth faltering.  <p>
<p>
     While growth faltering may be the result of inadequate nutrition, there is
clear evidence to suggest that it is also linked to the way young children are
fed.  <b>Feeding is more than giving children food; it includes the interactive
process which accompanies the intake of food.</b>  The interactive caregiving
provided during the feeding process can have a profound effect on the child's
later development. <p>
<p>
<b>ASIDE</b> Studies comparing children who are well- and poorly-nourished
suggest that there are positive <b>Caring</b> practices associated with
children with better nutritional status, even though the children come from the
same type of environment as their malnourished peers. (Zeitlin, 1993)   <p>
<p>
     In the context of feeding, <b>Caring</b> practices include frequent physical
contact, being consistently responsive to the child's needs and showing
affection to the child.  <b>Care</b> also includes <i>active feeding</i> which
means being aware of how much the child is eating, offering the child a second
helping, assisting the child in the use of a utensil instead of expecting
complete self-feeding, and offering praise for eating. (Engle, 1992)<p>
<p>
     The studies of feeding are but one example of current research that indicates
the powerful effect of the interaction between the child and the environment on
growth and development.  Another example comes from longitudinal studies of
children growing up in poverty.  In Hawaii, Werner (1982) was able to identify
children who were able to thrive even though the conditions under which they
were raised suggested they would be malnourished and not develop well.  She
termed those children that did well <i>resilient</i>.  Those characterised as
resilient evidenced greater autonomy and competence (pg. 158) and clearly did
better developmentally and over time than their non-resilient peers.  They did
better because they were able to "elicit predominantly positive responses from
their environment."  These children were also found to be "stress-resistant"
compared to children who elicited negative responses from their environment.<p>
<p>
     In her research, Werner sought to identify what makes some children more
resilient.  She concluded, as have others, that <b>the differences between
children who thrive and those who falter are determined by the type of
interaction that occurs between the child and the environment</b>.  The child's
ability to thrive is greatly enhanced by the amount of affective stimulation
and the kind of care the child receives.  This clearly supports the contention
that it is not enough to merely provide food.  The child needs food and care.<p>
<p>
     Another important factor in a child's ability to thrive is the level of
support the caregiver (most often the mother) receives from others in the
family and from society.  This support plays an important role in the kind of
care the caregiver is able to provide.  Recognizing this fact, UNICEF has
included support for the caregiver in their Nutrition Strategy.  Adopted by the
UNICEF Board in 1990, the Strategy suggests that in addition to food security,
access to health care and a healthy environment, programming must address the
care of children <b>and women</b>. Recent research supports the UNICEF position
that all of these are necessary; one alone is not sufficient.  
</a><p>
 <p>
     From the onset of conception, the child and mother are inextricably linked and
this is maintained after birth through breast-feeding and psychosocial
nurturing.  Therefore the understanding  of the health needs and problems of
the young child starts naturally with adequate health inputs and supports for
the mother.  A range of variables have an impact on women's ability to provide
care.  These have been outlined by Engle (1992).  They include:<p>
<p>
     1. <i>Physical health</i>.  Many women in developing countries are chronically
anemic and undernourished.  This necessarily affects both the health of the
newborn and the woman's ability to provide <b>Care</b>.   <p>
<p>
     2. <i>Mental health</i>. This includes a woman's level of self-confidence and
her status within the culture.  When women are stressed and feel they have no
control over their lives, the sense of powerlessness can debilitate them.  The
more they feel they can control aspects of their lives, the more self-confident
they are and the more likely they are to be able to give to others.  <p>
<p>
     3. <i>Women's status</i>. In cultures where women are subordinated to others,
they are frequently unable to take good care of themselves, and may well lack
the resources (physical and psychological) to care for the child.  When women
are respected and have control over resources, they are more self-assured.
This generally yields positive benefits for children.  <p>
<p>
     4. <i>Women's income</i>.     The literature suggests that women's work outside
the home produces direct benefits for children, particularly if the salary
level is reasonable and if the woman has control of the monies that she earns.
In these instances, children are likely to have improved health and participate
more fully in education. <p>
     <p>
     5. <i>Education and Beliefs</i>.  Numerous studies have demonstrated the
strong positive relationship between a woman's education and child health and
nutrition outcomes.  While all the complexities of this relationship have not
been explored fully, it is clear that when women are better educated, their
children do better. <p>
<p>
     6. <i>Social Supports</i>. Moving beyond the individual, the fifth variable is
the kinds of social supports available to women.  When women feel they are part
of a community, alternative forms of child care can be developed, agricultural
production can be facilitated through the formation of work groups and informal
sharing of tasks is possible, relieving the stress on an individual woman.
Community support allows women to carry out a number of tasks effectively.
Lack of supports may mean that many of the tasks are not done well.<p>
<p>
     7. <i>Time</i>.  Somewhat related to the issue of social supports is the time
that women have available for <b>Care</b>.  The many hours of labour that women
spend to accomplish a range of tasks during the day has been well-documented.
One legitimate question is: if women had more time would it be devoted to
childcare?  The answer to this question is unclear.  As Engle notes, the lack
of an answer is largely due to the fact that when women are asked the question
they find it hard to imagine having leisure time.<p>
<p>
     These variables are not static.  They are changing all the time as the nature
of women's work changes. New economic pressures on and possibilities presented
to women mean they increasingly work outside the home, often for long hours and
following schedules that limit their availability and thus the time they can
devote to child care.<p>
<p>
     In rural areas women often work in the fields.  While in many cultures women
have historically constituted a majority sector of the agricultural work force,
in other settings the out-migration of men who are seeking employment elsewhere
has increased women's agricultural role.  In addition, in some agricultural
settings cash crop production and plantation economies have meant that women
are increasingly being exposed to demands of rigid time and work schedules
similar to those common in urban environments.  In both urban and rural
environments there is an increase in the number of women-headed households.
All of these variables have an impact on women's work loads.  <p>
<p>
<b>Aside</b>  Women have always played multiple roles that compete for their
time and physical and emotional energy.  Regardless of the context within which
children are raised, care of children, particularly young children, is still
the woman's responsibility.  In addition, the woman is responsible for
household management and operations, and economic/productive activity, some of
which takes her outside the home. Demands on time and energy make it
increasingly difficult for women to provide the kind of <b>Care</b> their
children need. <p>
<p>
     Zeitlin (1992) has studied the impacts the rapid pace of change is having on
children and families.  She concludes that many of the previous roles of the
extended family are being taken on by society. Because of this, Zeitlin is
concerned not only with the families' ability to provide care, but the ability
of local institutions to take on this function as well.  As Zeitlin notes,
<b>Care</b> is moving from the non-monetized dependency relationships within a
family to the monetized public realm, and money does not buy love. <p>
<p>
     Zeitlin provides rich insight into the relationship between family variables
and children's developmental outcomes. The Positive Deviance Research Project,
conducted from 1987 to 1992 was sponsored by UNICEF New York and Nigeria, the
WHO/UNICEF Joint Nutrition Support Program (JNSP) of the Italian Government and
Tufts University.  In five countries (Bangladesh, Indonesia, Nigeria, Nicaragua
and Mexico), Zeitlin and a team of researchers undertook an "intervention
research" approach which encompasses academic research, operational research
and the development of a project.  The particular focus of this study was on
the relationship between family variables and children's nutritional and
developmental status. <p>
<p>
<b>Aside</b>  In conditions where there are poverty, food insecurity and a high
risk environment, good child <b>Care</b> and the social health of the family
and community are the most important variables in determining children's
nutritional success. <i>(Zeitlin)</i> <p>
     <p>
     The study provides insights into the role and impact of traditional care
practices on nutritional status and children's growth and development.  It also
provides a view of what the future holds as traditional practices are lost and
modern strategies are introduced.  <p>
<p>
     To represent the complexity of the data, Zeitlin developed a conceptual model
that is elaborated on in her discussion of practices within the various
cultures.  The basic model posits that overall child growth and development,
while rooted in family resources (material and social), is mediated by family
management, beliefs and caring behaviours.  These include: hygiene and sanitary
practices; feeding practices; affection and attention; and academic stimulation
provided to the child, all of which are components of <b>Care</b>.  Zeitlin
suggests further that for infants and toddlers it is difficult to differentiate
nutritional and developmental outcomes.  <p>
<p>
     In traditional cultures care has been the purview of the entire family
kinship unit. Thus Zeitlin argues that nutritional programmes need to address
the needs of the "family kinship unit, the human entity that survives across
generations", emphasizing in this broader definition the family unit over time,
rather than the individual child or the family within one generation.  <p>
<p>
     The ability of the mother (or the primary caregiver) to provide care for the
infant and young child depends both on her nutritional status and the kinds of
supports that she receives.  The father and other family members have an
important role to play in the child's survival.  Zeitlin found that no matter
whether the father's traditional role called for direct involvement with the
child or just support of the mother, in all cases, "the father's presence,
commitment and contribution was associated with better child nutrition."
Others within the kinship unit also play an important role in caring for,
socializing and teaching the young child.   <p>
<p>
     However, in many places the family kinship network is no longer a stable
source of <b>Care</b>.  This makes it more crucial that programs which wish to
meet the needs of young children address the many dimensions of <b>Care</b>
directly, rather than treating it as a background issue, or assuming that good
care is being provided just because the child is in the company of adults.  The
example of the Asha Sadan remand home and orphanage demonstrates this
poignantly.<p>
          <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
   <i>A Note From the Field</i><p>
<b></b><p>
<b>Asha Sadan - A Hope Fulfilled</b><p>
<p>
     Asha Sadan is a home which affords shelter and protection for destitute and
abandoned children, as well as serving as a remand home for delinquent girls.
This foundling home receives children of all ages in different states of health
and nutrition.  The children remain in care until they are adopted.   The
neonates and sick children are assigned to nursing staff who tend and care for
them.<p>
<p>
     This is the story of the older children who were relatively healthy, but
little else.<p>
<p>
     The honorary managing committee members had noticed that the children were
apathetic and sometimes unruly.  They showed no signs of normal growth and
development.  In the month of August '86 there were thirty-two babies who
needed help, but the managing committee could not fathom the reason.  <p>
<p>
     The children had been provided with a beautiful nursery with fancy cots and
beds and plenty of toys, but were not really allowed to play with the toys
except under supervision. There was a luxurious kitchen and a full-time cook
who dished out nutritious meals at fixed times.  But she was strictly following
instructions, and being anxious by nature, would prepare the food well ahead of
time, then leave it on the counter until the specified time.  The children
spent most of their time looking longingly at the food, partly because they
were hungry, but more importantly because they had nothing better to do.<p>
<p>
     <i>Mobile Creches</i> was requested to help in running the childcare centre
during the day.  Consequently four trained staff members arrived at Asha Sadan
to assess and assist in tending the children.  For the staff of <i>Mobile
Creches</i> who were accustomed to the dust and rubble of construction sites
and creches with low roofs and little ventilation, this seemed like heaven!
There were toilets with running water and a large kitchen.  What luxury.<p>
<p>
     But the atmosphere was strangely disconcerting.  The place smelled of stale
urine and most of the children were either crying or just sitting.  Some of the
smarter ones were pointing to the food on the counter and begging.  The staff
were flabbergasted.  There was no time to be wasted in observing.  They had to
get down to work immediately.<p>
<p>
     Two of them attended to the physical cleanliness of the nursery as well as the
care of the children.  The plastic panties were replaced with comfortable
cotton ones, and toilet training was started.  Almost all the children had head
lice and scabies.  These were immediately treated.<p>
     <p>
     But the most important aspect of child care was affectionate interaction,
coupled with stimulating activities.  These brought about perceptible changes
in the behaviour of the children in the short time of a week.  The children
responded to the love shown to them and began to communicate with the adults
who cared for them.  But when it was time for the caregiving staff to leave in
the evening, there were heartrending scenes.  The children would cling to them
and cry bitterly.<p>
<p>
     By the end of a fortnight all this had changed.  The children felt more secure
and were willing to wave goodbye to the caregivers, secure in the knowledge
that they would come again the next morning.  Slowly they were accepting
discipline without fear.  The routine of feeding children and keeping them in
bed most of the time was slowly modified to include interactive, stimulating
activities for cognitive development.<p>
<p>
     Working with established practices that were unimaginative and outmoded was
not easy.  There was tremendous resistance from the senior nursing staff who
believed that "children should be seen and not heard."  They had established
the rules and nobody dared question them.  For example, at feeding time, the
children were seated on the floor. Bowlfuls of mashed cereal mixed with egg
were shoved into their mouths mechanically by some helpers, with not a word
being spoken.  At the end of the meal, they were given water from the same
bowls.  Then the children were lifted up and put to bed.<p>
<p>
     After many laborious discussions the emphasis was shifted from feeding and
dumping, to nurturing with love and care, as well as to activities for
cognitive development.  More attention to the children's health problems and
habit formation began to pay dividends.  They were encouraged to play and to
use the toys.  The children looked forward to the time allotted for outdoor
play.  Soon they were dancing and singing, and the creche was resounding with
their laughter.  The first faltering words had been uttered, showing that the
children were normal after all.<p>
<p>
     A fortnight after the entry of Shalini, Vasanti, Shakuntala and Saraswati of
<i>Mobile Creches, </i>there was a perceptible change in the children.  They
were happier and healthier and looked forward to each day with enthusiasm.  The
creche was now vibrant with eager children wanting to talk, play, learn and
sing all the time.  Their social-emotional development was beginning to take
place.<p>
<p>
     The children's recorded weights showed an increase of 500 grams exactly one
month after intervention.  They were now feeding themselves from little
gleaming plates and enjoyed the independence.<p>
<p>
     Particular mention should be made of Ashish.  He was totally withdrawn and
uncooperative and would not respond to any instructions.  Twice or thrice a day
he would have a tantrum and would cry inconsolably.  This was his only
communication with the world.  But with patience, understanding and love,
Vasanti was able to win him over in a month and a half.  He related to her and
enjoyed looking through picture books and communicating with her.  His psyche
was still precarious and he reacted to harsh instructions with tantrums, but he
was able to be pacified by Vasanti.<p>
<p>
     For <i>Mobile Creches</i> the experience provided mixed feelings. There was
the frustration of not being able to change the system drastically, combined
with the satisfaction of meeting the challenge and achieving success.  The
initial trials turned into triumphs.  They had brought joy and stability into
the lives of many forgotten children.<p>
<p>
     At the end of six months the children had graduated into balwadis
(pre-school).  But the work is not finished yet. The staff of the remand home
need to be trained for quality childcare, so that every child who enters the
home has a better chance of normal development and a bright future.<p>

<p>
     Zeitlin found that the kinds of <b>Care</b> provided by traditional and more
modern parents have different outcomes.  Looking at the relationship between
<b>Care</b> and children's psychological development in Indonesia and Nigeria,
the researchers found that parents with more modern (i.e. Western) childrearing
practices produce children who are more cognitively advanced and better
nourished, and thus better prepared to participate in the modern world. In
particular Zeitlin's researchers observed in modern families: <p>
<p>
  <i>A change in parental discipline away from immediate physical punishment to
tolerance of slower obedience.</i> There was also an expectation that the child
would have an understanding of the reasons for rules.<p>
<p>
  <i>Prolonged parental protection</i>.  Parents accepted the child's physical
dependency up to an older age, and they provided more attentive feeding and
care. <p>
<p>
  <i>More affection and intimacy</i>. A more personal relationship existed
between the children and the father, and there were more recreations shared by
parents and children.<p>
<p>
  <i>Increased verbal responsiveness to the child</i>.  This included the use
of explanation in addition to physical demonstration in teaching. (Zeitlin,
1993, pg 10-11)<p>
<p>
     While these findings are heartening, modernization has also had a negative
impact on care provided by the family.  Those aspects noted specifically by
Zeitlin include:  <p>
<p>
  <i>A dehumanization of the care environment</i> (with increased use of the
bottle rather than the breast, and the reliance on mass media rather than human
interaction for entertainment).<p>
<p>
  <i>The disintegration of family and community units</i> and of commitment to
each other.  Smaller units of ownership and residence lead to less sharing and
more individualism.<p>
<p>
  <i>A reduction in the ability of families and communities to provide care</i>
given the changing demands of work outside the home.  The nature of this work
does not nurture stable family formation.<p>
<p>
  <i>The feminization of poverty.</i>  When families dissolve, the woman and
her children generally fall into poverty and lack adequate resources for child
care.<p>
<p>
  <i>A reduction in children's altruism.</i> Preparing children to be
autonomous tends to make them precocious, self-centered and unruly.  Those
children reared in more traditional societies are more altruistic.  As
modernization occurs they become more egotistical. (pgs. 11-12) <p>
<p>
     One interesting outcome of this research was the discovery that the same
characteristics of families who exhibited positive nutrition in circumstances
of poverty, were those that led to positive cognitive and social development as
well.  In other words, good <b>Care</b> yields benefits across the board in the
physical, mental and emotional realms.<p>
<p>
     Zeitlin concludes that child care practices are "evolving codes of behavior
that embody a society's perceptions of what children need to survive..., and
what society needs from the next generation."  These "codes of behavior" are
not easily changed.  Parents are not very responsive to what she calls
"shorter-term vertical objectives" such as improved weight gain.  Programmes
that focus solely on weight gain without addressing the families' codes of
behavior are not likely to be very effective.  She adds her voice to the
growing chorus of researchers who argue that support of "nutrition", (often
conceived of by the health field as consisting solely of Knowledge, Attitudes,
and Practices (KAP)), must also incorporate <b>Care</b>, for the child, the
family and the society.  <p>
<p>
     She argues that programmes should be directed toward: <p>
<p>
   "strengthening families, for whom child care is intrinsic          to
self-expression; <p>
   using screening criteria to select dedicated, genuinely       caring alternative
child care providers;<p>
   monitoring the emotional climate of alternative child              care...; and<p>
   empowering the formation of community-based advocacy          and self-help
groups...as these groups affiliate and serve out of a sense of shared purpose."
<p>
<p>
<p>
3.  <b>Children's Health Requirements 
</a></b>
<p>
<p>
     Understanding the health needs and problems of the young child starts
naturally with adequate health inputs for the mother.  After birth, the health
care requirements vary depending on the age of the child.  For example,
nutrition is often a focus of programmes for children under three, since
malnutrition in its various forms contributes to about one-third of all deaths
of young children in developing countries (Engle, 1992).  With children between
the ages of 3 and 6, more emphasis is given to the promotion of school-related
skills and the development of good health habits.  <p>
     <p>
     Over the last five decades much has been written about the effects of protein
deficiency on children's physical development.  Children who receive inadequate
protein intake fail to grow normally, and may develop kwashiorkor, marasmus and
other mild to moderate symptoms of malnutrition.  <b>However, recent research
on the long-term effects of Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) suggest there is
also a linkage between adequate nutrition during the early years and later
cognition.</b>  <p>
<p>
     A series of studies were carried out in four villages in Guatemala.  A first
set were conducted between 1969 and 1977.  Two types of nutritional
supplementation were provided to children up to seven years of age.  Follow-up
studies were then conducted between 1988 and 1989 (when the children were
between 11 and 24 years of age) to assess the long-term effects of the
nutritional supplementation programme.  Two types of supplemental foods were
given.  One, <i>Fresco</i>, was a locally-available drink that contains 59 kcal
per cup, but no protein. The other, <i>Atole</i>, was created as a substitute
for the traditional corn-based drink commonly given to young children.
<i>Incaparina</i>, developed at INCAP, was used as the base of the Atole drink.
It contained 11.5 g of protein; 163 kcal of energy per cup.  Both drinks were
fortified with vitamins and iron.<p>
     <p>
     Children were tested at 6, 15 and 24 months. Even at this point there were
differences in children's mental development scores, based on the amount of
their protein intake. (Pollitt, et.al. 1993).  During the preschool years (3-7)
10 tests were administered annually.  An additional 12 tests were administered
to children 5-7 years of age.  The results of these studies, conducted by
various people, using different methods and different sampling procedures,
showed small but consistent and significant differences between the groups,
based on protein intake; those who took Atole did better. (Pollitt, et.al 1993,
pg. 19)<p>
<p>
     Over time the differences between the two groups increased. The longitudinal
results, when children reached adolescence, indicated that those children who
received Atole scored significantly better on knowledge, numeracy, reading and
vocabulary tests than those who received Fresco.  Within the Atole group, there
were significant differences: children from the lowest economic strata
benefitted the most from Atole.  Those who had Atole supplementation were also
more likely to enter school earlier and to complete more grades within primary
school.  <b>Atole acted as a "social equalizer"</b>.<p>
<p>
     Pollitt also looked at the differences between children who received
nutritional supplementation before and after the age of two.  While nutritional
supplementation was of benefit to children who began receiving it after age
two, the benefits were greater if the children received the supplement before
the age of 2.  From this Pollitt concludes:<p>
<p>
This difference in the range of effects observed among the two groups suggests
that the behavioral development of children is more sensitive to nutritional
factors during the first years of life, particularly during the period of rapid
growth in the brain and body. (Pg.76)<p>
<p>
     Protein intake is not the only determining factor affecting a child's
nutritional status.  In recent years considerable research has been conducted
on the role of micro-nutrients in the short- and long-term development of the
child.  The findings are impressive. They indicate clearly that the lack of
specific nutrients when children are young can have lasting effects on
children's cognitive abilities later in life.  <p>
<p>
     Three micronutrients, iodine, iron and vitamin A, have received considerable
attention and are the topic of a recent World Bank report on <i>Best Practices
in Addressing Micronutrient Malnutrition</i> (1993).  The report focusses on
Iodine, Iron and Vitamin A specifically for three reasons.  First, an estimated
2 billion people worldwide suffer deficiencies of these important nutrients.
Second, a great deal is known about the functions of these nutrients in human
growth and development.  And third, all of these nutrients can be provided to
populations through the application of low-cost technologies, which have been
demonstrated to be effective in alleviating the deficiencies. (World Bank,
1993)<p>
<p>
     In terms of what is known about the functions of these nutrients, there is
clear evidence that deficiencies of any one of these micro-nutrients is
associated with infant mortality.  For children who survive who have been
deficient in these elements, there are life-long consequences.  Further, the
effects of deficiencies suffered during the early years cannot be reversed even
when children are provided with the nutrients later in life.  As noted in the
World Bank report, <b>"When moderate or severe deficiencies coincide with
critical developmental stages, they can cause prolonged or permanent
dysfunction." </b>(pg. 20)<p>
<p>
     For example, fetal iodine deficiency can result in severe, irreversible mental
retardation and neurological disorders.  In less severe circumstances it can be
the cause of deafness, muteness and mild to moderate mental retardation.
Vitamin A deficiency, when not lethal, can cause blindness, a handicap which is
seldom catered to in developing countries.  Iron deficiencies are associated
with prematurity and low birth weights. (pg.21)  Children suffering from low
iron can have lasting immune system problems and growth failure, increasing the
chances of morbidity and mortality throughout childhood.  In terms of learning,
"iron deficiency is associated with poor attention span, inadequate fine motor
skills and reduced memory retention." (pg. 20)  Thus deficiencies of iron,
Vitamin A and iodine can have profound long-term consequences on children's
development.  <p>
<p>
     The costs associated with these deficiencies have been calculated. The World
Bank report provides an example:<p>
<p>
     "If a country of 50 million people had the prevalence of iron deficiency
anemia, iodine deficiency disorders (IDD) and vitamin A deficiency seen in
South Asia, the <u>immediate</u> costs of micronutrient malnutrition to that
society per year would be as follows:<p>
<p>
          359,430 student-years (3% of total) wasted;<p>
1.3 million person-years of work lost;<p>
20,000 preventable deaths;    <p>
11,000 additional severely handicapped children.<p>
<p>
The cost of these deficiencies would depend on the wage rates and the value of
life.  If conservative [estimates] are made of these values, $750 per year in
wages and $1000 for life, the social costs of micronutrient [deficiencies]
would add up to almost $1 billion per year for the current year only, or more
than 20 times the Official Development Assistance per capita received by
low-income countries.  The value of <u>future</u> productivity lost due to
educational failure and disabilities adds a significant additional social
burden.  In addition, there is the non-qualified personal and social tragedy of
unnecessary death, cretinism and blindness.<p>
     Compared to the costs of deficiencies, the interventions to address them are
inexpensive.  The costs of supplementing all pregnant women with iron, giving
everyone under 45 years of age iodine supplements, and supplementing all
children under 6 with vitamin A would cost $19 million per year.
Alternatively, the costs of fortifying food and/or water with vitamin A, iodine
and iron would cost about $25 million per year.  Even if coverage and
efficiency were 50%, the benefits of alleviating micronutrient deficiencies far
outweigh costs." (pg. 28)<p>
<p>
<p>
     Thus the costs of not providing these nutrients greatly outweigh the costs of
providing them.  While there are simple solutions in terms of what people need
in order to increase these nutrients in their diet, actually making them
available and convincing people to include them in their diets is not simple.
The question is, how can they be provided in a cost-effective and
socially-effective way?<p>
<p>
     The process for introducing these micronutrients into people's diet varies,
depending on the source of the micronutrient (whether it is currently produced
and/or available and what it would take to introduce it when it is not).  It is
generally not successful to introduce programmes that are "single-focussed",
addressing only one set of needs.  For example if cassava is introduced to
increase caloric intake, it can replace foods currently being grown that are
richer in iron and iodine.  An increase in caloric intake can mean a decrease
in micronutrients.  Nutritional supplementation efforts must take people's
entire diet into account. <p>
  <p>
     Cultural and political variables are also important in getting micronutrients
into people's diet.  To develop an effective and sustainable programme it
involves people at many levels:<p>
       creating new products that are profitable to produce,          linking health
professionals with the business community;  <p>
       changing people's behaviour, which calls upon the         expertise of
anthropologists, sociologists and educators; <p>
       creating demand, which could be accomplished more         effectively with help
from marketing specialists;<p>
       developing supportive policy, which includes educating         and informing
lobbyists and politicians;<p>
       making adequate resources available to reach those most in          need, which
may require calling upon support from international donor agencies.<p>
<p>
     The sources of iron, iodine and vitamin A are significantly different.  Iron
deficiency is a result of the body's ability to absorb only a small amount of
iron from food.  The best source of iron is red meat, but this is a scarce
commodity for many.  Thus they have to rely on legumes, grains and vegetables
for iron.  The population needs to be educated about the right combination of
these, and the advantages of eating them along with foods that help increase
the capacity of the body to absorb iron (i.e. foods rich in vitamin C).<p>
<p>
     Iodine deficiency is more of an environmental problem.  Where iodine is not
present in the soil and water, it is not available through plants grown in the
area. Thus it has to be introduced from outside through food fortification
(primarily iodized salt).<p>
<p>
     Vitamin A is found in a variety of green leafy vegetables, yellow and red
fruits and vegetables, and some oils.  A decrease in vitamin A intake is
associated with seasonality of foods and/or improper processing.  Again,
education plays an important role in assuring adequate intake of vitamin A.<p>
<p>
     In most situations where there are deficiencies in one of these
micronutrients, there are deficiencies in the others as well.  When there is
food insecurity, for example, people are likely to be deficient in all three
micronutrients.  There is also a significant interaction between these
deficiencies and infectious diseases.  For example, vitamin A deficiency
combined with measles can produce blindness and death; iron deficiency and
anemia increase one's susceptibility to AIDS.  <p>
     <p>
     While deficiencies are clearly associated with poverty and the lack of food,
food security does not assure adequate intake of these micronutrients.  There
are instances where people have a choice about foods to buy and they do not
chose those that would give them the needed nutrients.  Thus education is an
important variable in addition to availability.  <p>
     There is a complex relationship between the availability in the market place
of various micronutrients and whether or not families actually buy and use
them.  Cultural values of the family and community and characteristics of
geo-political systems can make a difference in whether or not these nutrients
get to children.  For example, in some cultures, it is considered unattractive
for pregnant women to eat and gain weight. This attitude could greatly affect
the success of a drive to improve the nutrition of expectant mothers. Thus the
World Bank document presents a case for examining the context within which
programmes are introduced to determine their viability and sustainability.  <p>
<p>
     Levinger (1992) makes much the same point.  While in her monograph
<i>Promoting Child Quality: Issues, Trends and Strategies</i>, she looked at
the impact of the three micronutrients discussed by the World Bank, she also
included research on protein-energy malnutrition, helminthic infections
(worms), sensory impairment and temporary hunger.  In reviewing the research
studies Levinger noted that most of them look at the relationship between these
nutritional and health variables and children's school achievement.  Levinger
argues that school achievement is a very narrow concept, and suggests that we
should instead be looking at what she calls <i>Active Learning Capacity</i>, a
more comprehensive conception of child achievement.   <p>
<p>
     Active Learning Capacity (ALC) is <i>a child's propensity and ability to
interact with and take optimal advantage of the full complement of resources
offered by any formal or informal learning environment.</i>  ALC is the child's
ability to learn in any context, and is the result of all the factors that have
contributed to the child's current status.  This includes the child's history
(nutritional, health and stimulation) and personal characteristics, the child's
family, and the child's environment.<p>
<p>
     Levinger suggests that ALC is the result of an interactive process which begin
at conception.  Along with Engle and Zeitlin, Levinger clearly sees the child
as active rather than as a passive recipient.  From birth onward, she points
out, there is an interaction between primary variables (health/nutrition state/
hunger level and cultural support) and secondary variables (child/caretaker
interaction, aptitude, schooling history and learning receptiveness).  <p>
     <p>
     Her model, drawn from a combination of Anthropology, Epidemiology and
Psychology, links family, community and national institutions to programmes and
polices.  The model encourages a sensitivity to cultural differences and
provides a tool for looking at a child's life in terms of what she calls "child
quality".  Levinger makes a strong argument for focussing on the development of
children's Active Learning Capacity as a way to improve child quality.<p>
<p>
     In their studies of Protein Energy Malnutrition Pollitt et.al. (1993) present
findings that would support Levinger's interactional model of child
development.  They suggest that the effects of malnutrition on body size, motor
maturation, and physical activity are interrelated with delays in behavioral
development over time:<p>
<p>
In particular we conjecture that small body size, delays in motor maturation,
and reduced physical activity contribute to the gradual formation of styles or
modalities of social-emotional and behavioral interactions between the
malnourished child and the environment that slow cognitive development and
educational progress. (pg.80)<p>
<p>
     They posit that children who are small in size are treated by caregivers as if
they are younger and are not provided with the kinds of stimulation that would
promote the development of new skills.  Further, delays in children's motor
development are associated with delays in the development of cognitive
abilities and social skills.  And, malnutrition results in lower levels of
activity, limiting children's ability to explore their environment. Thus the
impact of early malnutrition begins an interactive cycle that has long-term
consequences.   <p>
<p>
     In sum, what children bring to the learning situation is a result of the
complex interaction of factors in their lives.  It includes their nutritional
history, general health status, and the kinds of <b>Care</b> and stimulation
that they have received in the early years.  It is all these factors together
that contribute to a child's development.  <p>
<p>
     If it takes a combination of all these variables to support a child's
development, then programmes for young children and their families should
consciously include them. <p>
<p>
<b>Aside</b> At this point in time, when there are significant dollars being
devoted to health programmes, when there are millions of dollars going toward
nutrition programmes, and when early childhood education programmes are being
created for a variety of purposes, it would be advantageous to build on current
efforts and to make them more comprehensive.  <p>
<p>
     The final section of this article offers suggestions on how to do that.<p>
  <p>
4.   <b>Strategies for Enhancing the Success of Providing Health, Nutrition, Care
and/or Education Components within Early Childhood Programmes
</a></b><p>
<b></b> <p>
     The guidelines for programming outlined in this section come from Evans and
Shah's WHO paper, and are based in part on Levinger's approach to assessing
child quality, Engle's "Caring Analysis Tool" designed to assess current
efforts to improve nutrition programmes in terms of their "enhancement of
care", and the World Bank's guidelines to assure eradication of micronutrient
deficiencies. The following recommendations apply to any intervention designed
to have a positive impact on children's growth and development.<p>
<p>
     <b>Aside</b> Integrating programme components within existing institutional
and service structures is a complex and difficult process.  The time and energy
required to introduce new components is generally underestimated by those
involved. It is not just a technical process but involves important
interpersonal, political, bureaucratic, socio-cultural and resource factors.
<p>
<p>
     To successfully introduce and provide the necessary on-going support for the
implementation of health, nutrition, care and education components, the
following strategies are suggested: <p>
<p>
     4.1. <u>Assess the Existing Situation.</u><p>
<p>
     Before deciding what type of intervention to create it is critical to have a
clear understanding of what exists.  This includes an assessment of the
situation of the child (age, degree of risk of malnourishment), the caregiving
environment (Who takes care of the children? Where are children cared for? Who
supports the family? What institutions and programmes exist to provide support
and empowerment?  Are there untapped resources within the community that could
be used in providing better support for children's development?) and local
childrearing practices and beliefs that can be built upon in the introduction
of new elements. <p>
<p>
     An assessment of the existing situation also includes assessing who the child
is. There is a need to identify some of the child variables that are likely to
affect nutrition and to assess the extent to which these need to be taken into
account in developing a programme.  For example, what are the characteristics
of the children to be served?  Is gender an issue in the culture?  If so, how
should that be addressed? What is the developmental level of the children to be
served?  What type of supports are required?  <p>
     The assessment should include understanding the caregiving environment. One
place to begin is to look specifically at the situation of the caregiver,
primarily mothers, in the community.  What is the status of their nutrition and
health?  What supports do they have and what do they need?  What resources do
they have available to them?  What are the demands on their time?<p>
 <p>
     In designing the assessment, Zeitlin (1993) would suggest identifying
successful or positive practices of individuals within the community, to be
used as the frame of reference in developing supports for families.  Calling
this approach "Positive Deviance" she says that rather than focussing on what
families lack, "identifying, honoring and building on local strength should be
an underlying principle of all types of assessment, analysis and action to
improve care."  When you find individuals who are doing something positive
(positive deviations), then you can look at what factors allowed them to be
successful.  For example, if only two families in a village send their girl
children to school, you can try to identify what makes those families
different.  What supports, beliefs, and practices have led to this positive
outcome?<p>
<p>
      <b>      Aside</b> In assessing the existing situation emphasis should be put on
what is happening that is supportive of child growth and development.  That
should also be the basis for developing new programmes.  <p>
<p>
     4.2. <u>Determine what programme elements should be introduced.</u><p>
<p>
     Here the focus is on specifying the kinds of behaviours that are to be
encouraged within the programme.  These clearly include child and parental
behaviours.  However, they also include community and national (policy-level)
behaviours.  The psychological and social aspects of health, nutrition and
education need to be considered in creating and implementing the programme.  <p>
<p>
     Also important in determining the programme elements is an assessment of the
technology available to help address the need. In terms of micro-nutrients,
what technology can be applied to bring needed micro-nutrients into the lives
of those who need them?  What are the technologies available in terms of
educational programmes?  How can these be made available to more children and
families?<p>
<p>
     4.3.  <u>Create demand for and establish the legitimacy of the activities in
relation to what is currently being provided.</u>  <p>
<p>
     It is important for the community to understand the need for the programme
element, whether it be vitamin A or child stimulation, in order for it to be
introduced effectively.  Those to be involved in the programme (sponsors,
community members and parents) must come to believe in the importance of the
components that are to be introduced.  Even though there may be a child care
programme in place that is fully utilised by the community, if something is
"tacked on" to the programme, it will not necessarily be accepted.  People need
to value the addition and see ways that it can enhance their lives.  Before
offering materials and training to introduce new components, it will be
necessary to conduct a needs assessment to ascertain what is already known and
practiced in a particular setting, and to determine immediate needs and
desires.  Then new elements can be introduced in response to these needs.<p>
<p>
     Once the public is demanding the service or product, then those responsible
must be in a position to supply it, whether that be appropriate care for young
children outside the home, supports for women's involvement in
income-generating activities, immunization dosages, sources of vitamin A, or
other services.<p>
<p>
     4.4.  <u>Begin with parent/community participation in developing the
programme</u>.  <p>
<p>
     Within current development planning, one of the strategies most frequently
advocated is to have strong community participation in programme development,
from the definition of the need, to development of a plan of action, to project
implementation, to evaluation of outcomes.  While this strategy is used in the
development of many basic services programmes, it is seen as particularly
important in relation to early childhood programmes.  <p>
<p>
     It is argued that since parents are the policy makers in most areas of their
children's lives, their involvement in the design and operation of an early
childhood care and development centre increases the likelihood of continuity of
experience between the home and school for the child.  This same argument is
being made for parental and community involvement in the implementation and
management of child care programmes in developing countries.  The general
consensus is that the greater the level of community involvement, the more
likely it is that the programme will meet community needs and become an
integral part of community life.  <p>
<p>
     It should be noted, however, that the extent to which parents can and will
become involved in early childhood care and development programmes is
determined by a number of variables.  For example, there is cultural variance
in the degree to which it is deemed appropriate for parents to be involved in
the education of their children.  In some societies women are responsible for
care of the child, but do not play a role in educating the child.  Thus, they
would not feel they should be a part of the child's on-going education.  <p>
<p>
     Yet another variable is the time that parents have available to become
involved.  Where early childhood care and development programmes have been
developed in response to needs for day care, women are likely to have little,
if any, time to be involved in the day-to-day activities of the programme.  <p>
<p>
     Another variable that affects the extent of parent and community involvement
in child care programmes is related to the political structure of the
programme, and the extent to which control for the programme is centralised or
decentralised.  Where the programme is designed and introduced from outside the
community, there may be little room for parent and community involvement. <p>
 <p>
     While communities have limited resources, the on-the-ground commitment of
communities is what sustains programmes over time.  And, in fact, while other
sponsors may provide comparatively unlimited resources to the initial
development of an early childhood initiative, without community belief in and
commitment to the effort, the child care programme will not be successful.<p>
<p>
     4.5.  <u>Define clearly and openly the goals and limits of the programme
component to be introduced</u>.  <p>
<p>
     Related to the need to help people see the introduction of new components as
useful to them, it is equally important to be clear about what that component
will and will not contribute to the community.  Thus those operating the
programme need to understand clearly what the components are and what their
role will be in implementation.  Input should be sought from the managing
organisation on how the current programme can be changed to reach desired
goals.<p>
<p>
     Sometimes people are eager to take something new on-board but have no
understanding of what will be required of them to make the new venture
successful.  Those introducing the new component need to show sensitivity to
the cultural, social and interpersonal bonds that hold programmes together.
Any programme that has been in place for some time will have a history that has
created a <i>programme culture</i>.  That culture will include both formal and
informal ways of operating and communicating that are an integral part of what
the programme has to offer.  Anyone attempting to enter the programme must try
to understand the culture of the organisation and must not violate the norms
and values that hold the programme together.  It is best to listen and observe
before stepping in with recommendations for changes.<p>
<p>
     There are changes that are likely to occur within the agency as a result of
intervention.  This may include a re-definition of staff roles and the support
required, change in the focus of the organisation in terms of the services
and/or intended beneficiaries.  While the specifics cannot be anticipated, the
potential for changes needs to be recognised and accommodated.  Thus child care
managers and care-givers need to be involved in the planning phase. <p>
<p>
     Similarly, staff need to understand that they will be required to undertake
additional training, and they need to know if the introduction of the
components is going to demand more of their time.  (For example, recording
periodic information on children's growth and development is time-consuming and
may be an entirely new task for staff.)  If staff are not willing to accept the
new demands on them, the programme will not be implemented effectively. Thus
the clearer the goals and expectations are from the beginning, the more likely
it is that the new components will be implemented fully.<p>
     <p>
     4.6.  <u>Develop a climate of support for the effort within the larger
socio-political arena. </u><p>
<p>
     The World Bank document (1993) provides important guidance in terms of being
aware of and learning how to use the political framework within a country in
support of the introduction of micro-nutrients.  The same principles apply when
considering the introduction of any programme component that has an impact on
children's development.  In establishing a programme it is important to be able
to answer questions such as:<p>
<p>
       What political factors might have an impact on children's           growth and
development?  <p>
       What is required in terms of national policy and support       in order for the
programme to be effective?  <p>
       Is there enough political will to address the problem in a          significant and
sustainable way?  If not, what will it take to get policy-makers "on-board"?
<p>
       What legislation and laws are in place (in a variety of        sectors) to
support the implementation of appropriate programming?  <p>
       What other mechanisms need to be put into place?  What is           the process for
doing so?      <p>
<p>
     4.7.   <u>Allow adequate time and resources for planning, start-up, testing
and implementing the programme</u>.  <p>
<p>
     Those sponsoring the introduction of the components are likely to want to get
things moving quickly.  They are aware of the urgency of getting needed
services to populations not currently being served.  They also have a good
understanding of what the components involve and they can see an obvious
<i>fit</i> with current programming.  However, those who will be implementing
the component may need more time to see the fit and to incorporate the activity
into their daily life.  <p>
<p>
     Beyond the needs, abilities and competencies of the local staff are the
bureaucratic and political dimensions that need to be taken into account when
allocating time and resources to the project.  All of these factors will mean
that the programme is <p>
likely to be implemented much more slowly than is desirable.<p>
<p>
     Adequate management systems need to be part of any new approach or technology.
What are current management capabilities (in terms of planning, delivery of
services and goods, training, motivation, and monitoring) within the groups
expected to implement the project?  What additional training and support are
required to make these systems function effectively?  <p>
<p>
     4.8.  <u>Plan from the beginning for programme growth and institutionalisation
of the programme</u>.  <p>
<p>
     One mistake commonly made in the development of programmes is to wait until
the programme is fully functioning and coming to the end of its funding before
thought is given to how to sustain the effort over time.  Experience would
suggest that as the programme is being planned it is important to address the
issue of how it will be maintained over time, financially and in terms of
programme quality.  From the beginning, plans must be made in relation to the
pace of growth and the long-term viability of the effort.<p>
<p>
     In general, when seeking expanded coverage, it would be most efficient to link
new input with large-scale efforts where an infrastructure already exists that
includes facilities, basic services, staffing, training and on-going support.
<p>
<p>
     An alternative strategy is to seek out successful projects, serving those most
at risk, which have the potential for <i>going-to-scale</i>.  Going-to-scale
refers to the process of taking successful small-scale projects and developing
them into programmes that attempt to reach as many potential beneficiaries as
possible, regionally, nationally or even worldwide (Myers, 1992).<p>
<p>
     The ingredients for successfully going-to-scale inevitably vary since
communities possess different social and cultural patterns, organisational and
fiscal resources, problems, norms and history. Nonetheless, there are certain
pre-existing community conditions that enhance or hinder the likelihood of
success of any expansion effort.  The following conditions seem to be critical:
<p>
<p>
      Political commitment at all levels should include an appropriate supportive
policy, adequate budget allocations, and a willingness to make structural
reforms where necessary.<p>
<p>
      Adequate fiscal and human resources must be available. The on-going costs
must be within the community's present and future means. The costs of a
programme may vary in kind and amount from one community to another.<p>
<p>
      The model must be adequately developed. It should be structurally strong yet
flexible and adaptable. An evaluation system should be established.<p>
<p>
      An organizational mandate should be prepared and the organizational and
management skills required to operate the programme should be available within
the host agency. The staff should be selected on the basis of their values and
motivation.<p>
<p>
     While an understanding of programme characteristics is critical in supporting
the expansion of a child care system, another important variable to be taken
into consideration is the sponsor.  <p>
<p>
     4.9.    <u>The Role of Sponsors in the Development and Support of Early
Childhood Programmes.</u>   
</a><p>
 <p>
     There are three levels of sponsorship: programme funding, programme
monitoring/supervision and programme implementation or operation. It is not
uncommon, for instance, for those who provide initial funding and/or technical
support for the programme to have a time-limited involvement.  The expectation
is that after the programme is established it will be maintained, at some
level, by the population being served.  In other instances, funders,
supervisors and operators are one and the same.  Those responsible for funding
the programme actually operate, monitor and maintain the programme over time.
Thus, in seeking ways to introduce primary health care into child care settings
it is important to be able to differentiate between those who provide initial
support and those who maintain the programme over time.  <p>
<p>
     It is necessary to acknowledge and plan for the fact that funders, monitors
and implementers, in the short- and long-term, play different roles in child
care programming, and they would have different roles in the introduction
and/or upgrading of public health care services.  More importantly, however, to
develop a successful intervention strategy, it is necessary to understand the
organisational and bureaucratic structure within which the sponsor operates.
Sponsors of early childhood programmes can be divided into four groups:  <p>
<p>
          4.9.1.  <u>Non-governmental (NGO), Private Voluntary Organizations
(PVO)</u>.
Non-governmental organisations exist outside any governmental structure. They
can be found within the international community, at the national level, or
their scope may be regional.  At the <i>international</i> level there are a
variety of groups (e.g. Save the Children, Christian Children's Fund, Oxfam,
CARITAS, Radda Barna, etc.) who are currently involved in development
programming. These organisation use some of their monies to create schools and
community development centres which address the multiple needs of the child and
community rather than only providing services to children.<p>
<p>
     At the <i>national</i> and <i>local</i> levels there are church-related and
welfare organisations that have developed a range of early childhood
programmes.  In addition, there are voluntary organisations which have seen the
need for early childhood programmes and have taken the initiative to develop
them within their country.  For example, the Botswana Council of Women, a
private voluntary membership organization, has raised the funds necessary to
establish day care centres to support women's increased involvement in the wage
economy. <p>
<p>
     The amount a given NGO/PVO is able to spend on early childhood activities is
determined by the organization's mandate and related budget.  The potential for
these groups to expand their service to young children varies greatly among the
NGO/PVOs.<p>
<p>
          4.9.2.  <u>Government</u>.  There are governmental agencies and organizations
whose involvement in early childhood activities is based on nationally-defined
needs, goals and resources.  Government agencies and organizations frequently
play the role of funder, supervisor/monitor and implementer.  These agencies
are mandated to carry out national policy.  If early childhood programmes are
seen as a national priority, then a governmental ministry will be charged with
the responsibility for developing, implementing and operating related
programmes.  Sometimes only public sector funds are used in the development of
national programmes.  In other instances, the government encourages private
sector involvement as well.  One of the challenges of working with early
childhood programmes is that they have been developed by and operated under the
mandate of a variety of national ministries, including education, welfare,
health, labour, social affairs, women's affairs, youth, agriculture, or some
combination of these.   <p>
<p>
     Within each of these ministries the rationale for the development of early
childhood programmes, the identification of the population to be served,
specific programme goals, the curriculum, staffing, and resources available to
the programme are quite different.  In order to work with government officials
within the various ministries, it is important to know their bias and concerns
if they are to be approached to expand the range of services they currently
provide.  For example, it will take a different strategy to work with the
Ministry of Education than it will to work with the Ministry of Labour; the
rationale for their involvement in early childhood programming is different,
they serve different constituents, and implement different types of
programmes.<p>
<p>
     It is also important to recognize that governmental involvement in early
childhood programmes occurs at the regional or county level, and at the city or
local level, as well as at the national level.  While being responsive to
national policy, the regional and local government groups frequently have a
great deal of autonomy in establishing priorities and creating programmes
designed to meet the specific needs of their constituency.<p>
                <p>
          4.9.3.  <u>Multi-national donor agencies</u>.  Multi-national donors (e.g.
WHO, UNICEF, UNESCO, USAID and other bi-lateral donor agencies) plan from an
international perspective.  They usually provide short-term support.  In
general, these groups establish target populations to serve, develop an agency
policy about how that group is to be reached, and then work with appropriate
national ministries to develop programmes for the target population, based on
national goals and resources.   These agencies tend to provide funding and
technical assistance which supports programme development; they do not provide
funding for on-going programme support, although they might be involved in
monitoring the effort.<p>
<p>
          4.9.4.  <u>The Community</u>.  There are instances where the community has
initiated the creation of child care and/or pre-school activities for young
children.  Sometimes financial and technical support for the effort is then
sought from outside sources.  In other cases the community provides the service
itself.  While this kind of community initiative will assure the continuity of
the programme, there may not be appropriate expertise within the community to
maximise the benefits that such programmes could provide to young children.<p>
<p>
     4.10.  <u>Create monitoring and feedback mechanisms in the early stages and
insure that users are committed to them.</u>  <p>
<p>
     An important aspect of any programme is knowing how well the programme is
doing in meeting its goals and objectives.  In order to make this assessment,
an evaluation or monitoring system needs to be put into place.  While quite
obviously the system should assess the impact of the programme on those being
served, monitoring systems also need to be developed to assess the
effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation.  <p>
<p>
     These systems cannot be set up and operated by people outside the programme.
They should be an integral part of the day-to-day activities of staff.  If
staff are involved in developing the monitoring system, and if they see how it
can help them in their work, then they are likely to follow through and keep
the system going.  However, if the evaluation and monitoring activities become
<i>busywork</i> they will be done without much thought and they will ultimately
have little value.  When staff are able to use the information they are
gathering for planning and making their work more effective, the tools will be
used. <p>
<p>
     <b>In sum</b>, because the introduction of a new programme component implies
disruption of the equilibrium of the social system, it should be based on
mutual negotiation, clarification of intent, adaptation of expectations and
plans, and establishment of consensus on roles and obligations.  The likelihood
of short- and long-term programme success is enhanced by building links between
the old environment and the new programme component.  The staff and management
of the on-going programme need to feel that the new component has something to
offer them and that the links are beneficial to them as well as to the
population being served.  <p>
<p>
<b>ASIDE</b> Given the range of variables which have an impact on a family's
life, it is no wonder that it is difficult to establish programmes to support
young children's development within the context of the family and community.
Nevertheless it is desirable to create programmes that enhance the parent's
ability to function socially and economically as well as addressing children's
needs.  When both the parents and the child are provided with a supportive
milieu it helps assure the child's  healthy growth, early stimulation and
preparation for successful entry into the formal educational system. <p>
     <p>
     Fifty billion dollars is spent each year on 'Health' programmes. In view of
the profound link between physical and mental health and social integration,
any definition of health must necessarily include all aspects of the child's
development. Interventions must go beyond simply providing a one-dimensional
programme, whether that be nutritional supplementation, immunization, or an
education programme for children.  We need to maximise resources by
collaborating across sectors.  If we are going to meet our goals for children
in the year 2000, we need to take on the challenge of building new programmes
that reflect our knowledge of the multi-dimensional, integrated nature of young
children's development.   <p>

<b>THE THIRD INTER-

AGENCY
MEETING OF THE CONSULTATIVE</b><br>
<b>GROUP ON EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE AND DEVELOPMENT</b><br>
<b>January 12-

14,
1987</b><br>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Background</u></b><p>
<p>
	In May 1983, staff from six organizations (Ford, UNICEF, USAID, Carnegie, WHO,
and IDRC) convened at the Ford Foundation in New York to discuss their mutual
interest in community-

based
programmes designed to promote early childhood care and development. After
sharing information about programmes and approaches being supported by each
organization, the group suggested that the informal exchanges continue on a
periodic basis. Accordingly, a second meeting was held at UNICEF's Headquarters
in New York, from October 29-

31,1984,
where special attention was given to the topic, "Going-

to-
Scale
with Programmes of Early Childhood Development." (Full summaries of these
previous two meetings are available from the Coordinating Unit of the
Consultative Group.) A third meeting, hosted by the Agency for International
Development, was held in Washington, D.C. from January 12 to 14, and is
reported upon in the following pages.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Purposes</u></b><p>
<p>
	The third inter-

agency
meeting of the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development had
three major objectives:<p>
	1. <u>To exchange programme information about current child care and
development activities</u> supported by each participating organization.<p>
<p>
	2. <u>To discuss the topic, "Combining Health, Nutrition, and Psycho-

Social
Components in Programming for Early Childhood Care and Development</u>."<p>
<p>
	3. <u>To review activities of the Consultative Group</u> and to think
collectively about its future.<p>
<p>
<b><u>The Agenda</u></b><p>
<p>
	 In the three-

day
meeting, most of the first day was devoted to information exchange. The
remainder of that day and all of day two focussed on the main theme. Working
groups were set up on the afternoon of day two. Day three was spent reviewing
activities and looking ahead. For details of the agenda and alist of documents,
see Attachment A.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Participants</u></b><p>
<p>
	 Among the 27 participants were staff from ten organizations participating in
the Consultative Group (USAID, UNICEF, Ford, IDRC, Carnegie, Aga Khan, The
World Bank, UNESCO, WHO/PAHO, and Rockefeller) as well as individuals from the
Commonwealth Secretariat, a major private voluntary organization (Save the
Children/USA), two research centres (High/Scope, The International Center for
Research on Women), and three universities (Maihdal/Thailand, Bogazici/Turkey,
and The National Teacher Training College/Lesotho). Reflecting the many-

sided
nature of early childhood development, participants came from the fields of
education, medicine, sociology, nutrition, psychology, economics, and social
psychology. Included in the group were present (or former) policy makers and
planners, practitioners and programme implementors, researchers, and funders.
This unusual diversity enriched discussion. For a list of participants, see
Attachment B.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Opening Remarks</u></b><p>
<p>
	 <u>Bichard Bissel</u>, the Assistant Administrator of Policy and Program
Coordination for the Agency for International Development (AID] welcomed the
Consultative Group, noting the importance of such a mechanism as an antidote to
uninformed duplication of efforts and as a basis for informed, less wasteful
programming. He noted that AID is providing considerable support for programmes
of child survival and assists many programmes in developing countries that
focus on the school-

aged
cohort. Little has been done in between those two, however, to support child
care and development. Even so, Mr. Bissel encouraged the Group's efforts noting
the natural follow-

on
of early childhood development to child survival and the need to begin
attending to the "eleven who survive" (see below). He mentioned as well the
potential influence on primary schooling of early interventions that improve
preparation for school.<p>
<p>
	In his remarks, Mr. Bissel urged the group to keep in mind that, with  early
childhood interventions as with other programmes, there is a need to look at
specific demands of particular environments when making programme choices.
There is also a need to consider the sustainability of programmes (within the
resource context in which programmes exist). That is hard to do if programmes
are imposed from outside and does a double disservice if governments cannot
pick up the programmes later. To the extent the Consultative Group can
contribute to fostering local adaptability and to increasing attention to
sustainability it will be performing a useful function.<p>
<p>
	<u> Robert Myers</u>, Coordinator of the Consultative Group, briefly recounted
the evolution of the consultative mechanism. He mentioned four characteristics
which, when taken together, distinguish this Group from others. First, it has
evolved as an<u> informal mechanism</u> with participation loosely defined to
accommodate different levels of interest and involvement while allowing also
for the varied organizational possibilities and constraints existing among
organizations interested in being involved. Second, the mechanism looks
<u>beyond survival to focus on development</u> of surviving children. (Myers
noted  that 11 of 12 children now survive to age one. By the year 2000 it is
estimated that 18 of 20 children will live, and many countries in the Third
World have already reached that level with an Infant Mortality Rate below 50,
making a look "beyond survival" increasingly central for programming.) Third,
the Consultative Group has emphasized <u>mental and social development</u>,
including attention to the interaction of care givers and children, to
nurturance, to language and cognitive development, and to socialization and
early education.   Fourth, the Consultative Group <u>cuts across traditional
sectoral and academic lines</u> in an attempt to overcome isolated viewpoints,
in which knowledge specialization and turf battles within organizations cut the
child into pieces, making integrated attention difficult. The conscious
crossing of lines by the Consultative Group is evident in the theme of the
meeting (combining health, nutrition, and psycho-

social
components) and in the Group's work linking early childhood development to
programmes of women-

in-
development
and to primary schooling.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Programme Information Exchanges</u></b><p>
<p>
	An explicit policy governing the support of child care and development
projects or programmes was an exception rather than the rule among those
present. Indeed, it seems that governments and national organizations in the
developing world are considerably ahead of donor organizations in their
thinking about, and support for, early childhood development programmes.
Nevertheless, international support was being provided for a wide range of
activities intended to benefit children, ages O to 6, in developing countries.
That includes support for such diverse activities as: pre-

natal
programmes to improve the health of women, child care within income-

generating
projects, assistance for a large-

scale
national service of integrated child development, research on home learning and
the transition to primacy school, the testing of early childhood development
measures (and other methods of studying children's development), the
preservation of indigenous toys and games, and longitudinal research examining
forms of child care provided to four year olds and their effects on enhancing
performance in primacy school.<p>
<p>
	Running through the presentations were frequent references to:<p>
<p>
 		 Support for integrated, multi-

sectorial
approaches.<p>
<p>
		 A desire for increased community participation.<p>

Discussion of the Topic, "<u>Combining Health, Nutrition, and Psycho-

Social
Components in Programming for Early Childhood Care and Development</u>"<p>
<p>
	 Although there seems to be almost unanimous agreement that a multi-

faceted,
integrated approach to programming for child care and development is desirable,
that has often been difficult to achieve in practice. The meeting examined why
that integration is difficult, and under what circumstances integration might
realistically be expected. It also identified examples of ways in which such
integration has been achieved (or was being sought).<p>
<p>
	 The topic was approached from two directions. First, child care and pre-

school
programmes were looked at as entry points for health and nutrition components.
Second, the discussion turned to how psycho-

social
components might be included within health and nutrition programmes.
Inevitably, the discussion also brought out the somewhat limited and false
nature of this dichotomized approach, adopted as a discussion device. Other
examples of ways in which the several components might be combined were cited
as, for instance, in an integrated community development approach, or by
integrating the content of educational programmes for a variety of audiences,
or by incorporating all components into women's income-

generating
programmes.<p>
<p>
	1. <u>Child Care and Pre-

School
as Entry</u><p>
	<u>Points for Maternal and Child Health Care</u><p>
<p>
	 The discussion of how to add health and nutrition components into programmes
of day care began with a presentation of outcomes from a World Health
Organization (WHO) meeting held earlier in the year to discuss that topic. In
the documentation far that earlier meeting, a typology had been set out in
which various kinds of day care (at the work-

place,
in formal pre-

school
centres, in community-

run
centres, and in home day care arrangements) were examined for the feasibility
of use as vehicles for delivering different health care components to young
children of different ages. Health components were distinguished in terms of
their promotional, preventive or curative nature, and whether they responded to
nutritional, health (infection), security (from accidents), or developmental
needs. (See Attachment C for one rendering of the typology). Among the
conclusions from the WHO meeting were the following:<p>
<p>
	 If day care is to be used as an "entry point" for maternal and child health
care, a range of programme alternatives is needed, with selection of the
appropriate one depending on the age of the children in day care, the social
and geographic circumstances in which care is given, the type of care giver,
and the location of the care giving (work, neighbourhood, home). Accordingly,
planners and funders of programmes need better descriptions of existing child
care arrangements, through case studies, and national surveys.<p>
<p>
		 A minimum standard of quality is required for day care. Some characteristics
of quality care were discussed.<p>
<p>
		 Unless a primary health care system is already in place, using day care
arrangements to deliver MCH services is unlikely to be successful.<p>
<p>
		 Day care and its extension as an entry point for health care should be seen
as complementary to, not a replacement for, the family.<p>
<p>
		 Formulating a programme should begin with a situational description of
children's needs, followed by an evaluation of how well the family meets those
needs (recognizing that many will be fulfilled by the family), and by an
assessment of how formal and non-

formal
arrangement do, and might do more to, complement family functions in meeting
those needs.  That diagnostic process would identify where additional support
is needed and allow planning of the activities, materials,... required to
provide it. In so far as possible the diagnostic process as well as the
organization and conduct of activities should be participatory.<p>
<p>
	The WHO meeting went on to try and define the kind of training, technology,
materials, and technical assistance that would be required in the different day
care circumstances to use the day care effectively as an entry point for MCH
components of PHC.<p>
<p>
	These and other points from the earlier meeting were set out in a summary of
the meeting provided as background reading.<p>
<p>
	 <u> Discussion</u>.   The focus on "day care" as an entry point seemed too
narrow.  A distinction was therefore made between day care, with its
connotation of custodial caretaking with perhaps some educational content for
children, and "child care," which would include not only a "minimum package" of
services needed for adequate attention to the needs of children, but also a
parental education component. From this broadened definition followed comments
suggesting that the original typology, set principally in terms of where
organized day care occurs, needed to be supplemented by looking at who would be
trained in each of these circumstances. The earlier WHO discussion had focussed
on the training of day care professionals or para-

professionals,
providing them with knowledge about preventive and curative health and
nutrition activities. The broader view was that the "entry point" should really
be training of the parents of children in day care arrangements. The question
then became, "What day care circumstances and what methods would favor
education of parents and other caretakers?"<p>
<p>
	 With a broadened view of the problem to include parents came also discussion
of the method implied in considering "day care as an entry point."  Some
concern was expressed that, in spite of specific attention in the WHO typology
to preventive and promotional as well as curative activities, a curative
emphasis was implied and was likely to prevail unless a different approach was
formulated. Not only would it be necessary to impart knowledge to parents and
other caretakers but it would also be necessary to avoid lecturing them on what
to do, and to motivate participation by linking discussion to highly valued
ideas (e.g. "helping the child be more intelligent") or activities (e.g. income-

generating
projects or community and group discussions of mutual problems). Several
participants suggested that health themes, per se, did not seem to be highly
motivating for parents. Where child care occurs in factory settings, it may be
possible to obtain released time of mothers form the kind of discussions
suggested above. That is more difficult for other forms of day/child care, and
so motivation to attract parents would be critical. Women's organizations exist
in many countries that can be mobilized to this end.<p>
<p>
<p>
	 One participant suggested that educational messages are usually delivered at
the health centres, not day care centres, which provide services for children.
But mothers are in a hurry, and so that medical model does not always work very
well. This led to the observation that messages and desired outcomes should be
differentiated, with those requiring more time or learning (e.g, learning new
forms of food preparation) provided in a discussion setting, perhaps attached
to a child care arrangement.<p>
<p>
	The Group was reminded of the importance of distinguishing child care needs
and arrangements by the age of the child being served. Although the
documentation made that distinction clearly, discussion in the Group quickly
slipped into undifferentiated treatment, with 0-

1
and 3-

6
year olds lumped together.<p>
<p>
	One participant observed that day care seemed to be primarily an urban
phenomenon, associated with a relatively stable source of income, providing
services for a fairly self-

selected
group. That idea was countered with examples of early childhood programmes
(that also provide "day care") from India, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Peru, and
Thailand.<p>
<p>
	A question was raised about the status of serious evaluation of child care
programmes -- in general, and as entry points for health and nutrition. Several
solid evaluations of child care programmes were mentioned, some of which
included attention to health and nutrition components as well as to cognitive
and social development. There was, however, a clear need for additional
systematic evaluation of child care alternatives.<p>
<p>
	Finally, the discussion turned toward the political contexts of governmental
decision-

making
about support for child care arrangements and for their use as extensions of
the public health system. Noting that most child care is still informal and
much of the growth has been in community-

based
or private programmes, a question was raised (but not answered) about the
dynamics by which a growing demand for child care creates a political
imperative to support expansion and improvement of child care. Can one
anticipate pressure points on policy and act accordingly? There was a question
also about the inevitability of increased control and decreased flexibility
with increased involvements of governments. Can a co-

partnership
between the private sector/community/parents and government be forged, or does
government involvement inevitably lead to a shift of responsibility and
control? (Additional attention would be given to this issue in conjunction with
the Colombian case to be described below.)<p>
<p>
	This discussion was followed up in Working Group No. 1, reported upon below.
<p>
<p>
	<b><u>2. Integrating Psycho-Social Components</u></b><p>
	<b>into Programmes of Health and Nutrition</b><p>
<p>
	The second approach taken to the theme turned the topic around by looking at
how developmental components might be worked into programmes focussed on
survival and growth. Two complementary case studies were presented as a basis
for discussion. The first was an action research project demonstrating
integration of psycho-

social
components into a nutrition programme (that was in turn, part of an integrated
rural development programme in rural Northeast Thailand). The second case study
was of an on-

going
set of activities integrating psycho-

social
components into a Colombian national programme of child survival and
development by mobilizing the educational system. In both cases, attention was
given to the process as well as to the content of the activities.<p>
<p>
	<u>The Thai case study</u>.   A case study of the integration of psycho-

social
components of early childhood development in a nutrition education programme of
rural Northeast Thailand was presented by Dr. Nittaya Kotchabhakdi of the
Department of Pediatrics, Ramathibodi Hospital in Bangkok.   Her background
paper, written for the meeting, reported results of a nutrition education
programme based on use of five video modules for the training of community
workers and for the education of parents. The modules dealt with differences
between well-

nourished
and  malnourished children, the value of breast-feeding, basic food groups,
cooking of a supplementary food product, how to encourage babies to eat, and
the importance of providing infants and young children with stimulation and
play materials.<p>
<p>
	 The action research examined children's nutritional status and maternal
knowledge, attitudes, and child regarding practices. Village mothers of under-

two
aged children were interviewed individually prior to introduction of the media-

based
nutrition education, and at 2, 10, and 14 months later. A comparison was made
between families in randomly-

assigned
"treatment" and control villages.<p>
<p>
	 In the paper data from the study were presented that responded to two main
hypotheses:<p>
<p>
		 a. Improved mother-

child
interaction will have a positive effect on child nutritional status, acting
through improvements in maternal understanding of the child's needs and better
feeding of supplementary food.<p>
<p>
		 b. Child rearing practices will be more appropriate if mothers recognize
their children's perceptual and learning abilities, and if mothers recognize
their own potential to help children grow and develop better.<p>
<p>
	Although the research did not show a significant reduction in prevalence of
malnutrition among children of all ages (below the age of two) during the
period of the study, there were important improvements in maternal
understanding of the childrens' needs and changes in feeding  practices. The
persisting malnutrition may have been due to continued early introduction of
semi-

bulky
sticky rice to infants (a practice which interferes with breast-feeding), and
to inadequate breast milk production in rural malnourished lactating mothers.
Significant improvements were found in the percentage of mothers intending to
give their baby colostrum, in maternal awareness of infants' perceptual
abilities, in knowledge and attitudes toward breast-feeding, in child play and
play materials, and in supplementary feeding practices. Random observation
during home visits revealed some changes in mother-

child
interaction, in existing play   materials, and in the type of cradle being
used.<p>
<p>
	In her presentation, Dr. Kotchabhakdi demonstrated dramatically, through a
video presentation, how much mothers and fathers can be helped to recognize
their own abilities to foster development through interaction and by making
changes in the child's environment (e. g. as simple a things opening hammocks
so babies can see what is around them). Once it is  understood by mothers that
a baby of two or three weeks is a seeing, hearing, and reacting person (most
mothers did not think that was the case), changes in behaviour followed
naturally. The presentation illustrated the way in which an increased feeling
of maternal competence can motivate women and lead to self-

sustaining
behavioural changes.<p>
<p>
	Among other research findings were: the importance of seasonal variations, the
superiority of the videos over radio presentations (which can be good reminders
but did not get across the initial message as well), the power of person-

to-
person
exchanges, and the value of an entertaining presentation.<p>
<p>
	<u> Discussion</u>. A question was asked about what benefit the participating
women saw in the programme, Although supplementary food was being made
available, it had to be purchased. That was done in part so as not to use money
or food as an incentive. Rather, the attraction seemed to be a combination of a
fairly personal approach in which field staff backed the video presentations
with personal discussion, of a relatively entertaining presentation, of a
message that related to everyday life, and to the immediate enjoyment that
women seemed to get from seeing immediate results of some of the recommended
actions. <p>
<p>
Related to the above point was a discussion of the process used in the action
research project. Rather than impose a brand of Western-

verified
"scientific" knowledge, the project began with a preliminary survey of existing
customs, then used results to build upon what the community was already doing.
Rather than tell the mothers what to do, the project helped them to discover
ways of controlling their own environment. Although technology was used, the
basic premise of the project was "social" rather than "technological." A
distinction was made between imposing <u>values</u> in the name of science
(e.g. an assumed value placed on "independence") and suggesting
<u>activities</u> that help respond to a value or need that has been defined
locally.<p>
<p>
	When asked what printed materials were used, the response was that only the
growth chart seemed to be useful. pamphlets and leaflets did not seem to work
so well, but a systematic evaluation was not made.<p>
<p>
	Some skepticism was voiced about the feasibility of raising the limited action
research project to a national scale. Did all villages have television so that
the video technology could be carried to them? What would happen when local para-

professionals
rather than university researchers were made responsible for presenting and
discussing the messages? In response, Dr. Nittaya indicated that there was
usually at least one television set in each village so that the medium was not
new and the technology was feasible. Also, the project had actually been
expanded into 40 provinces and the videos had been used to train trainers.
Unfortunately, this is recent and there has not yet been an evaluation of the
expanded programme. However, in the pilot study, an important part of the
success of the project came from the fact that mothers spread the word,
removing dependence on the university personnel.<p>
<p>
<p>
	The discussion also brought out that 97 percent of the village women had had
at least a 4th grade education.<p>
<p>
	No study had been done of costs.<p>
<p>
	School children were also brought into the project. Apparently the upper
primary school children liked the idea of helping younger children. The
teachers encouraged them to make toys. Dr. Nittaya helped the Ministry of
Education to write up external readings for 5th and 6th grade children. There
had been no formal evaluation of that aspect of the programme, but village
health workers reported informally that siblings were in fact more involved
with their younger brothers and sisters.<p>
<p>
	A question was raised about the benefits on the women involved (as well as on
the children who had been emphasized in the discussion and in the evaluation),
One participant hypothesized that one would find important effects on women's
self esteem and her social behaviour. It would be interesting to see whether
women asked more of delivery systems as a result or whether, feeling
"empowered," they took the burden of development more on their own shoulders.
Dr. Nittaya indicated she would like to carry out such a study but there were
not enough hands and not enough time to do it.   In Bangkok, something similar
had been done in which an effect was found on the verbal ability of
participating mothers.<p>
<p>
	The fact that this project was carried out in Buddhist communities led to a
discussion of the role of religion in maintaining or changing child rearing
behaviours, Dr. Nittaya said that many monks were very supportive. At an
abstract level that was easy to do because the messages corresponded with the
religious concerns about peace and harmony and love. There are books by monks
on childrearing, and there are dramas that identify the "good mother's role.
"What the monks have difficulty dealing with are the emotional issues. These
observations led to comments about an approach being taken by UNICEF in Latin
America which seemed very similar. Meetings had been held with the Latin
American Bishop's Conference. Various ways were found in which the messages of
the church and the health, nutrition, and early development messages of child
survival and development programmes come together.<p>
<p>
	In closing the discussion, an intriguing, if unanswerable, question was asked:
"Did desirable childrearing behaviour never exist in the society, or did it
exist and was forgotten?" The latter position is implied in the notion that one
can "rediscover" and build upon local traditions that have fallen into
disuse.<p>
<p>
<p>
	<u>The Colombian case study</u>. Jairo Arboleda for Save-

the-
Children/USA,
and Vicky Colbert from UNICEF/Colombia described their on-

going
experience with helping to set in motion a programme of the Colombian
government that is intended to mobilize the Colombian educational system to
improve child survival and development. Within a National Plan for Child
Survival and Development, this set of activities is supposed to help
institutionalize successes attained through a National Immunization Campaign,
to clarify institutional roles for an effective and sustained effort, and to
look beyond survival to development of the young child. Three initiatives were
described briefly but not discussed in detail: 1) incorporation of health,
nutrition, and development objectives into the primary school curriculum of
ruralschools, 2) the training of "health scouts" as part of the secondary
school curriculum, and 3) including child survival and development components
into normal schools and selected programmes for training professionals within
the universities.<p>
<p>
	 A fourth initiative was emphasized in the presentation -

--
providing family  education for child survival and development in rural areas.
This part of the overall programme would prepare parents, other adults, and
older siblings to promote child survival and to provide adequate child care
during the first  five years of life. The effort builds on the work of Save-

the-
Children,
USA which had developed a set of 10 "child protecting behaviours" as the
essential  component of its approach to increasing child survival in the 58
countries it supports around the world. The original list of 10 hefiaviours
dealt with  health, nutrition, and sanitation. In the adaptation to Colombia,
the list was expanded to 16 behaviours. Behaviours directed toward enhancing
socio-

emotional
interaction were specifically included. Thus, psycho-

social
elements were combined with health and nutrition components in programming. The
list of behaviours is as follows:<p>
<p>
1.		Use of oral rehydration therapy for diarrhea.<p>
<p>
2.		Vaccination of women and children.<p>
<p>
3.		Acquiring and using clean water.<p>
<p>
4.		Sanitary disposal of excreta.<p>
<p>
5.		Appropriate nursing, weaning, and feeding of children.<p>
<p>
6.		Monitoring of child growth and health.<p>
<p>
7.		Finding competent care in case of severe or complicated 	illness.<p>
<p>
8.		Appropriate feeding of pregnant and lactating women.<p>
<p>
9.		Expressing affection to the child in smiling, talking, and 				singing
during feeding, bathing, and clothing the child. 	Avoid any of the previous
actions when you are over tense.<p>
<p>
10.	Interact with the child using songs, story telling, music, and showing and
naming of toys and other objects.<p>
<p>
11.	Facilitate child's games, play with them and make toys using materials
available in the environment.<p>
<p>
12.	Support the child so that he develops the ability to express and movement
of his body: crawling, walking, dancing, and running.<p>
<p>
13.	Promote the expression and communication of the child through painting,
modeling, singing, stories and other.<p>
<p>
14.	Allow the child to do things independently such as eating, getting dressed,
bathing, going to the toilet, selecting the games and the companions with whom
to play.<p>
<p>
15.	Prevent accidents of the child, especially in the handling of work tools
and the activities in the fields and at home.<p>
<p>
16.	Register the child with the civic authorities.<p>
<p>
<p>
	 In order to operationalize delivery of this family education programme, rural
educational institutions are being used. Execution is decentralized, relying on
state and local levels, with mobilization centered on groups of 10 to 15 adults
who are responsible for introducing the desired behaviours into their homes. A
first step in introduction is an assessment of the prevalence of the desired
behaviours and of the viability of adoption. An agenda and a series of meetings
is then set up to deal with one of the behaviours at a time. As part of the
programme, local resources will be drawn upon, including the identification and
involvement of "positive deviant" mothers who already practice the behaviours
and who can explain them to others. Posters, phamphlets, manuals and other
publications are made available to each family.<p>
<p>
	Key features of the initiative are:<p>
<p>
		 Integration (of content and organization)<p>
<p>
		 A family focus with grouping of families<p>
<p>
		 Decentralization (facilitating participation and NGO involvement)<p>
<p>
		 Grouping of families<p>
<p>
		 Large-

scale
use of reinforcing materials made available to families<p>
<p>
		 Use of exisiting infrastructure.<p>
<p>
	Because the programme is at a very early stage, an evaluation has not yet been
carried out, but anecdotal evidence points toward the feasibility of correctly
implementing the strategy with the desired results.<p>
<p>
<u>	Discussion</u>. Considerable interest was expressed in the way in which
theColombian programme build upon existing infrastructure. Particular attention
was given to working with existing groups rather than trying to get around them
to set up something new. In each case, whether the school or the church or the
military or another, the effort has avoided trying to operate by fiat. Rather,
it has explored with each organization the points in common and the existing
points of the doctrine and structures that provide natural points of linkage.
In the medical schools, for instance, there are particular courses that treat
the themes behind the behaviour. In secondary schools, biology course material
provides a natural point of contact. The Catholic church is in agreement with
many of the principles articulated and so has been willing to work ideas into
its counseling for new couples and other activities that are part of its
regular religious services.<p>
<p>
	In contrast with Thailand, it was felt that print media can have an effect in
Colombia.<p>
<p>
	   A missing behaviour was pointed out. In much of the Western world
"touching" in not encouraged, but it is an important expression of affect
already existing in the indigenous culture which should be reinforced and
retained.<p>
<p>
	The need for evaluation was strongly expressed by participants, both as a
guide to the programme and because the results would be of interest more
broadly.<p>
<p>
	The special circumstances present in the Colombian case were noted. For
instance, funds were available that were not being used effectively (through a
two percent payroll tax). Also, there was strong Political commitment. and a
national immunization campaign had just been carried out that provided an entry
point. In reply, it was suggested that there are always special circumstances
present. The trick is to identify them and to build upon them.<p>
<p>
	Common to both the Thai and Colombian cases seemed to be the following:<p>
<p>
		1. Political support and commitment.<p>
<p>
		2. Well-developed infrastructure that could be called upon.<p>
<p>
		3. A relatively well-

developed
level of human resources.<p>
<p>
		4. A technology that helped make the desired outcomes concrete.<p>
<p>
		5. Available financial resources from national sources.<p>
<p>
	Discussion of the Thai and Colombian cases were continued in Working Group No.
2 (see below).<p>
<p>
<b><u>Some Distinctions</u></b><p>
<p>
	From the presentations and discussions came a number of distinctions  helping
to define and analyze complementary ways of integrating or combining  health,
nutrition, and psycho-

social
components of early childhood care and development. First was a set of
distinctions related to different points in the process of defining and
implementing programmes. Integration might occur:<p>
<p>
 at a conceptual level;<p>
 in the setting of policy and in planning;<p>
 in organizing and carrying out a programme; and. ultimately, in the minds and
actions of individual caretakers.<p>
<p>
<p>
<u>Conceptual integration</u>. A concept of "total" or "holistic" development
of the child seemed to be accepted by all present. However, several
clarifications were made during the meeting that sharpened and helped to
operationalize that idea.<p>
<p>
	1. <u>The starting point for development</u>. Dr. Lucas reminded the group
that development begins with conception. So that the idea of total development
must include attention to the pre-

natal
period and to the health, nutritional statui, and well-

being
of the mother during pregnancy.<p>
<p>
	2. <u>From "day care"" to "child care."</u> Dieter Berstecher questioned the
care " as a starting point for discussion because it was too narrow -

-

implying a kind of formal, centre-

based
custodial arrangement for fixed periods of time, when the concept of total
development reguires broader attention to the range of environments, including
the home, in which the child is developing. The term "child care" was suggested
to capture that conceptual broadening.<p>
<p>
	3. <u>From "mother" to "caretaker."</u> Several participants encouraged the
group not to restrict discussion of developmental influences to the  mother.
Fathers, siblings, grandparents, and other caretakers (or better  yet, care
givers), should be included when thinking about programmes to  enhance the
total development of the child.<p>
<p>
	<u>Integration in Policy and Planning</u>. There is a tendency to think in
terms of a health policy, a nutrition/feeding/agricultural policy, an
educational policy, etc., but not a child development policy. The same is true
for plans, which are often made by sectors, with little integration of the
various components that affect the young child in a synergistic manner. It was
observed, however, that integration at the level of policy or plan is much
easier than integration in implementation.<p>
<p>
	<u>Integration in Programme Implementation</u>. Most implementation occurs on
a sectoral basis so that administrative integration is difficult. Participants
seemed to chorus the difficulties of achieving integration in the
implementation of programmes. The Indian Integrated Child Development Service
(ICDS) has had problems of integration, despite some concerted and creative
efforts to achieve such integration. Most discussions of implementation seem to
focus on administrative integration, and often on devices for overcoming the
vertical nature of the several delivery systems involved. The ICDS. for
instance, has created inter-

sectoral
committees at several levels. These sometimes do not work because geographical
responsibilities are assigned differently for health, nutrition, and early
education sectors or because the relative prestige of the various sectorial
actors is different. In some places, integration is being sought by assigning
implementation responsibility to NGOs whose task is then to act as a bridge
across the sectors. It was noted that integration was more likely to occur when
a strong organization was in place at the level of the village or district that
could do the integrating. One suggestion was that often, the most that could be
expected would be geographic convergence of programmes, not integration.<p>
<p>
	Although administrative integration is difficult to achieve, integration of
the <u>content</u> of programmes seemed to be more feasible. Much of the
discussion at the meeting had to do with ways in which the content of
programmes might contain the several elements desired, working with each of the
sectors and with various organizations involved in implementation. In large
part, this was thought to be a training problem.<p>
<p>
 	<u>Integration at an Individual Level</u>. In the last analysis, an
integrated view of child development is sought in the minds and actions of care
givers.   Again, the problem seems to be an educational one requiring a look
not only at the formal ways of transmitting knowledge about early care and
development hut also attention to the cultural and social influences on child
care. More than simply broadcasting messages with integrated content to a vast
public seemed to be called for.<p>
<p>
	Another set of distinctions was made in terms of the many kinds of
<u>individuals and organizations involved in the delivery of early
childhood</u> <u>programmes</u>, each requiring a different approach in order
to try and achieve integration of health, nutrition, and psycho-

social
components into their work. These included: the academic community with its
knowledge specialization, the several professional communities (doctors,
nutritionists, nurses, educators, child development specialists, etc. whose
training often leaves out or treats poorly one or more of the components), para-

professionals,
funders, policy-

makers,
NGOs and PVOs, the churches, etc.  Any broad attempt to combine components
would have to examine barriers and possibilities to integration in the training
and activities of each of these groups.<p>
<p>
	These distinctions were suggested as appropriate to keep in mind in the
working group discussions.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Reports of the Working Groups</u></b><p>
<p>
	Two Working Groups were set up, corresponding to the two main approaches made
to the theme of the meeting. Each group was provided with several guiding
questions to discuss, including, for example, under what circumstances
combining components might occur, where the focus of efforts should be, and
what resources are available. Each was asked also to suggest what the
Consultative Group might do to promote integration.<p>
<p>
	<u>Working Group No. 1: Day Care and Preschool Programmes as an Entry
Point</u><p>
<p>
	1.   All types of day care (governmental, locally organized non-

formal,
and others) should provide an adequate environment that will facilitate
physical and psychological development of the child including health,
education, and nutrition as their basic components.<p>
<p>
	2.   In order to accomplish a comprehensive approach to health. PHC should
work specifically in collaboration with the education sector (day care centres,
etc.). This is also true for the different levels with each sector system.<p>
<p>
	3.   Assuming that more specific developmental actions are already well
established, and there is an excellent health network, we identified several
activities in the health area that could be accomplished by the day care
worker:<p>
<p>
	--    Provide a healthy environment (stimulation), accident prevention and
model behaviour for an appropriate child care minder.<p>
<p>
	--    Screen children with simplified instruments or indicators and refer them
to health centres or related professionals.<p>
<p>
	--     Promote health activities with emphasis on health education and
monitoring of growth and development to be provided to parents and community
members.<p>
<p>
	--     In close connection with the health worker, undertake preventive
services, such as a complex level of diagnoses and collaborative preventive
actions such as in major anemia and deworming as well as specific treatment
required for any other diseases.<p>
<p>
	4. In order to accomplish the health activities mentioned it would be
necessary to analyze the functions and training already existing with each
section involved, mainly health and education.<p>
<p>
	Based on the above, we identified two aspects that need to be addressed by the
Consultative Group:<p>
<p>
	-   Emphasis on <u>training</u> is essential to a comprehensive approach.
Specifically, attention should be given to training of middle level supervisors
for both sectors (health and education). Training centres should include
information in their curriculum from each sector involved (mainly health and
education) and should also include the necessary tools for dissemination of
knowledge for in-

service
training to grass-

root
workers.<p>
<p>
	-   Develop<u> indicators and instruments</u> to facilitate evaluation of
health status, including growth and development monitoring, and a follow-

up
system to evaluate the referral system.<p>
<p>
<u>	Working Group No. 2 -


Summary Report</u><p>
<p>
	<u>Procedure</u>. The group was to consider the assignment with reference to
integration at: 1) a conceptual level (academics, etc.), 2) a policy level (how
policy gets set), and 3) an implementational level/users level (geographical,
organizational, content, combining resources). It was asked to keep in mind
also the various actors: academics, professionals (medicals doctors/nurses,
nutritionists,...), funders/policy makers/planners, users (care givers), the
general public, social institutions, Buddhists, Catholics, etc., NGOs, etc.<p>
<p>
We talked around a number of points using the above guidelines but did not get
around, for shortage of time, and possibly lack of a systematic approach, to
addressing how these levels and people or organizations are combined in any
particular programme. We spent quite a bit of time on Question 1 (see below),
briefly discussed Question 2 (see below) and finally <u>underlined what we need
to do</u> in terms of getting the whole cycle of change or intervention
started, and implemented. Lastly, we had a few recommendations to the
Consultative Group on what it would do in the near future.<p>
<p>
	<u>Question No. 1</u>. Why is there not more attention to psycho-

social
development particularly to mother-

child
(care giver-

child)
interaction, for children 0-

2?<p>
<p>
		The term, "psycho-

social,"
addresses cognitive, personality, emotional, and social 	development vs.
physical growth. Possible explanations given for the lack of attention
include, but are not restricted to:<p>
<p>
	 Not enough is known in this area; the child development field is in its
infancy in some parts of the world, e.g. Africa.<p>
<p>
	 There is an under-

utilization
of psychologists and educators who could provide answers (psychologists have
low income, less prestige, no power, in comparison to medical doctors).<p>
<p>
	 Psychologists themselves are of different persuasions, use different tests
(often developed and normed elsewhere), and attempt to generalize, ignoring
cultural variations. Cross-

cultural
psychology is therefore important as a balance.<p>
<p>
	 The importance of attachment in the early years is over-

emphasized.<p>
<p>
	 Psycho-

social
outcomes are not discrete -


they need to be measured, not once, but repeatedly.<p>
<p>
	 The audience seems uncomfortable (psycho-

social
= threatening; indicators appear "soft" for other professionals).<p>
<p>
	 Vertical arrangement, rather than intersectorial, integrative (ideas
integrations, organization integration, bringing people together, content
integration).<p>
<p>
	<u>All in all</u>, the concept is recognized as important, there are a number
of road-

blocks
that make it difficult for us to fully address its different aspects, and to
articulate it in a manner understood by our varied audiences.  <u>The
challenge</u> for the professionals is to <u>simplify</u>, nay, <u>demystify
</u>the concepts of psycho-

social
development. In the meantime, what do we do? This leads to Question 2.<p>
<p>
<u>	Question No. 2</u>: What needs to be done within child survival programming
to respond to psycho-

social
needs of children 0-

2?
<u>A Prior Question</u>:   Why choose 0-

2,
why not 0-

6?<p>
<p>
	 Attention to mental and social development before age 3 is minimal at best.<p>
	 Programmes attend to ages above age 3.<p>
	 Programmes for survival, health and nutrition have grown: hence we are using
it as an entry point.<p>
	 Early intervention is important for longer term cognitive development.<p>
<p>
	<u>What should we do?</u> We need to "sell" the product (Vance Parkard,
"Hidden Persuaders"). To do this, we need to know where our audience is coming
from.<p>
<p>
	 Provide simple, concrete, operationalized statement.<p>
	 Provide rationale for your intentions, especially for academics.<p>
	 Break the message into meaningful, do-

able
chunks.<p>
<p>
	<u>The Thailand Example</u>. The importance of interaction with the child was
pointed out (action research, training field level workers). We notice it is
also do-

able.
We recognize: maternal competence; nutrition (you get more food eaten by the
child if you know how to handle the social interaction with the child). <u>The
Colombian Example</u> illustrated the importance of starting from the
concrete.<p>
<p>
<u>A Wider Rationale</u>. Why start early childhood education?<p>
	 The moral argument -


every child has a right to developing.<p>
	 The scientific argument -


early years are critical.<p>
	 The social-

equity
argument -


affect poor more.<p>
	 The economic argument -


investment brings economic return.<p>
	 The population argument -


fertility rates decrease.<p>
<p>
	We need to piggy-

back
psycho-

social
development on other programmes, but we can also use it as an entry point to
community development. To stress that in the final analysis it is the family
and the community that provide the anchor for all activities related to psycho-

social
development and sustainability of those activities.<p>
<p>
	Focus of effort should be on advocacy,<u> especially to the top</u>.<p>
<p>
	<u>Recommendations for Consultative Group</u>. We did not get to a point of
fully addressing how the conceptual, policy level, and implementation level
issues could be addressed in a single programme. Nevertheless we felt we had
enough concrete points to enable us to make some recommendations.<p>
<p>
	1.   Clarification and verification of measures on psyche-

social
development are needed.<p>
<p>
   	2.   There is a need to analyze medical curricula and nutrition manuals
(say of 2-

3
professions) to determine what elements of psycho-

social
development are needed. Make appropriate changes and design appropriate in-

service
and pre-

service
training accordingly.<p>
<p>
	3.   Make a case for feeding as a social activity.<p>
<p>
	4.   Look for ways in which videos could be used for advocacy.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Consultative Group Activities and Finances</u></b><p>
<p>
	<u>Activities</u>. Although the Consultative Group remains an informal
mechanism it has carried out a range of information-

gathering
and dissemination activities. A summary of these activities is provided in
Attachment 0. During 1985 and 1986, eight review or concept papers were written
and distributed. Three issues of the <u>Coordinators' Notebook</u> were
produced. A Knowledge Network has evolved that now includes approximately 400
individuals or institutions in 90 countries. Also available are several trip
reports providing information about meetings and early childhood programming in
countries visited by the Coordinator.<p>
<p>
<u>	Finances: 1987 and Beyond</u>. Financial support for activities of the
Consultative Group is in place, at a level of approximately $225,000, for
activities anticipated in 1987. This includes the support given in-

kind
by UNICEF, providing office space and covering the cost of communications,
photocopying, and mailing. The Ford Foundation, AID and UNICEF are the main
financial supporters in 1987, with contributions to the joint exercise also
coming from Carnegie, IDRC, the Aga Khan Foundation, and UNESCO. Some funds are
committed for 1988.<p>
<p>
<u>	Activities: 1987</u>. A tentative work plan for the Coordinating Unit for
1987 was presented and discussed. It is anticipated that during the year, a
minimum of four review/concept papers would be completed and three or four
issues of the <u>Coordinators' Notebook</u> produced. The Knowledge Network
will continue to grow slowly. The Consultative Group would also help to
organize and provide Summary Reports for three or four meetings. Other possible
activities for 1987 and beyond are suggested in the report of the Advisory
Committee (see Attachment E). A review and evaluation would be carried out
during the first half of i987 to assist the Group in deciding what course to
take in the future.<p>
<p>
<u>	 Looking Ahead</u>. The attached report from the Advisory Committee
strongly recommends continuation of the Consultative Group mechanism and
provides suggestions for a variety of information-

gathering
and dissemination activities which, in its opinion, need to be undertaken.<p>
<p>
	When the Committee's report was discussed on the third day of the meeting,
several topics received particular attention. The measurement problem was
mentioned from several perspectives as important to take on. Included among the
concerns were ethical as well as technical questions related to the development
and use of early childhood development measures. Part of the task seemed to be
demystification. Another part was reaching agreement among people from
different schools of thoughts.<p>
<p>
	Considerable support was expressed for organizing a process to make available
good video tapes of early childhood experiences. It was clear from the meeting
itself that good videos can have a strong impact.<p>
<p>
	The link to women's programmes was also emphasized. A suggestion was made that
this might be a theme for the next Consultative Group meeting.<p>
<p>
	Not in the Committee's report but receiving attention in the discussion was a
review and synthesis of training experiences at various levels, from the
training of medical doctors to the training of community-

based
para-

professionals.<p>
<p>
	Several of the organizations present made statements in support of continuing
the Consultative Group, UNICEF indicated it was willing to continue its
financial contribution beyond 1987 at approximately the same level. AID
suggested the Group consider increasing the level of activity, with a somewhat
more institutionalized structure, and said it would be willing to consider
contributing to support at the higher level as long as AID did not become the
major funder. The World Bank thanked the Consultative Group for helping re-

open
discussion of the early childhood care and development topic within the Bank
and thought the Consultative Group mechanism might help the Bank in the future
by continuing the discussion and helping assess requests the Bank might
receive. A hope was expressed that the Bank could continue to be involved
modestly as a participant in the mechanism. Save-

the-
Children
thought an arrangement might be made for its participation by helping translate
the <u>Coordinators' Notebook</u> into Spanish.    <p>
	In order to improve communication about current policies and programmes, a
suggestion was made that participants might send a note on this to the
Coordinator every three months. The Coordinator would then send out the
information gathered in a kind of <u>Newsflash</u> to the Consultative Group
participants.<p>
<p>
	The Committee's recommendation to learn more from the practices and
experiences of NGOs was in need of additional focus. One way to do that would
be to look specifically at the role of NGOs in service delivery vis-

a-
vis
governments. How do NGO and governmental institutional frameworks fit? Do they
cooperate, and if so, and with what effect? Also, in conjunction with NGOs, the
earlier discussion was recalled about ways in which religious organizations can
and do provide vehicles for improving the total growth and development of young
children.<p>
<p>
	The Consultative Group and its Coordinating Unit might do more advocacy for
programmes of child development than it has done to date, beginning within the
participating organizations.<p>
<p>
	Participants felt the role of the Advisory Committee should be strengthened.<p>
<p>
<u>	Evaluation/Review</u>. The general tone of the discussion led to the
suggestion that the proposed evaluation to be completed by June 1987 be seen as
formative in nature, and largely prospective. The exercise should, however,
include an independent look at the quality of the work being produced by the
Coordinating Unit. It should also seek out the value to practitioners as well
as to the participating agencies, making a virtue of the fact that national
governments and local organizations seem to be running well ahead of
international agencies in this field. (Indeed, a suggestion was made that the
"inter-

agency"
label should be dropped, and that more emphasis should be put on assisting
field efforts.) To put the proposed evaluation/review in motion, it was agreed
that the Coordinator should, after further consultation with participating
agencies, recommend several possible evaluators, with a final selection made
from the list by a three-

person
committee composed of the Coordinator, and staff members from Ford and
UNICEF.<p>

<p>
	A Knowledge Network has grown to include approximately 400 individuals in 90
countries. An attempt has been made to locate individuals who are themselves
"brokers" of information. Three issues of a bulletin called the
<u>Coordinators' Notebook</u> have been produced and mailed, together with
several reprints of articles, studies, and photocopies of tables of contents
from periodicals in the field. The response to these mailings has been high and
encouraging.<p>

<b><u> REPORT OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE</u></b><p>
<p>
<b>Third Inter-

Agency
Meeting of The Consultative Group</b><p>
<b>on Early Childhood Care and Development</b><p>
<b>January 12-

14,
1987</b><p>
<b>Washington, D.C.</b><p>
<p>
<p>
	The Advisory Committee to the Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and
Development is composed of the following six members, in alphabetical order:<p>
<p>
		Lukas Hendrata (UNICEF/New York HQ)<p>
		Nittaya Kotchabhakdi (Child Dev. Unit/Ramathibodi Hospital, Thailand)<p>
		Cigdem Kagitcibasi (University of Bogazici/Istanbul, Turkey)<p>
		Barnabas Otaala (National Teacher Training College/Lesotho, Africa)<p>
		Sheila Vir (Aga Khan Foundation/New Delhi, India)<p>
<p>
It may be worth noting that the members represent a wide distribution and
representation in terms of geographical (continental) diversity and types of
organizational and professional affiliation.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Observations and Conclusions</u></b><p>
<p>
	The Advisory Committee met three times during the Third Inter-

Agency
Meetings of the Consultative Group and made the following observations and drew
the following conclusions on the basis of the Consultative Group discussions.<p>
<p>
A.	First of all, the starting point of the discussions was the assumption that
the Consultative 		Group would and should continue. It would, indeed, be very
disappointing if the recent 		accomplishments and the potential contributions
of this group and especially of the 		Coordinating Unit are not adequately
recognized and supported. This might lead to the 		dissolution of the Group,
one of the available options, which is not at all acceptable. Thus, 		the value
and importance of the Consultative Group are strongly endorsed.<p>
<p>
B.	 Secondly, and in substantive terms, there needs to be the basic recognition
that early 		childhood development covers the total span of time beginning with
the pre-

natal
period 		and extending into the start of primary schools. Thus, early child
development 		programmes fit within this time span.<p>
<p>
C.	Several suggestions were made for procedural/administrative action;
information gathering 		and synthesizing activities; programme directions and
dissemination of information for the 		Consultative Group.<p>
<p>
<p>
<b><u>Regarding Procedural Orientations:</u></b><p>
<p>
	1. In the activities of the donor agencies, including the Consultative Group
activities, attention should be given to drawing upon  and strengthening the
services of developing country institutions and individuals for consultancies
and projects. In conjunction with this point, the Coordinating Unit could
develop a roster of institutions and individuals to be called upon for
consultancies.<p>
<p>
	2. A concerted effort should be made in crossing bureaucratic and academic
boundaries; interdisciplinary and inter-

sectorial
approaches should be fostered.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Regarding Information Gathering/Synthesizing and Programme
Directions:</u></b><p>
<p>
	1. The diversity among and within developing countries should be recognized.
An effort should be made to collect baseline information where this is lacking.
Equity should be observed in geographical/other orientations.<p>
<p>
	2. The Consultative Group/Coordinating Unit should foster inventorying and
analyzing of projects and programmes (much as is being done by UNICEF and
UNESCO in the Latin American region).<p>
<p>
	3. Programmes emphasizing family and community involvement should be
encouraged.<p>
<p>
	4. A set of case studies should be put together based on successful
experiences. These cases should include information about antecedents,
description of what was done, discussion of problems and lessons learned and
evidence of project impact.<p>
<p>
		a. One set might deal with projects in which child care arrangements' hate
combined health/nutrition and psycho-

social
components in different ways.<p>
<p>
		b. Another might look at child care as related to women's work.<p>
<p>
The case studies should then be used as fertile ground for learning and
exchanging ideas.<p>
	5. The Coordinating Unit should organize analyses of existing indicators,
instruments, and in general, measurement devices that are intended for use in
screening, monitoring, and evaluating early childhood development.
Clarification and cross-

cultural
validation of measures should be undertaken. A series of regional workshops
should be held to set criteria for <u>developing</u>/choosing/analyzing
indicators and instruments. In this process culturally sensitive professional
expertise should be tapped.<p>
<p>
	6. A comprehensive definition of child care should be developed including
categorization of the different forms it may take. Toward this end pilot
projects should be carried out in several countries designed to provide
statistics about the range of child care programmes that exist, with the idea
of developing a system of information that could map and track the coverage and
general characteristics of child care. Consideration should be given to the way
in which such statistics and information systems might assist effective
programme implementation.<p>
<p>
	7. Analyses should be done of the training materials for health and nutrition
professionals and for educators to see how the topic of early childhood
development is treated and with recommendation for reform. This might begin
with analyses of medical school curricula and nutrition manuals.<p>
<p>
	8. There should be a focus on women in early childhood development research
and programme implementation. This focus should integrate the productive and
the reproductive roles of women rather than pitting one against the other.
Toward this end "women in development" approaches in  theory and practice
should be made compatible with early childhood development approaches by
further concentrating on the intersecting needs of women and children.<p>
<p>
	9. Research and programming for parent education should be encouraged as a
means of supporting/educating/empowering parents and other care givers. This
would lead toward providing a more healthy environment for child development.<p>
<p>
	10. A comprehensive review/evaluation of home/family day care programmes
should be undertaken. Diversities as well as commonalities should be
established regarding these programmes.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Regarding Dissemination of Information:</u></b><p>
<p>
	1. An issue of the <u>Coordinators' Notebook</u> should be devoted to
presenting information from a variety of sources describing minimal needs of
good day care centres.<p>
<p>
	2. The <u>Notebook</u> should be translated into other languages.<p>
<p>
	3. A catalogue should be made of existing videos prepared as training or
advocacy materials. The best of these should be selected for translation, if
necessary, for reproduction, and for distribution to interested institutions. A
composite video might be prepared showing  experiences from a range of projects
and programmes.<p>
<p>
	4. A meeting of major international and national NGOs should be organized.
Each participating institution should be asked to prepare one or more case
studies, in line with the previous suggestion regarding case studies.<p>
<p>
	5. A position paper should be written to be used as an information and
advocacy document in meetings of international funders, professional
associations, and national governments.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Evaluation</u></b><p>
<p>
	The Consultative Group should stress the importance of and promote thinking
and work toward evaluation activities in all early childhood development
research and programming.<p>
<p>
<b><u>Administrative Issues</u></b><p>
<p>
	Staffing of the Coordinating Unit, frequency and timing of the Consultative
Group meetings, etc., need to be discussed and determined.<p>

<b>1.</b>      <b>Introduction</b><p>
<p>
Over the past few decades there has been a ongoing dialogue about child care.
Research and articles have focussed on whether or not care should be provided
for young children outside the home.  In recent years the debate has been
stilled somewhat, not by research suggesting the efficacy or harmful attributes
of child care, but by the reality of people's lives.  Demographic, social and
economic factors, such as population growth, changes in the composition of the
labour force, the shift from agriculture to industrial employment, migration
from rural to urban areas, and changes in patterns of family life have all
affected the way people live and the types of health and social service
supports they require.  For many, child care is a necessity, not an option. <p>
<p>
The response by families, communities, non-governmental organisations and
governmental bodies to the need for child care has been to develop a wide
variety of early childhood programmes available to children from soon after
birth until the time they enter the formal school system.  These systems exist
throughout the world, serving people in a wide variety of settings. <p>
<p>
At the same time that there is an increasing need for child care and early
childhood programmes are being created, those involved in the health sector are
seeking ways to expand the delivery of health services.  Given the goal of
health and social programmes to bring basic services to all people, a range of
strategies is needed.  The creation of primary and/or maternal and child health
care centres constitutes one strategy.  Yet, in many developing countries these
may not as yet reach the high risk groups; families living in rural and urban
slum settlements have typically been under-served through health centres.  <p>
<p>
While there are a number of reasons for the lack of utilisation of health care
centres by certain segments of the populations, a contributing factor is that
preventive health care is not often seen as a priority by traditional and
low-education groups.  Where maternal and child health services are available
they are often seen as sources of therapeutic or remedial rather than
preventive care.  Moreover, planning by the health and social sectors has
typically failed to incorporate many of the perceived needs and expectations of
the communities for whom the planning has been undertaken.  As a result, the
services that are available have neither attracted the attention, nor inspired
the confidence, that would have ensured their appropriate use.  Therefore, the
challenge is to find ways of delivering primary health care services,
particularly to low-income families in both urban and rural settings, that will
bring those services to populations not currently being served.  <p>
<p>
One possible strategy is to integrate health care into the rapidly expanding
systems of child care that are developing out of family and community needs.
The focus of this document is on how that might best be done.  But before
discussing the feasibility of such an approach, it is important to define what
is meant by child care systems. <p>
<p>
In the literature there are a range of terms that refer to group care of young
children (from birth until the age at which the child enters the formal school
system, generally between the ages of 5 and 7), outside the home.  For example,
the word, <i>Creche</i>, generally refers to services for children under the
age of 2. <i>Child Minding</i> or <i>Family Day Care</i> is care provided in
the home of a woman in the neighbourhood. <i>Daycare</i> generally describes
full-time care provided for children, most often in a centre.  And there are
<i>pre-school</i> programmes that are designed to prepare young children for
entry into the formal primary school system. To encompass all these situations,
and for the ease of usage, the terms <i>child care</i> and <i>early childhood
programmes</i> will be used in this document to describe group care for young
children, regardless of the age group or the setting.  <p>
<p>
For the purposes of this document, child care and early childhood programmes
will include all those situations where: i) the care of the child is
transferred from the parent to a caregiver who is outside the family system;
ii) this transfer is formalised in the sense that there is a recognised
economic value to the care being provided (whether or not the parent is
actually involved in direct payment); and iii) there is a definite pattern to
the care being provided over time.  This definition excludes situations where
members of the extended family take on care-giving responsibilities.  It also
excludes situations where occasional care is needed or given (e.g. babysitting)
on an irregular basis.  The argument is made in this document that the full
range of child care programmes can be used effectively to achieve primary
health care goals.  <p>
<p>
The first section of this document provides information on the situation of the
young child in various parts of the world today. This is followed in Section 2
by a delineation of the particular needs of children under six and their
parents and a definition of maternal and child health components which can be
introduced into child care systems to meet those needs.  Section 3 presents a
typology of child care systems, illustrating the range of settings within which
child care is currently being provided. The specifics of what is required in
order for Maternal and Child Health Care components to be delivered through
child care systems is in Section 4, and Section 5 presents a discussion of the
curriculum, materials and support services that need to be developed by the
health sector in order to introduce MCH components into existing programmes.
Section 6 presents a discussion of cost issues.  The document concludes with a
brief description of what needs to happen next to advance the development of
integrated services for young children and their families through early
childhood care and development programmes. <p>
<p>
1.1.  <u>The Situation of Young Children
</u>
<p>
<p>
One and a half billion children will be born in the decade of the 1990s
(UNICEF, 1990).  Given economic conditions worldwide, these children will
increasingly be born into poverty and situations which threaten their chances
for optimal human growth and development. <p>
<p>
The quality of the environment in which millions of children are growing up is
inadequate by any number of criteria. Overcrowding, lack of potable water and
sewage facilities, lack of adequate food, and inadequate caretaking
characterise the environments of many young children.  Frequent infection (most
commonly diarrhoea) and malnutrition account for over 50% of all infant
mortality in developing countries.  These statistics are likely to worsen as
the numbers living in urban areas increase, which they will.  It is estimated
that by the year 2000, urban populations in the developing countries will
increase from the 1 billion in 1980 to 2.1 billion.  This represents a 110 per
cent increase, compared with a projected increase in the world's population
during that same time period of 38 per cent.  A further expansion of urban slum
and squatter settlements is inevitable.<p>
 <p>
This situation is of concern to many.  In recent years there has been an
attempt to focus the world's attention on the needs of children, as evidenced
by the <i>Summit for Children</i> convened in September 1990, and the fact that
the <i>Convention of the Rights of the Child</i> was brought to the General
Assembly of the United Nations in 1989, setting universal standards for
children in relation to survival, development and protection.  But the
Convention and other documents provide only for the ideal.  They do not
guarantee what will happen in the life of an individual child.  Therefore it is
necessary to develop policies and programmes at the regional, national and
local levels to turn the wording of Conventions into reality.  The various
United Nations organisations whose mandates include children have taken on the
challenge.  However, children cannot be viewed in isolation.  They are part of
an ever-changing family and community. By understanding more about changes in
the family and community it is possible to anticipate the impact on children's
growth and development.  Such an understanding should then provide the basis
for intervention programmes that meet the needs of children and their families.
<p>
<p>
1.2.  <u>The Changing Family Environment
</u>
<p>
<p>
The rapid pace of change is having an impact on families world-wide.  Dramatic
changes resulting from technological advances in the industrial and
agricultural fields are leading to the breakdown of traditional social
institutions.  When describing the consequences of changes in family and
community life as a result of modernization, the tendency is to focus on the
negative aspects of change.  However, there have been some positive benefits.
For example, there have been changes in the way parents raise their children
that have been positive for the children in terms of their school performance.
Through a research study conducted in Bangladesh, Nigeria and Indonesia,
Zeitlin (1993) was able to identify parental behaviours among more modern
families that were associated with better school performance.  She noted:<p>
<p>
  <i>A change in parental discipline away from immediate physical punishment to
tolerance of slower obedience.</i> There was also an expectation that the child
would have an understanding of the reasons for rules.<p>
<p>
  <i>Prolonged parental protection</i>.  Parents accepted the child's physical
dependency up to an older age, and they provided more attentive feeding and
care. <p>
<p>
  <i>More affection and intimacy</i>. A more personal relationship existed
between the children and the father, and there were more recreations shared by
parents and children;<p>
<p>
  <i>Increased verbal responsiveness to the child</i>.  This included the use
of explanation in addition to physical demonstration in teaching. (Zeitlin,
1993, pg 10-11)<p>
<p>
While these findings are heartening, modernization has also had a negative
impact on care provided by the family.  Those aspects noted specifically in
Zeitlin's (1993) research include:  <p>
<p>
  <i>A dehumanization of the care environment</i> (with increased use of the
bottle rather than the breast, and the reliance on mass media rather than human
interaction for entertainment).<p>
<p>
  <i>The disintegration of family and community units</i> and of commitment to
each other.  Smaller units of ownership and residence, lead to less sharing and
more individualism.<p>
<p>
  <i>A reduction in the ability of families and communities to provide care</i>
given the changing demands of work outside the home.  The nature of this work
does not nurture stable family formation.<p>
<p>
  <i>The feminization of poverty.</i>  When families dissolve the woman and her
children generally fall into poverty and lack adequate resources for child
care.<p>
<p>
  <i>A reduction in children's altruism.</i> Preparing children to be
autonomous tends to make them precocious, self-centered and unruly.  Those
children reared in more traditional societies are more altruistic.  As
modernization occurs they become more egotistical. (pgs. 11-12)<p>
<p>
Zeitlin's research looked specifically at the impact of modernization on
children's lives.  There are some more global changes which more generally
impact the quality of family life, indirectly affecting the growth and
development of children.  These include:<p>
<p>
     1.2.1.  <u>Changes in the traditional functions of the family</u>. <p>
<p>
One particularly important support has been the extended family system. In the
past, close family ties provided a built-in measure of economic, emotional and
social security to children and families, but this traditional support for
families has been disrupted.  Many of the previous roles of the extended family
are being taken on by society.  So notable is this trend that the phrase
<i>public familism</i> has been adopted to describe the family functions that
now are provided outside the family. (Dizard and Gadlin, 1990)  One of the
consequences of this public familism is that family functions that did not have
monetary value when they were performed by the family now have to be bought.
(Zeitlin, 1993).  One of the major functions of families being shifted from the
family to those outside is child care. <p>
<p>
     1.2.2.  <u>Changes in the structure of the family</u>.  <p>
<p>
The size of families is declining.  This is due partly to the fact that people
are having fewer children, but more significantly the decline in family size is
due to a move from multi - generational family groupings to the nuclear family.
The extended family system of traditional societies is being replaced by the
nuclear family which often fails, by  virtue of its limited number of adults, to
provide the care and support required by children.  It is also important to
note that these smaller families are not stable units.  There is fluctuation in
the numbers in a household as a result of seasonal and work - related in - and
out - migration.  <p>
<p>
     1.2.3  <u>Changes for the girl child.</u> <p>
<p>
Women and girls have become the focus of international attention.  Thus
patterns of care which relied on the older girl child to care for younger
children in the family are being challenged.  Girls who have traditionally been
responsible for the care of younger siblings are attending school at an
increased rate and being encouraged to complete their education.  This has an
impact on patterns of care within the family.  <p>
<p>
     1.2.4.  <u>Changes in the nature of women's work.</u> <p>
<p>
New economic pressures on and possibilities presented to women mean they
increasingly work outside the home, often for long hours and following
schedules that limit their availability and thus the time they can devote to
child care.<p>
<p>
In rural areas women often work in the fields.  While in many cultures women
have historically constituted a majority of the agricultural work force, in
other settings the out-migration of men who are seeking employment in other
locations has increased women's agricultural role.  In addition, in some
agricultural settings plantation economies and cash crop production have meant
that there too women are increasingly being exposed to demands of rigid time
and work schedules similar to those common in urban environments. <p>
<p>
In both urban and rural environments there is an increase in the number of
women-headed households.  This necessarily impacts the woman's work load.
Women have always played multiple roles that compete for their time and
physical and emotional energy.  Regardless of the context within which children
are raised, care of children, particularly young children, is still the woman's
responsibility.  In addition, the woman is responsible for household management
and operations, and economic/productive activity, some of which takes her
outside the home.<p>
<p>
The literature would suggest that women's work outside the home produces direct
benefits for children, particularly if the woman has control of the monies that
she earns.  In these instances, children are likely to have improved health and
participate more fully in education. (Engle, 1980)  However, there are also
costs. Demands on time and energy make it increasingly difficult for women to
provide the kind of care their children need. <p>
<p>
There is a growing recognition of the need for child care for the children of
the vast majority of working women.  The question is, what kind of child care
should be provided at what point in a child's life? <p>
<p>
The rapid growth and early acquisition of motor and cognitive skills typical of
infancy and early childhood make children vulnerable to a variety of health,
nutritional, psycho-social and other environmental conditions.  Those living in
poverty are particularly at risk of poor physical and psycho-social
development.  Thus it can be argued that a critical time to assure survival and
sustained development is during the early years.  Child care outside the home
is usually required for children during these most crucial stages of a child's
development, from birth to 6 years of age.  In the next section the biological
and psychosocial needs of young children are described.  Also included in the
section is a delineation of the maternal and child health components required
to promote optimal growth and development that should be included in any child
care system<p>
<p>
<b>2.  Key Needs from Conception through the Early Years</b><p>
<p>
In terms of physical, intellectual, emotional and social well-being, the period
from conception to age 6 is the key to subsequent growth, development and
ultimate productivity.  Pre-natally through the sixth year there are several
distinct stages.  They include: intra-uterine, intrapartum, post-partum (birth
to 1 month), early infancy (the first six months), late infancy (6-12 months),
toddler (1 to 3 years), and the pre-school child (3-6 years of age).  <p>
<p>
The various developmental transitions that the young child goes through in the
first years require constant adjustment and present potential threats to health
and survival. These transitions are compounded by stresses of poor
socio-economic, sanitary and environmental conditions that are themselves
changing rapidly. The younger the child, the greater the susceptibility to
morbidity and mortality and the more difficult it is to disassociate the
physiological and psychological factors within the environment that governing
health.  <p>
<p>
Conditions in the environment, such as the child's relationship to the mother,
affect children in different ways across these stages.  For example, the
mother's health and nutritional status are critical to the baby's well-being
pre-natally and during the first few months of life.  Influences on the child
during the prenatal period include the mother's pre-pregnancy weight and how
much weight she gains during pregnancy, her dietary intake, how much energy she
expends, and her emotional state (Engle, 1992). It is estimated that a
nutritional anaemia afflicts close to half of all women of childbearing age in
developing countries, and more than 70% of pregnant women suffer from
malnutrition. (Sivard, 1985) These data suggest that more than half of the
children in developing countries enter the world under less than optimal
conditions.  <p>
<p>
Combined with the conditions within the physical environment which are
important in supporting children's growth and development, are the conditions
within the family context.  An important dimension of the family environment is
care. <p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
2.1.  <u>The Role of </u><cite>Care</cite><u> in the Child's Development
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
The quality of <i>care</i> the young child receives determines his/her
development. During the post-partum and early infancy stages the mother is
generally the primary caregiver, sometimes with considerable support from
others and sometime alone.  She is responsible for the safety, care and feeding
of the child, and, to varying degrees, for providing stimulation for the
child's cognitive and psycho-social development.  As the child grows older,
others in the family and community play an increasingly important role in the
care of the child.<p>
<p>
Care includes much more that keeping the child safe and free from harm.
Caregiving behaviours include breastfeeding; providing emotional security and
reducing the child's stress; providing shelter, clothing, feeding, bathing,
supervision of the child's toilet; preventing and attending to illness;
nurturing and showing affection, interaction and stimulation; playing and
socializing; protecting from exposure to pathogens; and providing a relatively
safe environment for exploration (Zeitlin, 1991, Myers, 1992).  A second set of
caregiving behaviours includes the use of resources outside the family,
including curative and preventative health clinics, prenatal care, the use of
traditional healers, or members of the extended family network (Engle, 1992).
All of these behaviours are a part of supporting the development of young
children.<p>
  <p>
The type of caregiving behaviour which is required depends to a large degree on
the child's developmental age and the health and nutritional risks the child is
facing.  For example, during the first year of life the child is at the
greatest risk of mortality.  During late infancy (or when complementary foods
are introduced) and during the toddler period the child is at greatest risk of
growth faltering.  <p>
<p>
While growth faltering may be the result of inadequate nutrition, there is
clear evidence to suggest that the feeding of young children is more that
providing them with food.  Feeding includes the interactive process which
accompanies the intake of food.  This process is part of caregiving, and the
way that care is provided during the feeding process can have a profound effect
on the child's later development. Studies comparing children who are well and
poorly nourished suggest that there are positive <i>caring practices</i>
associated with children with better nutritional status, even though the
children come from the same type of environment as their malnourished peers.
(Zeitlin, 1993)   <p>
<p>
In the context of feeding, caring practices include frequent physical contact,
being consistently responsive to the child's needs and showing affection to the
child.  Care also includes <i>active feeding</i> which means being aware of how
much the child is eating, offering the child a second helping, assisting the
child in the use of a utensil instead of expecting complete self-feeding, and
offering praise for eating. (Engle, 1992)<p>
<p>
The studies of nutrition are but one example of current research that indicates
the powerful effect of the interaction between the child and his/her
environment on growth and development.  Another example comes from longitudinal
studies of children growing up in poverty.  In Hawaii, Werner (1982) was able
to identify children who were able to thrive even though the conditions under
which they were raised would suggest they would be malnourished and not develop
well.  She termed those children that did well as <i>resilient</i>.  Those
characterised as resilient evidenced greater autonomy and competence (pg. 158)
and clearly did better developmentally and over time than their non-resilient
peers.  They did better because they were able to "elicit predominantly
positive responses from their environment."  And these children were found to
be "stress-resistant', compared to children who elicited negative responses
from their environment.<p>
In her research, Werner sought to identify what makes some children more
resilient.  She concluded, as have others, that the differences between
children who thrive and those who falter are determined by the type of
interaction that occurs between the child and the environment.  Important
elements of this interaction that help determine the child's ability to thrive
include the amount of affective stimulation and the kind of care the child
receives.  It is important to note that the linkage between the child and the
primary caregiver, usually the mother, is not the only important variable.
Even when this linkage is positive, the level of support the caregiver receives
from others in the family and from society plays an important part in the kind
of care that person is able to provide.  <p>
<p>
It is also important to note that what the child brings to the situation is as
important as what the environment provides.  Early on a cycle can be
established that leads to and reinforces poor developmental outcomes.  The
cycle can begin with an unresponsive infant who does not engage with adults.
As a result caretakers find the child unappealing and fail to provide the
stimulation that is needed to promote development.  The results are evidenced
in young children as apathy, reduced responsiveness to people and the
environment, and the inability to attend to tasks. The cycle gets reinforced.
The child is even less appealing and adults do not choose to interact with the
child. The child becomes more invisible and without significant interaction
with adults, does not achieve optimal development. <p>
<p>
The impact of the interaction between the child and the environment has
implications for nutritional status, disease management and influences patterns
of morbidity and mortality.  Further, severe malnutrition, disease, and
infection suffered during the early years has a permanent effect on later
development, not only because of the consequences to the child's physical
well-being, but because these variables interact with and have an impact on the
child's social and cognitive development.  <p>
<p>
In view of the profound link between physical and mental health and social
integration, any definition of health must necessarily include all aspects of
the child's development and the establishment of <i>care</i> for the child must
go beyond simply providing food and safety.<p>
<p>
2.2.  <u>Children's Requirements for Care
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
From the child's point of view, care outside the home should support and
complement the mother's as well as the family's role in providing the basic
developmental needs.  At the same time, the care should enhance the parent's
ability to function socially and economically.  When both the parents and the
child are provided with a supportive milieu it helps assure the healthy growth
and early stimulation of the child, and prepares the child for successful entry
into the formal educational system. <p>
<p>
As noted, children have different needs, depending on where they are
developmentally.  In general, the youngest children are completely dependent on
adults.  As they become toddlers, environmental cleanliness, encouragement of
eating and vigilance in terms of the child's safety are of utmost importance.
As the child enters the pre-school years he/she is more self-reliant.  As noted
by Engle (1992) these children "are initiated into the culture of children, and
may even become fledgling caregivers themselves... they may have developed
skills to obtain food for themselves, and the wisdom to protect themselves a
little from pathogens in the environment. (pg. 25)  <p>
<p>
While the general description of differences across the ages is important, in
order to create a programme for young children, it is critical to have more
specific information on their needs.  An indication of developmental
differences is provided by Donohue-Colletta (1992) for three age groups.  She
defines the needs as follows:<p>
<p>
     Infants (birth to 1) need:<p>
            protection from physical danger<p>
            adequate nutrition and health care<p>
            an adult with whom to form an attachment<p>
       an adult who can understand and respond to their                  signals<p>
            things to look at, touch, hear smell, and taste<p>
            opportunities to explore the world<p>
            appropriate language stimulation<p>
<p>
     Toddlers (1-3 years of age) need these things as well as:<p>
  support in acquiring new motor, languages and             thinking skills<p>
  a chance to develop some independence<p>
  help in learning how to control their own behaviour<p>
            opportunities to begin to learn to care for                      
themselves<p>
  daily opportunities to play with a variety of objects<p>
<p>
     Children ages 3-6, in addition to the above, need:<p>
  opportunities to develop fine motor skills<p>
  encouragement of language through talking, reading,       singing<p>
  activities which will develop a positive sense of        mastery<p>
  opportunities to learn cooperation, helping, sharing<p>
       experimentation with pre-writing and pre-reading          skills  (pg. 65)<p>
<p>
In any child care setting, these elements should be present to support
children's overall development.  As the health sector begins to examine ways in
which appropriate linkages can be made between child care settings and health
services, a similar differentiation can be made between the health needs of
children depending on their developmental ages.  What follows is a definition
of the maternal and child health components that are important during each of
the stages, with a description of those that could be delivered through child
care systems.<p>
<p>
2.3.  <u>Children's Health Requirements</u>  
</a><p>
<p>
In considering the MCH components that can be delivered in child care
programmes, it is necessary to differentiate what might be offered to different
groups.  The place to begin is with the mother.  From the onset of conception,
the child and mother are inextricably linked and this is maintained after birth
through breast-feeding and psychosocial nurturing. The understanding therefore
of the health needs and problems of the young child starts naturally with
adequate health inputs for the mother. These are possible through child care
services.  Early childhood care and development programmes can successfully
provide an avenue for reaching mothers, both before the child is born and once
the child is part of a child care programme.<p>
<p>
In relation to young children, three groups will be considered:  infants;
children from 1-3 years of age; and children from 3-6 years old.  This grouping
is suggested based on the fact that often these groups are served in different
contexts.  Further different emphases are given to health care components
within these three age groups.  For example, nutrition is often a focus of
programmes for children under three.  With children between the ages of 3 and
6, more emphasis is given to the promotion of school-related skills and the
development of good health habits.  <p>
While there are some health needs that have preeminence during certain stages,
there are others that should be given equal emphasis across all ages.  For
example, across the age continuum there should be opportunities for cognitive
stimulation and psycho-social support.<p>
<p>
In sum, one of the ways to begin to look at health inputs is to define what
children need based on their developmental age.  Another way to do it is by the
type of health input that could be provided.  These are discussed in the
section which follows.<p>
<p>
2.4.  <u>Types of Health Provision
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
Health needs can be divided into three categories: <i>promotional</i>,
<i>preventive</i> and <i>curative</i>.  Promotional activities are those which
involve providing people with information so that they are aware of what
constitutes good health practice.  Promotional activities have a general
education focus and are designed to influence knowledge, attitudes and beliefs,
as well as practice.  Preventive activities are quite specific and frequently
require a discrete set of actions.  For example, immunization would be
classified as a preventive activity.  Curative actions, as the name implies,
are those taken in order to restore health once an individual is ill.  Each of
these will be discussed in relation to the age groups defined above.<p>
<p>
     2.4.1.  <u>Promotional activities</u>.  <p>
<p>
These fall in two categories.  There are those directed toward the caregivers
and those that are a part of the child care setting.  In terms of the
caregivers, there are messages that should be passed to mothers in relation to
the child's growth and development.  At the most fundamental level, the mother
needs to be given information about breastfeeding.  Ideally these messages
should be delivered to the mother when she is pregnant.  If it is at all
possible, given the mother's work load and the timing of the child care, the
mother should be supported in breastfeeding the child.  Then, at the
appropriate time, the mother should be given guidance and support in the
introduction and use of complementary foods and the feeding process.  Family
members also can be provided information on how to detect diseases, how to
prevent accidents and the importance of parent-child interaction.<p>
<p>
The second category has to do with health promotion within the child care
setting.  The physical setting itself should promote good health.  This can be
done through the environment, which should be a healthy place for children and
adults.  There should be opportunities for movement and play, both indoors and
outdoors, and there should be safe drinking water and sanitary facilities.  <p>
<p>
However, the promotion of health in the child care setting goes beyond
establishing a safe environment.  It also includes the quality of the
interaction between the caregivers and the children.  Within the child care
context the caregivers should be able to create an environment that promotes
the child's overall growth.  For example, they should be able to implement a
feeding programme that includes both adequate food and a feeding process
supportive of children's development.  Caregivers should be able to screen (as
well as monitor) children's nutritional status, their vision and hearing.
There should be ample opportunity to promote children's abilities to think,
reason, and engage in creative problem solving.  Within the daily routine good
health habits should be promoted, including self-care, care of the teeth, and
personal hygiene.  All of these elements should be part of a caring environment
that provides children with security and promotes children's self-esteem,
helping them develop new skills, knowledge and competencies.<p>
<p>
     2.4.2.  <u>Prevention</u>  <p>
<p>
Prevention also has two categories: those activities that can be done with
family members to prevent accidents, disease and malnutrition in the home and
community, and activities that take place within the child care setting.   The
same education process employed in promoting good health can be utilised in
relation to prevention.  And, in the same vein, the types of activities
undertaken in the child care setting to promote health can also be implemented
to prevent accidents and disease.  An additional activity for prevention might
be the introduction of immunization services, growth monitoring, Vitamin A
supplementation, and other basic health services.  At a minimum they should be
able to link with a health care service so that referrals can be made for these
services. <p>
<p>
     2.4.3.  <u>Curative</u>  <p>
<p>
Within this category the primary focus is on the child in the care setting
where it is possible to make provision for curative care in relation to
childhood diseases, most commonly diarrhoea, worms and anaemia.  In addition
nutritional supplementation and positive feeding practices can be introduced
for malnourished children.  It is particularly important in relation to
curative health care to be able to refer families to health services.<p>
<p>
As a reference point, Table 1 has been created to present visually a summary of
the types of promotional, preventive and curative health actions that can be
successfully delivered via child care programmes, by the age of the child.   As
can be seen, a wide variety of critical health activities can be undertaken
within child care settings.<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
<p>
In addition to providing the minimum package sketched in Table 1, the more
formal child care programmes are able to do more feeding and carry out growth
monitoring.  Depending on the number of children being served, it would also be
possible to provide direct health care through the presence (full or part-time)
of a nurse.<p>
<p>
It must be noted, however, that it is only with adequately trained staff that
these health services can be developed and delivered. Thus another step in
considering the MCH components that can be delivered through child care
programmes is to differentiate between those that can be delivered by child
care personnel, with appropriate back-up and referral mechanisms, and those
that require the skills and knowledge of health care personnel.  While
caregivers can be trained to provide a range of health care activities,
particularly those associated with promotion and prevention, in some instances
someone from the health sector needs to be available to deliver services such
as immunizations. <p>
<p>
In sum, there are a variety of MCH components that could logically be delivered
through early childhood programmes. The question is, how feasible is it to
deliver these components through child care systems?  In the next section an
argument is made that while there are pros and cons of using early childhood
programmes for the delivery of health care, clearly the scale is tilted toward
the positive aspects of such a collaboration.<p>
<p>
2.5.  <u>Characteristics of Child Care Programmes
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
There are some compelling reasons for using child care programmes for the
delivery of health care components.  But, in order to determine the feasibility
of doing so, it is important to define the supports for integrating child care
and health systems and the constraints to such a process. <p>
<p>
     2.5.1.  <u>Positive/supportive factors</u><p>
     <p>
          2.5.1.1.  <i>Early childhood care and development programmes exist in
some form in all parts of the world</i>.   They have been begun under the trees
in rural Africa, and organised in the streets of Chile. They have also been
developed through national initiatives devoted to promoting the healthy growth
and development of all children, as in India, Mauritius and parts of Southeast
Asia. While in many instances an infrastructure exists to support these
programmes, they are frequently under-utilised in terms of the range of
services that could be provided. In general, those programmes not sponsored by
the health sector have not taken up the health care and health monitoring needs
of children and mothers.  Even fewer have responded to the opportunities
presented for complementing, and building on, existing primary health care
activities, and for creating opportunities for cognitive and psycho-social
stimulation. For example, many feeding programmes focus only on providing
nutritional supplementation to young children; they are unaware of the
necessity for psycho-social stimulation, and the potential that their programme
offers to provide such stimulation.<p>
<p>
          2.5.1.2  <i>While early childhood programmes generally reach only a small
percentage of the eligible population, they have the potential to reach many
more.</i>  In many developing countries approximately 50% of the population is
under the age of 15. More than a third of these are under the age of 5 (World
Bank, 1984).  By taking into account young children's families, it is possible
for child care programmes to touch the lives of more than half the population.
        <p>
<p>
          2.5.1.3.  <i>Early childhood programmes are expanding rapidly due to
increasing demand</i>. The demand has come from urban and rural communities,
from those wanting better health care, from those concerned with supporting the
child's cognitive development, and from those seeking a safe place for their
child. The demand is illustrated by the increase in the number of child care
centers available over the years.  For example, in 1969 in Tanzania there were
only 280 centers.  By 1980 there were 3,500.  The increase is much more
dramatic in Kenya where in 1968, early childhood programmes served 175,000
children; by 1980 that number was 300,000, and it had increased to 800,000
children in 1992 (Myers, 1992).  Even so, the programmes which exist serve only
a small percentage of the eligible population world wide.  But the situation is
changing rapidly.  Increasing demand is leading to the development of a wide
variety of child care programmes.<p>
<p>
          2.5.1.4. <i>Early childhood care and development programmes have a social
attractiveness and acceptability that invites participation from families that
might not avail themselves of primary health care services</i>.  For peoples in
many parts of the world, early childhood programmes are a priority. Given a
choice, a community may well begin by creating an early childhood programme.
An example comes from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia where the health sector was
interested in establishing health care services, but the community was
interested in early childhood care and income generating activities.  Once
these were established, the community was open to the development of health
care services. Thus, support for and the utilization of early childhood care
and development programmes in many settings may be more regular than is often
the case with health care and family planning services.<p>
<p>
         2.5.1.5.  <i>Primary health care is a logical extension of the current
services being provided within early childhood care and development
programmes</i>.  Health care is a part of the child's total development, and as
such should be seen as a part of and provided within the context of children's
services.  Health services are currently being provided as part of a variety of
child care programmes.  For example, a non-formal education programme for
pre-school aged children in Puno, Peru, has been used as the base for the
implementation of a number of health programmes.  It provided a setting for a
regional immunization programme, touching the lives of families in the
community as well as the children served in the programme.  <p>
<p>
          2.5.1.6.  <i>Early childhood care programmes are a way of promoting
family and community as well as child development, thus meeting primary health
care goals for the population in addition to meeting the needs of the young
child. </i> Through the process of linking MCH components with early childhood
programmes there is an opportunity to assess the role that communities can play
in delivering quality health and development services to young children and
their families.  In particular, there is interest in maximizing the extent to
which persons from the community, with basic training in screening, disease
management and nutrition, can complement the health and welfare sectors and
provide a meaningful extension to primary health care programmes.<p>
<p>
Child care offers parents and the community the possibility of participating in
the health care of their own children through the monitoring of physical growth
and development, the early detection of physical and psychosocial handicaps,
nutrition surveillance, immunization against major diseases, prevention and
treatment of common diseases and health education. In addition, child care
programmes can provide a channel of communication between families and health
services, which in turn can assist in making parents more aware of better
hygienic and nutritional practices.<p>
<p>
          2.5.1.7.  <i>Early childhood care and development programmes are
gaining national and international support</i>. In a number of instances in
Latin America and South East Asia, national legislation exists which supports
the development of child care programmes. Frequently such enabling legislation
is connected with Labour Law which requires businesses with more than a given
number of women employees to provide child care.  Legislation supportive of
early childhood programming may also be promoted by the education sector.  In
Southeast Asia the result of government support for the development of
educationally focused pre-school programmes has lead to the lowering of the
school entrance age; it is now 5 years of age in Burma and Sri Lanka, and
Thailand is aiming to achieve the same goal (UNESCO, 1983, p.7).  Thus early
childhood programmes are becoming part of the mainstream.<p>
<p>
         2.5.1.8.  <i>Many of the health and nutritional problems associated
with conditions of poverty, if identified early, can be managed using
appropriate and simple technologies</i>.  Technology in this instance is meant
to include "not only scientifically sound equipment and information but also
certain organizational elements." (Rohde and Hendrata, 1982, p.212). These
technologies are currently available and can be managed by persons with
relatively low levels of training, and delivered through other than health care
centres.  There is every reason to believe that the health and nutrition
technologies are suited to most early childhood care and development programmes
which are in place, or could be developed with a minimum of cost and back-up
support. (Werner, 1977).<p>
<p>
     2.5.2.  <u>Constraints</u><p>
<p>
The many positive factors listed would appear to provide a solid rationale for
using child care settings to deliver MCH components.  However, there are some
constraints that are likely to be encountered. They are:<p>
<p>
          2.5.2.1.  <i>The multiplicity of mandates which have lead to the
development of early childhood programmes make it difficult to identify an
entry point for primary health care.</i>  Early childhood care and development,
because it is closely intertwined with child rearing, is a phenomenon in which
almost everyone feels he or she should have a say, from those in health,
education, public welfare, social services, community development, and labour.
What this means is that there is no one sector that can be worked with to
better integrate health care into child care service delivery.  By looking at
Thailand, for example, it is possible to illustrate the issue. It is estimated
that only 2% of the 0-6 age group are being served through some type of early
childhood effort (UNESCO, 1983, p.4).  Yet, even with so few children being
served, the following programmes have been developed: child nutrition centres
are run by the Department of Health; child development centres are operated by
the Department of Community Development; kindergarten, or "head start" centres
are run by the Department of Education; day-care centres are operated by
metropolitan city municipalities; and private enterprises provide services to
yet another group of children.<p>
<p>
To make things even more difficult, those operating early childhood programmes
may not be aware of other child care programmes.  Private sector providers
frequently do not coordinate their efforts with public sector programmes
offered by health, education, or social welfare ministries.  And, since the
public and private sectors may have different goals for offering services to
young children, it is not uncommon for parallel programmes to be developed.  In
some instances this leads to more spaces being available within child care
programmes than there are children in the community, while in other communities
there are no services.<p>
<p>
In the developed countries the primary emphasis has been on development of
child care programmes that include educational/ stimulation components, with
little thought being given to the essential health elements.  Models of these
child care systems, particularly in the form of pre-school programmes, have
been transposed to developing countries.  The pressing health needs and
problems of infants and young children remain either unattended or are
aggravated in such centres.  Where access to the health care system is
inadequate there is now a clear need to recognize the full dimensions of child
care systems in terms of their potential to integrate basic health care and
developmental stimulation, complementing existing primary health care
structures and activities. <p>
<p>
          2.5.2.2.  <i>The multiple needs of children requires a multi-sectoral
approach to the integration of the MCH components and early childhood
programming</i>.  Such an approach is consuming of both time and energy and can
only be developed with the cooperation of all sectors involved.  A successful
approach to multi-sectoral programming is to begin by providing a core service.
Once that becomes well established, it is then possible to add services.  An
example comes from Indonesia where a parent education programme,  which
includes weekly meetings, a toy lending library and extensive follow-up with
families, was added to an already successful family planning and nutrition
programme. (Stein, 1985).  The infrastructure developed in the existing
programme allowed the parent education programme to be added successfully.<p>
  <p>
          2.5.2.3.  <i>A primary constraint on using child care programmes to
implement primary health care components is that many are developed on a pilot
basis, but they neither continue beyond the project development phase, nor are
they disseminated to other communities</i>.  Even though a project shows
promise, it may not have staying power and thus it may not be appropriate to
expend limited resources to integrate MCH components into the project.  Reasons
for the failure of projects have been delineated by authors such as Pyle
(1984).  The reasons fall within four categories: resource constraints, lack of
political commitment at various levels; weak demand for services; and
organizational, implementation and management problems (Myers, 1984).  There
are also issues related to how to take a successful pilot project and
disseminate it to a wider audience.  Many organizational characteristics of
community-based projects necessarily change if the project is to be implemented
nationally (Pyle, 1984).  Thus, before investing in projects it is necessary to
question whether or not they could successfully undergo these organizational
changes to be implemented on a large scale. <p>
<p>
          2.5.2.4.  Because of the scarcity of resources, low cost alternative
approaches are being sought for the delivery of health care. <i>Early childhood
care and development programmes are low-cost services</i>.  While this might at
first appear to be an advantage, it is in fact a constraint.  Early childhood
programmes are frequently developed by the community and rely on trained
volunteer or paraprofessional staffing for day-to-day programme operation.
What this means is that those who work in these programmes generally have low
levels of education, and once they receive training they are able to find
higher paid employment in related fields.  This has three implications.  First,
programmes are constantly in the position of training new staff; it is
difficult to build on experience and develop a cadre that can provide role
models, peer support and supervision.  <p>
<p>
Second, health care planners need to be realistic about what health care
components can be introduced in early childhood programmes.  Although health
care technology makes it possible for people with low levels of education to
deliver a wide variety of services paraprofessional staff may not have the
capacity to develop the skills necessary to deliver sophisticated health care
services.  Third, training materials and methodologies have to be geared to a
very practical level, with on-going support and supervision built into the
training system. <p>
<p>
On balance, experience indicates that the positive factors supporting the
introduction of health care elements into child care programmes largely
outweigh the constraints.  Further, if given due consideration in the planning
and implementation phases, the constraints can be overcome.  <p>
<p>
Part of the planning process is to take into consideration where the child care
is being offered, and under what conditions, since each type of child care
programme would require a different strategy for implementation of health care
components.  In the next section a typology of child care programmes is
presented that will serve as the framework within which MCH implementation
strategies can be developed. <p>
<p>
<b>3.     Day Care Programmes: an Analytical Framework</b><p>
<p>
This typology represents a classification of child care programmes based on
their setting.  However, setting is not defined solely by the physical location
of the programme.  As will be seen in the description of the programmes in each
of the six categories, knowing the setting often provides information on the
rationale for developing the child care programme, how it was initiated, the
goals of the effort, the kinds of services that are being provided, and the
level of financial and community support it receives.  (Within each of the
categories there is a brief description of an exemplary programme.  Greater
detail on these and other programmes are provided in Annex A.)  All these
variables need to be taken into account in developing a strategy for
introducing MCH components into child care programmes.<p>
<p>
3.1.  <u>Parent/Caregiver Education</u>. 
</a>
<p>
<p>
These programmes are all designed to build upon and strengthen traditional
patterns of caregiving.  They generally focus on teaching family members how to
provide for the young child's health, nutrition, cognitive and psycho-social
needs, and seek to have an impact on the child's development within the most
natural setting, the home.  These are not strictly child care programmes.
However, since they frequently target the hardest to reach children and have
been proven to be effective in reaching and having a positive effect on the
whole family (Kagitcibasi, 1993), they have been included in this document.
They are a potentially important vehicle for the delivery of MCH components.<p>
<p>
There are three basic models that fall within this category.  There are
<i>home-based parent education</i> programmes where a home visitor or home
teacher works on a one-to-one basis with the mother and child dyad. The second
model involves <i>parent education in a group setting, </i>generally with
regular meetings over a defined period of time.  The third model is the
<i>Child-to-Child</i> system where older children are taught basic health care
and monitoring and use their skills and knowledge with younger siblings, other
family members and the community.<p>
<p>
     3.1.1.  <u>Home visiting</u>.  <p>
<p>
The most common model is for a community member to be trained to provide
regular home visits to other mothers in the area.  Generally the visits are
made anywhere from once a week to once a month and frequently there is a
<i>curriculum</i> that the home visitor uses to guide her interactions with the
mother.  In most cases the mother is then expected to use the curriculum
activities with her child.  Developmental charts or profiles are used to
evaluate the child's progress.  These programmes have been designed for
children from birth to five years of age, but they are used most commonly with
children under the age of 3. (An example of a successful home visiting
programme implemented in Peru is provided in Annex A.)<p>
     <p>
     3.1.2.  <u>Parent groups.</u>  <p>
<p>
Another way to reach the primary caregivers is through group meetings.  Where
groups can be organised and parents can be encouraged to attend, the groups can
be a valuable and relatively inexpensive way of developing parents'
competencies.  The general format is to have a series of meetings within which
parents are introduced to child development topics and learn about ways in
which they can support their child's overall growth and development.  <p>
<p>
A successful parent education project in Chile, known as <i>Padres y Hijos</i>
began with community meetings where parents expressed their concerns about
their children's development.  Parent education groups were then formed and
facilitated by trained community members.  The effort has evolved over time.
To reach distant communities a radio programme was developed.  The topics are
broadcast on a regular basis and a local facilitator guides the follow-up
discussion.  The groups which have been formed have also been effective in
mobilising their communities to undertake a variety of community-development
activities. (See further description in Annex A.)<p>
<p>
     3.1.3.  <u>Child-to-Child</u>. <p>
<p>
This is a programme aimed at giving older children the skills and knowledge
needed to improve the health and development of their younger siblings, with
the expectation that the messages will also be passed on to the family and
community.  Known internationally as Child-to-Child, the programme was
conceived during the International Year of the Child (1979) and since then has
been established in more than 70 countries.           <p>
<p>
Child-to-Child is frequently offered as a part of the primary school curriculum
for children in Classes IV or V.  Simple preventive and curative activities, as
well as games, songs and role-playing, are taught to children as a way to
reinforce learning and to take the messages to others in their family and
community. <p>
<p>
Through the Child-to-Child programme children have been taught a variety of
simple messages.  For example, how to identify malnutrition by taking an arm
measurement, the dangers of dehydration which is associated with diarrhoea, and
how to make the water, salt and sugar solution to combat dehydration.  They are
also taught about safety and how to prevent disease and other health problems,
such as how to locate and clear stagnant pools in the village where mosquitos
breed.  In recent years there has been an expansion of the programme to include
child development information as well.  <p>
<p>
While technical support is provided to Child-to-Child projects by the Institute
of Education in London and the Tropical Child Health Unit of the Institute of
Child Health, University of London, the materials are developed from the field
experiences of those actually implementing Child-to-Child programmes. <p>
      <p>
The programmes included in this category illustrate ways in which family
members can become the focus of early childhood care and development
programmes.  In general, these programmes operate in the home, the child's
first setting.  In the next category are those early childhood programmes that
operate within the next most natural setting, the neighbourhood.<p>
<p>
<p>
3.2.  <u>Child Minding/Family Day Care</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
Within this category are child care programmes that operate in homes in the
community.  These are generally known as <i>Child Minding</i> or <i>Family Day
Care</i> programmes.  In general the provider or caregiver is a woman who cares
for a small group of children in her own home.  There are two kinds of
providers.  First, there are women who, under their own initiative, decide to
care for other children.  These women may or may not be connected with a formal
network of providers.  While there are many women involved in this type of
care, they are hard to access.  Of more interest in terms of the current review
is the second group of providers which consists of women who are part of a
formalised system developed and supported by a public or private organization.
<p>
<p>
One of the largest systems of organised family day care is currently operating
in Colombia.  The Colombian Community Child Care and Nutrition Project began in
1990.  Within the project <i>Homes for well-being</i>, a community-based,
non-formal programme, provides services for children from birth to 7 years of
age.  The programme relies heavily on community involvement.  People from the
community participate in an initial needs assessment to determine the number of
homes required.  They also participate in selecting the women who will be the
care providers.  Local associations are created and they are then responsible
for managing the overall effort.<p>
<p>
One of the major lessons learned from the Colombian experience is that it is
possible to mount a home-based programme on a large scale.  It began in early
1987.  Twenty-eight months later it was serving 800,000 children, and it was
expected to serve 1,500,000 by 1992.  (Myers, 1992)  These large systems of
care for young children are obviously a good entry-point for the provision of
MCH services. (Annex A provides a more complete description of the Colombian
programme and describes a home-based child care in Ecuador as well.)<p>
<p>
3.3.  <u>Workplace: In support of Women's Development</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
Included in this category are programmes that have been developed in
conjunction with women's place of work, either within the formal sector or in
relation to the non-formal or traditional sector, and those child care
programmes created to support women's increased involvement in development.  <p>
     <p>
     3.3.1.  <u>Support for women working in the formal sector</u>.<p>
<p>
In the <i>formal sector</i> there are instances of governments that have
mandated that businesses provide child care for their employee's children.
Where there have been mechanisms to enforce this legislation, industry-related
child care, either at the work place or through the sponsoring or subsidization
of a variety of child care programmes near the place of work, has become a
reality.  These systems have been implemented extensively in the developed
countries.  They are becoming more common in the developing world.  <p>
<p>
India is a country that has had legislation in support of employer sponsored
child care since 1964.  For many years it was not enforced.  However, there is
continuing pressure for industries to comply.  Sometimes this pressure comes
from non-governmental organisations.  For example, a private voluntary
organization, working with the construction industry, created the <i>Mobile
Creches</i> system, which began in 1969.  This child care programme is
established where women are involved in construction and moves with them from
one building site to another.  As buildings are completed and new ones begun
elsewhere, families are shifted.  The <i>Mobile Creche</i> also shifts,
providing a consistent early childhood programme for children from infancy
through age 12. <i>Mobile Creches</i> have also been established to serve the
children of street cleaners, rag pickers, and other families representing the
lowest social status groups in India.<p>
<p>
     3.3.2. <u>Support for women working in the informal sector</u>. <p>
<p>
In general, planners have not understood the necessity of developing child care
programmes to support what has been viewed as women's work which is "compatible
with child care".  The question is, what work is compatible with child care?
As noted by Engle (1980) in a paper on the intersecting needs of working women
and their young children,  <p>
<p>
agricultural work, work in the home, work near to the home, and work in sales
have all been considered to be compatible with child care.  However, it seems
quite clear that a woman accompanied by one or more small children will be less
efficient in her time use than a woman unaccompanied. (p. 24)<p>
<p>
Women involved in the <i>informal sector</i> feel a need for child care and
have developed their own.  One example of a child care programme included in
this category comes from Ghana, where the Accra Market Women's Association, on
their own initiative, created a centre in the market place for their children
while they were involved in buying and selling.  While initially the women were
on their own in operating the centre, over time they were able to garner
support from government social and health services to support the on-going
operational costs of the programme.<p>
<p>
Another initiative undertaken in relation to women's work in the informal
sector was begun in Senegal in 1962.  Women who were part of a group
(<i>Animation feminine</i>) proposed that a child care centre be started so
that the younger children could be cared for while the women and their older
daughters undertook the arduous task of working in the field.  While initially
these were rather informal centres, over time they became viable and a central
activity of the <i>Animation Feminine</i>.   Community developers quickly
realised that the centres could be used as a base from which a variety of
social services could be offered.  Eventually the centres were taken over by
the Department of <i>Animation Rurale, Promotion Humaine,</i> who began to
offer training to community volunteers who worked in the centres.  They also
began to offer adult education courses in nutrition, health, hygiene, disease
prevention, and water purification.  Through the centres they also offer
curative health services for common diseases. <p>
<p>
While it is important to understand the potential for developing early
childhood programmes in relation to women's traditional place of work, these
programmes are more likely to be unique to a given geographic area.  It should
be recognised that it may be difficult to find networks of such programmes or
an organisational structure within which one could work to implement primary
health care components in these community-initiated efforts.<p>
<p>
     3.3.3.  <u>Support for women seeking new opportunities.</u>  <p>
<p>
During the last 20 years there has been an increased recognition of women's
role in development, and efforts have been made to support women's greater
involvement in the wage economy.  Some of the projects designed to promote
women's development have been successful; others have not met intended goals.
By and large, those that have met with the most success are those that have
provided women with the supports they have needed to take on new roles.  The
primary support required is a recognition of the fact that even though women
are being given new opportunities, their traditional responsibilities related
to the household and child care remain intact.  In order for women to fully
participate in development, quality child care must be available.<p>
<p>
An example of early childhood programmes developed in relation to women and
development efforts comes from Brazil. In 1979 the <i>Centro de Estudios
Supletivos de Narandiba (CESUN)</i> was established to provide non-formal
education and vocational training to low-income peoples. One of CESUN's
original ideas was to provide vocational training to women in non-traditional
trades, such as plumbing or electricity. Although the women expressed interest
in such training, they also indicated they needed child care.  Following a
series of discussions, CESUN not only established a child care centre, but it
also developed a vocational course for Caregivers. (Rocha, et.al., 1983)  Thus,
in addition to meeting the immediate needs of women who wanted to participate
in training, women were given marketable skills and knowledge.  Not
incidentally, what they learned in the course also helped them in their own
parenting role.<p>
<p>
In sum, in both the developed and developing world there is increasing pressure
to create early childhood care and development programmes in relation to the
work place.  Early childhood programmes operated at the work place represent
both programmes developed from the top down (those mandated through
legislation) and those developed from the community up, based on women's
definition of their needs.  The systems being developed offer tremendous
potential for the integration of health care and psycho-social stimulation into
child care programmes that all too often provide only custodial care.<p>
<p>
3.4.  <u>Community-based</u>. 
</a>
<p>
<p>
Within this classification there are two kinds of community-based child care
programmes.  There are those which were begun by the community itself,
supported primarily by community resources. And there are those that have been
begun by outsiders with a broad community development perspective, who are
using child care as an entry point for the introduction of community
development activities.  As can be imagined, this category encompasses a wide
range of early childhood efforts.<p>
<p>
     3.4.1. <u>Community initiated</u>. <p>
<p>
What characterises these programmes is the fact that, by and large, they are
initiated by the community and rely primarily on community resources for their
operation and continuation. In many developing countries resources are not
available to build early childhood centres. Yet there is interest in creating a
programme for young children.   Many of these begin in the out-of-doors because
no other facilities are available.  Some of them have remained there while
others have become a part of a larger regional or national effort.<p>
<p>
     Within several African countries there are examples of such community-based
initiatives.  A notable one comes from Kenya, where the <i>harambee</i>
movement has led to the creation of local pre-schools which today operate in 28
of the country's 41 districts, enrolling approximately 800,000 children (almost
30% of the 3-5 year olds in the country). (Myers, 1992)   The programme is low
in cost because of the heavy contributions made by the local community.  It is
also decentralised.  The centres are operated by local parent committees, and
the resources necessary to implement the programme come primarily from the
community.  County, town and municipal governments take an active part in
supervision of the pre-schools, while the Ministry of Education is responsible
for teacher training and for providing on-going support to the teachers.  This
is done through a well-elaborated system of District Centres for Early
Childhood Education (DICECE), supported by a National Centre (NACECE) within
the Kenya Institute of Education.<p>
<p>
Other examples of community-based programmes are described in Annex A. In all
the examples it is evident that these programmes rely heavily on community
support if they are going to survive.  Additionally, they have been developed
in communities that are the least likely to be reached by the more formal
traditional pre-school programmes. They also reach children and families least
likely to be served by the health sector.  Yet these programmes face many
challenges.  In describing these child care programmes in Africa,
Mbikusita-Lewanika (1982) summarises some of the issues.<p>
                                                         <p>
Most of these centres are provided by the communities on self-help bases. The
communities are eager for their children to benefit from any kind of early
childhood care and education, and cannot wait for the governments to provide
these facilities...Since they are provided by the communities, they are the
cheapest of all children's centres....These centres have the poorest
facilities; ill constructed or uncompleted buildings, poor ventilation,
dangerous walls and floors, overcrowding of children, lack of equipment and
materials, under-staffed, and untrained personnel.  p.23<p>
<p>
While these characteristics would suggest that community-based child care
programmes are a poor choice in terms of their ability to introduce MCH
components, these programmes have some real strengths.  Mbikusita-Lewanika
(1982) identifies the following: early childhood centres in these communities
have the potential to serve as a base for community development; these
communities receive the least in terms of all social services; children from
these communities are most in need of what a quality pre-school can provide;
and last, but not least, people in these communities have demonstrated their
commitment to their children and their ability to create a programme through
self-help initiatives. (p. 23-24).<p>
<p>
     3.4.2. <u>Entry point programmes</u>.  <p>
<p>
These are community development programmes where child care is developed as an
entry point into the community and a base from which other community
development activities can evolve.  The approach is to work with the community
to identify needs, and then to create a range of services to meet these needs.
The examples which follow are instances where the community has defined early
childhood programmes as a priority.  As a result, child care programmes have
been created. <p>
<p>
One example is the <i>Sang Kancil</i> project developed within the squatter
settlements of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The project was begun by health sector
personnel interested in establishing primary health care centres within
<i>kampungs</i> (districts) in the settlements.  However, taking a community
development approach, meetings were first held with community members to
determine their needs and priorities.  They were most interested in having a
child care system for young children, and in creating income- generating
activities for women.  Health care was not seen as a priority.  Those involved
in developing the project listened to the community.  Rather than building a
health centre, they established a pre-school and an income-generating project.
When these were well established, then it was possible to introduce primary
health care, which is now widely accepted.  (Yusof, 1982) <p>
3.5.  <u>Formal Pre-schools
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
Included in this category are programmes designed to meet the needs of children
living in poor urban and rural areas who are seen as having a disadvantage when
they enter primary school.  These children, because of their ethnic, social,
regional, or family background, lack the experiences, skills, and knowledge
that more affluent peers bring to the school experience.  As a result, they do
poorly, drop out of school early, and are likely to continue the cycle of
poverty.  In the hopes of breaking that cycle, preschool programmes have been
developed for this group of children so that once they enter the school system
they can compete on an equitable basis with their peers.<p>
<p>
Within Southeast Asia there are a number of examples of national efforts which
have been developed to provide a pre-school experience in the primary school
for the urban poor and rural child.  In Thailand, for example, there was an
awareness that some children come to the formal school experience at a
"disadvantage".  There was also recognition of the long-term value of quality
pre-school.  Demographics also played a part.  There was a declining birth rate
which led to a demand for better education; with fewer children, families have
a high investment in their children's education.  The lower birth rate meant a
decreasing enrollment in primary schools, with the result being empty
classrooms.       <p>
<p>
In response to these factors the Ministry of Education provided grants so that
targeted communities could develop pre-primary programmes.  Grants went to
"areas identified as the rural impoverished, the urban deprived, the remote and
barren, and the community with 50% of the children speaking other than Thai".
(Piya-Ajariya, 1983)  Other communities interested in establishing pre-primary
programmes had to bear all the costs themselves.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately this programme, and those developed in connection with public
schools elsewhere, tend to represent an extension downwards of a costly formal
educational system.  There is some question about the long-term value of
creating these costly systems.  With alternative models it may be possible to
achieve multiple goals, in terms of health care, nutrition, parent education
and community development, as well as education.      <p>
<p>
3.6.  <u>Integrated Care Centres</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
These are early childhood efforts that are developed from the beginning to meet
the multiple needs of young children from the poorest of the poor families.
Included in this category are those programmes that consciously provide a full
range of services for the child (from health and nutrition to educational
activities), parents and sometimes the community.  <p>
<p>
One of the most notable is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
programme in India.  The need for massive programmes which address the needs of
young children is most evident in a country like India where there are more
than 109 million children under the age of 6, constituting 16% of the
population (Sadka, 1984).  In 1974, India adopted a National Policy for
Children as an indication of its commitment to ensure the delivery of
comprehensive child development services to all children.  One of the first
targets for the effort were the "poorest of the poor found in urban slums and
urban areas", particularly children in "scheduled cases and tribes." (Sadka,
1984, p.3).  <p>
<p>
The programme began on a pilot basis in 33 of India's 5000 administrative
blocks.  By March of 1985, 100,000 <u>Anganwadis</u> (centres) were providing
services to approximately 3 million children.  In 1989 it was estimated to
reach 11.6 million children (Myers, 1992), and by 1993 there were 265,000
centres, serving 16 million children, with the ultimate goal being the delivery
of comprehensive services to all children under the age of 6 by the year 2000.
(See Annex A for a more complete description of the programme.)<p>
<p>
Several major evaluations of the programme have been conducted.  The earliest
was in 1978.  Others have followed, all of which indicated positive results in
terms of the programme's impact on children, women, and the community at large.
For example participation in the centre is associated with reductions in infant
mortality, severe malnutrition, morbidity and school repetition.  (Chaturvedi
et. al, 1987)<p>
In Latin America there are also community-based programmes designed to provide
health, nutrition, and education services.  A non-formal education programme
has been developed in Peru, where, in 1972, a national commitment was made to
provide pre-school  <i>(initial education</i>) for all children in Peru.
Recognizing the diversity of cultures represented in the various regions of the
country, communities were encouraged to develop models of pre-school education
that met their particular needs.  Within Puno, Peru, a non-formal model evolved
that was subsequently disseminated to other parts of the country.  <p>
<p>
The Puno programme began in 1967 as a community-based effort to provide
nutrition education to women.  But when the initial education movement began,
the programme shifted its focus to the development of a pre-school for Quechua
and Aymara children 3-6 years of age.  In 1973 it became known as the
<i>Proyecto Experimental de Educacion Initial No-Escolarizada de Puno
(PROPEDEINE)</i>.  The programme operates in simply constructed Children's
Houses (<i>Wawa Wasis</i> and <i>Wawa Utas</i>), constructed by community
members who donate the materials as well as their time and skill.  Pre-school
aged children are provided with an educational programme, basic health care,
and nutritional supplementation.  The centres have also been used for the
delivery of health components.  For example, they are used as the base of
operations during immunization campaigns.  <p>
<p>
The examples presented in this sub-category illustrate ways in which programmes
have been developed specifically to provide integrated care to the young child.
There are more and more private and public agencies and organisation attempting
to develop integrated programmes.  And, in situations where it is possible to
undertake new initiatives, this is the model that should be followed to address
the full range of the child's and family's needs.  At the present time,
however, integrated child care systems are few and far between.  Therefore
strategies need to be developed to introduce MCH components into existing
systems.  In the next section there is a discussion of some of these
strategies. <p>
<p>
<b>4.     Strengthening and Expanding Existing Programmes to provide better Health
Care</b><p>
<p>
Having established that child care systems are a logical entry point for the
delivery of maternal and child health components, and having defined a range of
approaches to child care, the next step is a systematic approach to
understanding how one would go about collaborating with these systems to
improve health care in the families and communities being served by the
programmes.  In order to determine the best strategy it is necessary to answer
the following questions: i) What is the population being served by child care
and how does that relate to the population that needs to be reached?  What
kinds of child care programmes are currently serving these populations?  ii)
What is the potential of expanding the scope and coverage of these services?
and iii) If the service is reaching the targeted population, what strategy
should be used by the health system to introduce MCH components?  In this
section, these questions will be discussed.<p>
<p>
<b>3.     Day Care Programmes: an Analytical Framework</b><p>
<p>
This typology represents a classification of child care programmes based on
their setting.  However, setting is not defined solely by the physical location
of the programme.  As will be seen in the description of the programmes in each
of the six categories, knowing the setting often provides information on the
rationale for developing the child care programme, how it was initiated, the
goals of the effort, the kinds of services that are being provided, and the
level of financial and community support it receives.  (Within each of the
categories there is a brief description of an exemplary programme.  Greater
detail on these and other programmes are provided in Annex A.)  All these
variables need to be taken into account in developing a strategy for
introducing MCH components into child care programmes.<p>
<p>
3.1.  <u>Parent/Caregiver Education</u>. 
</a>
<p>
<p>
These programmes are all designed to build upon and strengthen traditional
patterns of caregiving.  They generally focus on teaching family members how to
provide for the young child's health, nutrition, cognitive and psycho-social
needs, and seek to have an impact on the child's development within the most
natural setting, the home.  These are not strictly child care programmes.
However, since they frequently target the hardest to reach children and have
been proven to be effective in reaching and having a positive effect on the
whole family (Kagitcibasi, 1993), they have been included in this document.
They are a potentially important vehicle for the delivery of MCH components.<p>
<p>
There are three basic models that fall within this category.  There are
<i>home-based parent education</i> programmes where a home visitor or home
teacher works on a one-to-one basis with the mother and child dyad. The second
model involves <i>parent education in a group setting, </i>generally with
regular meetings over a defined period of time.  The third model is the
<i>Child-to-Child</i> system where older children are taught basic health care
and monitoring and use their skills and knowledge with younger siblings, other
family members and the community.<p>
<p>
     3.1.1.  <u>Home visiting</u>.  <p>
<p>
The most common model is for a community member to be trained to provide
regular home visits to other mothers in the area.  Generally the visits are
made anywhere from once a week to once a month and frequently there is a
<i>curriculum</i> that the home visitor uses to guide her interactions with the
mother.  In most cases the mother is then expected to use the curriculum
activities with her child.  Developmental charts or profiles are used to
evaluate the child's progress.  These programmes have been designed for
children from birth to five years of age, but they are used most commonly with
children under the age of 3. (An example of a successful home visiting
programme implemented in Peru is provided in Annex A.)<p>
     <p>
     3.1.2.  <u>Parent groups.</u>  <p>
<p>
Another way to reach the primary caregivers is through group meetings.  Where
groups can be organised and parents can be encouraged to attend, the groups can
be a valuable and relatively inexpensive way of developing parents'
competencies.  The general format is to have a series of meetings within which
parents are introduced to child development topics and learn about ways in
which they can support their child's overall growth and development.  <p>
<p>
A successful parent education project in Chile, known as <i>Padres y Hijos</i>
began with community meetings where parents expressed their concerns about
their children's development.  Parent education groups were then formed and
facilitated by trained community members.  The effort has evolved over time.
To reach distant communities a radio programme was developed.  The topics are
broadcast on a regular basis and a local facilitator guides the follow-up
discussion.  The groups which have been formed have also been effective in
mobilising their communities to undertake a variety of community-development
activities. (See further description in Annex A.)<p>
<p>
     3.1.3.  <u>Child-to-Child</u>. <p>
<p>
This is a programme aimed at giving older children the skills and knowledge
needed to improve the health and development of their younger siblings, with
the expectation that the messages will also be passed on to the family and
community.  Known internationally as Child-to-Child, the programme was
conceived during the International Year of the Child (1979) and since then has
been established in more than 70 countries.           <p>
<p>
Child-to-Child is frequently offered as a part of the primary school curriculum
for children in Classes IV or V.  Simple preventive and curative activities, as
well as games, songs and role-playing, are taught to children as a way to
reinforce learning and to take the messages to others in their family and
community. <p>
<p>
Through the Child-to-Child programme children have been taught a variety of
simple messages.  For example, how to identify malnutrition by taking an arm
measurement, the dangers of dehydration which is associated with diarrhoea, and
how to make the water, salt and sugar solution to combat dehydration.  They are
also taught about safety and how to prevent disease and other health problems,
such as how to locate and clear stagnant pools in the village where mosquitos
breed.  In recent years there has been an expansion of the programme to include
child development information as well.  <p>
<p>
While technical support is provided to Child-to-Child projects by the Institute
of Education in London and the Tropical Child Health Unit of the Institute of
Child Health, University of London, the materials are developed from the field
experiences of those actually implementing Child-to-Child programmes. <p>
      <p>
The programmes included in this category illustrate ways in which family
members can become the focus of early childhood care and development
programmes.  In general, these programmes operate in the home, the child's
first setting.  In the next category are those early childhood programmes that
operate within the next most natural setting, the neighbourhood.<p>
<p>
<p>
3.2.  <u>Child Minding/Family Day Care</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
Within this category are child care programmes that operate in homes in the
community.  These are generally known as <i>Child Minding</i> or <i>Family Day
Care</i> programmes.  In general the provider or caregiver is a woman who cares
for a small group of children in her own home.  There are two kinds of
providers.  First, there are women who, under their own initiative, decide to
care for other children.  These women may or may not be connected with a formal
network of providers.  While there are many women involved in this type of
care, they are hard to access.  Of more interest in terms of the current review
is the second group of providers which consists of women who are part of a
formalised system developed and supported by a public or private organization.
<p>
<p>
One of the largest systems of organised family day care is currently operating
in Colombia.  The Colombian Community Child Care and Nutrition Project began in
1990.  Within the project <i>Homes for well-being</i>, a community-based,
non-formal programme, provides services for children from birth to 7 years of
age.  The programme relies heavily on community involvement.  People from the
community participate in an initial needs assessment to determine the number of
homes required.  They also participate in selecting the women who will be the
care providers.  Local associations are created and they are then responsible
for managing the overall effort.<p>
<p>
One of the major lessons learned from the Colombian experience is that it is
possible to mount a home-based programme on a large scale.  It began in early
1987.  Twenty-eight months later it was serving 800,000 children, and it was
expected to serve 1,500,000 by 1992.  (Myers, 1992)  These large systems of
care for young children are obviously a good entry-point for the provision of
MCH services. (Annex A provides a more complete description of the Colombian
programme and describes a home-based child care in Ecuador as well.)<p>
<p>
3.3.  <u>Workplace: In support of Women's Development</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
Included in this category are programmes that have been developed in
conjunction with women's place of work, either within the formal sector or in
relation to the non-formal or traditional sector, and those child care
programmes created to support women's increased involvement in development.  <p>
     <p>
     3.3.1.  <u>Support for women working in the formal sector</u>.<p>
<p>
In the <i>formal sector</i> there are instances of governments that have
mandated that businesses provide child care for their employee's children.
Where there have been mechanisms to enforce this legislation, industry-related
child care, either at the work place or through the sponsoring or subsidization
of a variety of child care programmes near the place of work, has become a
reality.  These systems have been implemented extensively in the developed
countries.  They are becoming more common in the developing world.  <p>
<p>
India is a country that has had legislation in support of employer sponsored
child care since 1964.  For many years it was not enforced.  However, there is
continuing pressure for industries to comply.  Sometimes this pressure comes
from non-governmental organisations.  For example, a private voluntary
organization, working with the construction industry, created the <i>Mobile
Creches</i> system, which began in 1969.  This child care programme is
established where women are involved in construction and moves with them from
one building site to another.  As buildings are completed and new ones begun
elsewhere, families are shifted.  The <i>Mobile Creche</i> also shifts,
providing a consistent early childhood programme for children from infancy
through age 12. <i>Mobile Creches</i> have also been established to serve the
children of street cleaners, rag pickers, and other families representing the
lowest social status groups in India.<p>
<p>
     3.3.2. <u>Support for women working in the informal sector</u>. <p>
<p>
In general, planners have not understood the necessity of developing child care
programmes to support what has been viewed as women's work which is "compatible
with child care".  The question is, what work is compatible with child care?
As noted by Engle (1980) in a paper on the intersecting needs of working women
and their young children,  <p>
<p>
agricultural work, work in the home, work near to the home, and work in sales
have all been considered to be compatible with child care.  However, it seems
quite clear that a woman accompanied by one or more small children will be less
efficient in her time use than a woman unaccompanied. (p. 24)<p>
<p>
Women involved in the <i>informal sector</i> feel a need for child care and
have developed their own.  One example of a child care programme included in
this category comes from Ghana, where the Accra Market Women's Association, on
their own initiative, created a centre in the market place for their children
while they were involved in buying and selling.  While initially the women were
on their own in operating the centre, over time they were able to garner
support from government social and health services to support the on-going
operational costs of the programme.<p>
<p>
Another initiative undertaken in relation to women's work in the informal
sector was begun in Senegal in 1962.  Women who were part of a group
(<i>Animation feminine</i>) proposed that a child care centre be started so
that the younger children could be cared for while the women and their older
daughters undertook the arduous task of working in the field.  While initially
these were rather informal centres, over time they became viable and a central
activity of the <i>Animation Feminine</i>.   Community developers quickly
realised that the centres could be used as a base from which a variety of
social services could be offered.  Eventually the centres were taken over by
the Department of <i>Animation Rurale, Promotion Humaine,</i> who began to
offer training to community volunteers who worked in the centres.  They also
began to offer adult education courses in nutrition, health, hygiene, disease
prevention, and water purification.  Through the centres they also offer
curative health services for common diseases. <p>
<p>
While it is important to understand the potential for developing early
childhood programmes in relation to women's traditional place of work, these
programmes are more likely to be unique to a given geographic area.  It should
be recognised that it may be difficult to find networks of such programmes or
an organisational structure within which one could work to implement primary
health care components in these community-initiated efforts.<p>
<p>
     3.3.3.  <u>Support for women seeking new opportunities.</u>  <p>
<p>
During the last 20 years there has been an increased recognition of women's
role in development, and efforts have been made to support women's greater
involvement in the wage economy.  Some of the projects designed to promote
women's development have been successful; others have not met intended goals.
By and large, those that have met with the most success are those that have
provided women with the supports they have needed to take on new roles.  The
primary support required is a recognition of the fact that even though women
are being given new opportunities, their traditional responsibilities related
to the household and child care remain intact.  In order for women to fully
participate in development, quality child care must be available.<p>
<p>
An example of early childhood programmes developed in relation to women and
development efforts comes from Brazil. In 1979 the <i>Centro de Estudios
Supletivos de Narandiba (CESUN)</i> was established to provide non-formal
education and vocational training to low-income peoples. One of CESUN's
original ideas was to provide vocational training to women in non-traditional
trades, such as plumbing or electricity. Although the women expressed interest
in such training, they also indicated they needed child care.  Following a
series of discussions, CESUN not only established a child care centre, but it
also developed a vocational course for Caregivers. (Rocha, et.al., 1983)  Thus,
in addition to meeting the immediate needs of women who wanted to participate
in training, women were given marketable skills and knowledge.  Not
incidentally, what they learned in the course also helped them in their own
parenting role.<p>
In sum, in both the developed and developing world there is increasing pressure
to create early childhood care and development programmes in relation to the
work place.  Early childhood programmes operated at the work place represent
both programmes developed from the top down (those mandated through
legislation) and those developed from the community up, based on women's
definition of their needs.  The systems being developed offer tremendous
potential for the integration of health care and psycho-social stimulation into
child care programmes that all too often provide only custodial care.<p>
<p>
3.4.  <u>Community-based</u>. 
</a>
<p>
<p>
Within this classification there are two kinds of community-based child care
programmes.  There are those which were begun by the community itself,
supported primarily by community resources. And there are those that have been
begun by outsiders with a broad community development perspective, who are
using child care as an entry point for the introduction of community
development activities.  As can be imagined, this category encompasses a wide
range of early childhood efforts.<p>
<p>
     3.4.1. <u>Community initiated</u>. <p>
<p>
What characterises these programmes is the fact that, by and large, they are
initiated by the community and rely primarily on community resources for their
operation and continuation. In many developing countries resources are not
available to build early childhood centres. Yet there is interest in creating a
programme for young children.   Many of these begin in the out-of-doors because
no other facilities are available.  Some of them have remained there while
others have become a part of a larger regional or national effort.<p>
<p>
     Within several African countries there are examples of such community-based
initiatives.  A notable one comes from Kenya, where the <i>harambee</i>
movement has led to the creation of local pre-schools which today operate in 28
of the country's 41 districts, enrolling approximately 800,000 children (almost
30% of the 3-5 year olds in the country). (Myers, 1992)   The programme is low
in cost because of the heavy contributions made by the local community.  It is
also decentralised.  The centres are operated by local parent committees, and
the resources necessary to implement the programme come primarily from the
community.  County, town and municipal governments take an active part in
supervision of the pre-schools, while the Ministry of Education is responsible
for teacher training and for providing on-going support to the teachers.  This
is done through a well-elaborated system of District Centres for Early
Childhood Education (DICECE), supported by a National Centre (NACECE) within
the Kenya Institute of Education.<p>
<p>
Other examples of community-based programmes are described in Annex A. In all
the examples it is evident that these programmes rely heavily on community
support if they are going to survive.  Additionally, they have been developed
in communities that are the least likely to be reached by the more formal
traditional pre-school programmes. They also reach children and families least
likely to be served by the health sector.  Yet these programmes face many
challenges.  In describing these child care programmes in Africa,
Mbikusita-Lewanika (1982) summarises some of the issues.<p>
                                                         <p>
Most of these centres are provided by the communities on self-help bases. The
communities are eager for their children to benefit from any kind of early
childhood care and education, and cannot wait for the governments to provide
these facilities...Since they are provided by the communities, they are the
cheapest of all children's centres....These centres have the poorest
facilities; ill constructed or uncompleted buildings, poor ventilation,
dangerous walls and floors, overcrowding of children, lack of equipment and
materials, under-staffed, and untrained personnel.  p.23<p>
<p>
While these characteristics would suggest that community-based child care
programmes are a poor choice in terms of their ability to introduce MCH
components, these programmes have some real strengths.  Mbikusita-Lewanika
(1982) identifies the following: early childhood centres in these communities
have the potential to serve as a base for community development; these
communities receive the least in terms of all social services; children from
these communities are most in need of what a quality pre-school can provide;
and last, but not least, people in these communities have demonstrated their
commitment to their children and their ability to create a programme through
self-help initiatives. (p. 23-24).<p>
<p>
     3.4.2. <u>Entry point programmes</u>.  <p>
<p>
These are community development programmes where child care is developed as an
entry point into the community and a base from which other community
development activities can evolve.  The approach is to work with the community
to identify needs, and then to create a range of services to meet these needs.
The examples which follow are instances where the community has defined early
childhood programmes as a priority.  As a result, child care programmes have
been created. <p>
<p>
One example is the <i>Sang Kancil</i> project developed within the squatter
settlements of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The project was begun by health sector
personnel interested in establishing primary health care centres within
<i>kampungs</i> (districts) in the settlements.  However, taking a community
development approach, meetings were first held with community members to
determine their needs and priorities.  They were most interested in having a
child care system for young children, and in creating income- generating
activities for women.  Health care was not seen as a priority.  Those involved
in developing the project listened to the community.  Rather than building a
health centre, they established a pre-school and an income-generating project.
When these were well established, then it was possible to introduce primary
health care, which is now widely accepted.  (Yusof, 1982) <p>
3.5.  <u>Formal Pre-schools
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
Included in this category are programmes designed to meet the needs of children
living in poor urban and rural areas who are seen as having a disadvantage when
they enter primary school.  These children, because of their ethnic, social,
regional, or family background, lack the experiences, skills, and knowledge
that more affluent peers bring to the school experience.  As a result, they do
poorly, drop out of school early, and are likely to continue the cycle of
poverty.  In the hopes of breaking that cycle, preschool programmes have been
developed for this group of children so that once they enter the school system
they can compete on an equitable basis with their peers.<p>
<p>
Within Southeast Asia there are a number of examples of national efforts which
have been developed to provide a pre-school experience in the primary school
for the urban poor and rural child.  In Thailand, for example, there was an
awareness that some children come to the formal school experience at a
"disadvantage".  There was also recognition of the long-term value of quality
pre-school.  Demographics also played a part.  There was a declining birth rate
which led to a demand for better education; with fewer children, families have
a high investment in their children's education.  The lower birth rate meant a
decreasing enrollment in primary schools, with the result being empty
classrooms.       <p>
<p>
In response to these factors the Ministry of Education provided grants so that
targeted communities could develop pre-primary programmes.  Grants went to
"areas identified as the rural impoverished, the urban deprived, the remote and
barren, and the community with 50% of the children speaking other than Thai".
(Piya-Ajariya, 1983)  Other communities interested in establishing pre-primary
programmes had to bear all the costs themselves.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately this programme, and those developed in connection with public
schools elsewhere, tend to represent an extension downwards of a costly formal
educational system.  There is some question about the long-term value of
creating these costly systems.  With alternative models it may be possible to
achieve multiple goals, in terms of health care, nutrition, parent education
and community development, as well as education.      <p>
<p>
3.6.  <u>Integrated Care Centres</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
These are early childhood efforts that are developed from the beginning to meet
the multiple needs of young children from the poorest of the poor families.
Included in this category are those programmes that consciously provide a full
range of services for the child (from health and nutrition to educational
activities), parents and sometimes the community.  <p>
<p>
One of the most notable is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
programme in India.  The need for massive programmes which address the needs of
young children is most evident in a country like India where there are more
than 109 million children under the age of 6, constituting 16% of the
population (Sadka, 1984).  In 1974, India adopted a National Policy for
Children as an indication of its commitment to ensure the delivery of
comprehensive child development services to all children.  One of the first
targets for the effort were the "poorest of the poor found in urban slums and
urban areas", particularly children in "scheduled cases and tribes." (Sadka,
1984, p.3).  <p>
<p>
The programme began on a pilot basis in 33 of India's 5000 administrative
blocks.  By March of 1985, 100,000 <u>Anganwadis</u> (centres) were providing
services to approximately 3 million children.  In 1989 it was estimated to
reach 11.6 million children (Myers, 1992), and by 1993 there were 265,000
centres, serving 16 million children, with the ultimate goal being the delivery
of comprehensive services to all children under the age of 6 by the year 2000.
(See Annex A for a more complete description of the programme.)<p>
<p>
Several major evaluations of the programme have been conducted.  The earliest
was in 1978.  Others have followed, all of which indicated positive results in
terms of the programme's impact on children, women, and the community at large.
For example participation in the centre is associated with reductions in infant
mortality, severe malnutrition, morbidity and school repetition.  (Chaturvedi
et. al, 1987)<p>
<p>
In Latin America there are also community-based programmes designed to provide
health, nutrition, and education services.  A non-formal education programme
has been developed in Peru, where, in 1972, a national commitment was made to
provide pre-school  <i>(initial education</i>) for all children in Peru.
Recognizing the diversity of cultures represented in the various regions of the
country, communities were encouraged to develop models of pre-school education
that met their particular needs.  Within Puno, Peru, a non-formal model evolved
that was subsequently disseminated to other parts of the country.  <p>
<p>
The Puno programme began in 1967 as a community-based effort to provide
nutrition education to women.  But when the initial education movement began,
the programme shifted its focus to the development of a pre-school for Quechua
and Aymara children 3-6 years of age.  In 1973 it became known as the
<i>Proyecto Experimental de Educacion Initial No-Escolarizada de Puno
(PROPEDEINE)</i>.  The programme operates in simply constructed Children's
Houses (<i>Wawa Wasis</i> and <i>Wawa Utas</i>), constructed by community
members who donate the materials as well as their time and skill.  Pre-school
aged children are provided with an educational programme, basic health care,
and nutritional supplementation.  The centres have also been used for the
delivery of health components.  For example, they are used as the base of
operations during immunization campaigns.  <p>
<p>
The examples presented in this sub-category illustrate ways in which programmes
have been developed specifically to provide integrated care to the young child.
There are more and more private and public agencies and organisation attempting
to develop integrated programmes.  And, in situations where it is possible to
undertake new initiatives, this is the model that should be followed to address
the full range of the child's and family's needs.  At the present time,
however, integrated child care systems are few and far between.  Therefore
strategies need to be developed to introduce MCH components into existing
systems.  In the next section there is a discussion of some of these
strategies. <p>
<p>
<b>4.     Strengthening and Expanding Existing Programmes to provide better Health
Care</b><p>
<p>
Having established that child care systems are a logical entry point for the
delivery of maternal and child health components, and having defined a range of
approaches to child care, the next step is a systematic approach to
understanding how one would go about collaborating with these systems to
improve health care in the families and communities being served by the
programmes.  In order to determine the best strategy it is necessary to answer
the following questions: i) What is the population being served by child care
and how does that relate to the population that needs to be reached?  What
kinds of child care programmes are currently serving these populations?  ii)
What is the potential of expanding the scope and coverage of these services?
and iii) If the service is reaching the targeted population, what strategy
should be used by the health system to introduce MCH components?  In this
section, these questions will be discussed.<p>
<p>
<b>3.     Day Care Programmes: an Analytical Framework</b><p>
<p>
This typology represents a classification of child care programmes based on
their setting.  However, setting is not defined solely by the physical location
of the programme.  As will be seen in the description of the programmes in each
of the six categories, knowing the setting often provides information on the
rationale for developing the child care programme, how it was initiated, the
goals of the effort, the kinds of services that are being provided, and the
level of financial and community support it receives.  (Within each of the
categories there is a brief description of an exemplary programme.  Greater
detail on these and other programmes are provided in Annex A.)  All these
variables need to be taken into account in developing a strategy for
introducing MCH components into child care programmes.<p>
<p>
3.1.  <u>Parent/Caregiver Education</u>. 
</a>
<p>
<p>
These programmes are all designed to build upon and strengthen traditional
patterns of caregiving.  They generally focus on teaching family members how to
provide for the young child's health, nutrition, cognitive and psycho-social
needs, and seek to have an impact on the child's development within the most
natural setting, the home.  These are not strictly child care programmes.
However, since they frequently target the hardest to reach children and have
been proven to be effective in reaching and having a positive effect on the
whole family (Kagitcibasi, 1993), they have been included in this document.
They are a potentially important vehicle for the delivery of MCH components.<p>
<p>
There are three basic models that fall within this category.  There are
<i>home-based parent education</i> programmes where a home visitor or home
teacher works on a one-to-one basis with the mother and child dyad. The second
model involves <i>parent education in a group setting, </i>generally with
regular meetings over a defined period of time.  The third model is the
<i>Child-to-Child</i> system where older children are taught basic health care
and monitoring and use their skills and knowledge with younger siblings, other
family members and the community.<p>
<p>
     3.1.1.  <u>Home visiting</u>.  <p>
<p>
The most common model is for a community member to be trained to provide
regular home visits to other mothers in the area.  Generally the visits are
made anywhere from once a week to once a month and frequently there is a
<i>curriculum</i> that the home visitor uses to guide her interactions with the
mother.  In most cases the mother is then expected to use the curriculum
activities with her child.  Developmental charts or profiles are used to
evaluate the child's progress.  These programmes have been designed for
children from birth to five years of age, but they are used most commonly with
children under the age of 3. (An example of a successful home visiting
programme implemented in Peru is provided in Annex A.)<p>
     <p>
     3.1.2.  <u>Parent groups.</u>  <p>
<p>
Another way to reach the primary caregivers is through group meetings.  Where
groups can be organised and parents can be encouraged to attend, the groups can
be a valuable and relatively inexpensive way of developing parents'
competencies.  The general format is to have a series of meetings within which
parents are introduced to child development topics and learn about ways in
which they can support their child's overall growth and development.  <p>
<p>
A successful parent education project in Chile, known as <i>Padres y Hijos</i>
began with community meetings where parents expressed their concerns about
their children's development.  Parent education groups were then formed and
facilitated by trained community members.  The effort has evolved over time.
To reach distant communities a radio programme was developed.  The topics are
broadcast on a regular basis and a local facilitator guides the follow-up
discussion.  The groups which have been formed have also been effective in
mobilising their communities to undertake a variety of community-development
activities. (See further description in Annex A.)<p>
<p>
     3.1.3.  <u>Child-to-Child</u>. <p>
<p>
This is a programme aimed at giving older children the skills and knowledge
needed to improve the health and development of their younger siblings, with
the expectation that the messages will also be passed on to the family and
community.  Known internationally as Child-to-Child, the programme was
conceived during the International Year of the Child (1979) and since then has
been established in more than 70 countries.           <p>
<p>
Child-to-Child is frequently offered as a part of the primary school curriculum
for children in Classes IV or V.  Simple preventive and curative activities, as
well as games, songs and role-playing, are taught to children as a way to
reinforce learning and to take the messages to others in their family and
community. <p>
<p>
Through the Child-to-Child programme children have been taught a variety of
simple messages.  For example, how to identify malnutrition by taking an arm
measurement, the dangers of dehydration which is associated with diarrhoea, and
how to make the water, salt and sugar solution to combat dehydration.  They are
also taught about safety and how to prevent disease and other health problems,
such as how to locate and clear stagnant pools in the village where mosquitos
breed.  In recent years there has been an expansion of the programme to include
child development information as well.  <p>
<p>
While technical support is provided to Child-to-Child projects by the Institute
of Education in London and the Tropical Child Health Unit of the Institute of
Child Health, University of London, the materials are developed from the field
experiences of those actually implementing Child-to-Child programmes. <p>
      <p>
The programmes included in this category illustrate ways in which family
members can become the focus of early childhood care and development
programmes.  In general, these programmes operate in the home, the child's
first setting.  In the next category are those early childhood programmes that
operate within the next most natural setting, the neighbourhood.<p>
<p>
<p>
3.2.  <u>Child Minding/Family Day Care</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
Within this category are child care programmes that operate in homes in the
community.  These are generally known as <i>Child Minding</i> or <i>Family Day
Care</i> programmes.  In general the provider or caregiver is a woman who cares
for a small group of children in her own home.  There are two kinds of
providers.  First, there are women who, under their own initiative, decide to
care for other children.  These women may or may not be connected with a formal
network of providers.  While there are many women involved in this type of
care, they are hard to access.  Of more interest in terms of the current review
is the second group of providers which consists of women who are part of a
formalised system developed and supported by a public or private organization.
<p>
<p>
One of the largest systems of organised family day care is currently operating
in Colombia.  The Colombian Community Child Care and Nutrition Project began in
1990.  Within the project <i>Homes for well-being</i>, a community-based,
non-formal programme, provides services for children from birth to 7 years of
age.  The programme relies heavily on community involvement.  People from the
community participate in an initial needs assessment to determine the number of
homes required.  They also participate in selecting the women who will be the
care providers.  Local associations are created and they are then responsible
for managing the overall effort.<p>
<p>
One of the major lessons learned from the Colombian experience is that it is
possible to mount a home-based programme on a large scale.  It began in early
1987.  Twenty-eight months later it was serving 800,000 children, and it was
expected to serve 1,500,000 by 1992.  (Myers, 1992)  These large systems of
care for young children are obviously a good entry-point for the provision of
MCH services. (Annex A provides a more complete description of the Colombian
programme and describes a home-based child care in Ecuador as well.)<p>
<p>
3.3.  <u>Workplace: In support of Women's Development</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
Included in this category are programmes that have been developed in
conjunction with women's place of work, either within the formal sector or in
relation to the non-formal or traditional sector, and those child care
programmes created to support women's increased involvement in development.  <p>
     <p>
     3.3.1.  <u>Support for women working in the formal sector</u>.<p>
<p>
In the <i>formal sector</i> there are instances of governments that have
mandated that businesses provide child care for their employee's children.
Where there have been mechanisms to enforce this legislation, industry-related
child care, either at the work place or through the sponsoring or subsidization
of a variety of child care programmes near the place of work, has become a
reality.  These systems have been implemented extensively in the developed
countries.  They are becoming more common in the developing world.  <p>
<p>
India is a country that has had legislation in support of employer sponsored
child care since 1964.  For many years it was not enforced.  However, there is
continuing pressure for industries to comply.  Sometimes this pressure comes
from non-governmental organisations.  For example, a private voluntary
organization, working with the construction industry, created the <i>Mobile
Creches</i> system, which began in 1969.  This child care programme is
established where women are involved in construction and moves with them from
one building site to another.  As buildings are completed and new ones begun
elsewhere, families are shifted.  The <i>Mobile Creche</i> also shifts,
providing a consistent early childhood programme for children from infancy
through age 12. <i>Mobile Creches</i> have also been established to serve the
children of street cleaners, rag pickers, and other families representing the
lowest social status groups in India.<p>
<p>
     3.3.2. <u>Support for women working in the informal sector</u>. <p>
<p>
In general, planners have not understood the necessity of developing child care
programmes to support what has been viewed as women's work which is "compatible
with child care".  The question is, what work is compatible with child care?
As noted by Engle (1980) in a paper on the intersecting needs of working women
and their young children,  <p>
<p>
agricultural work, work in the home, work near to the home, and work in sales
have all been considered to be compatible with child care.  However, it seems
quite clear that a woman accompanied by one or more small children will be less
efficient in her time use than a woman unaccompanied. (p. 24)<p>
<p>
Women involved in the <i>informal sector</i> feel a need for child care and
have developed their own.  One example of a child care programme included in
this category comes from Ghana, where the Accra Market Women's Association, on
their own initiative, created a centre in the market place for their children
while they were involved in buying and selling.  While initially the women were
on their own in operating the centre, over time they were able to garner
support from government social and health services to support the on-going
operational costs of the programme.<p>
<p>
Another initiative undertaken in relation to women's work in the informal
sector was begun in Senegal in 1962.  Women who were part of a group
(<i>Animation feminine</i>) proposed that a child care centre be started so
that the younger children could be cared for while the women and their older
daughters undertook the arduous task of working in the field.  While initially
these were rather informal centres, over time they became viable and a central
activity of the <i>Animation Feminine</i>.   Community developers quickly
realised that the centres could be used as a base from which a variety of
social services could be offered.  Eventually the centres were taken over by
the Department of <i>Animation Rurale, Promotion Humaine,</i> who began to
offer training to community volunteers who worked in the centres.  They also
began to offer adult education courses in nutrition, health, hygiene, disease
prevention, and water purification.  Through the centres they also offer
curative health services for common diseases. <p>
<p>
While it is important to understand the potential for developing early
childhood programmes in relation to women's traditional place of work, these
programmes are more likely to be unique to a given geographic area.  It should
be recognised that it may be difficult to find networks of such programmes or
an organisational structure within which one could work to implement primary
health care components in these community-initiated efforts.<p>
<p>
     3.3.3.  <u>Support for women seeking new opportunities.</u>  <p>
<p>
During the last 20 years there has been an increased recognition of women's
role in development, and efforts have been made to support women's greater
involvement in the wage economy.  Some of the projects designed to promote
women's development have been successful; others have not met intended goals.
By and large, those that have met with the most success are those that have
provided women with the supports they have needed to take on new roles.  The
primary support required is a recognition of the fact that even though women
are being given new opportunities, their traditional responsibilities related
to the household and child care remain intact.  In order for women to fully
participate in development, quality child care must be available.<p>
<p>
An example of early childhood programmes developed in relation to women and
development efforts comes from Brazil. In 1979 the <i>Centro de Estudios
Supletivos de Narandiba (CESUN)</i> was established to provide non-formal
education and vocational training to low-income peoples. One of CESUN's
original ideas was to provide vocational training to women in non-traditional
trades, such as plumbing or electricity. Although the women expressed interest
in such training, they also indicated they needed child care.  Following a
series of discussions, CESUN not only established a child care centre, but it
also developed a vocational course for Caregivers. (Rocha, et.al., 1983)  Thus,
in addition to meeting the immediate needs of women who wanted to participate
in training, women were given marketable skills and knowledge.  Not
incidentally, what they learned in the course also helped them in their own
parenting role.<p>
<p>
In sum, in both the developed and developing world there is increasing pressure
to create early childhood care and development programmes in relation to the
work place.  Early childhood programmes operated at the work place represent
both programmes developed from the top down (those mandated through
legislation) and those developed from the community up, based on women's
definition of their needs.  The systems being developed offer tremendous
potential for the integration of health care and psycho-social stimulation into
child care programmes that all too often provide only custodial care.<p>
<p>
3.4.  <u>Community-based</u>. 
</a>
<p>
<p>
Within this classification there are two kinds of community-based child care
programmes.  There are those which were begun by the community itself,
supported primarily by community resources. And there are those that have been
begun by outsiders with a broad community development perspective, who are
using child care as an entry point for the introduction of community
development activities.  As can be imagined, this category encompasses a wide
range of early childhood efforts.<p>
<p>
     3.4.1. <u>Community initiated</u>. <p>
<p>
What characterises these programmes is the fact that, by and large, they are
initiated by the community and rely primarily on community resources for their
operation and continuation. In many developing countries resources are not
available to build early childhood centres. Yet there is interest in creating a
programme for young children.   Many of these begin in the out-of-doors because
no other facilities are available.  Some of them have remained there while
others have become a part of a larger regional or national effort.<p>
<p>
     Within several African countries there are examples of such community-based
initiatives.  A notable one comes from Kenya, where the <i>harambee</i>
movement has led to the creation of local pre-schools which today operate in 28
of the country's 41 districts, enrolling approximately 800,000 children (almost
30% of the 3-5 year olds in the country). (Myers, 1992)   The programme is low
in cost because of the heavy contributions made by the local community.  It is
also decentralised.  The centres are operated by local parent committees, and
the resources necessary to implement the programme come primarily from the
community.  County, town and municipal governments take an active part in
supervision of the pre-schools, while the Ministry of Education is responsible
for teacher training and for providing on-going support to the teachers.  This
is done through a well-elaborated system of District Centres for Early
Childhood Education (DICECE), supported by a National Centre (NACECE) within
the Kenya Institute of Education.<p>
<p>
Other examples of community-based programmes are described in Annex A. In all
the examples it is evident that these programmes rely heavily on community
support if they are going to survive.  Additionally, they have been developed
in communities that are the least likely to be reached by the more formal
traditional pre-school programmes. They also reach children and families least
likely to be served by the health sector.  Yet these programmes face many
challenges.  In describing these child care programmes in Africa,
Mbikusita-Lewanika (1982) summarises some of the issues.<p>
                                                         <p>
Most of these centres are provided by the communities on self-help bases. The
communities are eager for their children to benefit from any kind of early
childhood care and education, and cannot wait for the governments to provide
these facilities...Since they are provided by the communities, they are the
cheapest of all children's centres....These centres have the poorest
facilities; ill constructed or uncompleted buildings, poor ventilation,
dangerous walls and floors, overcrowding of children, lack of equipment and
materials, under-staffed, and untrained personnel.  p.23<p>
<p>
While these characteristics would suggest that community-based child care
programmes are a poor choice in terms of their ability to introduce MCH
components, these programmes have some real strengths.  Mbikusita-Lewanika
(1982) identifies the following: early childhood centres in these communities
have the potential to serve as a base for community development; these
communities receive the least in terms of all social services; children from
these communities are most in need of what a quality pre-school can provide;
and last, but not least, people in these communities have demonstrated their
commitment to their children and their ability to create a programme through
self-help initiatives. (p. 23-24).<p>
<p>
     3.4.2. <u>Entry point programmes</u>.  <p>
<p>
These are community development programmes where child care is developed as an
entry point into the community and a base from which other community
development activities can evolve.  The approach is to work with the community
to identify needs, and then to create a range of services to meet these needs.
The examples which follow are instances where the community has defined early
childhood programmes as a priority.  As a result, child care programmes have
been created. <p>
<p>
One example is the <i>Sang Kancil</i> project developed within the squatter
settlements of Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  The project was begun by health sector
personnel interested in establishing primary health care centres within
<i>kampungs</i> (districts) in the settlements.  However, taking a community
development approach, meetings were first held with community members to
determine their needs and priorities.  They were most interested in having a
child care system for young children, and in creating income- generating
activities for women.  Health care was not seen as a priority.  Those involved
in developing the project listened to the community.  Rather than building a
health centre, they established a pre-school and an income-generating project.
When these were well established, then it was possible to introduce primary
health care, which is now widely accepted.  (Yusof, 1982) <p>
3.5.  <u>Formal Pre-schools
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
Included in this category are programmes designed to meet the needs of children
living in poor urban and rural areas who are seen as having a disadvantage when
they enter primary school.  These children, because of their ethnic, social,
regional, or family background, lack the experiences, skills, and knowledge
that more affluent peers bring to the school experience.  As a result, they do
poorly, drop out of school early, and are likely to continue the cycle of
poverty.  In the hopes of breaking that cycle, preschool programmes have been
developed for this group of children so that once they enter the school system
they can compete on an equitable basis with their peers.<p>
<p>
Within Southeast Asia there are a number of examples of national efforts which
have been developed to provide a pre-school experience in the primary school
for the urban poor and rural child.  In Thailand, for example, there was an
awareness that some children come to the formal school experience at a
"disadvantage".  There was also recognition of the long-term value of quality
pre-school.  Demographics also played a part.  There was a declining birth rate
which led to a demand for better education; with fewer children, families have
a high investment in their children's education.  The lower birth rate meant a
decreasing enrollment in primary schools, with the result being empty
classrooms.       <p>
<p>
In response to these factors the Ministry of Education provided grants so that
targeted communities could develop pre-primary programmes.  Grants went to
"areas identified as the rural impoverished, the urban deprived, the remote and
barren, and the community with 50% of the children speaking other than Thai".
(Piya-Ajariya, 1983)  Other communities interested in establishing pre-primary
programmes had to bear all the costs themselves.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately this programme, and those developed in connection with public
schools elsewhere, tend to represent an extension downwards of a costly formal
educational system.  There is some question about the long-term value of
creating these costly systems.  With alternative models it may be possible to
achieve multiple goals, in terms of health care, nutrition, parent education
and community development, as well as education.      <p>
<p>
3.6.  <u>Integrated Care Centres</u>.  
</a>
<p>
<p>
These are early childhood efforts that are developed from the beginning to meet
the multiple needs of young children from the poorest of the poor families.
Included in this category are those programmes that consciously provide a full
range of services for the child (from health and nutrition to educational
activities), parents and sometimes the community.  <p>
<p>
One of the most notable is the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS)
programme in India.  The need for massive programmes which address the needs of
young children is most evident in a country like India where there are more
than 109 million children under the age of 6, constituting 16% of the
population (Sadka, 1984).  In 1974, India adopted a National Policy for
Children as an indication of its commitment to ensure the delivery of
comprehensive child development services to all children.  One of the first
targets for the effort were the "poorest of the poor found in urban slums and
urban areas", particularly children in "scheduled cases and tribes." (Sadka,
1984, p.3).  <p>
<p>
The programme began on a pilot basis in 33 of India's 5000 administrative
blocks.  By March of 1985, 100,000 <u>Anganwadis</u> (centres) were providing
services to approximately 3 million children.  In 1989 it was estimated to
reach 11.6 million children (Myers, 1992), and by 1993 there were 265,000
centres, serving 16 million children, with the ultimate goal being the delivery
of comprehensive services to all children under the age of 6 by the year 2000.
(See Annex A for a more complete description of the programme.)<p>
<p>
Several major evaluations of the programme have been conducted.  The earliest
was in 1978.  Others have followed, all of which indicated positive results in
terms of the programme's impact on children, women, and the community at large.
For example participation in the centre is associated with reductions in infant
mortality, severe malnutrition, morbidity and school repetition.  (Chaturvedi
et. al, 1987)<p>
<p>
In Latin America there are also community-based programmes designed to provide
health, nutrition, and education services.  A non-formal education programme
has been developed in Peru, where, in 1972, a national commitment was made to
provide pre-school  <i>(initial education</i>) for all children in Peru.
Recognizing the diversity of cultures represented in the various regions of the
country, communities were encouraged to develop models of pre-school education
that met their particular needs.  Within Puno, Peru, a non-formal model evolved
that was subsequently disseminated to other parts of the country.  <p>
<p>
The Puno programme began in 1967 as a community-based effort to provide
nutrition education to women.  But when the initial education movement began,
the programme shifted its focus to the development of a pre-school for Quechua
and Aymara children 3-6 years of age.  In 1973 it became known as the
<i>Proyecto Experimental de Educacion Initial No-Escolarizada de Puno
(PROPEDEINE)</i>.  The programme operates in simply constructed Children's
Houses (<i>Wawa Wasis</i> and <i>Wawa Utas</i>), constructed by community
members who donate the materials as well as their time and skill.  Pre-school
aged children are provided with an educational programme, basic health care,
and nutritional supplementation.  The centres have also been used for the
delivery of health components.  For example, they are used as the base of
operations during immunization campaigns.  <p>
<p>
The examples presented in this sub-category illustrate ways in which programmes
have been developed specifically to provide integrated care to the young child.
There are more and more private and public agencies and organisation attempting
to develop integrated programmes.  And, in situations where it is possible to
undertake new initiatives, this is the model that should be followed to address
the full range of the child's and family's needs.  At the present time,
however, integrated child care systems are few and far between.  Therefore
strategies need to be developed to introduce MCH components into existing
systems.  In the next section there is a discussion of some of these
strategies. <p>
<p>
<b>4.     Strengthening and Expanding Existing Programmes to provide better Health
Care</b><p>
<p>
Having established that child care systems are a logical entry point for the
delivery of maternal and child health components, and having defined a range of
approaches to child care, the next step is a systematic approach to
understanding how one would go about collaborating with these systems to
improve health care in the families and communities being served by the
programmes.  In order to determine the best strategy it is necessary to answer
the following questions: i) What is the population being served by child care
and how does that relate to the population that needs to be reached?  What
kinds of child care programmes are currently serving these populations?  ii)
What is the potential of expanding the scope and coverage of these services?
and iii) If the service is reaching the targeted population, what strategy
should be used by the health system to introduce MCH components?  In this
section, these questions will be discussed.<p>
<p>
4.1  <u>The Population being Served by Child Care Programmes
</a></u>
<p>
<p>
From the literature on early childhood programmes it is possible to divide
child care programmes into three groups, based on the populations they intend
to serve.  There are the global programmes that attempt to provide a given
service to all children in a specific age group.  For example, a nation may
decide to develop an early childhood programme for all children who will enter
the formal school system the following year in order for these children to be
better prepared for the primary education.  Not many countries can afford this
approach, nor does it generally reach those most in need of the service.<p>
<p>
     A second type of programme are those that target a more specific sub-group
within a given age range.  Included in this category are:<p>
<p>
 Pre-school programmes developed for a specific population of children (i.e.
from low income families) in order to ameliorate environmental differences that
put them at a disadvantage when they enter the formal school system.  The
ultimate goal of many of these programmes is to break the cycle of poverty.<p>
<p>
      Full-day child care programmes for children (0-6) of women involved in income
generating activities.  Such care is also provided to children of women
involved in educational/ training programmes, making it possible for them to
participate in these activities in order to gain new knowledge and skills.  At
a minimum these programmes provide a safe place for children when their mothers
are not available to care for them.<p>
<p>
      Early childhood programmes are designed to meet the special needs of children
at risk due to family stress or transition. The programme goal is to give them
a secure environment and consistent caregiver, for at least a part of the day.
            <p>
<p>
          Programmes for children within a given geographic region, to provide
them with the services that will support their growth and development and bring
them to an equitable position with children from other regions of the country
(i.e for rural children who lack stimulation, or for children in urban squatter
settlements who may lack adequate caregiving).<p>
<p>
      Programmes for children from other than the dominant cultural group to
provide them with experiences that will better prepare them to participate in
the formal school system (which is generally designed on the values and norms
of the dominant culture).<p>
<p>
      Early childhood programmes created to meet community development goals.  In
these instances, while providing direct service to children, the child care
programme is used as a way of reaching parents and other community members, and
ultimately getting them involved in developing a range of basic services for
the community.<p>
<p>
Third, there are very specialised programmes, targeting children with specific
needs.  These include children suffering from malnutrition who are provided for
through rehabilitation programmes.  In some instances, psycho-motor stimulation
is also a programme activity.  This category also includes programmes for
developmentally disabled children and those with special medical, therapeutic
and educational needs, who are provided with the specialised services that
their condition requires.<p>
<p>
These categories of target populations and programme goals are not meant to be
exhaustive, nor are they mutually exclusive.  Rather, they are illustrative of
the ways in which people have defined specific child populations in need of
child care services, and the goals associated with different early childhood
efforts.  It is primarily through the second type of programmes, those with a
targeted but not specialised populations, that those not being served currently
by the health care system can be reached.   <p>
                  <p>
4.2  <u>The Potential for Child Care Systems to Incorporate MCH Components.</u>  
</a>
<p>
<p>
In order to make an assessment of whether or not it would be worth investing
valuable resources to link with a specific effort, it is important to have an
understanding of the programme's characteristics to determine how easy or
difficult it would be to link with the programme and introduce MCH components.
Of particular importance is the programme's position in the community.  If the
early childhood programme is well respected and a part of the fabric of the
community, rather than on the periphery of people's lives, then there is a much
greater likelihood that additional programme components will be accepted and
used by the people.  There are a variety of dimensions to be examined to know
whether or not the programme is an integral part of community activities.
These include:<p>
<p>
     4.2.1. <u>The physical location of the child care programme.</u> <p>
<p>
Is it located within easy reach of those being served?  If not, then it is
unlikely that it is successfully serving those most in need.  An example of an
inappropriately placed programme was a nutrition recuperation programme
operated in Chile.  The programme was developed in response to public outrage
at high rates of infant mortality due to malnutrition.  A series of
recuperation centres were established in refurbished homes in upper class
neighbourhoods.  <p>
<p>
One of the reasons for using the homes was to create an atmosphere that would
be less intimidating and cold than many hospitals.  It was presumed that
mothers would feel more comfortable visiting and spending time with their
children in a home rather than in a hospital.  Another reason for locating the
centres in the upper class areas of the city was to assure that the programme
had high visibility, demonstrating the government's responsiveness to the need.
To further promote visibility, volunteers (upper class women), were asked to
provide stimulation to the children in the centres.  These women became very
involved in the programme. However, the parents did not.  <p>
<p>
While the atmosphere was less like a hospital setting, the neighbourhoods where
the centres were located were more intimidating than hospitals. There was a
great sociological/ psychological and physical distance between the
recuperation centres and the child's home.  Thus, mothers seldom visited their
children.<p>
<p>
When the child was ready to go home, after having gained weight and attained
appropriate developmental milestones, the child was returned to a family to
whom the child was a stranger. Nothing had been done within the context of the
child's environment to assure that malnutrition would not re-occur. Not too
surprisingly, many of the children returned to the recuperation centres several
months later, once again suffering from malnutrition (Colombo, 1979).  Thus,
while the programme met some short-term goals by decreasing infant mortality
and malnutrition during the child's first year of life, long-term goals were
not realised.  The socio-cultural and environmental variables that were a part
of the cause of the malnutrition were not addressed.  The programme was never
embraced by the community; it remained on the periphery until it was redesigned
to include parents in a significant way.<p>
<p>
     4.2.2.  <u>The history of the programme within the community</u>.<p>
<p>
Do the people within the community talk about their programme with pride?  Has
it been able to meet community needs over time?  If the programme is seen as
providing quality services, then it is likely that the addition of other
programme components will be accepted.  An example of this is the <i>Sang
Kancil</i> programme in squatter settlements in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,
described above.  Those developing the programme were responsive to the
community's expressed needs.  Then, once the preschool and income-generating
activities were well established and an integral part of the people's lives,
maternal and child health services were initiated in conjunction with the
existing programme and readily accepted (Yusof, 1982). <p>
<p>
<p>
     4.2.3.  <u>Parent/community participation in the programme</u>.  <p>
<p>
Within current development planning, one of the strategies most frequently
advocated is to have strong community participation in programme development,
from the definition of the need, to development of a plan of action, to project
implementation, to evaluation of outcomes.  While this strategy is utilised in
the development of many basic services programmes, it is seen as particularly
important in relation to early childhood programmes.  Within developed
countries a strong argument has been made that the community is the most
appropriate level of social organization to implement and manage child care
systems (Bronfenbrener, 1980; Center for the Study of Public Policy, 1971).  <p>
<p>
It is argued that since parents are the policy makers in most areas of their
young children's lives, their involvement in the design and operation of a
early childhood care and development centre increases the likelihood of
continuity of experience between the home and school for the child.  This same
argument is being made for parental and community involvement in the
implementation and management of child care programmes in developing countries.
The general consensus is that the greater the level of community involvement,
the more likely it is that the programme will meet community needs and become
an integral part of community life.  <p>
<p>
It should be noted, however, that the extent to which parents can and will
become involved in early childhood care and development programmes is
determined by a number of variables.  For example, there is cultural variance
in the degree to which it is deemed appropriate for parents to be involved in
the education of their children.  In some societies women are responsible for
care of the child, but do not play a role in educating the child.  Thus, they
would not feel they should be a part of the child's on-going education.  <p>
<p>
Yet another variable is the time that parents have available to become
involved.  Where early childhood care and development programmes have been
developed in response to needs for day care, women are likely to have little,
if any, time to be involved in the day-to-day activities of the programme.  <p>
<p>
Another variable that affects the extent of parent and community involvement in
child care programmes is related to the political structure of the programme,
and the extent to which control for the programme is centralised or
decentralised.  Where the programme is designed and introduced from outside the
community, there may be little room for parent and community involvement. <p>
 <p>
In sum, while it is important to assess the potential of a child care centre to
incorporate MCH components, when there are issues of scale involved, then it is
also critical to assess whether or not a relatively small-scale programme can
be expanded once MCH components are incorporated within it.  In the next
section, there is a discussion of issues related to expanding the coverage of a
child care programme.<p>
<p>
4.3.  <u>The Potential for Child Care Systems to Increase Coverage.
</u>
<p>
<p>
In general, it can be assumed that it is not cost-effective to develop
materials and provide the necessary training and support to individual child
care initiatives or those that are developed to serve a relatively small
population.  Clearly, it would be most efficient to link with large-scale
efforts where an infrastructure already exists that includes facilities, basic
services, staffing, training and on-going support.  While it is logical to
coordinate health input with successful large -
scale child care programmes, few
of these exist, and they seldom reach those most in need.  <p>
<p>
An alternative strategy is to seek out successful projects, serving those most
at risk, which have the potential for <i>going-to-scale</i>.  Going-to-scale
refers to the process of taking successful small-scale projects and developing
them into programmes that attempt to reach as many potential beneficiaries as
possible, regionally, nationally or even worldwide (Myers, 1985, p.1).  <p>
<p>
One of the problems with developing linkages with early childhood programmes
that appear to have the potential to go-to-scale, is that it is difficult to
predict what needs to happen for small-scale efforts to be implemented on a
broader basis. For example, in a review of seven successful pilot projects in
India, Pyle (1984) identifies project characteristics which would necessarily
change if the projects were to be implemented on a national scale.  In his
review Pyle notes that the organisational and political factors that would come
into play once the project moved beyond its current boundaries would
dramatically change the way in which the project would operate.  There is some
question as to whether or not these changes could be made while maintaining the
integrity of the project.<p>
<p>
Further, experience indicates that to be truly effective and enduring, a
programme must develop in response to community initiative, need and
willingness to assume responsibility for programme development.  In
community-based programmes community members frequently have administrative
control of a project.  They have autonomy in decision-making and are encouraged
to be flexible in developing solutions to their problems.  In going-to-scale,
project administration would change; it is likely it would become centralised,
more rigid and part of a bureaucracy.  This raises the question as to the role
of community participation when successful small-scale pilot projects
go-to-scale and are implemented on a region- or nation-wide basis.  <p>
<p>
The ingredients of successful transfer inevitably vary since communities
possess different social and cultural patterns, organisational and fiscal
resources, problems, norms and history. Nonetheless, there are certain
pre-existing community conditions that enhance or hinder the likelihood of
success of any expansion effort.  The following conditions seem to be critical:
<p>
      Political commitment at all levels should include an appropriate supportive
policy, adequate budget allocations, and a willingness to make structural
reforms where necessary.<p>
<p>
      Adequate fiscal and human resources must be available. The on-going costs
must be within the community's present and future means. The costs of a
programme may vary in kind and amount from one community to another.<p>
<p>
      The model must be adequately developed. It should be structurally strong yet
flexible and adaptable. An evaluation system should be established.<p>
<p>
      An organizational mandate should be prepared and the organizational and
management skills required to operate the programme should be available within
the host agency. The staff should be selected on the basis of their values and
motivation.<p>
<p>
While an understanding of programme characteristics is critical to supporting
the expansion of a child care system, another important variable to be taken
into consideration is the sponsor.  In the next section there is a discussion
of the kinds of organisations and agencies that sponsor child care centres, and
the different roles they can play.<p>
<p>
4.4  <u>The Role of Sponsors in the Development and Support of Early Childhood
Programmes.</u>   
<p>
 <p>
There are two aspects to sponsorship: programme funding and programme
implementation or operation. It is not uncommon, for instance, for those who
provide initial funding and/or technical support for the programme to have a
time-limited involvement.  The expectation is that after the programme is
established it will be maintained, at some level, by the population being
served.  In other instances, funders and operators are one and the same.  Those
responsible for funding the programme actually operate the programme and
maintain it over time.  Thus, in seeking ways to introduce primary health care
into child care settings it is important to be able to differentiate between
those who provide initial support and those who maintain the programme over
time.  <p>
<p>
It is necessary to acknowledge and plan for the fact that funders and
implementers, in the short- and long-term, play different roles in child care
programming, and they would have different roles in the introduction and/or
upgrading of public health care services.  More importantly, however, to
develop a successful intervention strategy, it is necessary to understand the
organisational and bureaucratic structure within which the sponsor operates.
Sponsors of early childhood programmes can be divided into four groups:  <p>
<p>
     4.4.1  <u>The community</u><p>
<p>
As was noted in Section 3, there are a wide variety of early childhood
programmes that are developed as a result of community initiative.  These are
either begun by an existing group or a community organisation evolves to work
specifically on the development of an early childhood programme. In either
instance, the community perceives a need for child care and a programme is
created.  Once these are established, the government and/or non-governmental
agencies can provide training and resources to upgrade the services provided.<p>
<p>
Thus communities can serve as sponsors of a child care programme.  While they
have extremely limited resources, the on-the-ground commitment of communities
is what sustains programmes over time.  And, in fact, while other sponsors may
provide comparatively unlimited resources to the development of an early
childhood initiative, without community belief in and commitment to the effort,
the child care programme will not be successful.<p>
<p>
     4.4.2.  <u>Non-governmental (NGO), Private Voluntary Organizations (PVO)</u>.
<p>
<p>
Non-governmental organisations exist outside any governmental structure. They
can be found within the international community, at the national level, or
their scope may be regional.  At the <i>international</i> level there are a
variety of groups (e.g. Save the Children, Christian Children's Fund, Oxfam,
CARITAS, Redd Barna, etc.), originally formed to address survival issues who
are currently involved in development programming. For example, Christian
Children's Fund, a child sponsorship organization, uses some of its monies to
create schools and community development centres which address the multiple
needs of the child and community rather than only providing nutritional
supplements to the sponsored child.<p>
<p>
At the <i>national</i> and <i>local</i> levels there are church-related and
welfare organisations that have developed a range of early childhood
programmes.  In addition, there are voluntary organisations which have seen the
need for early childhood programmes and have taken the initiative to develop
them within their country.  For example, the Botswana Council of Women, a
private voluntary membership organization, has raised the funds necessary to
establish day care centres to support women's increased involvement in the wage
economy. <p>
<p>
Private voluntary organizations and non-governmental agencies are financed
through a variety of mechanisms.  Some operate on the basis of subscriptions.
The UN related organizations are a primary example.  A second source of funds
are individual gifts and/or private philanthropy.  In addition, volunteer time
and energy are critical to the operation of most PVO organisations,
particularly those that operate at the community level.  Many community-based
child care programmes are able to exist because local resources are available
to the programme.  These take the form of: cash, in-kind goods, and labour
(meal preparation, construction and maintenance of facilities).  Other PVOs
charge fees for the programmes they operate, recuperating the costs of the
programme by participant reimbursement.  The amount a given NGO/PVO is able to
spend on early childhood activities is determined by the organization's mandate
and related budget.  The potential for these groups to expand their service to
young children varies greatly among the NGO/PVOs.<p>
<p>
     4.4.3  <u>Government</u>.     <p>
<p>
There are governmental agencies and organizations whose involvement in early
childhood activities is based on nationally defined needs, goals and resources.
Government agencies and organizations frequently play the role of funder and
implementer.  These agencies are mandated to carry out national policy.  If
early childhood programmes are seen as a national priority, then a governmental
ministry will be charged with the responsibility for developing, implementing
and operating related programmes.  Sometimes only public sector funds are used
in the development of national programmes.  In other instances, the government
encourages private sector involvement as well.  One of the challenges of
working with child care programmes is that they have been developed by and
operated under the mandate of a variety of national ministries, including
education, welfare, health, labour, social affairs, women's affairs, youth,
agriculture, or some combination of these.   <p>
<p>
Within each of these ministries the rationale for the development of early
childhood programmes, the population to be served, specific programme goals,
the curriculum, staffing, and resources available to the programme are quite
different.  In order to work with government officials within the various
ministries, it is important to know their bias and concerns if they are to be
approached to expand the range of services they currently provide.  For
example, it will take a different strategy to work with the Ministry of
Education than it will to work with the Ministry of Labour; the rationale for
their involvement in early childhood programming is different, they serve
different constituents, and implement different types of programmes.<p>
<p>
It is also important to recognize that governmental involvement in early
childhood programmes occurs at the regional or county level, and at the city or
local level, as well as at the national level.  While being responsive to
national policy, the regional and local government groups frequently have a
great deal of autonomy in establishing priorities and creating programmes
designed to meet the specific needs of their constituency.                <p>
There is yet another set of quasi-governmental agencies/ organisations that
have been very involved in the development of early childhood programmes.
These agencies are generally established through special funding and have been
created to fulfill a particular mandate.  In many instances those working in
these agencies have the freedom and resources to develop innovative programmes
that can be put into place relatively rapidly; they do not have to operate
within the bureaucratic structure which exists within many ministries. Examples
of such agencies include the Children's Foundation in Venezuela, a child
welfare agency headed by the First Lady of the Republic.  A comparable
institute also exists in Ecuador (Instituto Nacional de Ninos y la Familia),
and in most other Latin American countries.  All of these agencies have had a
significant role in the development of early childhood programmes in their
country.<p>
     <p>
     4.4.4.  <u>Multi-national donor agencies</u>.  <p>
<p>
Multi-national donors (e.g. WHO, UNICEF, UNESCO, USAID and other bi-lateral
donor agencies) do planning from an international perspective.  They generally
provide short-term support.  In general, these groups establish target
populations to serve, develop an agency policy about how that group is to be
reached, and then work with appropriate national ministries to develop
programmes for the target population, based on national goals and resources.
In general, these agencies provide funding and technical assistance which
supports programme development; they do not provide funding for on-going
programme support.<p>
<p>
In sum, there are a range of sponsors that can and have been involved in the
development of early childhood programmes.  Sponsors play a variety of roles,
from helping to make communities aware of the need for child care programmes,
to providing initial funding and technical assistance in support of the effort,
to providing the necessary on-going support to allow the programme to operate.
Each organisation has its own reason for being involved in early childhood
programming.  The motivation behind a group's involvement will, to a large
extent, determine the nature of the programme.  <p>
<p>
In order to work with the sponsoring organisation it is important to understand
their motivation and long-term commitment to the effort.  It is also important
to know what kind of financial and technical resources they have available to
them in order to know if they can support expansion of their effort to include
MCH components.  <p>
<p>
If an assessment of a child care programme suggests: i) that there are sponsors
available to support the introduction of MCH components into a given child care
system, ii) that the system is well established and serving an appropriate
target population, and iii) that the programme could be supported to
go-to-scale, then the health sector needs to develop strategies which will
allow for the successful introduction of MCH components.  A suggested course of
action is provided in the next section.<p>
  <p>
4.5  <u>Strategies for Enhancing the Success of Introducing MCH Components into
Existing Programmes</u>
<p>
 <p>
Integrating new programme components within existing institutional and service
structures is a complex and difficult process.  The time and energy required to
introduce new components is generally under-estimated by those involved. It is
not just a technical process but involves important interpersonal, political,
bureaucratic, socio-cultural and resource factors.  To successfully introduce
and provide the necessary on-going support for the implementation of MCH
components, the following strategies are suggested: <p>
<p>
     4.5.1.  <u>Select leaders responsible for promoting the new component from
among individuals who have local credibility, a genuine commitment to the
effort, and a personal style suited to the task.</u><p>
<p>
It is critical that the individual who initiates contact with the sponsoring
agency have credibility with the people in that agency.  If the sponsor is a
government ministry, then the individual must have formal credentials that
would make that person credible to those already involved in the child care
programme.  If, on the other hand, the sponsor is an international organisation
that promotes community development, then the initial contact should be made by
someone with a similar philosophy and approach to working with communities.<p>
<p>
     4.5.2.  <u>Show sensitivity to the cultural, social and interpersonal bonds
that hold programmes together</u>.  <p>
Any programme that has been in place for some time will have a history that has
created a <i>programme culture</i>.  That culture will include both formal and
informal ways of operating and communicating that are an integral part of what
the programme has to offer.  Anyone attempting to enter the programme must try
and understand the culture of the organisation and must not violate the norms
and values that hold the programme together.  It is best to listen and observe
before stepping in with recommendations for changes.<p>
<p>
There are changes that are likely to occur within the agency as a result of
intervention.  This may include a re-definition of staff roles and the support
required, change in the focus of the organisation in terms of the services
and/or intended beneficiaries.  While the specifics cannot be anticipated, the
potential for changes needs to recognised and accommodated. <p>
<p>
     4.5.3  <u>Establish the legitimacy for the MCH activities in relation to what
is currently being provided.</u>  <p>
<p>
As it was important for the community to understand the legitimacy of the child
care programme when it was begun, likewise those involved in the programme
(sponsors, community members and parents) must come to believe in the
importance of the MCH components that are to be introduced.  Even though there
may be a child care programme in place that is fully utilised by the community,
if something is "tacked on" to the programme, it will not necessarily be
accepted.  People need to value the addition and see ways that it can enhance
their lives.  Before offering materials and training to introduce new MCH
components, it will be necessary to conduct a needs assessment to ascertain
what is already known and practiced in a particular setting, and to determine
immediate needs.  Then new elements can be introduced.<p>
     <p>
     4.5.4.  <u>Define clearly and openly the goals and limits of the programme
component to be introduced</u>.  <p>
<p>
Related to the need to help people see the introduction of new components as
useful to them, it is equally important to be clear about what that component
will and will not contribute to the community.  Thus those operating the
programme need to understand clearly what the health care components are and
what their role will be in their implementation.  Input should be sought from
the organisation on how the current programme can be changed to reach desired
goals.<p>
<p>
Sometimes people are eager to take something new on-board but have no
understanding of what will be required of them to make the new venture
successful.  Thus child care managers and care-givers need to be involved in
the planning phase. Likewise, staff need to understand that they will be
required to undertake additional training, and they need to know if the
introduction of the components is going to demand more of their time.  (For
example, recording periodic information on children's growth and development is
time-consuming and may be an entirely new task for staff.)  If staff are not
willing to accept the new demands on them, the programme will not be
implemented effectively. Thus the clearer the goals and expectations are from
the beginning, the more likely it is that the new components will be
implemented fully.<p>
<p>
     4.5.5  <u>Allow adequate time and resources for planning, start-up, testing
and implementing the programme</u>.  <p>
<p>
Those sponsoring the introduction of the MCH components are likely to want to
get things moving quickly.  They are aware of the urgency of getting needed
health services to populations not currently being served.  They also have a
good understanding of what the components involve and they can see an obvious
<i>fit</i> with current programming.  However, those who will be implementing
the component over time may need more time to see the fit and to incorporate
the activity into their daily life.  <p>
<p>
Beyond the needs, abilities and competencies of the local staff are the
bureaucratic and political dimensions that need to be taken into account when
allocating time and resources to the project.  All of these factors will mean
that the programme is likely to be implemented much more slowly than is
desirable.<p>
<p>
     4.5.6  <u>Plan from the beginning for programme growth and
institutionalisation of the programme</u>.  <p>
<p>
One mistake commonly made in the development of programmes is to wait until the
programme is fully functioning and coming to the end of its funding before
thought is given to how to sustain the effort over time.  Experience would
suggest that as the programme is being planned it is important to address the
issue of how it will be maintained over time, financially and in terms of
programme quality.  From the beginning, plans must be made in relation to the
pace of growth and the long-term viability of the effort.<p>
<p>
     4.5.7  <u>Create monitoring and feedback mechanisms in the early stages and
insure that users are committed to them.</u>  <p>
An important aspect of any programme is knowing how well the programme is doing
in meeting its goals and objectives.  In order to make this assessment, an
evaluation or monitoring system needs to be put into place.  While quite
obviously the system should assess the impact of the programme on those being
served, monitoring systems also need to be developed to assess the
effectiveness and efficiency of the organisation.  <p>
<p>
These systems cannot be set up and operated by people outside the programme.
They should be an integral part of the day-to-day activities of staff.  If
staff are involved in developing the monitoring system, and if they see how it
can help them in their work, then they are likely to follow through and keep
the system going.  However, if the evaluation and monitoring activities become
<i>busywork</i> they will be done without much thought and they will ultimately
have little value.  When staff are able to use the information they are
gathering for planning and making their work more effective, the tools will be
utilised. <p>
<p>
In sum, because the introduction of a new programme component implies
disruption of the equilibrium of the social system, it should be based on
mutual negotiation, clarification of intent, adaptation of expectations and
plans, and establishment of consensus on roles and obligations.  The likelihood
of short- and long-term programme success is enhanced by building links between
the old environment and the new programme component.  A part of establishing
these links is having something to offer to the on-going programme.  In the
next section is a discussion of the specific things that the health sector can
offer to child care programmes to enhance their capability of delivering health
care components. <p>
<p>
<p>
<b>5.  MCH Programme Components to be Developed by the Health Sector</b><p>
<p>
In order to introduce health components into child care systems there has to be
a clear delineation of: i) a curriculum, what it is that you want to have
introduced into the setting; ii) support materials; iii) a clear plan for
training staff; and iv) evaluation systems for providing on-going support and
monitoring to assure the implementation of the curriculum.<p>
<p>
5.1.  <u>The Curriculum/Services Provided</u>.  

<p>
<p>
In planning for a child care programme, it is possible to think in terms of
developing a service or developing a curriculum.  There are important
differences between the two approaches. <b>Services</b> refer to the specific
activities provided for the child and family.  Generally programme developers
define the services to be provided based on their perception of what will meet
the particular needs of and goals for the target population.  In many instances
the service has a singular focus (e.g. it is the delivery of food to a
programme to help prevent malnutrition; it is a language development programme
to prepare children for the primary school system; it is custodial care to keep
children safe from harm). <p>
<p>
A <b>curriculum</b> perspective, on the other hand, helps the provider see the
interrelationship between the child's activities in the programme.  The
curriculum, in its broadest definition encompasses <b>all</b> the experiences
that a child has in the child care setting.  It includes the physical setting,
the timetable, the nutrition aspects of the programme, the planned activities
and the interactions between all those involved.  A curriculum  provides a
framework for addressing the multiple needs of children and it helps staff see
how everything that happens during the child's day is part of that child's
learning environment.  Without a curriculum perspective, caregivers are unaware
of the importance of all their actions.  They are also generally unaware of the
range of developmental needs and the activities that could be provided to
promote children's overall growth and development.  <p>
  <p>
While the health sector may be interested in introducing a specific health
component (i.e. a service) it needs to do this with an eye toward how that fits
into the total curriculum.  For example, the delivery of food to the centre is
only one aspect of good nutrition.  In designing a nutrition programme it is
important to be aware and supportive of a feeding process within the setting.
<p>
<p>
Thus, it is important to think in terms of developing <i>health curricula</i>,
not only <i>health services</i>.  From a curriculum perspective it is possible
to address and include the promotional, preventive and curative aspects of
health care as defined earlier.   <p>
<p>
While there is clearly a large body of health information that needs to be
incorporated into the curriculum and passed on to caregivers and families
concerning children's health, some of this will need to be adapted to the
cultural setting.  Thus in developing the curriculum there will be a need to
involve nationals, and sometimes even more local individuals, in the
development of the specifics.<p>
<p>
It may be that the less formal the programme, the less feasible it is to
introduce MCH activities, but if specific task-oriented training is given with
occasional monitoring to ensure maintenance of a satisfactory level of
competence, most promotional and preventive health activities could be provided
even at the level of child minding.  In Table 2 is a presentation of some basic
MCH components, and an indication of the whether or not they could be delivered
through the categories of child care programmes described in Section 3.  (An X
indicates that with adequate support for the provider, the component could be
delivered through that setting.)  <p>
<p>
<p>
5.2.  <u>Development and Dissemination of Support Materials </u>. 
<p>
<p>
In order to support the incorporation of MCH components into child care
systems, materials that can be used in that setting must be developed and/or
adapted.  Materials will be needed by: i) children; ii) the care providers;
iii) those working with parents and/or siblings, if different from those
working with the children; iv) supervisory/ training personnel;  and v)
administrative personnel responsible for the child care programme within an
agency, organization or sector.<p>

<p>
These materials will take several forms.  There may be written materials that
provide basic information which can be used as reference points for providers
and those working with parents.  There is also the need to develop training
materials (written and audio-visual) to support staff development.  Physical
materials that support health activities, such as weighing scales and perhaps
measuring devices to be used in creating ORS solutions, will also be required.
<p>
<p>
One tool that may be particularly useful is a developmental growth chart.  The
development of an instrument that provides basic information on the
developmental needs of the young child has been undertaken by the World Health
Organisation (WHO/MCH, 1991) in collaboration with research groups in Thailand,
India and China.  Through this partnership national teams have been developing
simple and reliable measures of physical growth and psychosocial development
for children under seven.  While the specific items differ across countries,
there is a commonality in the domains included.  They are: gross motor, fine
motor, vision, hearing, language, concept development, self-help and social
skills.  The instrument is used as a screening device to identity children with
developmental delays and provides important data useful in the development of
intervention programmes.  <p>
<p>
One example is the Indonesian Chart of Developmental Milestones that was
developed over several years.  While it drew heavily from developmental tests
developed in the West, there was considerable adaptation made to make the
profile culturally appropriate (Donohue-Colletta, 1992).  While the work done
to develop the instrument was extensive, the process provides a model that can
be replicated in other countries.  Other groups have been involved in the
development of similar instruments in Sri Lanka, Chile and Turkey (Landers
&amp; Kagitcibasi, 1990). Profiles or charts indicating developmental
milestones are invaluable in home-visiting programmes like the one developed in
Peru, a description of which is provided in Annex A.  <p>
In addition to developing materials to assess children's growth and
psychosocial development, it will also be necessary to develop materials for
the children themselves.  Some child care settings have enough resources to
make a variety of materials available, to the providers and the children.  More
commonly, however, child care programmes have few materials.  Caregivers are
encouraged to make use of locally found objects to create things for the
children to play with and learn from, but some basic supplies need to be
provided.<p>
<p>
While it is important that a variety of materials be developed to support the
implementation of health components, even the best materials will be either
underutilised or misused if the caregivers or those responsible for using the
materials are not trained in their use.  Therefore a key element is the
development of an adequate pre- and in-service training programme for staff at
all levels of the programme.  This needs to be developed by those wanting to
introduce the innovation; those currently responsible for the programme are
unlikely to have the required skills or resources to develop this training.<p>
<p>
5.3  <u>Training
</u>
<p>
<p>
The specific training needs of personnel and the subsequent training package
developed will depend on local conditions, programme objectives and targets
set.  It will also be determined by the nature of the institution providing the
care (i.e., formal or informal), the types and levels of caregivers, and the
resources available for the training.  Other important considerations include:
the health problems of the children in the setting, socio-cultural factors
influencing behaviour, and the extent to which the local health needs can be
met by the health, social welfare and education networks in the area.
Regardless of these many variables, there are some basic principles of training
that can be applied across all child care programmes.<p>
<p>
Training is not a one-time event.  It is a process and needs to be thought
about as such when plans are made for the introduction of health components
into child care settings.  In order to design an appropriate training system,
it is important to have some basic information on the people being trained.
The first rule in training is to begin with the learner, whether that be the
child, the child care provider, the parent, the Supervisor or the programme
administrator.<p>
<p>
While training needs to be developed for people at all levels of the programme,
the focus here will be on the development of appropriate training for the staff
who work directly with the children and perhaps the parents.  Thus the learner
in this instance is the child care provider, who is likely to be a
para-professional or volunteer.<p>
  <p>
In almost all countries of the world, early childhood programmes have access to
very limited resources.  Generally untrained staff serve as providers within
the child care programme since <p>
training opportunities are limited.   While this is often due to a lack of
resources, a more insidious problem is that frequently the assumption is made
that child care is women's natural work and therefore little training is
needed.  To compound the problem the work has little status since it is
perceived as something any woman can do.  Then, because the work has such low
status, pay is minimal, if received at all.  <p>
<p>
The consequences of the low status of and low pay for child care staff are that
those with education and a range of job options do not seek positions within
child care programmes.  Thus programmes are staffed by those with limited
education and few options for other employment.  If staff are fortunate enough
to receive some training, they frequently seek and move on to higher paid
positions in other fields.  Yet, to have a quality early childhood programme
that is meeting the full range of children's needs, it is necessary to have
well-trained staff who receive on-going training and supervision in a
curriculum that they believe in and understand.<p>
<p>
In beginning to design a training programme for these staff, the place to begin
is with a definition of what is to be accomplished through the training.<p>
<p>
          <p>
     5.3.1.  <u>Objectives</u>.    <p>
<p>
Regardless of the programme characteristics, there are some basic objectives
that are appropriate for all child care settings.  They are as follows:<p>
<p>
 to improve the caregiver's capacity to observe the state of the child's
overall development (i.e., physical, mental and social);<p>
<p>
      to provide caregivers with the skills to organise the child's daily care to
include physical, social, and pedagogical activities appropriate to the child's
present and desired status of development;<p>
<p>
      to work with the caregivers to define data that would be helpful in programme
monitoring and encourage them in the recording and use of observations;<p>
<p>
          to improve the caregiver's ability to establish and maintain communication
with the child and his/her family and strengthen parental involvement;<p>
<p>
          to equip caregivers with the knowledge of community services networks and
resource persons in the area.<p>
<p>
These objectives are very general and are not meant to be all- inclusive.  They
are provided as a framework that can be used by those planning training within
which to define specific objectives, given the needs of the trainees and the
context within which the training is to be developed.  Once the objectives have
been clarified, then it is possible to develop a training plan.<p>
<p>
<p>
     5.3.2.  <u>Developing the training plan</u>.  <p>
<p>
The challenge to those interested in introducing a programme component into a
child care setting is to help the caregivers and other staff associated with
the programme, acquire skills and knowledge that will make them feel and be
competent.  Following are guidelines to be utilised in developing training
schemes for those associated with the child care programmes:<p>
<p>
      Make an assessment of the caregiver's (or other staff person's) current
knowledge, skills and capabilities;<p>
<p>
      Determine what more it is they need to know in order to adequately care for
the children in their setting, and perform other functions in the programme;<p>
<p>
 Set up the training so that it builds on the individual's experience, and
provides them first with what is it they want to know;<p>
<p>
 Provide a balance of theory and practical work, moving back and forth between
the two to assess the trainee's understanding and her ability to translate
theory into practice;<p>
<p>
 Provide field-based experiences where the caregivers can be observed and given
feedback on their practice;<p>
<p>
 Use training methodologies that encourage participation, training caregivers
and other staff in the way you expect them to work with parents and children;<p>
<p>
      Schedule training so that trainees are able to attend without compromising
other responsibilities; and the length of each session should be designed in
relation to trainees' needs;  <p>
<p>
 Establish what it is realistic to accomplish through pre-service training,
given time and other resources, and what will be provided through in-service
training;<p>
<p>
 Develop ways for staff to evaluate their own skills and define their further
training needs.<p>
<p>
The application of these general principles can lead to quite different
training systems, depending on the trainee.  In Table 3 is a brief outline of
how the guidelines might be applied when working with staff from non-formal and
more formal child care programmes.  <p>
<p>
While training is a key to the ability of staff to perform effectively,
training alone is not adequate to assure that the knowledge, skills and
practices developed during training are maintained over time.  An on-going
support system needs to be developed so that staff can maintain their
competencies.<p>
<p>
     5.3.3.  <u>Developing on-going supports</u>.  <p>
<p>
At each level within a child care programme, there should be others that are
able to support the work.  Teachers need the on-going guidance of supervisors,
supervisors need support for administration, administration needs support from
the organisation, etc.  The health sector will need to determine how support
can be provided at these different levels when MCH components are introduced
into the system.<p>

<p>
One way to develop on-going support for the caregiver is to identify those who
can be trained as trainers/supervisors.  It is best if these people emerge from
among current staff, rather than being brought in from outside.  Once trained
as supervisors they can train new caregivers who enter the programme and offer
on-going support for all staff. <p>
 <p>
Beyond the needs of the caregiver, there are the needs of the supervisors and
trainers.  Given the nature of the materials which will be developed and the
concepts of integrated health, education and care in child care programmes, it
will be important to develop a technical support system for trainers and those
actually involved in using the new information and technologies within the
community.  These are likely to be personnel from health services.<p>
<p>
In sum, training and support are on-going activities within a child care
programme.  Attention to these aspects of the effort is necessary to create and
maintain a quality service.  But it cannot be assumed that because a training
programme is in place a quality programme is being provided.  To know whether
or not the programme is effective, it is important to establish monitoring and
evaluation processes.<p>
<p>
5.4.  <u>Monitoring and Evaluation
</u>
<p>
<p>
As with training, monitoring and evaluation are on-going processes.  Monitoring
essentially means <i>to keep track/to make observations</i> of what is
happening on a day-to-day basis.  When the information is gathered at any point
in time it is possible to evaluate the programme.  Monitoring and evaluation
can be done in relation to external criteria established for the programme, or
it can take place in relation to criteria developed by the programme itself.
External monitoring generally is done in relation to regulations established by
an outside agency.  Internal monitoring yields data on the effectiveness of the
effort.  These two methods of assessing the programme are described below. <p>
<p>
     5.4.1. <u>The monitoring of regulations</u>. <p>
<p>
Early childhood programmes that are part of formal systems are generally
required to meet certain minimal standards.  Monitoring in this instance is
associated with an assessment of compliance with externally-established
regulations.  It is generally conducted by people outside the day-to-day life
of the programme.  And while it is argued that this is required in order to
assure that children are being provided for in a safe, healthy environment,
historically there has been an inherent tension between the standards of health
care provision established by regulatory bodies and the realities of the
contexts within which child care is being provided. (Zigler, et al., 1983;
Ruopp, et al., 1979; Nelson, 1982).  <p>
<p>
A related tension is between standardised national norms and allowance for
regional and local variation.  These tensions exist even in developed countries
where there are relatively more resources available to providers to make
adequate provision for the care of young children.  The issue is exacerbated in
developing countries with grossly inadequate resources available for child care
programming. Another tension is the result of the fact that standards and
regulations are generally set by public bodies (i.e. ministries of health or
social services), while in many countries the great majority of early childhood
programmes are provided by non-governmental organisations.<p>
<p>
There is no question that young children should have a safe, healthy,
stimulating environment within which to play and learn.  The problem is that
the definition of a safe environment differs, depending on the value system of
the definer (Steiner, 1981; Harman, 1978).  To some extent value differences
can and should be worked out in the goal-setting process.  As goals are
established, they can be translated into operational terms which then define
standards and regulations.  <p>
<p>
Standards and regulations are frequently developed in relation to the following
areas:<p>
<p>
 the physical environment (inside and out): size, structure, light, air,
safety, sanitation, etc;<p>
<p>
      the staff-child ratio and/or group size;<p>
<p>
      staffing, the structure, training and/or credentials of providers;<p>
<p>
 months of operation, length of day, hours of operation;<p>
<p>
 fees and financing;<p>
<p>
      the types and variety of services to be provided.<p>
<p>
Unfortunately, as the list suggest, the balance of attention in regulating
early childhood programmes is frequently given to the monitoring of the
<b>static</b>, easily measured dimensions of a programme (i.e. the number of
square feet/child, the number of toilets, etc), none of which have been
demonstrated to have a significant impact on developmental outcomes for
children.  On the other hand, there are a variety of environmental conditions
that are known to promote the healthy development of young children. (Zeitlin,
1993; Werner, 1982; Berruta-Clement, 1984)  These more <b>dynamic</b>
dimensions (e.g. the patterns of adult-child, child-child and child-environment
interactions) speak to the programme process and need to be included in any
system of standards and regulation of child care.  In order to try and
integrate these more dynamic variables into regulations, the following are
suggested as an alternative framework for monitoring programmes: <p>
<p>
      adequate provision for health, safety, nutrition and shelter;<p>
<p>
          consistent caregivers;<p>
<p>
          adult and peer models of appropriate cognitive and social behavior, and
opportunities to interact with these models;<p>
<p>
          appropriately communicated and consistent expectations and limits;<p>
<p>
          a recognition of and allowance for children's individual interests and
developmental pattern;<p>
<p>
          a physical and social environment that encourages active exploration
and provides opportunities for learning;<p>
<p>
          feedback, both positive and negative, that provides the child with a
positive sense of self and a trust of others.<p>
<p>
While not so easily addressed in regulations nor accessible through simple
monitoring techniques, these variables are key to the implementation of quality
child care programmes and should be built into any child care system and
included in the monitoring process.  <p>
<p>
One example of an attempt to include both the static and dynamic variables in
an assessment tool developed by WHO (1990).  Their Child Care Facility Schedule
includes the following categories:<p>
<p>
          I.  Physical Environment<p>
         II.  Health and Safety<p>
        III.  Nutrition and Food Service<p>
         IV.  Administration<p>
          V.  Staff-Family Interaction<p>
         VI.  Staff-children Interaction<p>
        VII.  Observable Child Behaviour<p>
       VIII.  Curriculum<p>
<p>
Within the international community there is recognition that  early childhood
care and development will remain far more personal and informal than other
kinds of social programmes.  On the other hand, there needs to be a means for
assuring that quality experiences exist for children.  At the present time
there is a great deal of tolerance when programmes fail to meet minimal
standards.  Ultimately it will be necessary to develop regulations which
recognise that family and community values vary across the range of child care
settings, and that these differences will continue to exist (OEF, 1979; Bruner,
1980; Bronfenbrenner, 1980; Clarke-Stewart, 1977).  <p>
     <p>
     5.4.2   <u>Evaluation</u>.  <p>
<p>
As with all components of a child care programme, MCH services require adequate
monitoring of children's development, growth and health so that the needed care
can be provided when growth and/or development lags. To assure that the
services are effective, evaluation systems need to be put into place within the
programme.<p>
<p>
In the majority of cases those involved in developing early childhood
programmes respond to an expressed need, bringing to the situation their
knowledge and experience, and the programme either succeeds or fails, or lies
somewhere along that continuum.  But frequently programme developers are not
able to step back from their day-to-day actions and responsibilities in order
to understand what is happening in the process.  Thus, regardless of the
outcome, they are not able to look at what happened along the way.  <p>
<p>
In order to assess the impact of a programme and to understand what has and has
not worked within the programme, evaluation should be built into the effort
from the beginning. Programme evaluation takes two forms.  <b>Formative</b>
evaluation is a way to monitor on-going activities, the process of putting the
programme into place.  By looking at what happens along the way it is possible
to see areas where the programme needs to be improved. Documentation of
day-to-day activities and the development and use of simple monitoring
instruments can be invaluable in collecting formative evaluation data.  A
formative evaluation is particulary important as the project is getting
started.  It will provide information on whether or not appropriate procedures
are being used to introduce programme components.<p>
<p>
The second kind of evaluation focuses more on programme impact.
<b>Summative</b> evaluation provides an assessment of whether or not programme
goals are being met.  In order to provide the most useful information,
summative evaluations should include an assessment of what children and
families looked like before the programme began, perhaps provide an assessment
of progress at some mid-point in the programme and then assess the impact of
the programme when the child leaves the child care setting. Summative
evaluation is frequently more formal than the formative evaluation and may
include people from outside the programme.<p>
<p>
Both of these aspects of evaluation are important in a situation where an
attempt is made to add or upgrade programme components.  And they must both be
designed in relation to programme goals.  For example, if the programme is
seeking to have an impact on health in the family, then there need to be ways
of assessing if there are changes in the family's health.  If the programme
seeks to increase children's knowledge in relation to specific health content,
then there needs to be a way to test that knowledge.  <p>
<p>
Evaluation activities can be built into and be an integral part of programme
activities.  For example, one of the concerns in most programmes is the
physical growth and psychosocial development of the child.  Growth charts such
as those described in the section on materials have been developed in a variety
of cultures that allow children's growth to be followed periodically.  This
evaluation tool can be administered by staff within the child care programme,
and it can be used with parents. <p>
There is good evidence to support the fact that it is relatively easy for
experienced mothers to make rough and usable estimates of whether a child is
severely or only mildly retarded, normal or in advance of his/her peers in
specific, broad areas of functioning such as language, socialization and
general comprehension.  Even health and physical growth can be monitored
effectively by frequent observations.  While the anecdotal observations are
important, the more formal, but simple, growth charts which monitor growth,
development and the health of the child provide information both on the child's
progress and the effectiveness of the child care programme.  Thus if one of the
programme goals is to increase the mother's awareness of her child's growth and
development, then using the growth chart with her, or teaching her how to use
it, achieves the goal of increasing her understanding of growth and development
as well as provides a way to evaluate the child's progress. (Donohue-Colletta,
1992)  <p>
<p>
Another approach to the evaluation of programme outcomes has been taken by the
Consultative Group on Early Childhood Care and Development, working with
researchers in developing countries to develop two sets of instruments within a
given country.  One is a <i>Child Readiness Profile</i> and the other is a
<i>School Readiness Profile</i>.<p>
<p>
The impetus for this approach came from two concerns.  First, there are
continuing questions about the effectiveness of various child care programmes.
Thus there is a need for outcome measures that will indicate the relationship
between children's participation in child care programmes and their growth and
development.  The second concern comes from those who believe high dropout and
repeater rates in primary school are the result of children not being "ready"
to learn when they enter primary school.  To respond to these concerns a
readiness profile will be developed that provides a picture of the child's
nutritional status, health status, pre-literacy and pre-numeracy skills, social
relations skills, self-esteem and family knowledge, expectations and support.<p>
<p>
As noted, a complementary profile is being developed for schools.  All the
blame for school failure cannot be put on children and their families.  Schools
also bear part of the responsibility.  Thus, it is equally important to have a
measure of how well the school is doing.  The variables in the School Readiness
Profile include: availability and access; quality of schooling, adjustments by
schools to local conditions, and teacher expectations.<p>
<p>
In sum, monitoring and evaluation activities are important to assess the
effectiveness of a child care programme.  There are two points in time when an
evaluation of the effort is important in relation to the introduction of MCH
components.  First, it is important to know if the current system of provision
is effective (i.e. would be MCH components be introduced into an already
effective set of services?)  If current provision is not meeting its
objectives, then the inputs required from the health sector would necessarily
involve improving the quality of the total programme in addition to introducing
MCH components.  If the system is effective and MCH components are introduced,
a second evaluation point would be to determine the extent to which MCH
components have been introduced successfully. <p>
<p>
As noted, the inputs required from the health sector would differ depending on
the services currently being provided. One of the inputs is financial.  The
financial requirements necessary for the development and expansion of child
care systems needs to be understood before the health sector becomes involved
in working with these systems.  The costing of alternative approaches to child
care is discussed in the next section.<p>
<p>
<b>6.  Costing of Alternative Approaches</b><p>
<p>
Despite growing concern about costs, they are frequently addressed in the final
rather the initial stages of planning.  Costs should be addressed early in the
process of creating a programme and costing should be an integral part of
project development.  Financial requirements are a key variable in assessing
the feasibility of integrating MCH components effectively into child care
systems. <p>
<p>
This section focuses on how to define the costs of a programme, develop a
budget, and determine resource requirements in relation to programme benefits
and effectiveness.  A clear definition of the costs can lead to pragmatic
standards for judgments about whether to begin a project and whether or not to
expand or replicate a programme.  A knowledge of the relationship between costs
and programme outcome can aid in planning and improving the use of resources.
Before looking at the relationship between these two, it is useful to define
more specifically the costs of early childhood programmes.<p>
<p>
6.1.  <u>The Costs Associated with Child Care Programmes</u>. 
<p>
     <p>
Costs go beyond the actual expenditures of a programme.  They include in-kind
contributions and human resources donated to the effort as well as the monetary
input.  When costing a given programme, different people can come up with
widely variant results, depending on which of these variables they choose to
include in their calculations.  For example, a funding agency may be concerned
only with how much it needs to contribute to make the effort successful.  In
another instance, someone might be trying to illustrate how important the
community's contribution is to the programme, so in-kind contribution are
included.  A third individual, trying to estimate what it would cost to
replicate the effort on a large scale, could well be concerned about costing
all the elements. Thus, the reasons for collecting the data will determine what
is actually costed.  This, in turn, will make a difference in the costs of the
programme per beneficiary.<p>
<p>
Generally those items that require actual payment (salaries, equipment,
supplies, materials, transportation, etc.) are included in any costing.
However, frequently the in-kind or voluntary contributions are not costed.
Many early childhood programmes rely heavily on community contributions in the
form of donations of land and/or a building for the programme, voluntary labour
in building classrooms, providing food and cooking the meals for children, and
sometimes even the volunteering of a caregiver's time.  When these programmes
are costed, the contribution of the community may or may not be valued in
monetary terms.  The extent to which these variables are taken into
consideration are important in determining the real costs of the effort.  And
while the costs of the community's contribution might not be important in terms
of the day-to-day operation of the programme as it stands, there are
implications <p>
when the programme is being considered for expansion.<p>
<p>
In addition to whether or not community input is costed, there are several
dimensions that have a major impact on the budget.  These include the phase of
project development, the type of facility being used for the programme, and
staffing.  Each of these is described more fully.<p>
<p>
     6.1.1  <u>Phases in programme development</u><p>
<p>
Costs vary depending on when they are assessed during the life of the
programme.  For example, during a pilot phase there are expenses that will not
be present once the programme has been put into place.  As the project is being
developed there is the cost of establishing and furnishing the centre.  There
may be expenses associated with pre-service training that later will be
converted to a budget allocation for continuing in-service training.  There is
likely to be technical assistance provided in the early years that is
discontinued once those implementing the programme are well trained.  And there
are likely to be high monitoring and evaluation costs as the project gets
underway.  <p>
<p>
When pilot projects are developed there is frequently considerable investment
in evaluation, sometimes nearly equivalent to the entire budget for the
project.  This may be necessary when a new idea is being tested, as it is
important to be able to closely monitor project development and make
appropriate corrective actions.  However, this type of evaluation is not
necessary as the programme becomes regularised.  From among the instruments and
techniques used in evaluation of the pilot project, it will be possible to
identify those that yielded the most useful data.  Only these should be
included as part of the on-going programme.  This will greatly reduce
evaluation costs.  <p>
<p>
The expense of on-going evaluation activities should not be such that it limits
programme expansion and discourages governments from adopting the programme on
a larger scale.  The evaluation component of on-going programmes should
represent about 10% of the total budget. <p>
<p>
Thus, in analysing costs it is important to define where the project is in its
development.  This will help differentiate between the costs associated with
start-up and those that will be incurred as the project continues over time.
<p>
<p>
     6.1.2.  <u>Programme setting</u>.  <p>
<p>
As has been noted, there are programmes that have been developed by the
community where the community has provided the space, in some instances a
purpose-built child care centre.  In other instances, the programme operates in
make-shift settings.  While child care in purpose-built settings may be more or
less adequate in terms of meeting criteria of safety and promotion of healthy
practices, there are many settings where it would take considerable input from
the health sector to upgrade the centre to reach even minimal standards.<p>
<p>
<p>
     6.1.3.  <u>Staff credentials have cost implications</u>.  <p>
<p>
In general, there are three levels of staff: professional,
paid-paraprofessional and volunteer para-professional.  The use of staff at
these three different levels has implications for costs, both in terms of
paying the individual, and in terms of training.  While the salary of a
professional caregiver is higher than that for para-professionals, they are not
necessarily more costly to the programme.  There are trade-offs in terms of
training.  A professional will have had basic training in child care, including
health, nutrition and child development.  Thus, in order for them to implement
the MCH components, it may require very little in terms of additional training
and on-going support to make them competent child care providers.  Also, if the
conditions of work are favourable and they are receiving a reasonable salary
relative to others in the community, they are likely to continue their work
with the programme.<p>
<p>
Having para-professional staff is quite different.  On the surface it might
appear that it is less costly to staff a programme with para-professionals.
While their pay may be low, or non-existent, they are also likely to be
untrained.  Thus the costs of providing them with adequate training so that
they can implement a child care programme may be proportionately much higher
than in a programme where the staff are professionals.  Further, they will
require more intensive on-going support.  If they are receiving little of no
pay, they are likely to leave if other opportunities are available.  This
results in a high turnover rate, which means that there would be a need to
constantly have a pre-service training programme available.<p>
<p>
The phase of programme development, the nature of the facilities and staffing
are but three of the programme variables that have an impact on the budget.
However, since they are likely to contribute heavily to the costs of the
programme, they have been highlighted.  In order to consider all the costs of a
programme, what follows is a brief discussion of the full range of components
that need to be included in constructing a budget for a child care programme.
<p>
<p>
6.2. <u>Constructing a Budget.
</u>
<p>
<p>
It is important to realise that while there are some fairly standard categories
to be taken into consideration when constructing the costs of a programme,
there is no formula for determining what proportion of the costs should go to
personnel, what proportion to the facility, what proportion to management, etc.
While all the same categories of costs need to be considered for each
programme, their relationship to one another will be determined by the setting.
For example, in a village without electricity and running water, where the
centre is a make-shift building, the maintenance costs are minimal.  However,
there might be very high costs in terms of obtaining food for the children in
the programme because it has to be brought in from outside the community.  On
the other hand, a facility in an urban area may have high costs for maintenance
(electricity, heat, water, custodial service, etc.) relative to the costs of
feeding the children in the centre.  Thus, when considering the costs to
programmes of introducing MCH components and materials, it must be recognised
that in some instances the introduction of the various technologies may
represent a very large additional cost to programmes in some settings, while
being easily integrated into current budgets for other programmes.<p>
<p>
In constructing the budget for a programme the following are categories which
need to be taken into consideration:<p>
<p>
     6.2.1.  <u>Capital costs</u>.  <p>
<p>
These are all the costs associated with the physical center.  There may be
costs for land, the building, and perhaps the costs of a vehicle and basic
equipment for office support and for the centre itself.  These costs are
necessarily high as the programme is being established.  They should be
relatively low as the programme becomes fully operational, but they must be
considered once again if there are plans to expand the programme to additional
settings.<p>
<p>
     6.2.2.  <u>Personnel</u>.  <p>
<p>
These are the costs associated with the people that will be involved in the
effort, from the Director of the project, to Supervisors/Trainers, to the
actual caregivers and those who work directly with parents, to auxiliary staff
who provide support either on a full or part-time basis.  In a pilot project,
as the programme is being developed and people are being trained, the ratio
between staff and children may be quite high.  Once in place, however, the
programme may be able to serve a larger number of children and their families
with the same number of staff.  As the programme is being costed for expansion,
it is possible to look for economies of scale.    <p>
<p>
     6.2.3.  <u>Operations and supplies</u>.  <p>
<p>
This category includes all the things that have to be continually supplied to
or purchased by the programme.  It includes the educational materials that are
used with the children and with parents, food that needs to be purchased for
the nutritional aspect of the programme, office supplies, and all the recurrent
maintenance costs that allow the programme to function (electricity, telephone,
transportation for teachers, vehicle maintenance costs).  It also includes the
special services that may be need to be purchased, such as the costs to the
programme for immunizations, or the hiring of a bus to transport children.<p>
<p>
     6.2.4.  <u>Human resource development</u>.  <p>
<p>
Included in this category are all the activities that are undertaken to
strengthen personnel within the programme.  The primary activity in this
category is training.  The costs of training will depend on: the credentials of
those currently employed, the nature of the training required, the type of
agency providing the training, the training plan (the allocation of time to
pre- and in-service training and who is responsible), and the kind of on-going
support which is necessary. <p>
<p>
Also included in this category are the costs of consultants who are brought in
to help up-grade the effort, either on a one-time basis or periodically.  Over
time there may also be costs associated with sending staff for more specialised
training (e.g. sending a caregiver to a short course so that she can be
upgraded to a Supervisor as the programme develops, providing management
training to administrative personnel who will be required to manage a larger
system as the programme expands).<p>
     6.2.5.  <u>Monitoring and evaluation</u>.<p>
<p>
There are costs associated with the monitoring and evaluation of the project.
These may include the costs of hiring an evaluation group or personnel who are
not normally employed by the project, or it may mean providing an increment in
pay to current staff if they take on increased responsibility in relation to an
evaluation.  Also in this category are the costs of developing instruments to
be used in evaluation, data analysis, documentation, and report writing.  <p>
<p>
Each of these costs needs to be calculated for three distinct phases in a
programme: for the pilot phase, for project implementation and then for
expansion.  It will also be necessary to relate each of these costs to funders.
If the cost is to be covered in the pilot and implementation phase by the
community, it cannot be assumed that these same aspects of the programme will
be provided by the community where the programme is to be introduced.  It may
well be that as the programme is transferred these elements will have to be
included in the budget, particularly if the programme is being introduced into
a poorer community.  These costs must be anticipated.<p>
<p>
Costs do not exist in a vacuum.  The costs of a programme cannot be evaluated
in isolation of the benefits or outcomes.  As there is great variance in terms
of the costs associated with different kinds of child care programmes, there
are also differences to be considered when assessing the benefits of these
efforts.<p>
<p>
<p>
6.3.  <u>Outcomes/Benefits</u>  
<p>
<p>
Economists and planners are increasingly concerned about making wise
investments.  This is judged by calculating what is accomplished as a result of
putting money into a programme.  In order to assess the benefits, the goals of
the programme have to be clear.  For example if the effort is designed to
provide a specific service (e.g. immunization) for children in a given age
group then it is fairly easy to measure the outcome.  It is simply a matter of
tabulating what percentage of the children are now immunized and comparing that
with the percentage immunized before the project.  The cost of each
immunization, can, in fact be calculated.  There is a clear direct relationship
between costs and benefits.  However, if an organisation is involved in the
implementation of an integrated programme of care for young children and their
families, then the outcomes are much more elusive.  They are harder to define
in terms of specifics and they are difficult to measure.  <p>
<p>
But the difficulty of measuring the benefits is only one of the problems in
terms of defining programme outcomes.  Another problem is that it is often
difficult to recognise the full benefits of a programme.  Even when programme
goals might be limited to having a positive impact on the child's success in
school, there are frequently spill-over benefits to the family that will
probably go undocumented and perhaps unnoticed. For example, through parent
education groups a mother may gain enough self-confidence that she decides to
get additional training and seek a better job. <p>
<p>
It is even more difficult to determine benefits in programmes that have broad
community development goals.  The quality of life in a village may be changed
as a result of an initial investment in an early childhood programme.  And
while those operating a community-based child care initiative would like to
think that their programme provided the impetus for upgrading the life of
people in the village, it is hard to ascribe changes in the village (such as
the addition of a water pump, the establishment of a part-time health clinic,
for example) to the investment in the child care.  The relationship between the
costs and the benefits is much less clear than in a single-focused programme.
<p>
<p>
In addition to the spill-over effects of programmes while they  are operating,
there are sometimes long-term benefits that are unanticipated and therefore not
included in an assessment of outcomes.  One of the most noteworthy longitudinal
studies on the impact of early childhood education found that over time the
impact of a preschool experience could be measured in terms of adult
behaviours.  Those with preschool were more likely to complete high school,
they were less likely to be delinquent, they got better jobs and were able to
stay off welfare. (Berruta-Clement, J.R. et al, 1984).   These benefits were
not anticipated when the programme was initially evaluated and costed.  <p>
<p>
Thus before determining the outcomes or benefits received in relation to the
amount of money invested, those involved in making the calculation have to
agree on what is going to be included in the costing of the project and how
benefits will be defined.  As noted, this calculation may not be of much
interest to those involved in the programme, but when the programme is being
considered for expansion, these calculations are important.  <p>
<p>
<b>7.     The Way Forward</b><p>
Because of its commitment to meeting the basic health needs of all by the year
2000, the World Health Organization is seeking ways to have a widespread impact
as effectively and efficiently as possible.  In considering where the health
sector should invest its resources one of the questions is, where it is
cost-effective to do so?  <p>

In recent years there have been several significant shifts in the way young
children have been viewed by health care professionals.  There has been a shift
from a focus simply on child survival to a concern for overall development,
accompanied by a shift from looking only at the child to a focus on the family
and the context within which the child is living.  There has also been a shift
from a medical to a social science model of health, accompanied by a shift from
treatment to concern about prevention.  These shifts have led to increasing
concern about how to create multi-disciplinary programmes for children and
their families.  This document argues that one alternative is to invest in the
integration of primary health care components into early childhood programmes.
<p>
<p>
The research on the relationship between early childhood experiences and later
growth and development provides a persuasive argument in support of developing
quality child care programmes.  Evaluation of programme experiences in a wide
variety of settings, under less than optimal conditions, also suggests the
power of early childhood programmes.  <p>
There is a considerable body of early childhood programming experience.  This
experience comes from rural and urban areas, from developing and developed
countries, from the health, education and social services sectors, and from
informal community-based initiatives to the more formal pre-schools. Some of
these efforts have provided integrated services, including  health, education,
growth and development concerns. <p>
<p>
While there is interesting research currently being conducted that will provide
additional insights into the way to work most effectively with children and
their families, there is enough known about the impact of early experiences on
later development that it is possible to move forward in terms of actually
developing curricula, materials, and training strategies to increase the
delivery of MCH components through early childhood programmes.  Given what is
known, guidelines and materials for implementing health activities within child
care settings can be developed and tested.<p>
<p>
The health sector is in a position to spearhead the promotion and
implementation of child care programmes as part of an integrated primary health
care approach.  While these programmes would need education and social sector
support, the lead needs to be taken by the health sector.  The challenge for
the health sector is to develop strategies for expanding their conception of
health services to include a broad range of developmentally and contextually
appropriate health activities. <p>
