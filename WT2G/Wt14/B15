</table><h1>AAA Recommends Tips for Worry-Free International Travel</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., July 15, 1996 -- A record 9 million Americans are expected to
travel to Europe this year, with nearly 5 million people traveling during the
summer, according to the American Automobile Association.
<p>
"For many travelers, this may be their first experience in a foreign
country," said Jack Mannix, managing director, AAA Travel Related Services.
"Because of the differences in language, currency and surroundings, it's
helpful to make the reservations through an experienced travel agent."  
<p>
Once the arrangements have been made, AAA recommends the following tips for
hassle-free international travel:
<p>
BEFORE DEPARTURE
Review your insurance policies to determine coverage for trip cancellation or
interruption, loss or theft, and accident or injury while traveling overseas.
If appropriate, purchase additional coverage.
<p>
Leave copies of your passport identification page, credit card account
numbers, travelers check numbers, airline ticket numbers and trip itinerary
with a friend or relative who is accessible by telephone.  Travel with a copy
of all the information, plus a set of spare passport photos.
<p>
Purchase an International Driving Permit if you'll be driving in a country
where English is not the primary language spoken.  Even if you won't be
driving, an IDP is an excellent form of identification.  IDPs are available
for purchase at your local AAA office.
<p>
Obtain travelers checks instead of carrying large amounts of cash.  AAA
members can obtain no-fee American Express Travelers Cheques at any of AAA's
1,000 offices in the United States and Canada.
<p>
Put all necessary medications in their original containers and pack in your
carry-on bag.  Verify that your medications do not violate foreign drug laws.
Ask your doctor if international certificates of vaccination are required at
your destination.
<p>
Reconfirm your flight with the airline 48 hours prior to departure.
<p>
Arrive at the airport two hours prior to departure.  International travelers
must check in at the ticket counter where proper identification will be
requested, including a passport depending on the destination.
<p>
UPON ARRIVAL
Be alert at all times.  Keep your distance from luggage or packages left
unattended at airports and other public places.
<p>
Use an authorized money exchange outlet to purchase enough local currency to
pay for arrival expenses, such as taxis and tips. Most airports have 24-hour
currency exchange windows.
<p>
Use authorized airport and hotel taxis.  Avoid those that pick up additional
persons en route.  Only travel in a taxi with a meter.
<p>
AT THE HOTEL
Check-in time is usually 3 p.m.  After a long flight, you may want to reserve
the room for the night before.  Alert the hotel to your arrival time.
<p>
Check with the hotel staff whether or not debit cards are needed for use with
public telephones.
<p>
Unless you need them during the day, leave your passport, airline ticket and
other valuables in the hotel safe.  There may be a small fee, but it is worth
the cost.
<p>
Before exchanging large sums of money at your destination, compare exchange
rates and service fees with the hotel cashier, bank and local foreign
exchange office.
<p>
IN THE CITY
Travel with a detailed map and prominently mark your hotel, embassy and
police station.  Carry a piece of hotel stationery with you -- it comes in
handy when communicating with local taxi drivers.
<p>
Wear a money belt or neck purse under your clothing.  If a handbag is
necessary, place the shoulder strap over your head and hold it in front.
<p>
Be cautious of street vendors and attention-gathering distractions.  While
your focus is diverted, a second person may try to steal your belongings.
<p>
Travel with a good phrase book or international translator to aid in
communicating.
If your passport is lost or stolen, notify the local police immediately.
Bring the police report, identification and spare passport photos to the
nearest U.S. Embassy for replacement.  If your credit cards or travelers
checks are lost or stolen, contact the issuing company immediately.
<p>
Take along an inexpensive nylon duffel bag for your purchases and keep them
all in one bag for ease in going through customs.  Keep all receipts
together.

</table><h1>July 4th Holiday to Spark  Strong Travel  Volume, says AAA</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., June 25, 1996 -- This Fourth of July period is expected to
generate the highest number of travelers for that holiday in eight years as
35.7 million Americans plan to take a trip of 100 miles, according to the
American Automobile Association.
<p>
AAA's holiday projections are up 2 percent from last year and are the highest
since 1988 when 36 million people traveled over the Independence Day period.
<p>
This July 4th, an estimated 30.3 million Americans are expected to travel by
auto, truck or recreational vehicle, a 1 percent increase over the 30 million
who drove last year.  Another 5.4 million will travel by airplane, train or
bus -- up 8 percent from 5 million in 1995.
<p>
AAA's June Fuel Gauge Survey, which showed an average $1.303 per gallon for
self-serve regular unleaded, is up 7.5 cents from a year ago.  The increase
amounts to 30 cents more for gasoline on a 100-mile trip, compared to a year
ago.
<p>
The greatest number of auto travelers will originate in the Southeast, with
7.8 million, followed by the Northeast, with 6.5 million; Great Lakes, 5.8
million; West, 5.5 million; and Midwest, 4.7 million.
<p>
The most popular Independence Day auto travel destinations will be cities and
towns, both with 24 percent of the total travel volume.  Other destinations
include: ocean or beach, 18 percent; lake, 12 percent; mountain area, 8
percent; theme/amusement park, 6 percent; state or national park, 3 percent;
other or undecided, 5 percent.
<p>
Of those spending at least one night at their destination, 35 percent will
stay at a hotel or motel and another 35 percent will stay with friends or
relatives.  Other overnight accommodations include:  cabin, condo or vacation
home, 14 percent; camper, trailer RV or tent, 8 percent; and other, 2
percent.  Six percent are undecided or aren't staying overnight.
<p>
Research data for the Fourth of July holiday are based on a national
telephone survey of 1,500 adults by the Travel Industry Association of
America, which conducts special research for AAA.

</table><h1>AAA and DeLorme Join Forces to Create New Travel Software</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., June 19, 1996 -- The American Automobile Association, a
leading provider of comprehensive travel information, and DeLorme, a leader
in mapmaking and mapping software, have joined forces to create AAA
Map'n'Go(R) -- a powerful new travel and mapping tool scheduled for release
in late June.
<p>
Setting a new standard in travel planning technology, AAA Map'n'Go is the
first consumer software that links to the Internet to provide users with
updated travel information, and the first to offer the AAA TourBook(R)
database of more than 57,000 accommodations, restaurants, campgrounds and
points of interest.  Other groundbreaking features include:
<p>
1,000,000 miles of routable roads and maps for the United States, Canada,
Mexico and the Caribbean;
The ability to search for specific street addresses;
Detailed, street-level maps for 241 metropolitan areas;
The ability to link with GPS receivers;
The ability to choose from four different print options;
A directory of AAA's 1,000 offices in the US and Canada;
Improved routing capabilities, including scenic trip routing;
The ability to customize the maps with annotations and symbols.
<p>
"AAA's database is one of the largest in the world," says Graeme Clarke,
senior vice president, AAA Products and Services.  "When you combine it with
the expertise of DeLorme, the result is an unmatched experience in travel
planning."
<p>
"AAA Map'n'Go will revolutionize the way people plan trips, either for
business or pleasure," says David DeLorme, president of DeLorme.  "With its
AAA TourBook data and links to the Internet, GPS receivers and Phone Search
USA 2.0, AAA Map'n'Go will be 'must-have' software for any computer user."
<p>
Users who have access to the Internet, either through an on-line service or
Internet service provider, will be able to link DeLorme's new web site,
www.mapngo.com, to obtain updated weather conditions for the entire US, road
construction information for the US and Canada, and special event information
for all of North America.  Once downloaded from the web site, the information
will appear as overlays on the AAA Map'n'Go maps.
<p>
First released in 1994, DeLorme's Map'n'Go was the first comprehensive CD-ROM
travel planner for all of North America.  In 1995, it won a CODIE Award (the
computer industry's "Oscar") for Best New Use of a Computer.  With all of its
new features, AAA Map'n'Go is a greatly enhanced version of the original
product.
<p>
AAA Map'n'Go is available for Windows on one CD-ROM and will be released at
an estimated street price of $39.  It will be available at computer and
specialty retailers throughout the US and Canada, participating AAA travel
offices, direct from DeLorme at 1-800-452-5931 or from the DeLorme web site
at www.delorme.com.
<p>
AAA is a not-for-profit federation of 106 motor clubs providing its 39
million members in the US and Canada with comprehensive travel, insurance,
financial and auto-related services.
<p>
DeLorme is America's leading mapping software publisher, serving the
consumer, business, education and government markets.  In addition to AAA
Map'n'Go, DeLorme CD-ROM titles include Street Atlas USA(R) 3.0, Phone Search
USA, MapExpert(R) and Global Explorer(R).

</table><h1>Lodging and Meal Costs Unchanged for 1996, AAA Says</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., May 23, 1996 -- For only the third time in 46 years, the
average cost of lodging and meals has not increased from the previous year,
according to the American Automobile Association.
<p>
AAA's annual vacation cost survey shows that a family of two adults and two
children can expect to pay an average of $193 per day for food and lodging,
the same amount as last year.  Lodging rates will average $92 per night, down
$1 from a year ago, and meals will cost $101, up $1.
<p>
The last time hotel and restaurant costs were unchanged was in 1994.  They
decreased slightly in 1961.
<p>
The least expensive vacations in the United States are in North Dakota, where
food and lodging will cost a family an average of $142 per day. The most
expensive is Hawaii at $383 per day.
<p>
The lowest priced accommodations are in North Dakota at $64, followed by
Nebraska and Kansas at $65 per night. The most expensive average price for
lodgings is in Hawaii at $246 per night for two adults and two children,
followed by Delaware, $181, and Alaska, $117.
<p>
The lowest average family meal costs are in South Dakota at $76 per day,
followed by North Dakota, $78, and Nebraska, $80.  The highest meal costs are
in Hawaii at $137 per day, followed by New York, $136, and Delaware, $131.
<p>
To plan a complete vacation budget, travelers also need to allow money for
transportation, entertainment and other expenses, AAA advised.
<p>
The vacation cost estimates are based on meal prices and room rates for
restaurants and lodgings listed in AAA's TourBooks(R).

</table><h1>Gas Prices Won't Stall Memorial Day Travelers, Says AAA</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., May 16, 1996 -- The Memorial Day weekend will kick off a
strong summer travel season as a record 30.4 million Americans plan to travel
100 miles or more from home this holiday -- up from last year's 30 million
travelers, according to the American Automobile Association.
<p>
"Although the recent run-up in gas prices may seem high as we enter the peak
vacation season, vacationers are paying less than a dollar more for gas than
they did last Memorial Day for a 200-mile trip," said Graeme Clarke, senior
vice president of AAA Products & Services.
<p>
For example, a 101-mile trip from Philadelphia to New York would cost only 45
cents more this year compared to last Memorial Day.  Travelers can expect to
pay only about $1.22 more if headed from Los Angeles to Las Vegas, a 274-mile
getaway.
<p>
AAA estimates 26.7 million Americans will travel this holiday by auto, light
truck or recreational vehicle, up 1 percent from last year's high of 26.4
million travelers.
<p>
Another 3.7 million will travel by airplane, train or bus, up nearly 3
percent from the 3.6 million in 1995.
<p>
The greatest number of Memorial Day auto travelers will originate in the West
with 7.6 million, followed by the Great Lakes with 5.2 million; Midwest, 4.9
million; Southeast, 4.8 million; and Northeast, 4.2 million.
<p>
Ocean and beaches will be the most popular Memorial Day auto  destinations
with an expected 25 percent of the travel volume, followed by cities and
town/rural area, both 23 percent; mountain and lake, both 8 percent;
state/national parks, 6 percent; theme/amusement park, 4 percent; and other,
2 percent.  One percent are undecided.
<p>
Hotel or motel will be the accommodation-of-choice for 43 percent of the
Memorial Day auto travelers.  Twenty-eight percent will stay overnight with
relatives or friends, followed by 9 percent, camper/trailer/RV/or tent.
Other overnight plans include:  cabin/condo/vacation home, 7 percent;
boat/ship, 3 percent; bed & breakfast, 1 percent; other or undecided, 6
percent.  Three percent do not plan to stay overnight.
<p>
Research data for Memorial Day are based on a national telephone survey of
1,500 adults by the Travel Industry Association of America, which conducts
special research for AAA.

</table><h1>AAA Offers Travel and Road Information on America Online</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla.,  May 13, 1996 -- AAA has begun offering travel, automotive,
insurance and traffic safety information through America Online's Travel
Channel as part of a six-month test, according to the American Automobile
Association.
<p>
"During its 94-year history, AAA has earned a reputation as the advocate of
the traveler," said Allan Plank, director of AAA Electronic Publishing.
"Through AOL, AAA is continuing this tradition by expanding member access not
only to travel information but many other AAA products and services.  In
addition, nonmembers now have a chance to sample what AAA has to offer."
<p>
AAA Online offers information on travel and tour packages, discounts,
vehicle-related financial services, a nationwide calendar of events, and
lists strict enforcement areas and construction hotspots.  Visitors to the
site also can browse articles and brochures with automotive, flying, cruise
and other travel tips.
<p>
In addition to information available to all users of AOL, there are areas
available only to AAA members who belong to one of four clubs participating
in this test.  These clubs are:  Automobile Club of Southern California, AAA
Missouri, AAA Washington and the New Jersey Automobile Club.  Members of
these four AAA clubs can access AAA TourBook (R) information on
accommodations and attractions, and request Triptik (R) routings.  Based on
the results of the test, the service may be made available to other AAA
members who use AOL.
<p>
AOL members can reach the AAA site by selecting "Go To" and typing AAA as the
keyword.  Or they can click on the Travel button and choose AAA Online.
<p>
The AOL test is part of a larger objective to enhance the AAA member
experience.  Up-coming initiatives include the CD-ROM Map 'n Go scheduled for
release in June, and AAA's home page on the World Wide Web.

</table><h1>Traveling Motorists Need to Know Local Laws</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., April 26, 1996 -- Are radar detectors legal?  When do you have
to turn on your headlights?  Can you wear a radio headset while driving?  The
answers vary from state to state and can confuse traveling motorists,
according to the American Automobile Association.
<p>
To help travelers comply with local rules of the road, AAA publishes the
Digest of Motor Laws --a comprehensive description of the laws that govern
motor vehicle operation in the United States and Canada.
<p>
The Digest of Motor Laws covers a wide range of regulations, from bare-foot
driving -- permitted in every state -- to open containers of alcohol
--prohibited in 28 states.
<p>
"While many basic rules are constant, there are important differences in
state traffic regulations," said Charles Butler, director of AAA Driver
Safety Services.  "Knowledge of those differences is required for safe
travel."
<p>
Some of the regulations that differ between states include the following: 49
states allow radar detectors to be used in passenger cars. 18 statesrequire
headlights to be used when wipers are in use or under specific atmospheric
condition such as rain, snow or fog, regardless of visibility. 15 states
prohibit drivers from wearing radio headsets. 18 states place restrictions on
passengers riding in the back of pickup trucks. 30 states have specific
restrictions on the use of hazard lights.
<p>
Information for the AAA Digest is submitted by local and state jurisdictions
and organized by states, territories and Canadian provinces.
<p>
To obtain a copy of the 1996 Digest of Motor Laws, contact your local AAA
club or the traffic safety department of AAA's national office at 1000 AAA
Drive, Heathrow, FL  32746-5063.  The glove-compartment-size book retails for
$8.95. AAA is a not-for-profit federation of 112 motor clubs with more than
1,000 offices providing nearly 39 million members in the U.S. and Canada with
travel, insurance, financial and auto-related services.

</table><h1>'Show Your Card' Program Saved Members $80 Million in 1995</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., March 26, 1996  -- AAA members saved more than $80 million in
products and services through the association's Show Your Card & Save
program in 1995, up 60 percent from $50 million in 1994, the American
Automobile Association reported today.
<p>
AAA members also had more locations to choose from last year as the number of
licensed Show Your Card & Save outlets in the United States and  Canada
reached 20,000 -- a 25 percent increase from the program's  inception in
December 1993.
<p>
"Currently, we're exploring several retail opportunities that AAA  members
may use on an even more frequent basis -- perhaps with a national  dining
chain," said Tom Wilt, director, AAA Market Development.
<p>
New to AAA's Show Your Card & Save lineup in 1996 are Busch  Entertainment --
including Sea World and Busch Gardens -- and Amtrak.
<p>
Other national companies offering AAA members reduced rates through  Show
Your Card & Save include:  Aloha Airlines, Choice Hotels,  Club  Nautico,
Days Inn, Hertz, Hilton, Hyatt, Host Marriott Travel Plazas,  LaQuinta,
Pearle Vision, Ryder, Six Flags and Universal Studios.
<p>
AAA members also save when they show their membership cards to participating
neighborhood merchants, including jewelers, tire stores,  photo processing
and local attractions.
<p>
"AAA advises members to look for the Show Your Card & Save logo when they
shop or ask merchants if they offer AAA members a discount," said  Wilt.
<p>
Members also can contact their local AAA club for the names of participating
area or national merchants.

</table><h1>AAA Members Get Full Refund Up to Time of Departure</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla., Feb. 21, 1996 -- AAA's national advertising theme, "Travel
With Someone You TrustSM," has taken on new meaning for the American
Automobile Association's 38 million members, thanks to an enhancement in its
newest travel product, AAA Vacations.
<p>
AAA's private-label vacation package, operated jointly by AAA and Certified
Vacations, now provides an automatic trip cancellation guarantee to AAA
members booking Florida, Nevada or California travel packages through any of
AAA's nearly 1,000 travel agency offices.
<p>
AAA members may cancel their vacation for any reason, up to the time of
departure and receive a full refund.
<p>
"By focusing on issues such as quality and consumer protection, AAA Vacations
is providing a unique and exclusive feature that meets the needs of our
members," said Nancy Fox, director of AAA Vacations.
<p>
"For less than the average cost of travel cancellation insurance, nonmembers
can join AAA and qualify for this enhanced protection, plus enjoy all the
other AAA benefits -- travel, financial,
insurance and auto-related services," Fox said.
<p>
In addition to the trip cancellation waiver, AAA members can take advantage
of special winter sale prices on packages to selected Florida, Nevada and
California destinations when booked by April 15 through a AAA travel agency.
<p>
During the sale, a package featuring air service from Philadelphia to
Orlando, is priced at $499 for  the Days Inn Civic Center, or $609 for the
Residence Inn by Marriott, compared to regular package prices of $539 and
$649, respectively.   Rates are per person, double occupancy.
<p>
Sample packages include four hotel nights, four-day compact car rental from
Hertz, midweek round-trip airfare on USAir, and a four-day Walt Disney World
Hopper Pass.  Additional gateways and hotel selections are available with a
two-night minimum stay.
<p>
Reservations must be made by April 15 to take advantage of the winter sale
prices.
<p>
For more information, contact the local AAA travel agency.

</table><h1>Cruising -- Why It is the Perfect Vacation</h1></center>
<p>
A cruise is the ultimate vacation, yet it doesn't require an ultimate income.
In fact, making the switch from a land to a sea holiday could save you a
bundle of money, according to the American Automobile Association.
<p>
A proliferation of new ships, new itineraries and fierce competition means
good deals on cruises are available now. What's more, shorter cruises are
making shipboard vacations more affordable than ever.
<p>
AAA travel agents report cruise vacations have surged in popularity. Prior to
the 1960s, ships carried mostly well-to-do passengers between New York and
Europe. When jets arrived on the scene, cruising fell out of favor until
ships began calling on Caribbean ports in the 1970s. Now more popular than
ever, the number of people who have cruised is expected to reach eight
million by the year 2000.
<p>
Air/sea packages -- taking passengers from the northern United States to
cruise line ports in cities like Miami, Tampa, Los Angeles and San Juan --
now offer some of the most value-packed holidays on the market.
<p>
When shopping for vacations, travelers will hear the term "all-inclusive"
used to describe cruises. That's because the cost of a cruise includes your
accommodations, meals, recreation, entertainment, sports, baggage handling
and, often, airfare. You'll know almost to the penny how much you'll spend.
<p>
The largest single expense in the all-inclusive cost of a cruise is the
cabin. How much you pay is largely determined by the size and location of
your cabin and when you make your reservation.
<p>
Generally, cabins on the top deck are the largest and most expensive. Also,
outside cabins usually are more costly than inside cabins.
<p>
Choosing a moderately priced cabin isn't the only way to save money, however.
Bargain hunters can drive the price of a cruise down by taking advantage of
"early-bird" specials, off-season rates and other discounts. Most cruise
lines reward travelers who book early with lower rates and will guarantee
clients lower rates if they become available after reservations are made.
<p>
When cruising, you'll discover everything you've heard about lavish shipboard
meals to be true. If you're not willing to go "hog wild" on vacation, you can
select from the new, light dishes many cruise lines have added to their
menus.
<p>
Dining is more than just eating when you cruise; it's where you can socialize
as well. Although some ships' dining rooms can accommodate all passengers at
once, most ships have two seatings which differ only by time. Your travel
agent will want to know when you wish to dine -- early or late -- and how you
wish to dine -- at a table for as many as 10 passengers or a seating for two.
<p>
Once on board, you'll find additional dining options, such as continental
breakfast, poolside fare, midnight buffet, hors d'oeuvres, room service, high
tea, pizza bars and much more.
<p>
Tips, beverages, shore excursions and some personal services, such as the
beauty salon, are not included in the cost of a cruise. And, of course,
you'll probably want to do a little souvenir shopping at the gift shops on
board ship or on shore.
<p>
Shore excursions offer another dimension to the overall cruise experience.
For instance, in Mexico you can climb the pyramids of Coba for $65, in Alaska
see the Mendenhall Glacier for $35 or walk through an actual rain forest in
Dominica for $28. Some cruise lines allow the excursions to be purchased in
advance, thus ensuring your reservations on popular tours with limited
capacity.
<p>
When tipping, plan on about $3 per person, per day, for your dining room
waiter. The same goes for your cabin steward.
<p>
Bartenders and deck stewards are tipped as services are rendered. The cruise
director, as part of an advice-giving session prior to disembarking, offers
guidelines on tipping.
<p>
Cruise lines present abundant choices. A travel agent can help you compare
ships, make recommendations based on your interests and finances as well as
secure reservations, AAA said.
<p>
Your travel agent can also be your bargain hunter. An agent keeps up with the
many promotions and special rates being offered by the cruise lines at
various times throughout the year.
<p>
For a real eye-opener, compare the cost of a cruise with a resort vacation on
a per diem basis. This is the cost per person, per day. Since a cruise is
all-inclusive, simply take the rate in the brochure and, if it is a seven-day
cruise, divide by seven.
<p>
When you figure the per diem at a resort, remember to include airfare; hotel;
meals and snacks; taxi, bus, or car rental transportation; activities; and
entertainment.
<p>
Ask your travel agent to assist you with this exercise. The final figures
probably will surprise you. You'll find that, dollar for dollar, it's hard to
beat a cruise in terms of value and vacation experience.
<p>
So if you haven't already, try a holiday at sea.

</table><h1>Car Rental Tips Can Help Reduce Surprises, Says AAA</h1></center>
<p>
ORLANDO, Fla. -- If your vacation plans include a rental car, you may be in
for some surprises if you don't plan ahead, says the American Automobile
Association.
<p>
"Current issues such as mileage caps and drivers' license checks may be
confusing and even intimidating to consumers," said Tom Wilt, director, AAA
Market Development. "By doing your homework and asking the right questions at
the time of reservation, consumers can enhance their vacation experience many
times over."
<p>
Check with your travel agent or the car-rental company if mileage caps are in
effect for the location where you are renting. Some rental agencies may be
charging fees in selected markets and rates on mileage in excess of 100 miles
a day, especially for local rentals. Hertz, for instance, is imposing a cap
only on minivans.
<p>
Motor vehicle record checks can be another source of surprise to the
uninformed customer. Most of the major car-rental companies are performing
these background driving checks on renters and additional drivers in certain
states. Because the screening is done at the time of pick up -- not when the
reservation is made -- drivers should be aware that they could be denied
service at the rental counter based on the findings.
<p>
Other hassle-free car-rental tips from AAA:
<p>
-  Call your insurance agent to determine if your personal insurance policy
covers collision and liability for rental cars, and if it has limitations or
deductibles that apply.
<p>
-  Ask about rates when making your reservation and, when possible, call at
least two weeks in advance -- especially during the busy summer travel season
-- to get the best rates available. Car-rental companies usually offer
special weekly or weekend rates with advanced reservations.
<p>
-  Ask if you are entitled to membership or employee discounts or benefits.
For example, AAA members can receive up to a 20 percent discount with Hertz,
in addition to other benefits such as special upgrades, dollars-off coupons
and exemptions from certain charges.
<p>
-  Make sure to write down your confirmation number and quoted rate and bring
the information to the rental counter when picking up the car for
verification purposes.
<p>
-  If your rental is based on a weekly rate, ask what the charges will be if
you return the car in less than six days. Weekly rates usually have a minimum
time requirement.
<p>
-  When comparing rates, ask if airport fees or other charges will be
assessed on the rental.
<p>
-  Ask if other people may drive the car. Some firms charge for extra
drivers. Many companies have minimum age requirements for drivers.
<p>
-  Ask for the car-rental company's emergency road-service number, and find
out what services it provides.
<p>
-  Ask in advance about "one-way" charges if you don't plan to return the car
to the original location.
<p>
-  Ask what time the car must be returned and whether you will be charged, if
late, for a partial or full day; if early, for the full term of the rental.
<p>
-  Most car-rental firms offer several refueling choices: purchase the fuel
option at time of rental, refill the tank before returning the car or return
the car with a less than full tank of gas and pay the refueling charge. AAA's
Wilt recommends that, when possible, refill the rental car before returning
it and avoid the upfront fuel purchase or the normally expensive refueling
charge.
<p>
AAA's network of 1,000 travel offices provides a complete line of worldwide
travel agency services to its more than 37 million members and the public.

</table><h1>AAA Supports Safety-Only Mission For FAA</h1></center>
<p>
WASHINGTON, D.C., June 21, 1996 -- The American Automobile Association
supports amendment of the Federal Aviation Act to ensure the Federal Aviation
Administration pursues only one primary mission: aviation safety.
<p>
In a letter to Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena, commending him for
requesting the amendment, AAA's vice president for public & government
relations, James L. Kolstad, said, "Our 39 million members are frequent air
travelers and believe that aviation safety should be the number one concern
of the federal agency charged with oversight of the system.
<p>
"FAA's dual mission," Kolstad said, "while understandable at the time of
enactment of the Act, only contributes to a widespread belief that the FAA is
torn between the goals of aviation safety and promotion of the air transport
industry.
<p>
"While this perception may be mistaken, amending the Act to explicitly state
that safety is the FAA's single mission will erase any doubts," he said.
<p>
Also relating to aviation safety, AAA has recently launched a "Crisis Ahead"
campaign to raise public awareness of the steady deterioration of the
nation's transportation network, including its failure-prone air traffic
control system which AAA says costs the economy billions annually in flight
delays and reduces safety margins.
<p>
The AAA campaign calls on Congress to reinstate immediately the airline
passenger and cargo tax to ensure that airport-airway safety needs are met,
and to take aviation and highway trust funds off budget to assure that user
fees paid by airline passengers and motorists are not held hostage to
Washington's budget battles.

</table><h1>National Scenic Byways Designations Announced</h1></center>
WASHINGTON, D.C., September 25 -- The U.S. Department of Transportation announced the first round of National Scenic Byways and All- American roads Thursday, recognizing 20 routes in 15 states for their  scenic, natural, historical, cultural, archaeological or recreational qualities.
<p>
With few exceptions, the designations mirror routes designated by AAA's own Scenic Byways program, established in 1983.  Actively involved in the program since its inception, when former AAA Vice President Darryl Wyland served on the Congressional advisory committee, AAA was instrumental in selecting routes for this first round of designations.  Earlier this year, AAA Geographic Information Services Coordinator Mike Camarano was tapped to serve on the twelve-person panel of experts which advised Secretary of Transportation Federico Pena.
<p>
"These national designations give America roads we can promote abroad for travelers interested in the 'American Experience' when visiting our country," Camarano said.  "Here at home, communities feel national designation can help provide a welcome economic boost, while recognizing the delicate balance between promoting tourism and protecting the resources of these exceptional corridors."
<p>
The National Scenic Byways program was created by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act of 1991 (ISTEA) to recognize and enhance the best of our national transportation corridors.  The program is voluntary and based on grassroots, community initiatives, rather than a federal mandate.
<p>
Roads which merit recognition at the national level for exemplifying the regional characteristics of our national culture, history and landscape are designated National Scenic Byways.  Roads recognized nationally and internationally for their outstanding and highly unique intrinsic qualities, and are destinations unto themselves, qualify for the elite designation of All- American Road.
<p>
The six All-American Roads selected are:
Alabama, Selma to Montgomery March Byway;
California, Route One, Pacific Coast Highway;
Colorado (2), San Juan Skyway and Trail Ridge Road/Beaver Meadow Road;
Mississippi, Tennessee and Alabama, Natchez Trace Parkway;
North Carolina, Blue Ridge Parkway.
<p>
<p>
The 14 National Scenic Byways are:
California, Tioga Road/Big Oak Flat Road;
Colorado, Grand Mesa Scenic and Historic Byway;
Connecticut (2), State Route 169 and Merritt Parkway;
Indiana, Ohio River Scenic Route;
Louisiana, Creole Nature Trail;
Minnesota, Edge of the Wilderness Scenic Byway;
Nevada (2), Eastshore Drive and Pyramid Lake Scenic Byway;
New Hampshire, Kancamagus Scenic Byway
New York, Seaway Trail;
South Dakota, Peter Norbeck Scenic Byway;
Tennessee, Cherohala Skyway;
West Virginia, Highland Scenic Highway.
<p>
For more information on the National Scenic Byways program and the first round of designations, call the National Scenic Byways Clearinghouse at 1-800-4BYWAYS.

</table><h1>Auto Travel To Increase 3% In 1997, Says AAA</h1></center>
//Auto Travel To Increase 3% In 1997, Says AAA
ORLANDO, Fla., Oct. 17, 1996 -- The outlook for auto travel is expected to increase 3 percent in 1997, fueled in part by the popularity of "retail tourism" and Americans' strong interest in casino and riverboat gambling, according to AAA.
<p>
"What travelers save on air fares and other travel bargains and what they don't lose at the blackjack tables is now being spent on shopping," said Jerry Cheske, director, AAA Public Relations, speaking at the Travel Industry Association's annual Travel Outlook Forum.
<p>
According to TIA, vacationers consistently rank shopping as the most popular tourist activity.  Last year, the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn. attracted more than 40 million visitors, including at least 12 million tourists.
<p>
To meet travelers' demands, some tour operators and travel agencies, including many AAA clubs, are offering "shop 'til you drop" getaways to the more popular retail and outlet malls.   These outlet malls -- with total sales expected to exceed $14 billion this year -- are the fastest growing segment not only of the retail trade, but also one of the fastest growing in the travel industry.    
<p>
In addition to retail tourism, the popularity of casino and riverboat gambling will contribute to the projected 3 percent increase in auto travel next year. 
<p>
 According to Harrah's Entertainment, the number of households visiting casinos last year increased 23 percent over 1994.  Revenues jumped 23 percent in 1995 and have more than doubled in the past five years.  This momentum should carry into 1997.
<p>
AAA cited these additional signs for the projected growth in auto travel in 1997: <p>  
New car sales are expected to reach 15.2 million vehicles this year - up 3.4 percent compared to 1995 levels.  The total should increase to 15.3 million in 1997.<p>
Rental car demand has been strong for the first three quarters of this year and should continue for the balance of 1996 and through next year if the economy holds. <p> 
RV shipments are expected to exceed 477,000 units this year -- a 3 percent increase compared to 1995.  An additional 3 percent gain is expected in 1997 and should surpass 1994's recent peak in RV shipments.
Unlike the past, this spring's spike in gas prices didn't deter motorists planning holiday and summer vacation getaways.  Travel for Memorial Day, Fourth of July, Labor Day, plus summer, was projected to be at record or near-record levels.  Although slightly higher gas prices may be in the forecast for 1997, this year's healthy auto travel activity indicates that Americans will not cancel their travel plans due to rising prices. 
<p>
AAA news releases are now available on the Internet.  Within 15 minutes of release, they will be available for download or fax through PR Newswire's site Company News On Call.  The address is:  http://www.prnewswire.com/cnoc.html and the search word is AAA.  Releases will remain available until one year after the release date.

</table><h1>AAA Map'n'Go Eearns PC Magazine Endorsement</h1></center>
ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 12, 1996 -- AAA Map'n'Go 2.0--the trip planning and mapping software product released this summer by AAA and DeLorme--was named "Editors' Choice" in the Nov. 5 issue of PC Magazine.<p>

AAA Map'n'Go was selected "the leader in trip planning software," out-performing Rand McNally's TripMaker 1997 and TravRoute Software's Road Trips Door-to-Door.<p>

 PC Magazine called AAA Map'n'Go the most useful of the three trip planning packages, due to its ability to link to a global positioning system and the comprehensive listings and ratings of AAA accommodations, campgrounds, restaurants and attractions. <p>

The Windows-based AAA Map'n'Go presents more routing choices, offers the traveler the quickest, shortest, preferred or most scenic way to get to the destination and makes the best use of color, according to PC Magazine.<p>

AAA Map'n'Go is on one CD-ROM and retails for $39.  The trip planning software is available at computer and other specialty stores in the United States and Canada, participating AAA travel offices, direct from DeLorme at 1-800-452-5931 or from the DeLorme Web site at www.delorme.com.<p>

AAA is a not-for-profit federation of 102 motor clubs with more than 1,000 offices providing its more than 39 million members in the U.S. and Canada with a complete line of travel, financial, insurance and auto-related services.<p>

DeLorme is America's leading mapping software publisher, serving the consumer, business, education and government markets.  In addition to AAA Map'n'Go, DeLorme CD-ROM titles include Street Atlas USA 3.0, Phone Search USA 2.0, MapExpert and Global Explorer.

</table><h1>91 Premier Establishments Earn AAA Five Diamond Award</h1></center>
ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 11, 1996 -- Unparalleled customer service, luxurious surroundings and superb amenities and cuisine describe the 91 world-class lodgings and restaurants selected to receive the 1997 AAA Five Diamond Award.<p>

The 1997 winner's circle features 52 lodgings and 39 restaurants, including six lodgings and six restaurants for the first time. Three Palm Beach luxury properties and a classic country inn were among the 12 newcomers to the 1997 AAA Five Diamond Awards.<p>

The awards were presented Sunday evening (Nov. 10) during ceremonies at The Ritz-Carlton, Cancun, Mexico. <p>

"AAA salutes the newcomers as well as the veteran properties that consistently deliver the ultimate guest experience," said Graeme Clarke, senior vice president, AAA Products and Services.  <p>

Newcomers to the 1997 Five Diamond lodging program are: <p>

The Mayflower Inn, Washington, Conn.; The Ritz-Carlton, Palm Beach, Manalapan, Fla.; The Breakers and The Four Seasons Resort, both of Palm Beach, Fla.; The Ritz-Carlton, Kapalua, Hawaii; and the Four Seasons Hotel Mexico City, Mexico.<p>

New Five Diamond restaurants are:
Erna's Elderberry House in the Chateau du Sureau, Oakhurst, Calif.; Campton Place Restaurant, San Francisco; The Dining Room in The Ritz-Carlton Hotel San Francisco, San Francisco;  the Everest, Chicago; The Dining Room at Woodlands, Summerville, S.C.; and the Wild Boar, Nashville, Tenn.  <p>

Of the more than 33,500 lodgings and restaurants listed in AAA TourBooks, fewer than one-half percent are recipients of the Five Diamond Award.<p>

AAA began inspecting lodgings and restaurants in 1937 and introduced its ratings program in 1963.  In 1977--during AAA's 75th anniversary--the association adopted the one to five diamond rating system.<p>

AAA news releases are now available on the Internet.  Within 15 minutes of release, they will be available for download or fax through PR Newswire's site Company News On Call.  The address is:  http://www.prnewswire.com/cnoc.html and the search word is AAA.  Releases will remain available until one year after the release date.

</table><h1>Thanksgiving Travel To Reach  12-Year High, Says AAA</h1></center>
     ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 19 -- Americans are expected to travel in record numbers this Thanksgiving, as 31.8 million travelers -- 3 percent more than 1995 -- plan a holiday getaway of 100 miles or more from home, according to AAA.<p>
     This year's Thanksgiving projections are the highest since AAA began reporting holiday travel intentions in 1985. <p>
     AAA estimates 26.4 million will travel by automobile, light truck or recreational vehicle, a 3 percent increase from 25.6 million who took a trip last Thanksgiving.<p>
     Another 5.4 million Americans will travel by airplane, train or bus, up nearly 2 percent compared to 5.3 million last year. <p>
     AAA's holiday travel projections are based on a national travel survey of 1,500 adults by the Travel Industry Association, which conducts special research for AAA.<p>
     The greatest number of Thanksgiving auto travelers will originate in the Southeast with 6.6 million, followed by the Midwest with 5.4 million; West, 4.9 million; Great Lakes, 4.8 million; and Northeast, 4.7 million.<p>
     Travelers plan on visiting the following destinations during the Thanksgiving holiday:  town/rural areas, 36 percent; city, 34 percent; mountain area, 11 percent; ocean/beach, 9 percent; state/national park,  3 percent; lake area, 2 percent; theme/amusement park, 1 percent; and other or don't know, 4 percent.<p>
     More than half of the Thanksgiving travelers -- 56 percent -- intend to stay overnight with relatives or friends, while 29 percent expect to stay in a hotel or motel.  Other overnight plans include:  cabin/condo, 5 percent; camper/trailer/RV or tent, 3 percent; boat/ship, 1 percent; and other, 1 percent.  Five percent are undecided or don't expect to stay overnight.<p>
     AAA is a not-for-profit federation of 102 motor clubs with more than 1,000 offices providing its more than 39 million members in the United States and Canada with a complete line of travel, insurance, financial and auto-related services.<p>

</table><h1>AAA Picks Top Cities For Safety Excellence</h1></center>
ORLANDO, Fla., Nov. 8, 1996 -- AAA today recognized 139 U.S. cities for traffic safety excellence as part of its first Community Traffic Safety Program.<p>

Grand Awards go to Grosse Pointe Farms, Mich., and Roseville, Calif., the winners from among 1,048 participating cities representing all regions of the country.  This is AAA's highest recognition for cities with outstanding traffic crash prevention programs and casualty records.<p>

"The Community Traffic Safety Program replaces and broadens the scope of AAA's 57-year-old Pedestrian Protection Program in an effort to emphasize a community's total traffic safety efforts," said Mark Edwards, managing director of AAA Traffic Safety.<p>

Grosse Pointe Farms was selected in the 10,000 to 50,000 population category.  The suburban Detroit city, which has not had a pedestrian death in six years, earned this year's highest program rating.  City activities include a televised bicycle-helmet promotion, school and school-bus safety patrols and a "School's Open: Drive Carefully" campaign.<p>

Roseville, near Sacramento, is the Grand Award winner among cities with a population of 50,000 to 200,000.  It has not had a pedestrian death in four years and significantly reduced the number of pedestrian injuries last year. Roseville's safety activities include frequent DUI checkpoints, alcohol-free graduation activities, bike rodeos and a safety fair.<p>

Awards of Excellence went to 16 cities that achieved top performances in traffic safety activities and death and injury records within their population categories.  The largest city to win the award was Anaheim, Calif.<p>

Twenty-five cities won Awards of Merit for demonstrating combined achievement in pedestrian safety records and traffic safety activities.  San Jose, Calif., and Seattle, Wash., were the two largest cities to win this award.<p>

"AAA's safety efforts have helped reduce the number of pedestrian fatalities from 15,500 in 1937 to 5,585 in 1995," said Edwards.  "This is all the more significant when compared to the sevenfold increase in the number of motor vehicle registrations since 1937, the 100 percent rise in the population and sixfold jump in motor vehicle travel."<p>

Winners of the 1996 Community Traffic Safety Program were selected by an independent panel of traffic safety experts from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration; Institute of Transportation Engineers; Fairfax County, Va., Police Department; National Commission Against Drunk Driving; and AAA Carolinas.<p>

<title>RSES Boards of Studies</title>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/boards_head.gif" alt="RSES Boards of Studies">
</head>
<hr>
Courses in the earth sciences are arranged within three broad groups of
topics at the Honours level, and these groupings also have some
relevance to work for the higher degrees.  The groups are called
Boards of Studies, and cover work in the general areas of:<p>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="geol/index.html">Geology</A> (GEOL courses)
<li><A HREF="gphs/index.html">Geophysics</A> (GPHS courses)
<li><A HREF="phyg/index.html">Physical Geography</A> (PHYG courses)
</ul>
<p>
Although it is helpful for administrative purposes to divide the
Honours papers between Boards of Studies, much of the research work of
RSES is independent of these divisions, and projects frequently
involve cooperation between people whose main research interests lie
in different disciplines.  All students and staff of RSES share the
common room and seminar room, and contribute to seminars and
conferences.  There are also strong links with scientists in
organisations outside the university.  The aim within RSES is to
provide an exciting research environment, and in this and every way to
encourage excellence in research.

<title>RSES Research Divisions</title>
<IMG SRC="../gifs/research_head.gif" ALT="RSES Research Divisions">
</head>
<hr>
The VUW Research School of Earth Sciences includes two divisions that
offer no honours level courses, participating solely in research
<hr>

<h2>Antarctic Research Centre</H2>

The Antarctic Research Centre provides advice and expertise for University research in
Antarctica.  The Centre is staffed by <A HREF="../staff/barrett.html">Professor Peter
Barrett</A>
(Director) and <A HREF="../staff/pyne.html">Alex Pyne</A> (Expedition
Manager).  It
contains
a library of maps, as well as a range of purpose-built equipment for polar marine studies,
such
as winches, corers, oceanographic instruments and GPS surveying equipment.<p>

Staff and students from VUW have gone to the ice each year since 1957 to carry out field
studies for a variety of research projects.  Normally three or four projects are carried out
each
year.  Results are reported in student theses and scientific papers.  Proposals for new
research
should be discussed with Centre staff and must be submitted to the Ross Dependency
Research Committee by June 30 each year for the summer field season 18 months ahead. 
Approved projects are provided with logistic support at a nominal cost by the New
Zealand
Antarctic Programme.<p>

Most of the research is in the area of earth science.  Current projects include studies of
the
Transantarctic Mountains, evolution of the Antarctic lithosphere and changes in Antarctic
climate over the last 100 million years.  Studies in other areas, e.g. biology and ice
physics
are successfully pursued.  A major commitment for the Centre over the next four years is
the
Cape Roberts project, a joint venture with other scientists from NZ, UK, Germany, Italy
and
USA to core strata off the Ross Sea coast to investigate the tectonic and climate history of
the region from 30 to 100 million years ago.<p>

<hr>

<H2>Geochemistry</H2>


Aspects of industry-related Geochemistry are addressed at the
undergraduate level in the <A
HREF="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/chemistry/courses/300-level/chem-365.html">CHEM
365</A> course in the <A
HREF="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/chemistry/chem-demo.html">Chemistry
Department</A> and aspects of igneous geochemistry are included in the
appropriate GEOL-300 level courses.<p>
Geochemistry is offered as a separate postgraduate discipline at the
PhD level only.  However selected aspects of industry-related
Geochemistry are included in the CHEM 407 Special Topic in Chemistry
and Technology and appropriate <A
HREF="../boards-of-studies/geol/geol-hons.html">GEOL-400 level
courses</A> such as GEOL 402 Mineralogy and Petrology and GEOL 406
Petroleum Geology and Geochemistry.<p>

Enquiries should be addressed to <A
HREF="http://www.vuw.ac.nz/chemistry/staff/jjohnston.html">Associate Professor Jim
Johnston</A>, Chemistry Department or <A HREF="../staff/collen.html">Associate
Professor
John Collen</A>, Geology Department (for industry-related geochemistry and
petroleum
geochemistry), or to <A HREF="../staff/vry.html">Dr Julie Vry</A>, or <A
HREF="../staff/gamble.html">Dr John Gamble</A>, Geology Department (for
igneous
and
metamorphic geochemistry.<p>

<h3> Research in Industry-related Geochemistry</h3>

A variety of research programmes in industry-related geochemistry are actively being
carried
out within the Departments of Chemistry and Geology and in collaboration with new
Zealand
industrial manufacturing, and oil exploration companies.  these programmes involve
studies
of the mineralogy and formation of selected New Zealand ore resources suitable for
potential
industrial utilization, and the development of industrial processes to produce high value
products from such resources.  They include the production of titanium dioxide pigment
from
ilmenite beach sand deposits and the extraction of sulfur, silica and clays from geothermal
resources.  Other studies also include the use of organic geochemical biomarkers to
determine
the maturity of potential hydrocarbon-bearing source rocks and to establish oil-soil rock
correlations from petroleum exploration in the Taranaki and East Coast basin areas.  In
addition studies on the inorganic diagenesis and development of reservoir porosity and
permeability in the Taranaki and China area are in progress.<p>

<h3>Research in Igneous and Metamorphic Geochemistry</h3>

Trace element and isotopic geochemical research programmes concerned
with the petrogenesis of igneous rocks, particularly from the Taupo
Volcanic Zone, Sub Antarctic islands, and Antarctica are being carried
out.  Geochemical techniques are used to investigate the ties between metamorphism and
tectonism and the roles of fluids in metamorphic and ore-forming processes, with recent
work
in Australia.<p>

<h2>Earth Sciences Resources Outside RSES</h2>

This is a collection of Earth Sciences resources found in exploring
the web.  It is intended to be a useful starting point to find useful
and interesting information relevant to RSES areas of study.  The
items have been loosely arranged in order to make exploration
easier.<P>

<dt><b><A HREF="search-engines.html">General Places to Start Searches</A></b>
<dd>These are `search engines', designed to list as many WWW pages as
possible.  You can use these to make searches on specific keywords,
for example `volcano' or `cretaceous', and see if any pages with these
words in the title are listed.  (If none are, it doesn't mean they
don't exist, merely that none were found by that particular
program)

A list of <A HREF="../../staff/geophysics.html">Geophysics Staff</A>
is available.
<p>
The Institute of Geophysics was established to provide a focus for
geophysical teaching and research, to assist in the further
development of these activities, and to undertake, as a separate
department, such teaching and research as was needed for a
well-rounded treatment of the subject.
<p>
The members of the Institute comprise all academic staff who are
involved in geophysical teaching and research.  Its members serve also
in the Departments of Geology, Mathematics, Physics, and Information Technology
Services.  These affiliations are valuable to students and staff
alike.
<p>
The Institute's work gains much from a close collaboration with the
relevant Crown Research Institutes, DOSLI, and MetService in Wellington.
<p>
Geophysics is offered in the Institute at the Diploma, Honours,
Masters and PhD levels for students whose qualifications include an
appropriate combination of courses in Physics, Mathematics and
Geology.  Tuition and research facilities are available in a variety
of areas of Geophysics.  The planning of courses is discussed
below.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Undergraduate Courses in Geophysics</h2>
A good introduction to Solid-earth Geophysics is given by the course
GEOL 311 (Applied Geophysics) which has as prerequisites a choice of
courses from Mathematics, Physics and Geology.  Preparatory theory of planetary physics
is given in PHYS 209, and valuable geophysical
material is included in MATH 322 (Applied Mathematics).  Students
preparing to undertake Honours in Geophysics require a substantial
grounding in Mathematics and Physics, and in appropriate cases Geology
as well.
<p>
Graduate Courses are available for:<P>
<ul>
<li><A HREF="gphs-dip.html">Dip App Sci</A>-three papers and an extended
project - normally 12 months.
<li><A HREF="gphs-hons.html">BSc Hons - four papers and a project - one
academic year.</A>
<li>MSc Hons - four papers (part I) and a research thesis (part II) - 24-30 months.

Physical geography is the study of the earth's surface features and
processes.  It aims to explain the geographic pattern of landforms,
soils, vegetation, hydrology, coasts, and climate by understanding the
processes operating at the surface of the earth.  Whereas the physical
processes involved link the discipline closely to other earth
sciences, the dependence of human activity on physical resources and
human impact on the environment also link the subject to geography.<p>

Although there are a number of Departments of physical geography
throughout the world, Victoria University is the only institution in
New Zealand offering a degree specifically in physical geography.  The
Research School of Earth Sciences has provided a unique environment in
which to develop teaching and research in the subject by sharing staff
and resources with other earth science disciplines.<p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

Research interests include particle size and shape, and the use of
these properties in understanding modern and ancient depositional
systems. Past studies have included alluvial and glacial sedimentary
systems and more recently we have been trying to quantify the
relationship between wave climate, grain size and water depth on
wave-dominated coasts. Work in Antarctica still dominates, recently
with glacial history as the main theme. Pliocene glacial history is
of particular interest, but the main effort at present in
investigating early glacial and pre-glacial history (see below).

<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>

Recent work is in two areas, Antarctic tectonic and climatic history
prior to 36 million years ago and sedimentation in Wellington Harbour.
The Wellington Harbour project is using sediment traps on the harbour
floor to measure present day rate of sedimentation (and pollution)
over a 1 year period, and sediment cores have been taken to obtain a
record of sedimentation and vegetation change (through palynology)
over the last several thousand years. A particular focus is the
influence of waves on the northern shore of the harbour. The project
concludes in 1995.<P>

Antarctic climatic and tectonic history is being investigated as part
of the multinational Cape Roberts Project, which plans to core 1500 m
of strata off the Antarctic coast to sample sediments from the time
period from 30 to more than 100 million years ago. First drilling is
scheduled for 1996. Further information is available on World Wide Web
(<A HREF="http://icair.iac.org.nz/">Gateway to Antarctica -
Science</A>). Those interested in studying some aspect of the core may

</ul>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Metamorphism: P-T-time history and the role of metamorphic fluids in diverse
geologic
environments, fluid/rock interaction, Proterozoic terrains, crustal cross-sections and deep-
crustal processes.

<li>Applications of spectroscopy and stable isotopes to fluid and mineral
studies.

<li>Fluid inclusions: in metamorphic rocks and ore deposits.
</ul>

<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>My primary research interests concern the metamorphic evolution of the crust
during
orogenesis, with emphasis on interpreting metamorphic pressure-temperature-time (P-T-t)
paths, the role of fluids, and the effects of multiple metamorphism.

<li>Topics of continuing interest include the evolution of Proterozoic low-pressure
metamorphic belts, crustal cross-sections, and deep-crustal processes.  Projects generally
stress an integrated approach to field oriented studies, and may combine mineralogy,
phase equilibria, thermodynamics, stable and radiogenic isotope geochemistry, and
microtexture and fluid inclusion investigations.

<li>Ongoing projects investigating the metamorphic evolution and fluid history of
Proterozoic
rocks in the Reynolds Range, northern Arunta Inlier, central Australia have been
conducted in collaboration with colleagues at Monash University, the University of
Melbourne, the Research School of Earth Sciences at The Australian National University,
and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Data originates from the Japanese Meteorological Satellite (GMS) which is in
geostationary orbit above the equator north of Australia.
Data are received at Victoria University of Wellington by ftp from California.
The data are regridded on a polar stereographic projection and the date,
time and map are added at the Institute of Geophysics, VUW.
<p>
This satellite image is also available for
anonymous FTP from <i>ftp.rses.vuw.ac.nz</i>.
We are currently working on providing a <b>mpeg</b> version which will
allow animations of recent satellite images.
There are also plans to provide colourised satellite pictures in the future.
<p>
Full resolution, full-field of view  data from this satellite are archived
on tape and CDrom at the Institute of Geophyisics, since November 1993.
The Institute of Geophysics has also produced a video disc of continuous
weather patterns in our region for the period 1 July 1990 to 21 July 1992.

Printers on the RSES network
</H1>

There are currently 8 networked printers available scattered about the
Cotten A and B buildings.  All of these printers are available via the RSES
Unix system.  Each departments PCs and MacIntosh desk top computers are
able to print to at least their own Departments printers. 
<p>
<p>
<h2>
Printers:</h2>
<h3>
<dl>
<dt>Department of Geography:</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>geog_lw</b>
This is an Apple LaserWriter IIf located in the Geography departments
photocopier room (CA203) on the second floor.  This is the printer that
people in the Geography department should use by default.
<p>
<dt><b>geog_tek</b>
A Tektronics phaser 220e Colour laser printer.  This is a colour laser
printer.  Due to the cost of colour laser printing (roughly $3 a page),
it's use is heavily restricted.  This is located in CB213.  If you want to
use this printer then see Jack McConshie in the Department of Geography.
<p>
<p>
</dl>
<dt><h3>Department of Geology:</h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>geol_gpx</b>
An Apple LaserWriter IIf located in the graphics lab on the ground floor
(CA107).  This printers main use is for Graphics printing and is the
default printer of the graphics lab computers.  Users on the ground floor
may use it also.
<p>
<dt><b>geol_lab</b>
This is an Apple LaserWriter IInt located in the 4th floor Geology computer
lab (CB412b).  It should be the default printer used by people in the
Department of Geology.
</dl>
<p>
<p>
<dt><h3>Institute of Geophysics:</h3>
<dl>
<dt> <b>gphs_cp</b>
An HP 750c A1 colour plotter.  Used for seismic plots or other large printouts.  If you think you need to use it talk to a member of staff about it first.
<p>
<dt><b>gphs_lw</b>
An HP 4m+ Laser printer also located in the 5th floor server(CB504) room.  
This should be the default printer used by staff and students of the 
Institute of Geophysics.  This is also the default printer for everyone 
on the Unix network.
<p>
<dt><b>gphs_met </b>
An HP LaserJet 4mp in Jim McGregors office (CB514).  Available for use by
the meteorology group.
<p>
<dt><b>gphs_star</b>
A Star 4 laser printer located in the secretaries office.  Not for general use.
<p>
<p></dl>
<h2>
</dl>
How to Print:
</h2>
<h3>Unix:</h3>
<pre>
Printing is accomplished using the command: 
        lpr filename 
</pre>
All the printers are capable of PostScript.  With the expection of <b>gphs_lw</b> 
before you print text to them you must convert it to PostScript.  This is most
easily done using  "pstext".  To select which printer you wish to print to you 
add a -P<printer name> option to the lpr command line.  
Example: 
 To print a postscript file called "myfile.ps" on the 4th floor laser
printer you use:
<pre>
        lpr -Pgeol_lab myfile.ps
</pre>

To print a text file called "README" out on the geography departments
laser printer you would use:
<pre>        pstext README | lpr -Pgeog_lw
</pre>
You can check the status of a printer using the 'lpq' command.  lpq accepts
the -P<printername> option the same as lpr.  So to find out what is waiting
to be printed on the Geography Tektronics colour laser printer you would
use the command:
<pre>
        lpq -Pgeog_tek
</pre>

If you decide you don't want to print the file after all, you can dequeue
the file using the 'lprm' command.  You need to give lprm name of the printer
it has been sent to and the job number of the file you are printing.  Running 
lpq will tell you that.  Thus to remove job 34 from the Geophysics star-4 
laser printer you can say
<pre>
        lprm -Pgphs_lw 34
</pre>
<h3>
Macintosh: </h3>
To pick which printer you want to use by default you should go to the chooser.  
<pre>
Click on the 'apple' menu and select chooser.  

Click on the type of printer you want to use (be sure you are using 
	the system 7 printer driver -printer icon with the '&' on it).  
	A list of available printers (which should include all the 
	above) will be displayed.  


Click on the Printer you wish to use. Remember, if you are using a
	Colour printer, be sure to change the options from 'Black 
	and White' to 'Colour/Greyscale'.

If the list of printers is not what you expect, you should check 
	that your appletalk zone is set to RSES.
</pre>

<h3>IBM PCs:</h3>
PCs using the NCSA software behave in a similar manner to the unix system. 
As all the Laser printers are postscript printers you must firstly generate
the postscript file. You print using the lpr command which is implemented
by a simple DOS batch file. which accesses the network via the server
printhost.rses.vuw.ac.nz. To print a file called MYFILE you:
<p>        
<h4>Using Windows:</h4>
Select the correct printer driver using PRINT MANAGER and print to a
file, rather than a port 
<pre>	eg:AppleLaserwriter IINTX on File:
</pre><p>
Print the document MYFILE from your application (eg Excel) A window will
appear Print to File  where you name the ouput file.
<pre>        eg c:\laser\myfile.ps  (the name isn't important, as long as the
</pre>
suffix .ps is present)

Go to FILE MANAGER and call up the laser directory (the laser directory
is not necessary - you can use any directory you wish). Your postscript
file will appear with a small icon with blue lines. Open your file - this
will start up the batch file that sends the file to the printer.

<h4>Using WordPerfect for DOS:</h4>
Open the print menu (SHIFT-F7), ensure you have the right printer
highlighted (as above), then print the document.

Exit the print menu and open the DOS shell (CONTROL-F1), select 2, DOS
COMMAND, then type: prtwp.

<h4>Using DOS:</h4>
Ensure you have printed from your application to a file (the name/suffix
isn't important). At the command prompt type: laser myfile.ps.

<TITLE>RSES tape drives</TITLE>

<h1>Tape drives on the RSES network</h1>

The RSES has a number of different tape drives attached to it to facilitate both regular backups and the reading of data from a variety of sources.  In general the Exabyte and DAT drives are used for most purposes, the other tape drives only being used for special purposes.  The 9-track tape drive is not normally connected to the network at all.  
<p><i>After finishing with a tape drive please ensure the backup tape is reloaded.</i>

<h4>Tape devices</h4>
In order to communicate with the physical tape drive, there are some special files in the Unix file system space.  These files copy what ever is written(read)  to(from) them out to(from) the tape drives.  They may do other things to, such as (un)compressing the data or rewinding the tape for you once you have finished.  The name of these special tape devices varies from machine to machine, but they all live under /dev.

<h4>Permissions</h4>
In order to use a tape drive you should first run the <b>use_tape</b> programme.  Tell <b>use_tape</b> the name of the tape drive[s] that you wish to use and it will give you the access required to utilise the tape drive.  EG on tartarus <pre>
<b> % use_tape /dev/nrst9</b></pre>
By issuing the <b>use_tape</b> command without mentioning a tape drive, available tape drives will be listed for you.  If you are not sure whether a tape drive is free to use or not, you can see the last person to use it by issuing the <b>use_tape <i>device</i> who</b> command.  Ask them before removing their tape.
<b>tape_use</b> must be run on the machine that has the tape drive physically attached to it.

<h4>The mt commands</h4>
There is a command <b>mt</b> that allows you to manipulate the tape in the tape drive.  To find out details about this command, type <b>man mt</b>.  To use this command you tell it the name of the tape you want to manipulate and what you want to do with it.  Some of the more command commands are : <pre>
	status		Report information about the tape and tape drive;
	offline		Eject the tape from the tape drive;
	fsf		File Skip Forwards (move onto the next file)</pre>
eg If I am on pandora and I want to see that status of the tape in the drive at
the moment, I could use the command:
<b>mt -f /dev/rmt/0 status</b>
which would then return some information looking like:<pre>
Archive Python 4mm Helical Scan tape drive:
   sense key(0x0)= No Additional Sense   residual= 0   retries= 0
   file no= 0   block no= 0
</pre>
This shows a tape that has been rewound to it's beginning.

<h4>Writing to tape:</h4>
After loading your tape into the correct tape drive you should log in to the machine that has that tape drive physically attached to it.  To copy a file to tape the easiest command to use is <i>tar</i>.  To find out how to use the <i>tar</i>command, you can view the manual page by typing <b>man tar</b>.  In short if you want to copy a file <i>File</i> to a tape drive <i>Tape</i> the command is: 
<p><b> tar -cf <i>Tape File </i></b> <p>

e.g. To copy the file <i>my_file</i> to the DAT drive on pandora, I would use the command:
<p><b>tar -cf /dev/rmt/0u my_file</b>

<h4>Compressed or uncompressed?</h4>
Many tape drives can write tapes in both compressed and uncompressed mode.  For instance in the example above the tape was written out using Ultra compression (that is what the 'u' after the 0 meant).  While you can fit much more data on a tape if it is written out compressed (the Exabyte drive for instance, can get roughly 5GB of data onto a tape if it is written out compressed, as opposed to only about 2 Gigabyte of data if you use the non-compressing name), this is not without a cost.  Tapes written out in a compressed mode may be unable to be read by other tape drives of a similar variety (for instance there are no other Exabyte tape drives in the university that can read or write 5GB tapes).  Thus if the data you put on a tape is to be sent to some one at a different site (say another university) it is better not to use the compressed tape device.  For use around the school itself however, using the compressing tape device is recommended.

<h4>Rewind device or no-rewind device?</h4>
After you have accessed a tape device it is often desired to have the tape rewound.  Depending on the device name your use to write or read a file from tape, the tape may be automatically rewound for you.  If you are writing a number of files onto the tape it is important that you use the <i>no-rewind</i> device.  Otherwise you will write your file to tape, the tape will be rewound, then you will write you next file to tape over the top of the previous file.  Different machines have different ways of specifying that the tape should <i>not</i> be rewound.  In general this involves having an 'n' somewhere in the tape device name.  Where changes from machine to machine.  For instance on a machine running Solaris2, the 'n' is usually the last letter of the tape device name, where as machines running SunOS4, the 'n' normally appears as the first letter of the device name.

	Research School of Earth Sciences networked computing facilities.
</H1>
	The school operates a Unix network with 11 server-work stations and 23 assorted Xterminals. Many desktop machines - both PC and MacIntosh also have access to them.  In addition to the Unix network the school has some labs of desktop machines for both general and specialised purposes such as GIS.
<p>
The Unix servers are a mostly a mixture of Suns running SunOS 4.1.4 and SunOS 5.5, and DEC alphas running OSF1 v3.0.

used for the analysis of seismic motion generated by earthquakes in
Southern California. It is displayed as either vector displacement,
particle motion traces, or surface displacement of the entire array.
Updating the screen image for each digital sample produces an animated
display analogous to a movie of an earthquake. Work is currently

<DD>"This hypermedia exhibit describes my experiences on the Grand
Antarctic Circumnvigation cruise of the MV Marco Polo, from January 26
through February 19, 1994. Our expedition leaders were Lars-Eric
Lindblad, well-known for his ground-breaking development of the
envirotourism industry, and Nigel Sitwell, also well-known for many
tourist expeditions to Antarctica. We were accompanied by a number of
famous Antarctic explorers, including Sir Edmund Hillary and Sir
Vivian Fuchs, as well as family members of the original South Pole
explorers, Robert Falcon Scott and Roald Amundsen, and experts on
Antarctic biology and geology."

<DT><A HREF="http://www.uvm.edu/whale/whalehome.html">Charlotte, The Vermont Whale</A>
<dd>"In 1849 while constructing the first railroad between Rutland and
Burlington, Vermont, workers unearthed the bones of a mysterious
animal near Charlotte. Buried nearly 10 feet below the surface in a
thick blue clay, these bones were unlike those of any animal
previously discovered in Vermont. After consulting with experts, the
bones were identified as those of a "beluga" or "white" whale, an
animal that inhabits arctic and subarctic marine waters in the
northern hemisphere."

Data originates from the Japanese Meteorological Satellite (GMS) which is in
geostationary orbit above the equator north of Australia.
Data are received at Victoria University of Wellington by ftp from California.
The data are regridded on a polar stereographic projection and the date,
time and map are added at the Institute of Geophysics, VUW.
<p>
This satellite image is also available for
anonymous FTP from <i>ftp.rses.vuw.ac.nz</i>.
We are currently working on providing a <b>mpeg</b> version which will
allow animations of recent satellite images.
There are also plans to provide colourised satellite pictures in the future.
<p>
Full resolution, full-field of view  data from this satellite are archived
on tape and CDrom at the Institute of Geophyisics, since November 1993.
The Institute of Geophysics has also produced a video disc of continuous
weather patterns in our region for the period 1 July 1990 to 21 July 1992.

<title>Careers in Geology</title>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/geol_board_head.gif" alt="Careers in Geology">
</head>
<hr>
<h2>Careers in Geology</h2>
The demand for geologists fluctuates, but depending on circumstances
there is a wide variety of posts available to a graduate in geology.
At one end of the employment scale is the survey geologist or the
member of a geophysical prospecting team working in the relatively
unexplored terrains of the developing countries, at the other, the
isotope geologist or the theoretical geochemist who spends most of his
or her time in a laboratory.  Most professional geologists fall
between these two extremes and find the alternation of field with
laboratory work stimulating and enjoyable.
<p>
A graduate in geology with a good honours degree could go directly
into employment with a government survey, Works and Development
Services Corporation (NZ) Ltd, or with a mining or oil
company; alternatively, he or she could proceed to more specialised
training through advanced study or research.  In addition to
opportunities for geologists there is a need for those with
specialised knowledge of geophysics, geochemistry, engineering
geology, hydrology and soil science.  Courses offered by RSES are a
suitable training for all of these posts.
<p>
With an increasing awareness of the environment, more earth science is
being taught in schools, particularly secondary schools.  This trend
is likely to increase in the future, and a degree in geology is
becoming much more useful within this profession.  Similarly, local
bodies and other organisations concerned with the environment are
becoming more and more aware of the problems and the need for early
investigation, and it is likely that employment in these fields will
also increase.

<title>Research in Geology</title>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/geol_board_head.gif" alt="Research in Geology">
<hr>
</head>
<h2>Research in Geology</h2>
Most research is carried out in the New Zealand region, but Antarctic
research has had an important place since annual expeditions began in
1957.  The Antarctic Research Centre was formed in 1971 to co-ordinate
University Antarctic activities, which are mainly in the fields of
earth science.<P>  

Research areas include the following:<p>

<ol>

<li><B> Structural geology and tectonics</B> : Tectonic history of the
east coast of the North Island and Marlborough involving field
mapping, palaeomagnetic and geodetic investigations is a major
continuing project.  Tectonic evolution of the west coast from
Auckland to Westland is also an active research topic utilising the
very large amount of industry acquired reflection seismic data.  A
geophysical transect across the South Island in association with
several overseas institutions is being planned.

<li><B> Volcanology and volcanic geology</B> : Studies initially
concentrated on the eruptive history of the Central Volcanic Region,
but have more recently extended to other parts of the North Island,
and to the sub-Antarctic Islands and Antarctica where chemical,
mineralogical and dating studies have been undertaken.  RSES has a
special interest in several active volcanoes, notably Mount Ruapehu in
the Central North Island and Mount Erebus in Antarctica.

<li><B> Quaternary Studies</B> : Current research topics include
marine terraces and sea level changes; paleopedology;
tephrastratigraphy and Quaternary tectonics.

<li><B> Sedimentology</B> : Current work is concerned with modern
sedimentary processes in Wellington Harbour and in McMurdo Sound,
Antarctica.  We are also involved in a six nation project to test
theories of ice sheet variations and global sea level change by coring
Antarctic strata from 40 to 100 million years old.

<li><B> Metamorphic and Economic Geology</B> : Projects use a variety of
different techniques, in integrated approach, to interpret the conditions and processes
involved in metamorphism and tectonism.  Topics include metamorphic pressure-
temperature-time (<i>P-T-t</i>) histories, the role of metamorphic fluids in diverse
geologic environments, crustal cross-sections and crustal processes at a variety of crustal
levels.  Work on the evolution of low-pressure Proterozoic metamorphic belts is currently
conducted in Northern Territory, Australia, and Canadian projects consider processes in
the deep crust.  New Zealand and possibly Antarctic projects are planned.

<li><B> Petroleum Geology</B> : Research into hydrocarbon deposits is
carried out, particularly with respect to petroleum reservoir
properties of New Zealand sandstones and the origin of New Zealand
oils and bases.

<li><B> The Science Faculty Analytical Facility</B> provides
facilities for research at high temperature and pressure and is
available for use by students and staff in the departments of
Chemistry and Physics, as well as RSES.  A large range of high
pressure/temperature equipment is available for use.  Current research
topics include: Crystal growth by hydrothermal and vapour reaction
methods; phase equilibrium in igneous and metamorphic petrology at
pressures ranging from atmospheric to 30 kilobars; synthesis of
titanium dioxide, various ion-selective materials, and superconductors
are being carried out.

<li><B> Geochemistry</B> : The Science Faculty Analytical Facility
contains X-ray fluorescence, computer automated electron microprobe
and atomic absorption spectroscopic equipment.  Infra-red, DTA and
other equipment suitable for clay analysis and other mineralogical projects are housed in
RSES.  Current geochemical investigations into the petrogenesis of igneous
rocks include major and trace element and isotopic studies of volcanic
rocks from the Taupo Volcanic Zone, Kermadec Island arc, and the
sub-Antarctic islands.  Detailed mineralogical studies of mantle
xenoliths from the Ross Embayment, Antarctica are also being
undertaken as are geochemical studies of granitoids from NW Nelson,
New Zealand.  Metamorphic geochemistry and mineralogical investigations typically
involve compositional studies of minerals and mineral assemblages, with careful attention
to textures.

<h2>BSc Hons (Geophysics)</h2>
A prerequisite to enrolment for Honours in Geophysics is a Bachelor's
degree including 12 approved credits at the 300 level in Physics,
Geology or Mathematics, or a combination of these.  The undergraduate
programme can be planned in such a way as to lead logically to a
programme of study in Geophysics which places emphasis on any one of a
number of broad areas.  There are two main themes in Geophysics Honours:  the fluid
earth, which includes meteorological studies, and the solid earth.<p>

The principal areas of emphasis are indicated in the specimen
programmes shown below.  For other possibilities and for advice on
detailed planning, students should consult the Chairperson of the
Institute of Geophysics.<p>

Students should note that GPHS 489 Project is compulsory for Honours
in Geophysics.<p>

<h2>Physical Geography Course Planning</h2>
There are five tracks leading to post-graduate research.<p>

<pre>
<hr>
TRACKS       1          2          3          4        5
<hr>
Level 1      BA         BA         BSc        BSc      BSc/BA

Level 2   BSc(Hons)  BSc(Hons)  BSc(Hons)  BSc(Hons)  MSc Pt I

Level 4     PhD        PhD         PhD        PhD       PhD
<hr>
</pre>
<p>

On all five tracks the attainment of each particular level requires
approximately the same amount of time, although options for part-time
study are available.<p>
<hr>
Students wishing to undertake postgraduate studies in physical
geography normally enrol for a BSc(Hons) degree.  To be eligible they
must have completed a Bachelors degree which included 9 300-level
credits in a physical geography course and 6 300-level credits from
any other science course or 12 300-level approved credits in geography.  The Chairperson
may also approve entry of other candidates who show evidence of adequate training and
academic merit.<p>

The Honours degree in physical geography requires <I>four</I> papers;
at least two of which must be physical geography papers (code PHYG).
The research project (PHYG 489) is compulsory and the remaining papers
are usually selected from the <A HREF="phyg-hons.html">courses in physical geography for
BSc(Hons)</A>.<p>

Eligibility and proposed programme of study should be discussed with
the Chairperson of the Board of Studies in Physical Geography.  All
applications will be considered but students with a B1 average or
better are likely to be favoured for entry into graduate programmes.
Final programme approval is contingent upon settlement of a suitable
research project.  As early as possible, prospective students should,
with the assistance of a staff member, prepare a draft research
proposal for submission to the Board of Studies.<p>
<hr>

The other graduate degrees have requirements as follows:
<dl>


<dt><B>Physical Geography for MSc Part I</B>
<dd>Three papers (including one from code PHYG) and an approved
thesis.  See the list of <a href="phyg-masters.html">500-level courses
in physical geography.</A>


<dt><B>Physical Geography for MSc Part II</B> 
<dd>A candidate who has been admitted to the degree BSc with honours
may be awarded the degree of MSc on presenting a satisfactory thesis.
No papers are involved.  If the thesis is of sufficient quality the
degree may be awarded "with merit" or "with distinction".

<dt><b>Physical Geography for PhD</b>
<dd>Candidates seeking admission to this course should consult the
Course Statute for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in the Calendar.

<dt><b>Diploma in Hydrology</b>

<h2>Careers in Physical Geography</h2>
There is a steady demand for good graduates in physical geography.
Many of our graduates occupy roles in resource management, land
management and planning, others are engaged in aspects of
environmental monitoring, resource surveys, impact assessment.
Physical geography graduates are employed in many agencies of central
government, including Crown Research Institutes, Ministry for the
Environment, Department of Conservation, Department of Survey and Land
Information, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of Agriculture, and
NIWA as well as catchment boards, regional and district planning
authorities, education boards and private consultancies.<p>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

Research interests focus on late Quaternary climate change with
emphasis on a) reconstruction of Holocene and Late Pleistocene coastal
environments, especially coastal dunefields and gravelly beaches and
b) reconstruction of regional and larger scale climate histories based
on biological (esp pollen) and physical indicators.


<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>
<ul>
<li>The sedimentation response of a coastal lagoon to
catastrophic burning in its catchment, Malibu Lagoon,
California (with Dr John Walcott, USC)

<li>Holocene coastal evolution of the Kaitorete Gravel Barrier
and Lake Ellesmere, Canterbury, New Zealand (with Emeritus
Prof Jane Soons (U of Canterbury) and others) and of Okains
Bay, Banks Peninsula, Canterbury (with Wayne Stephenson, U
of Canty).

<li>From November I will be involved in a drilling project
aimed at producing a 1+ continuous glacial-interglacial
cycle record from a 'stable' site on Banks Peninsula (with
Jane Soons and others).

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

I am a field-based structural geologist whose research to date has
been concerned chiefly with 
<ul>
<li>the evolution of strike- and oblique-slip fault zones and 
<li>structural mechanisms for uplift of blueschist-facies rocks  
</ul>
Current research is focusing on the nature
and scale of distributed plate boundary deformation in the
Marlborough fault system of New Zealand. 

<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>

Recent studies have been completed on structural unroofing of
blueschists in the New England orogen of eastern Australia and in
the Brooks Range of northern Alaska.  At present, I am studying
<ul>
<li>the neotectonics and slip history of the active Awatere fault in New
Zealand, and 
<li>the nature and magnitude of distributed deformation
in the blocks between active strands of the Marlborough fault
system
</ul>  
Our goal is to understand the way displacement and strain
is partitioned across the obliquely convergent Pacific-Australian
plate boundary.  Also involved in a collaborative study on the
microfabrics and 40Ar-39Ar thermochronology of parts of the
Marlborough and Otago schists displaced across the Alpine fault
system. <P>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

The style and distribution of continental tectonism appears to depend largely on spatial
variations of rheology and buoyancy of the lithosphere.  My primary interest is in better
understanding the physical processes and material properties that define this
relationship.</P>

<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li> Observation and processing of the 1996 Marlborough GPS campaign.

<li> Isolation of the mantle contribution to western US topography, for constraint of a
geodynamical model of thermal and compositional buoyancy associated with the
Yellowstone hotspot.

<li> Participation in the 1995 Yellowstone regional GPS campaign.

<li> Analysis of the tectonics of Venezuela as a consultant for Exxon Exploration
Company. </P>

<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>

<ul>
<li>Statistical modelling of MM Intensity Observations (report in press); with D. Vere-
Jones and J. Pang.  The work has resulted in an algorithm for constructing Isoseismals
from reported Modified Mercalli Intensity observations.  An extension to better estimation
of magnitudes of pre-instrumental earthquake magnitude is planned that will include data
from Italy and China as well as New Zealand.

<li>Seismicity models for Australia.  Consultancy work has led to the development of
seismicity models for the more densely inhabited parts of Australia based on the
Australian Geological Survey Organisation's earthquake catalogue and published
information about historical earthquakes.  A general model for earthquake recurrence in
Australia is planned.

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

Paleomagnetic Secular Variation.  Changes in the declination and
inclination of the geomagnetic field over the past few thousand years
can be recorded in the remanent magnetization of lake and deep sea
sediments.  We are developing a definitive record of this paleosecular
variation for New Zealand.  This will be used to derive better models
of the local and global magnetic fields, and also to date climatic,
volcanic and anthropegenic events recorded in sediment sequences.<P>

Magnetostratigraphic correlation and dating of cores from Maui Oil and
Gas Field.  Sediments of the reservoir units in the Maui Field record
a sequence of geomagnetic reversals, which can be correlated between
several wells drilled in both the A and B accumulations.  This helps
in constructing a chronostratigraphic correlation across the field,
which is difficult by other means because of lithological
diachroneity.  By matching the sequence of reversals to the global
polarity timescale we can also date the reservoir units.<P>

Geomagnetic Reversals: The mechanism by which the geomagnetic field
reverses, and the reason why it reverses are poorly understood.  An
international project is underway to sample sedimentary sequences
through a number of chosen reversals at many different sites, and
hence to reconstruct the geometry of the field actually as it
reverses.<P>

Identification of the ferro and ferri magnetic minerals which
carry the natural remanent magnetization in rocks and
sediments, and assessment of their stability over geological
periods of time.<P>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

Seismology and its relation to Tectonics and Earthquake Hazards.  More
specifically:

<h3>Seismic Anisotropy</h3>

The study of seismic anisotropy is a rapidly growing field which is
yielding information on the orientation of aligned minerals in the
mantle, which can be related to deformation within the earth's
mantle. This is very exciting, as it allows us for the first time to
get an understanding of the strain, or the "structural geology" within
the mantle.  We are still in the fundamental stages of mapping this
strain deformation, and determining the contributions from the crust
and asthenosphere, and from past and present tectonic processes. New
techniques for examining multiple layers of anisotropy are helping us
to answer some of these questions.  Surprisingly, the contribution to
splitting from the asthenosphere appears to be very small under
continents, arguing that the asthenosphere is either relatively thin,
or else is isotropic.  Field programs in the United States and in New
Zealand are helping to unravel relations between tectonic provinces
and seismic anisotropy.
 
<h3>Earthquake Hazards</h3>

Earthquake hazards continue to cause great concern to the
general public, and mitigating those hazards is an important part of
applied seismology.  My research in this area ranges from examination
of properties claimed to be precursors to larger earthquakes, to
determining statistically the likelihood of a moderate event being
followed by a larger one, to examining strong ground motion reports
from the 1994 deep Bolivian earthquake which was felt as far away as
Canada.  Aftershock surveys using portable seismometers help to
delineate faults and to determine the state of stress and the tectonic
movements within a region.

<P> (Picture Caption) Thirty seconds of earthquake ground shaking
recorded at five sites in Lower Hutt, New Zealand from a magnitude 5.7
earthquake.  The sites were located on bedrock (blue), stiff sediments
(purple), or soft sediments (yellow).<P>

<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>

Recent research has focussed on identifying the areas in population
centres where the greatest shaking can be expected in large
earthquakes.  This has led to studies of the variability in the
relative shaking of a site from earthquake to earthquake.  This
variability limits the accuracy of seismic hazard estimates.<P>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

Seismology: seismogenesis and earthquake hazard especially in
collaboration with Dr David Rhodes, the methodology for formulating,
testing and applying precursory hypotheses for earthquake forecasting.


<h2>Recent Research Projects</h2>

Formulation and testing of earthquake precursory swarms hypotheses in
New Zealand and Japan.  An early form of the precursory swarm
hypothesis has been tested in New Zealand and rejected.  The form
which allows for clustering of swarms and main shock events has been
under test in Japan since 1983 and New Zealand since 1991.  The
research also extends the methodology to other hypotheses for
earthquake forecasting.

</head>
<body>
<h2>New Zealand Geophysical Society<br>

CONFERENCES</h2>
<hr>
The annual conferences of the Society are (usually) spread over 2-3 days in August/September, and are (usually, but not always) held in Wellington.  The format of the conference in recent years has been that of a Symposium on a central theme, with both invited papers, and those submitted by anyone interested in doing so.
<p>
An abstract volume is distributed to registrants before the conference, and selected papers may be incorporated in a published volume of <i>Proceedings</i> (arrangements are specific to each conference).
<p>
The Annual General Meeting is normally held in conjunction with the annual conference.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Forthcoming conference</h2><p>
<h3>1997 - Symposium - <i>Natural Hazards in New Zealand</i></h3>
<p>
This symposium is scheduled for the last week in August 1997, and will 
be held at Victoria University of Wellington.
The goal is to attract scientists from a wide range of disciplines 
who are working on related natural hazards problems. 
The symposium will include talks by several invited speakers giving
overviews of hazards research in New Zealand.
<p>
<hr>
<h2>Recent Conferences</h2><p>
<h3>1996 - Symposium - <i>Volcanic and extensional processes in New Zealand</i></h3>
<p>
This symposium was held on 29-30  August 1996 at Wairakei, in the 
heart of the Central Volcanic Region of the North Island of New 
Zealand.  The theme complemented that of 1995, dealing with the 
extensional aspects of the plate-tectonic regime, in contrast to the 
convergence aspect of subduction.
<p>
Vaughan Stagpoole (Victoria University of Wellington/Institute of 
Geological and Nuclear Sciences) concluded his review of the conference
with:
<blockquote>"As with Geophysical Society symposia of previous years,
the 1996 conference impressed me with both the range and the 
quality of the research presented."</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>
<h3>1995 - Symposium <i>Subduction-related processes in New Zealand</i></h3>
<p>
Held in Wellington, on 31 August-1 September 1995, this symposium focussed on the phenomena associated with the zone of convergence between the Pacific and Australian lithospheric plates which traverses - and affects most of - New Zealand.
<p>
In a review of the conference, Martha Savage (Victoria University of Wellington) wrote
<blockquote>"The Symposium....was very impressive to this newcomer to the Geophysics community in New Zealand....I really enjoyed having the opportunity to get a good view of the state of the art in tectonic studies of this region.  The small meeting reminded me very much of a Chapman conference."
</blockquote>
<p>
<hr>
<h3>1994 - Symposium <i>The origin of the Southern Alps</i></h3>
<p>
Held in Wellington  on 22-23 August 1994, this symposium revisited a theme of an earlier symposium organised by Professor Dick Walcott in 1978.<p>
Donna Eberhart-Phillips (Earth & Ocean Sciences Research, University of Otago) described it as
<blockquote>"...a good mix of people and disciplines.  As someone who is relatively new to NZ geology, I found it particularly useful for such an interdisciplinary meeting to start with overview papers by Walcott, Berryman, and Anderson.<p>
The Arthurs Pass earthquake discussion added to the conference and further emphasised our lack of understanding....Such a timely earthquake was a bit serendipitous - will the Geophysical Society be able to do this again next year?" </blockquote>
(The answer was - No!)
<p>
The proceedings of this symposium have been published in the 
<a href="http://www.rsnz.govt.nz/sir/journals/geology/geology.html">
New Zealand Journal of Geology & Geophysics</a> Volume 38, Number 4, 1995<p>

	(b)	must have arranged to undertake a degree embodying geophysical study of relevance to New 
  Zealand;  and<br>
	(c)	must have either completed or arranged to complete a significant amount of degree study in  
  New Zealand.
</dl>
	Except in special circumstances, an award shall not be made more than once to the same             
   person.
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> Nomination of an applicant must be made, either by the applicant or on the applicant's behalf, to 
the Secretary of the Society by 1 January each year.  The nomination must be accompanied by 
evidence of merit and a statement of the arrangements that have been made for further study.
<p>
<strong>4.</strong> Towards the end of each year, the Council of the Society shall appoint a <em>Scholarship Committee </em>
of three to five members (not necessarily members of the Society) and forward to them the 
names of the applicants and documents supporting their applications.  The Scholarship 
Committee may seek nominations, and shall, after considering the merits of the applicants, 
recommend to the Council which eligible applicant is the most likely to advance geophysics in 
his or her subsequent career.  The Council shall then decide the winning applicant. Members of 
the Scholarship Committee shall not be eligible for the Scholarship.  The Council may at any 
time replace a resigning member of the Scholarship Committee.
<p>
<strong>5.</strong> The Scholarship will normally be awarded annually and the winner announced in February of 
each year; but if, in the opinion of the Council, no applicant has sufficient merit, the 
Scholarship shall not be awarded.
<p>
<strong>6.</strong> The Society shall invest the capital sum of money accrued for the Scholarship in a special 
account to be known as the <em>Jim Ansell Geophysics Scholarship Fund</em>.  The Council shall 
endeavour to maintain the purchasing power of the Fund.  The award shall consist of a sum of 
money drawn from the interest on the Fund and will be paid after the winner has registered for 
the arranged studies.
<p>
<em>Explanatory Note:</em> Rules 7, 8, 9 and 10 are required in order to gain approval from the New 
Zealand Inland Revenue Department of Charitable Donee Status for the Jim Ansell 
Geophysics Scholarship Fund, thus qualifying donations to the Fund to be deductible against 
New Zealand income taxation.
<p>

<strong>7.</strong> (a) Any income, benefit or advantage from the Scholarship Fund shall be applied to the 
charitable purposes of the Jim Ansell Geophysics Scholarship.<br>
 (b) No member of the N Z Geophysical Society or any person associated with a member shall 
participate in or materially influence any decision made by the Society in respect of the 
payment to or on behalf of that member or associated person of any income, benefit or 
advantage whatsoever from the Jim Ansell Geophysics Scholarship Fund.<br>
 (c) Any income paid from the Jim Ansell Geophysics Scholarship Fund for services rendered, or 
for reimbursement of expenses incurred, shall be reasonable and relative to that which would 
be paid in an arm's length transaction.<br>
 (d) Unless approval is given by the Inland Revenue Department, the provisions and effects of 
rule 7 shall not be removed from this document and shall be included and implied into any 
document replacing this document.

<p>
<strong>8.</strong> If upon the winding up or dissolution of the Jim Ansell Geophysics Scholarship Fund there 
remains after satisfaction of all its debts and liabilities any property whatsoever, the same shall 
not be distributed among the members of the Society, but shall be given or transferred to some 
other charitable purpose within New Zealand.
<p>
<strong>9.</strong>	No addition to or alteration of the charitable objects, the personal benefit clause or the winding 
up clause shall be made without Inland Revenue Department's approval.
<p>
 <strong>10.</strong> Every winner of the Jim Ansell Geophysics Scholarship shall use the moneys or benefits awarded 
from the Scholarship to pursue geophysical research of relevance to New Zealand.

<head><title>N. Z.  GEOPHYSICAL SOCIETY:  Geophysics Prize</title></head>
<body><h2>New Zealand Geophysical Society<br>
NEW ZEALAND GEOPHYSICS PRIZE</h2>
<hr>

<h2>Preamble</h2>

The Geophysical Society invites the submission of publications to be
considered for the award of the The New Zealand Geophysics Prize. 
The $200 prize is awarded annually to the author or co-author of the 
most meritorious publication submitted.
<hr>

<h2>Rules</h2>

Each publication submitted must meet the following conditions:
<p>

<strong>1. </strong>The publication shall describe research in the field of geophysics 
        which has been carried out in New Zealand,
<br>
   OR   has been carried out principally by a New Zealander temporarily 
        overseas,
<br>
   OR   pertains to the New Zealand region.

<br>
<br>
        Except in special circumstances, an award shall not be made 
        more than once to the same author.
<p>
<strong>2.</strong> The publication shall have been published within 
the past three years (ie 1994, 1995 or 1996 for a 1996 submission).
<p>
<strong>3.</strong> Three copies of each publication, being submitted should be sent 
        to the Secretary (at the address below) before 1 August in each year.
        If the paper has limited publication or has been bound, 
        the copies will be returned if this is requested at the time of 
        submission. In the case of a book that can be readily obtained 
        on loan by the adjudicators, submission of a single copy would 
        be sufficient.
<p>
<strong>4. </strong> In cases of joint authorship, relative contributions may be 
        indicated by the person submitting the publication.
<p>
The name(s) of the successful candidate(s) will be announced in the 
the Society's October newsletter.

<title>Diploma in Hydrology</title>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/phyg_board_head.gif" alt="Diploma in Hydrology">
</head>
<hr>
<h2>Diploma in Hydrology</h2>
The goals of the diploma are:
<ol>
<li>To provide a refresher or enhancement programme for graduates who
completed a degree several years ago, or who wish to advance their
knowledge in the area of hydrology.
<li>To provide a conversion programme for graduates who wish to gain a
qualification in hydrology.
</ul>

Study for the diploma may be part time, in which case it is normally
completed in two years, or it may be full time for one year.<p>

Candidates are normally university graduates.  However it is also
possible to undertake the course without a degree, subject to the
provision of evidence of some other suitable qualification or
experience.<p>

The core of the diploma is the paper PHYG 404 (Hydrology and Water
Resources) and GEOG 313 (Advanced Physical Environmental Processes) a
paper which concentrates on fluvial hydrology, fluvial geomorphology
and soil/water relations.  A research project in some aspect of
hydrology is also required and one other paper selected from a wide
choice.  Further information is given in the prospectus for the
diploma or through the Chairperson of the Board of Studies in Physical
Geography.<p>

<h1><a name = "info0">Our Focus</a></h1>
<p>
As experienced scientists, we bring an integrating perspective to 
contempory issues of resource and environmental management, 
economic and social development, and environmental change. As skilled
analysts, we systematically explore linkages between people and 
their environments, at a variety of scales, to aid
policy making and planning.
<p>
Measurement and evaluation, modeling and mapping of information, are 
all key  aspects of our approach. We have particular expertise in 
spatial analysis and the visual representation of statistical
and other data. This leads to a greater insight into the patterns
and processes which occur at the Earth's surface, and in human
communities. Such insight provides a sound basis for more holistic and
sustainable action.
<p>
At VUW, we aim to advance knowledge and understanding through applied
research, teaching, and creative partnerships with national and
international organisations. We offer a comprehensive set of
skills and up-to-date field experience in many parts of New Zealand and
the Asia-Pacific region, as well as further afield.

<h1><a name = "info2">What can you study in Geography?</a></h1>
<p>
Geography courses are arranged into five themes (below). 
They form an exciting base of study which has relevance to the modern 
world. One or more of these five themes can be followed as part of a
major in Geography, or individual courses can be incorporated 
with other subjects such as Law, Commerce, Architecture, Geology or
Biological Sciences.
<p>
<dl>
<dt> Systematic Human Geography
<dd> Includes the study of towns and cities, population geography,
industrial and economic development. It aids understanding of the 
economic and social systems which make up society as we know it today.
This theme complements other subjects, such as Architecture, Economics,
Sociology and Politics, by providing an understanding of urban
processes.
<p>
<dt> Biophysical Systems
<dd> Relates to ecosystems, water resources, landforms and landscape
processes, and the field methods used to study them. Courses
in this theme are important for students interested in the physical 
processes operating on the Earth's surface, and those taking other 
subjects such as Geology and Biological Sciences.
<p>
<dt> Environment and Resource Studies
<dd> Provides a grounding in environmental and resource management 
in New Zealand and worldwide. In combination with courses from other
Geography themes, or subjects like Law and Economics, this theme
could lead to careers in environmental law and resource management.
<p>
<dt> Regional and Development Studies
<dd> Investigates New Zealand's growing relations with Asia, the Pacific
and Australia. Courses help students to understand our country's place
in the world and provide an essential perspective for those
also studying subjects as Commerce, Politics, Maori Studies or
Anthropology.
<p>
<dt> Techniques for Geographical Analysis
<dd> Supports the other four themes and provides vital skills such
as work with Geographic Information Systems (GIS), analysis of
statistical data, graphic techniques, and report production and 
evaluation. These skills are useful for students in any subject who 
will be analysing and presenting information and offer
an opportunity to apply training in statistics.

<title>400/500 - Level Physical Geography Courses</title>
<IMG SRC="../../gifs/phyg_board_head.gif" alt="400/500 - Level Physical Geography
Courses">
</head>
<hr>
<h2>PHYG 401/501 Geomorphology and its Application</h2>
<h3><A HREF="../../staff/crozier.html"> (Dr Crozier)</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><i>CRN</i> 1143
<li><i>Timetable : </i>Full year, Tuesday 10-12
<li><i>Assessment: </i>Course work 40%;  final examination 60%.
<li><i>Recommended Reading: </i>Crozier, M.J., <i>Landslides - Causes,
Consequences and Environment</i> (Croom-Helm); Brunsden, D. and Prior,
D.  <i>Slope Instability</i> (John Wiley); <i>Morphology</i> (Dowden,
Hutchinson and Ross).
</ul>

<b>Note: </b>The course explores a number
of aspects of geomorphology including: fluvial geomorphology, coastal
geomorphology, tectonic geomorphology, alpine geomorphology and slope
studies.  A major focus of the course is on slope stability and
natural hazards.  The course consists of lectures, seminars and a
small component of field and laboratory work.

<hr>

<h2>PHYG 403/503 Special Topic</h2>  (not offered in 1996)
<h3><A HREF="../../staff/lawrence.html"> (Dr Lawrence)</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><i>CRN</i> 1146
<li><i>Timetable : </i>Terms I and II to be arranged.
<li><i>Assessment: </i>Final examination 100%.

</ul>

<b>Note: </b>This course provides an opportunity for students to study
new developments and current issues in areas related to physical
geography.  A number of different topics are offered each year by
members of the RSES with occasional contributions from visiting
scientists.  The list of each year's topics can be obtained from the
secretary of the RSES.  Normally three or four topics, each of six
weeks' duration, are offered each year from which a student must
select two to present for examination at the end of the year.  Topics
being considered for this year include: natural hazards and applied
climatology.

<hr>


<h2>PHYG 404/504 Hydrology and Water Resources</h2>
<h3><A HREF="../../staff/mcconchie.html"> (Dr McConchie)</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><i>CRN</i> 1148
<li><i>Timetable : </i>Full year, Friday 10-12 
<li><i>Assessment: </i>Course work 60%;  final examination 40%.
<li><i>Recommended Reading: </i>Dunne, T. and Leopold, L.B. 1978.
<i>Water in Environmental Planning</i> (W.H. Freeman and Company, San
Francisco).  Gregory, K.J. and Walling, D.E. 1973.  <i>Drainage Basin
Form and Process - a Geomorphological Approach</i> (Edward Arnold).  Mosley,
M.P. (ed.) 1992: <i>Waters of New Zealand</i>, NZ Hydrological Society.

</ul>

The aim of this course is to provide those skills necessary to
undertake an analysis of the water resources of a region/catchment.
The course will cover three broad areas. Firstly, it will explore the
concepts of rights, ownership, types of usage, and planning mechanisms
with respect to water resources.  Second, it will focus on the
assessment, measurement, and quantification of ground water resources
together with the methods and requirements of data acquisition.  The
interactions among the various hydrologic processes operating within
slopes will also be studied.  Finally, the course will look at the
effects, both physical and social, of manipulating the water resources
of an area and the mechanisms available for resolving conflicting
usage requirements.<p>

<hr>


<h2>PHYG 412/512 Natural Hazards</h2>
<h3><A HREF="../../staff/crozier.html"> (Dr Crozier)</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><i>CRN</i> 6181
<li><i>Timetable : </i>Full Year, Tuesday 3-5
<li><i>Assessment: </i>Course work 50%, final examination 50%.
<li><i>Recommended Reading: </i>Crozier, M.J. 1990. <i>Natural Hazard
Assessment in New Zealand</i> (RSES, VUW).  Smith, K. 1992.
<i>Environmental Hazards: Assessing Risk and Reducing Disaster</i>
(Routledge, London, 324pp). Speden, I. and Crozier, M.J. (eds.) 1984.
<i>Natural Hazards in New Zealand</i> (NZ Commission for UNESCO).
</ul>

This course aims:
<ol> 
<li>to understand the concepts underlying hazard theory
<li>to understand the hazardous qualities of different natural
processes and places
<li>to understand the interrelationships between physical processes
and society that explain natural hazard risk
<li>to develop and ability to measure, analyse, assess and discuss
natural hazard risk, impact, adjustments and mitigating measures 
</ol>

At the completion of this course, students will be equipped to
address both international concerns and national issues, such as those
confronting Regional Councils under the Resource Management Act.  The
course consists of lectures from a number of staff and two student
assignments, each worth 20% of final grade.<P>

<h2>PHYG 489 Research Project  </h2>
<h3><A HREF="../../staff/crozier.html"> (Dr Crozier)</A></h3>

<ul>
<li><i>CRN</i> 1150
<li><i>Timetable : </i>
   <dl>
    <dt>Formal research proposal
    <dd>2nd week, Term I
    
    <dt>Written progress report
    <dd>end, Term I

    <dt>Oral presentation
    <dd>July

    <dt>Draft project report
    <dd>end, Term II

    <dt>Final submission
    <dd>2nd week, Term III
   </dl>
<li><i>Assessment: </i>Research Project Report 100%.

</ul>

<b>Note: </b>PHYG 489 provides the student with the chance, and the
challenge, of formulating and carrying out a piece of research on a
topic of his/her own choice.  It can also provide the student with the
experience of working closely with a particular staff member as
his/her supervisor.  The student's work is written up in the form of a
research report of around 7500 words in length.<p>

In the first instance students should talk over possible research
topics with staff members and discuss progress of topic formulation
with the PHYG 489 co-ordinator.  Once the topic begins to take form an
interim supervisor will be allocated.<p>

The student and interim supervisor will then work on the preparation
of a formal research proposal which must be ready by the end of the
first week of Term I.  Proposals are then considered by the Board of
Studies in Physical Geography, and the interim supervisor, with a view
to assessing feasibility, practicality and possible problems
(modifications or redrafting may be necessary at this point).  Once
the topic is approved, permanent supervisors are allocated.<p>

Once research is underway students should see their supervisors
regularly to report progress and discuss problems encountered.  At
certain stages of the year written progress reports are required.
Students are expected to attend relevant research seminars within the RSES
and the Department of Geography.  About midway through the year each
PHYG 489 student will contribute a seminar on their own research.<p>

The first draft of the essay should be completed by the end of Term 2.
Two typed copies of the final draft are then due early in the third
term.  A circular setting out precise dates, and giving general
requirements in greater detail, will be available from the RSES
secretary.<p>

The RSES is not generally in a position to offer financial assistance
for research essay expenses, although some assistance may be available
for the purchase of research equipment, air photographs and data
sources.  Requests for assistance should be made through your
supervisor on the understanding that any items purchased will remain
the property of the department after use.<p>

<title>Geography at Victoria</title>

<body background="../../gifs/background.gif">
<p>

<h2><center>Geography at Victoria</center></h2>

Geography at Victoria in 1996 consolidates the entirely new course introduced in 1995. 
Developed
to meet changing student requirements, they form an exciting base of study which has real
relevance
to the modern world.  The courses are arranged in five themes.  One or more themes can be
followed as part of a major in Geography, or individual courses can be incorporated into majors
in
Law, Commerce, Architecture, Geology, Biological Sciences, History, Sociology, Politics and
Anthropology as well as a number of other subjects.<p> 
<p>

The five themes are:<p>
<p>

<b>Systematic human geography</b><p>

This theme includes several sub-themes, such as economic, urban, social, and population
geography.
It focuses particularly on the processes of change in regional economies and human societies 
including urbanisation, industrial restructuring, and economic development.<p>

<p>

<b>Biophysical systems (Systematic physical geography)</b><p>

Ecology, climatology, hydrology, oceanography and geomorphology are among the sub-themes
included here. There is a particularly strong focus on slope stability and water resources, two
important issues for resource managers in New Zealand.<p>

<p>

<b>Environment and resource studies</b><p>

This area focuses on the inter-relations between the biophysical environment and human activity,
both in New Zealand and at the global scale.  Such topics as climate change and ozone layer
depletion are studied, and there is a strong focus on how individuals can have an influence on
environmental decisions.<p>

<p>

<b>Regional and development studies</b><p>

The social, cultural, and economic characteristics of countries and regions which are at various
stages of political development are considered.  Particular emphasis is placed on Asia, the Pacific,
and New Zealand, and reflects the growing political and economic importance of the Asia/Pacific
Basin.<p>

<p>

<b>Techniques for geographic analysis</b><p>

A distinctive feature of geography is its emphasis on research design, gathering data, and solving
problems under 'real world' conditions.  This theme includes quantitative and statistical spatial
analysis, and the processing of spatial information using computerised Geographical Information
Systems.<p> 
<p>
In all these areas, we are committed to providing a geographic understanding of contemporary
developments and issues, and the knowledge and skill base needed in an increasingly complex
society.<p><p>

<p>

<h2><center>Careers and Geography</center></h2>

Our graduates have entered a wide range of occupations in the private sector, government
organisations, and education.  For example, some recent graduates are employed as:<p>
<p>
*   a writer and researcher, for a publishing organisation<p>
*   a consultant and information analyst, for a business consultancy<p>
*   a hydrologist in a regional council<p>
*   a policy officer in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade<p>
*   a research analyst in the Treasury<p>
*   an executive assistant in the Department of Conservation<p>
<p>
Employers regard the breadth of knowledge and skills of geographers from Victoria as a great
asset. 
These skills are seen to provide a sound base on which to develop the additional abilities needed
to work in a particular organisation.  For example, people who have a good understanding of
environmental issues are required by many businesses and other organisations operating in New
Zealand.  Similarly, people who are familiar with other cultures and economies are needed by
businesses exporting to overseas markets, particularly in Asia.<p>
<p>
<a href="coursesoffered.html">Here</a> is a list of the individual 
courses offered. And these lists for the <a href="undergrad.html">Undergraduate</a> and <a href="postgrad.html">Postgraduate </a> courses show how they fit into the five themes
described above.  More detailed information is provided in the <a href="prospectus.html#outlines">course outlines</a>.

<title>Planning a programme of study</title>
</head>
<body background="../../gifs/background.gif">
<p>

<h2><center>Planning a programme of study</h2>
</center>
<p>

If you plan to major in Geography, you should try to include courses from both the 'human' and
'physical'
sides of the discipline, to provide breadth to your programme of study.  In addition to the two
systematic
streams, <i>Systematic Human Geography</i> and<i> 
Systematic Physical Geography</i>,
you may well wish to include
courses from the <i>Environment and Resource Studies</i> or  <i>Regional and Development
Studies</i> themes, if you have a
particular career path in mind.  The courses in the <i>Techniques for Geographic Analysis</i>
theme provide support
for the other themes.  They are particularly important if you are contemplating a career in which
research,
analysis, and presentation of information will be an important part of your responsibilities.  They
are essential
if you plan to proceed to an honours year, or to study for a masters degree or PhD.<p>

<p>

You should choose courses offered by other departments which will complement your Geography
courses.
Geographers find  that  courses in statistics (eg STAT 193), computing (eg COMP 130), and
economics (eg
ECON 102) are particularly useful.  If you incline towards human geography, then courses in
economics,
history, sociology, political science, Maori studies,  and related fields may be of interest.  If you
prefer physical
geography, then courses in geology, botany or zoology may be more appropriate.  We have
developed a
number of suggested course programmes for students with varying interests, and would be happy
to advise
you further.<p>

<p>

If you are majoring in a subject other than Geography, we will be happy to advise you on whether,
and how,
Geography courses can best fit into your programme of study. <i> 
The Fundamentals of Geography</i>,
<a href="geog111.html">GEOG 111 </a> will provide
a good starting point which covers a wide range of subject matter: 'human', 'physical',
environmental, and
regional.  If your intended career is likely to involve work in Asia and the Pacific or you simply
plan to travel
to Asia and the Pacific, <a href="geog112.html">GEOG 112</a> <i>Geography of the Asia-Pacific basin</i> will be of great
interest. <a href="geog115.html">GEOG 115</a><i>
Geographical interpretation and Design Cartography</i> with its material on maps, aerial photographs, and other
aspects of analysing and
presenting geographical information, will be of great value if you are studying architecture or any
field
science.<p>

<title>Laboratory and field work</title>
</head>
<body background="../../gifs/background.gif">
<p>

<h2><center>Laboratory and field work</h2>
</center>
<p>

Most Geography courses include laboratory work, field visits, and other practical work.  The
emphasis of this
work is to develop <i>skills</i> - for example, in analysis and presentation of survey data,
interpretation of aerial
photographs, sampling, - in addition to geographical <i>knowledge</i>.  <p>

<p>

The courses in the <i>Techniques for Geographic Analysis</i> theme 
(GEOG <a href="geog115.html">115</a>, <a href="geog215.html">215</a>, 
<a href="geog315.html">315</a>) are
particularly important,
as  they deal with both the theory and practice of collecting, analysing and presenting geographical
information.  You will be introduced to computer-based Geographical Information Systems, at
300-level.  Indeed, we intend to progressively introduce computer applications at all levels, with
the
aim of
ensuring that you will be 'computer literate' when you graduate.  (And we encourage you to
obtain
access
to a computer at home.)<p>

The Geography Department has standardised on DOS-based computers, because much
geographical software
is for these machines.  We use Wordperfect and Excel spreadsheets.  Bear in mind, when you
decide
between
a PC (DOS and Windows) or a Macintosh computer, how it will fit into your studies and meet
your
subsequent needs.  Please see Geography staff for advice.<p>

<p>

In the first year introductory course, (<a href="geog111.html">
GEOG 111 Fundamentals of Geography</a>),  you will use
maps
and aerial
photographs, as well as make observations in the field, to develop an understanding of human and
physical geography.  In the second year, depending on which courses you take, you
will carry
out field investigations of urban change in Wellington 
(<a href="geog216.html">GEOG 216 Urban and Population
Geography</a>), or develop
skills in hydrological, ecological, and geomorphological techniques in the Otaki area (<a href="geog223.html">GEOG
223
Physical
Environmental Processes: Field Methods</a>).  In the third year, a highlight for physical
geographers is the one week
field trip (<a href="geog323.html">Geog 323 Advanced Physical 
Environmental Processes: Field methods</a>).  This
provides hands-on
experience with a number of field techniques, as well as consultation with resource management
professionals.<p>

<p>

All the practical work is programmed to complement the work you do in lectures, tutorials, and
in
your own
background reading.  It is an essential part of Geography, a subject which straddles the arts and the
sciences.<p>

<title>Workload</title>

<body background="../../gifs/background.gif">
<p>

<h2><center>Workload</h2>
</center>
Faculties have suggested guidelines for the workload required of students.  Geography courses
are
designed
to meet these guidelines, and  recent surveys of students' <i>actual</i> workloads.  Of course,
different students will
need - or wish - to spend varying amounts of time studying particular subjects.  Also, workload
may
vary
markedly over the year, with assignments to complete, exams to prepare for, or laboratories and
field trips
to fit in.<p>

<p>

You should expect to spend, <i>on average through the trimester</i>, a total (lectures, labs,
private
study etc):<p>

        for a 100-level course: 9-12 hours per week<p>

        for a 200-level course: 12-15 hours per week<p>

        for a 300-level course: 14-18 hours per week<p>

These figures are for one trimester course.  Weekly commitments would be halved, for a full-year
course.<p>

<title>Course Requirements</title>
</head>
<body background="../../gifs/background.gif">
<p>

<h2><center>Course requirements</h2>
</center>
<p>

To complete a BA or a BSc, majoring in Geography, you will need to take at least 12 credits of
Geography
courses at 300 level.  All 300 level courses have certain prerequisites at 200 level; 200 level
courses
in turn
require that <a href="geog111.html">GEOG 111</a> (or in some cases 
<a href="geog112.html">GEOG 112</a>, <a href="geog114.html">
GEOG114/ENVI114</a> or <a href="geog115.html">
GEOG 115</a>) has been completed. 
Therefore, you
should plan carefully which courses you will need to take each year, to ensure that you will be
able
to
continue in following years.  <p>

<p>

With the permission of the chairperson of
Geography you may be exempt from the prerequisites for a Geography course.
We will consider any request on its merits, particularly if you are majoring in another
subject and
wish to take a 200 or 300 level Geography course, but cannot fit the prerequisites into your
programme.<p>

Geography 111 provides an introductory understanding to both physical and cultural
processes and patterns that mould both local and global landscapes.  The local environment
is used as a window through which to view such topics as natural hazards, industrial
restructuring, hydrological models, and the geography of the contemporary city.  The
emphasis is on the inter-relationships between the biophysical and the human environments
and the lecture programme is augmented by 'hands on' field trips and practical classes.  The
aim is both to lay the foundations for later courses at 200 and 300 levels, and to provide a
stimulating analysis of local and global landscapes and an introduction to the scope of
Geography as a discipline at University level.

<p>
Geography of the Asia-Pacific Basin provides a broad introduction to this dynamic and rapidly
changing region of the world and Aotearoa/New Zealand's relationship to it.  The course may appeal
to students interested in 'Third World' geography and/or for those whose intended career or future study
will require a knowledge of this region.<br>
<p>
The course is organised into six units:
<ol>
<li> Introduction and Concepts associated with the Asia-Pacific Basin;
<li> Historical Development and Colonisation
<li> Population, Cultures and Societies;
<li> Economic Development and Trade
<li> Geography, Environment and Natural Resources
<li> Aotearoa/New Zealand's Changing Role and Relationships in the Asia-Pacific Basin.
</ol>
<p>
These units will require students to explore case studies and examples from various countries in the
Asia-Pacific Basin to highlight and/or challenge regional development issues and trends.  Students are
encouraged to read widely, participate in tutorials and draw on their own experiences of living in the
South Pacific.

<i>Environment and Resources: the Foundations</i> is intended to be the &quot;foundational&quot;
course for the major in Environmental Studies, as well as an introduction to one of the themes of study
offered in the major in Geography.  We will be considering key concepts - &quot; what <i>is</i> the
environment?&quot; - and basic principles such as those relating to environmental ethics and values. 
We will introduce environmental systems, such as the global climate system, and some elements of
environmental economics.  An important aspect of the course will be the global context in which we
live - issues such as the pressures that the growing human population is placing on the global
environment.  And we will consider the New Zealand scene also - the history of resource use and
environmental management, and the approaches that are being developed in New Zealand to manage
our environment in a sustainable way.  The course is new in 1997, and will be as up to date as possible.

<p>
This course emphasises the importance of visualisation and graphic design as the essential basis for
effective and efficient geographic communication.  The course is an investigation of abstract, spatial
and thematic representations together with statistical graphics and publication design.
<p>
Cartography is not considered here, solely as means of replicating the real world.  Instead, cartography
is studied as a unique investigative design and management technique for transforming and
manipulating information about the spatial organisation of the world.
<p>
The course attempts to provide students with a versatile working knowledge of graphic design and
presentation techniques to ensure rapid and succinct communication of ideas and information.  To
attain this working knowledge the practical programme approaches graphic communication in a variety
of ways ranging from &quot;objective&quot; interpretations to thematic abstractions.  A graphic
project is an important part of the practical experience as well as providing a vehicle for creative
experimentation.
<p>
This course complements a great many courses on campus being essentially relevant to those students
interested in communicating geographic, social or economic data.

<p>
A number of countries in Northeast Asia (Japan, Korea, Taiwan, China, and the city states of Hong
Kong and Singapore) have recently achieved spectacular economic success.  This has earned them the
title of &quot; NewlyIndustrialised Countries&quot; (NIC's), thus distinguishing them from the
remainder of the developing world.  <i>Development Concepts in East Asia</i> critically evaluates
NIC development success and the possibilities for generalising the experiences of these countries.  The
course builds on the first year courses Introductory Geography and Geography of the Asia-Pacific
Basin.  It is divided into four parts.  The first part provides an overview of the development process
in the NIC's, identifies common features of their respective experiences, and draws attention to the
debates on Third World development which they have generated.  The second part of the course
questions the success of the NIC's by examining the costs of rapid growth.  Human rights abuses,
environmental destruction, social inequalities and loss of culture are given particular emphasis.  In the
third part of the course the recent trends in NIC development, such as democratisation and the rise of
civil society are explored.  Finally, in the last part of the course, the possibilities for repeating the
NIC experience elsewhere in Asia are evaluated.  Students will be required to develop a comprehensive
knowledge of the geography, society, culture and politics of each nation examined in the course, and
to develop a greater familiarity with core concepts and themes in development.

Geography 213 moves beyond the broad introduction to Physical Geography provided in GEOG 101. 
It provides a systematic treatment of environmental processes for students not intending to proceed in
Physical Geography but at the same time introduces the main foci of departmental research interests. 
It provides the skills and theory needed for advancement to <a href="geog313.html">GEOG 313</a>. 
GEOG 213 focuses on (i) hydrology/climatology (ii) material properties, landforming processes,
landforms and land appraisal (iii) ecology.  Specific topics include:  the systematics of climate, the
properties and behaviour of the atmosphere and of the hydrological cycle, the study of sediments and
their transportation, landform development in a range of climates, morphometric analysis, land resource
inventories and hazard mapping.  The ecology module focuses on ecosystem structure, function, and
change over time, and the human influences on ecosystems.

<p>
The aim of the course is to develop the student's understanding of resource systems, the environmental
issues arising from their utilisation, and the frameworks adopted to resolve such issues.  The course will
focus principally on New Zealand issues, such as energy management, and urban sustainability.  It will
include considerable reference to the Resource Management Act 1991, and its function in
environmental and resource management in New Zealand.  The roles of district, regional, and national
government agencies and the private sector will be explored, and there will be emphasis on how  the
public can participate in environmental decision making.  Towards the end of the course, material will
be introduced on environmental issues in the Pacific and Southeast Asia, particularly in the context
ofsustainable economic development at the global scale.  Laboratories, tutorial, and assignments will
emphasise a case study approach to analysis of environmental issues.
<p>
The ultimate aim is to equip students to participate effectively in resource management decision
making, whether as professionals or as concerned citizens.

The aim of this course is to introduce the main processes involved in urban growth and development
and the components of population change.  
<p>
A study of the historical geography of the Wellington area will be used to increase awareness of the
local urban area and to provide local examples.  Settlement of the city will be analysed and related to
models of urban growth.  Several contemporary issues will then be examined employing the concepts
of urban geography.  The basic concepts and ideas of population geography will then be applied mainly
to the New Zealand experience.

Geog 223 is a field methods course providing skills which complement those of Geog 213 but also a
wide range of other courses concerned with observation, interpretation, and measurement of physical
environmental processes.  The course will allow flexibility for students to develop sound field skills
covering all aspects from research design, data collection, analytical techniques (including the use of
computers), result presentation and interpretation through to presenting research findings in both oral
and written form.  Field case studies will include landscape development and landform interpretation
using sedimentological techniques and vegetation disruption and succession.

This course studies the geography of social and economic change in New Zealand, building on the
concepts introduced in <a href="geog216.html">GEOG 216</a>.  Its main aim is to examine the
impacts of the restructuring and deregulation process in New Zealand since the early 1980s,
investigating the specific impact and change in agriculture, manufacturing, and service industries.  In
addition, we study the changing geography of transport, energy, resources, and social structure.  In the
latter part of the course Australia is examined, following similar comparative themes including trade
and the C.E.R. agreement.

<i>Development Experience in Southeast Asia</i> extends courses offered on Asia-Pacific at first and
second year levels to a consideration of contemporary socio-economic and political changes:  the
historical legacy of state formation, alternative economic straegies followed in pursuit of economic
growth, the role of nationalist ideologies in this process, the persistence of poverty, the costs of
incorporating ethnic minorities, the renegotiation of sex, gender and power, and the impact of
development on women and the environment.  Special attention will be given to contemporary
international structures and intervention, population and the environment, current issues and country
studies.

<p>
The course focuses on the physical processes and problems or particular relevance to the New
Zealand environment. Topics on Land and Soil Systems are covered in the First Trimester and topics
on Hydrology and Ocean Systems in the second.  Within the Land and soil Systems module the
following topics are covered:  hillslope processes and slope stability; properties and behaviour of earth
materials; soils.  The second module covers fluvial hydrology; environmental hydrology; coastal
processes.  The topic on hill slope processes focuses on the mechanisms and controlling factors for
hillslope runoff, surface and subsurface erosion, mass movement, sediment budgets, and slope stability. 
The study of earth materials involves a systematic treatment of regolith properties essential to
understanding geomorphic processes and appropriate land use.  Soils are studied from an ecological
and geological perspective.  The module on land and soil systems will be of particular value to those
students interested in engineering geology, soil conservation, and land management.  Fluvial
geomorphology concentrates stream flow, sediment movement and channel morphology.  In the
environmental hydrology section processes involved in the degradation of hydrological systems,
including problems of water quality and mining waste are examined.  The section on ocean systems
deals with sedimentation and coastal processes in the Wellington region and then widens to cover issues
of relevance to the Pacific region.

<p>
The aim of the course is to develop the student's understanding of resource systems, the environmental
issues arising from their utilisation, and the frameworks adopted to resolve such issues.  Building on
material presented in <a href+'geog214.html">GEOG 214</a>, the course will focus principally on
global environmental issues, particularly those which have an impact on New Zealand and which
require a New Zealand response.   These will include greenhouse gases and global warming, sea level
rise, energy and industrial development, Antarctica.  The approaches adopted by selected other
countries to environmental issues will be considered.  Proposals for dealing with global environmental
issues will be examined and compared, such as those offered by US Vice-President Al Gore,
IUCN/UNEP/WWF, and British resource economist David Pearce.   Particular emphasis will be placed
on developing the scientific knowledge base which is required for sound policy and decision-making.
<p>
The ultimate aim is to equip students to participate effectively in New Zealand's policy-making process,
whether as professionals working in government agencies or as informed, concerned citizens.

</table>
<p>
The course is focused on the design and execution of an individual research project.  Students will be
introduced to the nature, components, and skills required to undertake sound research which produces
valid results.  This will involve a lecture programme: outlining and explaining the various steps
involved in undertaking research; supported by 'practical' exercises to reinforce the lecture material and
provide fist-hand experience.  Training is offered in various computing skills (word processing,
spreadsheets, statistical packages) and in using GIS applications to manipulate, analyse, and map
geographic and spatial data.  Attention is also devoted to the requirements and standards for verbal and
written presentation of the research project.
<p>
The course is specifically designed to meet the demands made by employers for undergraduate training
in research techniques.  It also offers essential skills for those wishing to undertake graduate research.

GEOG 323 is a course which focuses on methods of investigation of earth surface processes and
environmental phenomena as they relate to issues of resource management.  It is designed to provide
an understanding and practice of methods and techniques in research planning, data gathering, analysis,
presentation, and interpretation within the field environment.  Students will become familiar with field
instrumentation and techniques applied to surface water, groundwater, sediment transport, soils,
vegetation, surveying, and slope stability.  They will also become familiar, in the field, with the issues
facing resource management in a particular region.

<p>

<h2><center>Geography at Victoria</center></h2>

Geography at Victoria in 1997  
will include five themes which extend from undergraduate through to 
honours and graduate studies:<p>
<p>

<b>Economic and social systems</b><p>

This theme includes several sub-themes, such as economic, urban, social, and population
geography.
It focuses particularly on the processes of change in regional economies and human societies 
including urbanisation, industrial restructuring, and economic development.<p>

<p>

<b>Biophysical systems (Systematic physical geography)</b><p>

Ecology, climatology, hydrology, oceanography and geomorphology are among the sub-themes
included here. There is a particularly strong focus on slope stability and water resources, two
important issues for resource managers in New Zealand.<p>

<p>

<b>Environment and resource studies</b><p>

This area focuses on the inter-relations between the biophysical environment and human activity,
both in New Zealand and at the global scale. Natural hazards, and such topics as climate change and ozone layer
depletion are studied.<p>

<p>

<b>Regional and development studies</b><p>

The social, cultural, and economic characteristics of countries and regions which are at various
stages of political development are considered.  Particular emphasis is placed on Asia, the Pacific,
and New Zealand, and reflects the growing political and economic importance of the Asia/Pacific
Basin.<p>

<p>

<b>Techniques for geographic analysis</b><p>

A distinctive feature of geography is its emphasis on research design, gathering data, and solving
problems under 'real world' conditions.  This theme includes 
cartography and the graphical presentation of information, 
quantitative and statistical 
analysis, and the processing of spatial information using computerised Geographical Information
Systems.
<br>
(<i>The Geography Department has standardised on DOS-based computers in 
computer laboratories, because much geographical software is made for these machines.
We use Wordperfect and Excel spreadsheets.
Bear in mind, when you decide between a PC (DOS and Windows) or
a MacIntosh computer, how it will fit into your studies and meet
your subsequent needs. Please see Geography staff for advice</i>).<br> 
<p>
In all these areas, we are committed to providing a geographic understanding of contemporary
developments and issues, and the knowledge and skill base needed in an increasingly complex
society.<p><p>

<body background="../../gifs/background.gif">
<p>

<h2><center>Careers and Geography</center></h2>

Our graduates have entered a wide range of occupations in the private sector, government
organisations, and education.  For example, some recent graduates are employed as:<p>
<p>
*   a writer and researcher, for a publishing organisation<p>
*   a consultant and information analyst, for a business consultancy<p>

*   a hydrologist in a regional council<p>
*   a policy officer in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade<p>
*   a research analyst in the Treasury<p>
*   an executive assistant in the Department of Conservation<p>
<p>
Employers regard the breadth of knowledge and skills of geographers from Victoria as a great
asset. 
These skills are seen to provide a sound base on which to develop the additional abilities needed
to work in a particular organisation.  For example, people who have a good understanding of
environmental issues are required by many businesses and other organisations operating in New
Zealand.  Similarly, people who are familiar with other cultures and economies are needed by
businesses exporting to overseas markets, particularly in Asia.<p>

<h3>
Research in Geography</h3>
<p>
We have been active in carrying out research in a wide range of fields over the years. 
We have <a href="publication.html"> listed
two recent papers </a> by each member of the Geography Department, to indicate the scope of
Geography at
Victoria, and the opportunities for research. 
 <p>
During the next five years, we see Geography's research priorities lying particularly in the
areas of:
<p>
<b>
<i>Earth surface processes</i>
</b>
<li>Nonpoint source pollution and sustainable catchment management
<li>Frequency and magnitude of earth surface processes 
<li>Mass movement studies: landsliding, erosion and deposition 
<li>Impact and behaviour of soil landslides
<li>Land degradation, erosion rates and periodicities, and social change
<li>Slope hydrology and material properties and their impact on slope stability
<li>Application of GIS techniques to hazard assessment and modelling biophysical systems
<li>Regional patterns and prediction of hydrological attributes
<li>Modelling hydrologic processes
<li>Streamflow generation and dynamics in Antarctica and New Zealand
<li>The value of water in the hydrological cycle, and the consequences of human modification
<li>Sediment transport processes and river channel change
<p>
<b>
<i>Rural and urban change in the Asia-Pacific region </i>
</b>
<li>The Upper and Middle Mekong basin: new road to international development
<li>Highland South China: the economic and ecological challenge of a marginal environment
<li>Indonesia and Sarawak: enhancing the income-earning potential of artisans and farm-based
households
<li>The urban employment and housing consequences of structural change
<li>Patterns and consequences of urban residential development
<li>Monitoring rural change, sustainability, and resettlement programmes
<p>
We have growing interests in development studies, sustainable land and water management,
urban and
regional growth, the geography of gender, and environmental studies.  A programme is being
developed
which focuses on all these major strengths, and graduate students will play a key role in this.  We
aredelighted if students themselves propose topics in which they are interested, and which will fit
into the
overall directions we are developing.  As can be seen from the list of <a
href="publication.html">publications</a>, there is a great deal of scope
for
suggesting topics, and we encourage you to discuss your ideas with one of the staff.

<h3>
Physical Geography for BSc with Honours, or MSc Part I
</h3>
<p>
Physical geography aims to explain the geographical patterns of landforms, soils, vegetation,
hydrology and
climate by understanding the processes operating at the surface of the earth.  The physical
processes involved
link the discipline closely to other earth sciences, while the dependence of human activity on
physical
resources and the human impact on the environment link it firmly with Geography.
<p>
The Honours degree in Physical Geography requires four papers: <a href="phyg489.html">PHYG
489</a>, at least one other
PHYG paper,
and two further papers from the following (taken as 400-level papers):
<br>
<p>
<pre>
<br>
<a href="phyg401.html">PHYG 401/501</a>        Geomorphology and its Applications (not offered in 1997).<br>
<a href="phyg404.html">PHYG 404/504</a>        Hydrology and Water Resources<br>
<a href="phyg412.html">PHYG 412/512</a>        Natural Hazards<br>
<a href="phyg413.html">PHYG 413/513</a>        Coastal Management<br>
<a href="geog409.html">GEOG 409/509</a>        New Zealand Resource Management<br>
<a href="phyg489.html">PHYG 489</a>            Research Project<br>
GEOL 405/505        Sedimentology<br>
GEOL 412/512        Quaternary Stratigraphy
                    (GEOG 313 is an acceptable prerequisite for this course).
</pre>
<br>
<p>
Part I of  the MSc degree in Physical Geography requires  three papers, including one PHYG
paper, from the
above (taken at 500-level papers).
<p>
You should discuss eligibility and your proposed programme of study with the Chairperson of the
Board of
Studies for Physical Geography, <a href="../../../staff/shulmeister.html">Dr James Shulmeister</a>. 
Final programme approval is contingent
upon
settlement of a suitable research project for <a href="phyg489.html">PHYG 489</a>.  You should,
as early as possible, prepare
a draft
research proposal, with the assistance of a staff member for submission to the Board of
Studies.

<h3>
Research for an MA, MSc, or PhD in Geography or Physical Geography
</h3>
<p>
Graduates who have received a BA or BSc with Honours, or who have completed an MA
or MSc Part I, may,
on presentation of a satisfactory research thesis, be awarded an MA or MSc.  The research will
normally be
carried out over a period of one to one and a half years, or up to three years for a part-time
student.  For a
PhD, the programme of research is normally between two and four years.  Full details of the
requirements and
conditions are found in the University Calendar, in the relevant Course of Study statute.
<p>
Our graduate research programme aims to aid students to carry out research which:
<li>is based on an in-depth knowledge and understanding of the subject;
<li>has employed methodologies which are appropriate to the study's objectives, and scientifically
defensible;
<li>produces results and conclusions which have been thoroughly evaluated, and are convincing;
<li>has an element of originality and flair.
<p>
Geography staff will be very pleased to discuss your ideas for research topics, particularly in the
areas
described in the section <a href="research.html"> Research in Geography</a>.  In these areas, we have
ongoing
research interests, and
resources such as equipment and databases are more readily available.  Topics in other areas of
geography
may also be considered, if you have a particular interest you wish to pursue.  In either case, it is
important that
you discuss your ideas with staff, and do preparatory reading, well before you wish to commence
research
work.

<h3> Introduction:</h3>
<p>
The Environmental Studies major may be taken for both the BA and BSc degrees, and is designed to
be a cross-disciplinary programme.  It has a core of courses offered by the School of Biological
Sciences and the Department of Geography, to which you can add courses from other departments. 
By careful selection of courses, you may, in fact, be able to take the major jointly with other majors
(Geography, Ecology, etc), within the 102 or 108 credits required for the BSc and BA degrees
respectively.  By taking a few additional courses, a joint major in other subjects may be possible.
<p>
At Victoria, we encourage you to take a range of courses, and become familiar with several areas of
study.  Of course, many students also will have an eye to their future career, and will wish to specialise
in some particular area.  The Environmental Studies major provides an opportunity to combine these
approaches to whatever extent you choose.  In particular, it offers:
<ol>
<li>A basis for a career in teaching or a field which requires a Bachelors degree but no specific
disciplinary basis.   With this approach, you could take a wide range of subjects, although we would
like to assist you in choosing the subjects so that they fit together. 
<li>A more specialist approach to Environmental Studies is suitable if you are planning a career in
some aspect of environmental management and will require a specific strength (for instance, economic
and urban geography, as a basis for a career in an urban district council).  In this approach, you might
take the minimum number of courses specified for the major (of which there are several options), in
conjunction with some specialisation in a particular discipline.   
<li>A  more strongly specialist approach which links Environmental Studies with another discipline,
resulting in a joint major.
</ol>
<p>
When selecting undergraduate courses, you should bear in mind that, increasingly, many employers
expect applicants for professional positions to hold a postgraduate degree.  If you have a very clear idea
of your intended career path, you might prefer to build a very strong disciplinary base as an 
undergraduate - through taking a major in Chemistry, for instance - and then study for a Diploma or
Masters in Environmental Studies.  The postgraduate qualification would enable you to place the
specialisation in a broader context.  In the case of an undergraduate Chemistry major, for instance, you
might plan to move into the field of waste management in a regional or city council, or large industrial
enterprise.

<h3> Careers in Environmental Studies:</h3>
<p>
Environmental and resource management is largely the responsibility of government, both national and
local. Many graduates with environmental qualifications are employed in regional councils, city and
district councils, and departments of central government, such as the Department of Conservation and
the Ministry for the Environment.  The types of position might include policy analysts, resource
consent officers, managers in the environment division of a council, and so on.  The actual work can
be very varied, because the responsibilities of government cover a huge range of matters. <br>
<p>
Some of today's key environmental issues, dealt with by local and national government, include:
<ul>
<li>maintenance of water quality

<li>oversight of New Zealand's international obligations under environmental conventions.
</ul>
<p>
Increasingly, environmental management in New Zealand is the responsibility of the private sector -
farmers and forestry companies, manufacturing industries which create liquid and solid waste, and
businesses whose offices consume energy and generate tonnes of paper waste.  Many organisations are
establishing environmental management systems, as a way of achieving a &quot;competitive
advantage&quot; by reducing their raw material and waste management costs.  Many others are acutely
aware that overseas markets expect New Zealand products to reflect our &quot;clean green
image&quot;, and are free of pesticide and other contaminants, or come from sustainably managed
forests.
<p>
This growing environmental awareness creates many career opportunities.  Some companies employ
environmental officers, who are responsible for administering their environmental management systems
or simply monitoring environmental performance.  Areas such as energy or waste management are
obvious ones in which to build a career.  Increasingly, environmental awareness is important to anyone
involved in business or commerce.  For example, the purchasing staff of a manufacturer which exports
to Germany must be assured that its raw materials are produced in an environmentally responsible way. 
<p>
Nowadays, many people are employed as consultants rather than as permanent staff of a particular firm. 
Environmental consulting is a real growth area, which requires adaptability and a broad knowledge
base to work from.  Although the greater uncertainty of work as a consultant may be unattractive to
some, many people enjoy the variety and challenge.
<p>
Finally, we should not forget teaching as a career for graduates in environmental studies. 
Remembering the saying &quot;Think global, act local&quot;, it is crucial that all New Zealanders are
environmentally aware and responsible.   Education is the key, and teachers at primary and secondary
level may have more influence on New Zealand's &quot;clean green&quot; future than anyone.

<h3> Planning a programme of study:</h3>
<p>
Today, adaptability is a valuable attribute for anyone - today's environmental issue may have been
solved tomorrow.  The ability to shift into a new area can be a real asset, as your career path unfolds. 
So, as you plan your programme, you should consider not just the career that you have in mind now,
but the possible alternatives in a few years time.  You may wish to go on and do postgraduate studies,
and will therefore need to have developed sound skills in research, analysis, and presentation of
information.  At present, an Honours in Environmental Studies is not available at Victoria, although
we do offer a Diploma in Environmental Studies and the Master of Environmental Studies.
<p>
We encourage you to adopt a cross-disciplinary approach to your studies, while choosing a particular
area of interest or specialisation, within the broader area of Environmental Studies.

<h3> Workload:</h3>
<p>
Workloads may vary over the year, with assignments to complete, exams to prepare for, or laboratories
and field trips to fit in.
<p>
You should expect to spend, <i>on average through the trimester</i>, a total (lectures, labs, private
study, etc):
<p>
<li>for a 100-level course: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  9-12 hours per week
<li>for a 200-level course: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12-15 hours per week
<li>for a 300-level course: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14-18 hours per week
<p>
These figures are for a one trimester, 6 credit course.  Weekly commitments would be halved for a
full-year course.

<h3><i>Environment and Victoria</i></h3>
<p>
<b> Environment</b>, <b> Conservation</b> and <b> Sustainable Development</b> makes up one
of the seven "distinctive areas of
focus" that Victoria University identified in setting its strategic directions for the five years that will
take
New Zealand into the twenty-first century.
<p>
The University did so in recognition of the fundamental importance of environmental issues to our
future
and the demand from students, business and government for teaching and research in the area.
<p>
At the undergraduate level, an undergraduate major in Environmental Studies has been added to the
BA
and BSc degrees, while existing programmes at the postgraduate level have been reviewed, redefined
and
better resourced.
<p>
<p>
<h3><i>Why postgraduate Environmental Studies?</i></h3>
<p>
Most employers are looking for employees with more experience than the basic undergraduate degree.
With a postgraduate qualification career prospects are very good in a wide range of applied fields.  Our
graduates have found employment with central government agencies such as the Ministry for the
Environment, Department of Conservation, Ministry of Health, Ministry of Transport, as well as
regional
and district councils around the country, private companies and environmental consultancy firms.
<p>
<h3><i>Why at Victoria?</i></h3>
<p>
Victoria University, as New Zealand's capital city campus, offers unique opportunities for work
placements
and research with the country's major research institutes, government departments, and commissions,
the
head offices of multinational businesses, industries and special interest groups being located in the 
city.
<p>
<h3><i>Postgraduate Environmental Studies at Victoria</i></h3>
<p>
The postgraduate programmes in Environmental Studies at Victoria provide the opportunity for you
to
put together meaningful and focused  multidisciplinary courses of study and research.  You are able
to
draw on diverse disciplines as Biological Sciences, Earth Sciences, Physics, Chemistry, Architecture,
Politics, Social Science, Commerce, Economics and Law, as well as cooperation with outside
institutions
involved with research, policy development, management, advocacy and mediation.
<p>
Market research, student experience and comparison with environmental  qualifications offered by
other
universities in New Zealand and overseas encourages Victoria to offer courses which:
<ul>
<li>build on a strong disciplinary base established in a student's undergraduate degree;
<li>have a strong &quot;applied&quot; or &quot;skills base&quot; to them; 
<li>have a strong policy or management orientation consistent with the University's location in the
capital city.
</ul>
<p>
<h3><i>Which degree?</i></h3>
<p>
Victoria offers two specialist postgraduate programmes in Environmental Studies - the <a
href="menvstud.html">Master of
Environmental Studies</a> (MEnv Stud), which replaces the former Master of Arts (Applied) in
Environmental Studies, and the <a href="dipenvstud.html">Diploma of Environmental Studies</a>
(DipEnvStud).<p>
<p>
The Master of Environmental Studies degree is aimed primarily at recent graduates who are interested
in a postgraduate qualification with a practical component to enhance entry into the job market.  It is
a
two-year full-time, up to four-year part-time applied programme.  However, the degree, particularly
on a
part-time basis, may also interest older students with work experience seeking to improve their
qualifications and gain different work experience so as to redirect their careers.<p>

<h2>The Diploma of Environmental Studies</h2>
</center>
<p>
The <b> Diploma of Environmental Studies </b>is a more compact environmental studies course.  It
is a one-year
full-time or  two-year part-time programme to supplement earlier academic or professional studies. 
It is
designed to suit those already in the work force who wish to augment or update their skill-base, or
recent
graduates wishing to broaden their undergraduate degree.
<p>
The Diploma combines:
<ul>
<li>a core paper on environmental politics and public policy;
<li>two further environmental studies-based papers from senior undergraduate or honours/masters
offerings in a wide range of disciplines; and
<li>a research project.
</ul>
<p>
You should also be aware that you may be able to pursue a research degree on an environmental topic
within the masters or doctoral programme of your undergraduate majors.

option papers, work placements and thesis research that you have relevant expertise and a range of
experience in the area of resource management that  you intend making your profession.
<p>
It combines:
<ul>
<li>a range of tailored papers dealing with the framework and practice of resource management in New
Zealand, conservation and environmental management, environmental law, economics and public
policy, and Maori resource management;<br>
<li>the opportunity to advance at honours or masters level relevant specialist interests from
undergraduate training, or to develop a wider knowledge base with honours or masters-level study in
<li>associated disciplines;<br>
<li>thesis research; and<br>
<li>the opportunity to apply study to the work environment in up to two work placements.

Regional and Urban Development Conference<br>
December 8-12th, 1997. Wellington, New Zealand<p>
<p>
<basefont size =3>
<center>
<h3>Background Information</h3>
</center>
<p>
This conference is being organised on behalf of the Regional Science Association International which
holds conferences in three  regions, North America, Europe and the Pacific.  It organises its activities
through  branches in each  country. The following backgrounds the organisations involved in this joint
conference of the Pacific Regional Science Conference Organisation (PRSCO) and the Australia New
Zealand Regional Science Association (ANSRSA).<p>
<p>
<h4> REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL  (RSAI)</h4>
<p>
The Regional Science Association International (RSAI) is an interdisciplinary, international association
for the advancement of regional and urban studies and spatial analysis.  Over 35 countries are affiliated
to the RSAI through their national organisations.
<p>
Members of the Regional Science Association come from a range of disciplines including economics,
geography, politics and planning.  They also come from many fields of activity including universities,
all levels of government and the private sector.  The Association derives strength from the
intermingling of these academic, policy-maker and practitioner perspectives.
<p>
For further information please write to: Regional Science Association International, University of
Illinois, 1 Observatory, 901 S. Mathews, Urbana, IL 61801-3682, USA.
<p>
<h4> PACIFIC REGIONAL SCIENCE CONFERENCE ORGANISATION (PRSCO)</h4>
<p>
PRSCO is an affiliate of RSAI and is one of the Three Major Super-Regional organisations, the
others being the North American Meetings Organisation and the European Congress Organisation. 
 As in the case of these other two Super-Region organisations, PRSCO acts as a forum for
meetings of RSAI members within the region, in this case the Pacific Rim.  The first conference
of PRSCO was held at the East-West Centre, University of Hawaii in 1969.  Since then
conferences have been held at different locations throughout the region approximately every two
years.  It is the fifteenth such meeting that will be held here in Wellington in 1997.  This is the first
time a PRSCO meeting has been held in New Zealand.
<p>
Membership of PRSCO is obtained through membership of the relevant branch organisations.
<p>
<h4> AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION
(ANZRSA)</h4>
<p>
The ANZRSA is the local 'branch' of the international body, RSAI and is a member of PRSCO. 
ANZRSA provides an Australia-New Zealand perspective within a global regional  development
context.
<p>
Through its annual conference, meetings and publications the ANZRSA encourages members to
achieve
greater recognition of the need for regional development policy and practice, and to ensure that
appropriate structures are pursued within regions in support of regional development based
uponanalysis and appropriate planning.  It is committed to ensuring that both the Australian and New
Zealand
regional development processes are of a quality that is recognised world wide. 
<p>
ANZRSA publishes the <i>Australasian Journal of Regional Studies</i> and <i>Regional Policy and
Practice</i>.
<p>
For membership enquiries and/or further information, contact ANZRSA Inc., PO Box U271,
University
of New England, Armidale, NSW 2351, Australia. Tel/fax (067) 71-4838.
<p>
<h4>VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON Te Whare Wananga o te Upoko o te Ika a Maui</h4>
<p>
Victoria University is one of the oldest, largest and most prestigious universities in New Zealand
with almost 13,000 students.  The 50 departments, schools and research institutes of Victoria's
six faculties offer over 80 subject areas.  Close to the campus are all the national research
institutions:  the National Library, including the Turnbull Library, National Archives, National
Film Archives, the National Art Gallery, Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa, Crown
Research Institutes, Parliament, government departmens and the General Assembly Library. 
Wellington is also the cultural centre of New Zealand , with music, drama and dance.  It is home
to the Royal New Zealand Ballet Company, the New Zealand School of Dance, the New Zealand
Drama School, the New Zealand String Quartet, and the New Zealand Symphony Orchestra. 
<p>
New Zealand is a nation of many peoples, with official languages of English and Maori.  This is
reflected in the University's Maori name <i>Te Whare Wananga o te Upoko o te Ika a Maui</i>,
literally:
'The university at the head of the fish of Maui'. In Maori mythology the North Island of New
Zealand was a great fish haled from the depths of the Pacific Ocean by the god Maui from his
boat, the South Island.

While the general structure of the weeks events will be as follows specific details might
change.  Delegates should note that there will be nine session timeslots available each of
one one and a half hours in length.  This will allow three half hour papers to be presented
per session.  Session organisers will be asked to adher to this format but exceptions will be
made to suit the purpose and aims of the particular session.
<p>
The number of concurrent sessions in any one time slot will depend on the number of
papers being offered.  Generally a theme,  such as Tourism and Regional Development, will
have its own set of 9 sessions running through the week.  A number of other themes will be
similarly organised.
<p>
The actual times corresponding to the time slots will be defined once the final programme is
set.  Time slot 8 refers to evening events and incorporate the evening meal.

<h2>
Seventh Conference on Labour, Employment and Work
Thurs. 28 &amp; Fri. 29 Nov. 1996
Victoria University of Wellington,
Wellington, New Zealand
</h2>
<hr>
<h2>
<b> Background to the LEW conferences</b>
</h2>
<p>
The first  national conferences on Labour, Employment and Work was held at Victoria University
of Wellington in May 1984.  They were based on an idea by <a href="http://www.rses.vuw.ac.nz/staff/morrison.html">Philip Morrison</a>, <a href="http://www.rses.vuw.ac.nz/geography/index.html">Geography
Department</a>, who was researching employment issues at the time.  Philip noted that even during the
mid 1980's when unemployment was increasing rapidly in New Zealand, there was no regular forum for sharing
recent research findings and ideas.   Philip then teamed up with Peter Brosnan of the Industrial
Relations Centre Victoria University  to organise  the first of what became the regular LEW
conferences held every two years at Victoria University of Wellington. <p>
<p>
A record of that first conference may be located in university and public libraries as <p>
<p>
<pre>
Brosnan, P.A and P.S. Morrison (eds) 1984 <i>Labour and Employment Research 
             in New Zealand. Bibliography and Proceedings of a workshop 
             held at Victoria University May 14-15, 1984.</i> Published by 
             the Geography Department and Industrial Relations Centre, 
             Victoria University of Wellington, 183 pages.  <p>
</pre>
<p>
That bibliography was subsequently updated with financial support from subsequent conferences and appeared as <p>
<p>
<pre>
Brosnan, P.A. 1991 <i>New Zealand Labour and Employment Research 1859-1990. 
              A bibliography of research and research materials</i>. 
              Published by the New Zealand Institute of Industrial 
              Relations, Wellington.<p>
</pre>
<p>
A second conference was held in 1985, a third in 1987, and a fourth in October 1990. Pat Walsh of
Industrial Relations took over from Peter Brosnan and worked with Phil in organising  the fifth
conference in November 1992 and the sixth in November 1994.  In these last two cases they have
been skilfully assisted by Pat Cumming who is also acting as Conference Secretary for LEW7.<p>
<p>
Attendance at these conferences has risen steadily over the 12 years and reached 141 in 1994.<p>
<p>
Proceedings of the fifth and sixth conferences may be consulted in major public and university
libraries as:  <p>
<pre>
Morrison, P.S. (ed.) 1993  <i>Labour, employment and work in New Zealand. 
              Proceedings of the Fifth Conference, November 12 &amp; 13th, 
              1992.</i> Published by the Department of Geography, Victoria  
              University of Wellington.
<p>
Morrison, P.S. (ed.) 1995 <i>Labour, employment and work in New Zealand.
              Proceedings of the Sixth Conference, 24th and 25th 
              November, 1994. </i>Published by the Department of Geography, 
              Victoria University of Wellington.<p>

Victoria University of Wellington,
Wellington, New Zealand
</h2>
<hr>
<h2>
<b> Call for papers</b><p>
</h2>
<p>
Papers for the Seventh Conference in November this year are invited from any university discipline,
CRI or other public or private organisation or individual undertaking research.  The only criterion
is that the paper reflect the author's current or recently completed research on labour, employment
or work issues in New Zealand.  Proceedings will be published and all presenters will be expected
to deliver their paper on disk in a prescribed format by the date of the conference. See <a href="proceedings.html">Papers for
proceedings</a> on how to prepare your paper. The contribution by graduate students has been a feature
in recent years and we would like to continue to encourage their participation.<p>
<p>
This year a special joint Friday afternoon session will be held with the overlapping Sociological
Association of Aotearoa (NZ) Conference 1996.  Please indicate if you would like to offer a paper
in this special session entitled 'The Sociology of Labour, Employment and Work in New Zealand'.<p>
<p>
Papers may be presented in the standard conference manner or as the basis of a workshop.  Two
timeslots will be set aside for workshops.  Several workshops will be held simultaneously at these
two times.   The convenor of a workshop will outline the topic for discussion and have a paper
available for to intending participants before the conference.   The workshop will begin with a 10
minute (max.) summary of the essential argument of the paper and questions designed to stimulate
discussion.  Workshop sessions will run for approximately one hour each.  A record of the session
will be kept and published along with the paper in the proceedings. (Alternative workshop ideas will
be considered).<p>
<p>
Please register your interest in presenting a paper or workshop by 31 
August 1996.

<br>
<p>
Details on this page will be sent to all those whose papers have been accepted for the conference. 
Acceptance notices will be sent out in August 1996.
 <p>
All papers will be published in a single volume of proceedings. The previous conference
proceedings may be consulted in University and Public libraries as

<pre>
Morrison, P.S. (ed.) 1995 <i>Labour, employment and work in New Zealand.
               Proceedings of the Sixth Conference, 24th and 25th 
               November, 1994</i>.Published by the Department of Geography, 
               Victoria University of Wellington. 
</pre>
<p>
For details on previous proceedings see <a href="background.html">Background</a>.<br>
<p>
<p>
We make every effort to get the Proceedings published quickly but need your cooperation
and attention to the details below to ensure that.  One of the conditions of preparing a paper
for this conference is that it be delivered on disk <b>to our specifications</b> on the <b>first day</b> of the
conference.  This page tells you how to  prepare your manuscript  on disk.  Please read the
following <b>very</b> carefully.  Disks which are incorrect will be returned for you to correct. <br>
<p>
Papers published in the Proceedings are not subject to peer review but they will be read by
the editor who reserves the right to require alterations to ensure clarity of the text.  Please
note that publication in these  conference proceedings do not - as far as we are concerned
- preclude you from  publishing elsewhere in a peer reviewed journal or book at a later date.<p>
<p>
<b> Papers must be delivered on a clearly labelled disk on the first day of the conference
and  must be accompanied by a paper copy with the authors name and full postal and
e-mail address.<br>
</b>
<br>
<p>
<h4><b> Format of delivered papers</b></h4>
<p>
We will do the formatting so please do little more than provide the text according to the following guidelines.<p>
<p>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Maximum word length 5000 words excluding figures and tables.
<li>Times 10 point
<li>Single space between lines
<li>No underlining or use of bold.  Plain text only.
<li> No indenting of text
<li>Ensure that text is both left and right justified
<li>Headings. One level only - use lower case with first letter of each noun in capitals
<li>Do NOT use the space bar.  Tab settings only
<li>One blank line between paragraphs
<li>Text and non-text files must be kept separate.   Text must be delivered on a separate
file from figures and tables.  Tables, figures and any non text files must NOT be
embedded in the text file. If submitting several files please indicate clear by which is
your text file. 
<li>Our preference is that you deliver your text in Microsoft WORD 4 or 5 for the
Macintosh.  Please indicate ON THE TEXT and ON THE DISK which software you
have used and the version.  If several files are enclosed please attach an explanatory 
note.
<li>All tables and figures must be numbered and must be referred to explicitly in the text
e.g. As Figure 1 shows  this is to ensure our placement of your figures and tables is
correct.
<li>A photograph will accompany your paper as in the LEW6 proceedings.  A
photographer will be on hand at a designated time during the conference. 
Photographs of those presenting in LEW6 will be used again unless we hear
otherwise.
</ul>

<center><b> CHANGE MANAGEMENT IN THE NEW ZEALAND MEAT INDUSTRY:
IMPLICATIONS
FOR LABOUR RELATIONS</center>
</b><p>
<center>Ramzi Addison<p>
<p>
<i>Department of Economics and Marketing<p>
Lincoln University<p>
</i></center>
<p>
Research on the management of change is not matched by an increase in the effectiveness of change
initiatives.  High failure rates for new technology implementations and for other initiatives such as
TQM
appear to point to the failure of research to identify the fundamental drivers of successful change
management.<p>
<p>
A multi-plant case study research project examined four meat plants which were introducing new
technology onto the  chain process.  The study found that the most critical factor was the quality of the
employment relationship <i>prior </i>to the change.  A 'positive' prior context characterised by high
trust
relationships, mutual respect and confidence was more likely to lead to a successful outcome than a
'negative' one characterised by autocratic management, low trust and respect.  These results affirm
some
earlier research carried out in the 1970's on labour relations in the New Zealand meat industry.<p>

The aim of this paper is to determine the relative impact of economic&nbsp;restructuring on Maori
during the
1980s and  early 1990s. The Data come from&nbsp;special tabulations compiled from Census data.
A
combination of quintiles&nbsp;and medians are used as measures to identify trends by ethnicity,
family&nbsp;type,
and labour force status.&nbsp;&nbsp;In particular, Maori and Non-Maori labour force participation
rates
are&nbsp;compared with income distribution trends to determine relationships between&nbsp;income
levels and
labour force participation.&nbsp;<p>

<center><b> PRELIMINARY RESULTS OF A SURVEY OF EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTING UNDER
THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS  ACT.<p>
</center>
</b><p>
<center>Craig Armitage<p>
<p>
<i>Industrial Relations Service, Department of Labour<p>
</center>
</i><p>
In order to make an initial assessment of the extent of&nbsp;labour market adjustment under the Employment
Contracts Act 1991, the&nbsp;Department of Labour commissioned surveys of adjustment under the Act
in&nbsp;1992 and 1993.  These surveys showed the spread of enterprise bargaining&nbsp;and individual employment
contracts, the nature of industrial relations&nbsp;changes made in different types of enterprises, and the
concentration of&nbsp;changes amongst larger enterprises.  The surveys also demonstrated that&nbsp;many of the
changes made under the Act occurred in its initial years. &nbsp;The Department has commissioned a similar
survey again this year, the&nbsp;final results of which are due by the end of the year.  This  paper&nbsp;explains the
objectives of this year's survey, how it differs from the&nbsp;previous surveys, and presents some preliminary
results.&nbsp;<p>

<center><b> FROM 'BOOM' TO 'BUST'?  INTERNATIONAL MIGRATION,<p>
POPULATION CHANGE AND THE LABOUR FORCE, 1991-1996<p>

<i>Department of Geography, University of Waikato<p>

</center>
<p>
This paper reviews the massive changes in patterns of international migration following the introduction
of the points system in November 1991.  Attention is focussed on the age and gender characteristics of
particular migrants groups, and their contributions to overall population change in New Zealand during
the early 1990s.  Particular attention is focussed on the labour force age groups, and the ways in which
international migration is impacting quite differentially on the younger and older workforces.  Some of
the implications of these changes are explored with reference to population aging.<p>

examine why local autorities have become involved in both issues, the variation across them in both level
and range of initiatives and degrees of effectiveness.  Several case  studies will highlight a number of the
opportunitites as well as the difficulties involved.<p>
<p>
The paper concludes that while local authorities have attempted to play a constructive and responsible
role there are still a number of unresolved issues concerning their role in economic development and
employment creation.  This paper argues that local authorities should be involved,  and have the
autonomy to act and be able to development and implement a range of effective programmes to address
local employment issues.<p>

Te Whanau o Waipareira Trust provides a large range of health,&nbsp;education, social, justice, economic and
employment services to its&nbsp;predominantly West Auckland Maori constituency. It operates  over a&nbsp;large
number of locations and uses a wide range of networks,&nbsp;alliances and joint ventures to deliver its
services.<p>
<p>
This paper&nbsp;will examine skill formation in Waipareira Trust  in light of&nbsp;Goldsteins (1991) complex
systems theory, developments in theories of&nbsp;workplace reform (Perry et al 1995) and draw on concepts
of Maori&nbsp;philosophy (Henare 1995) as they relate to employment and work. <p>
<p>
The paper will focus on those core skills needed by staff  to operate in its&nbsp;multi-dimensional complex
environment and will look at some of the&nbsp;ways that Te Whanau o Waipareira encourage staff to learn
these&nbsp;skills.  Te Whanau o Waipareira is the fourth case study of the FRST&nbsp;funded &quot;Economic
Restructuring and Skills Formation&quot; project&nbsp;undertaken by the Centre for Research on Work, Education

<center><b> DISINFLATION AND EQUILIBRIUM PARTICIPATION RATES<p>
ACROSS THE OECD&nbsp;<p>

<p>
Larry Ball's recent work shows that OECD countries with large and &nbsp;long lasting disinflations during the
1980s had the largest rises in their &nbsp;equilibrium unemployment rates. While supply side factors did not
&nbsp;initiate the rises in equilibrium unemployment, Ball finds evidence &nbsp;for an interactive relationship
between disinflation and open ended unemployment duration. He concludes the results support hysteresis
&nbsp;rather than natural rate theories of the labour market.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
A hysteresis theory  also implies that trend labour force &nbsp;participation should be changed by disinflation,
in addition to trend &nbsp;unemployment rates.* The study examines changes in trend participation &nbsp;across
twenty OECD countries between 1980 and 1990 and finds &nbsp;confirmation for the prediction of the
hysteresis hypothesis. &nbsp;Countries with high disinflation have the smallest rises in trend &nbsp;labour force
participation. However, there was no interactive effect &nbsp;between disinflation and benefit duration. Supply
side effects of &nbsp;benefit duration and union coordination act on trend participation independently from
disinflation. &nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
The results of both this study and that of Ball raise important  issues &nbsp;regarding the current operating
structures of monetary policy in New &nbsp;Zealand, based as these are on the natural rate hypothesis.<p>
____<p>
* hysteresis = path dependence; the idea that that long run outcomes are not independent of short run
outcomes.<p>

<p>
Since the 1970-80s, employment relationships in the western world have &nbsp;been influenced by the
emergence of human resource management (HRM) &nbsp;which has, to some degree, challenged the existing
order - industrial &nbsp;relations (IR).  &nbsp;&nbsp;The debate resulting from the emergence of HRM has kept the
academic &nbsp;presses churning.  At one level, there is a 'co-existence' debate which &nbsp;explores the likelihood
that HRM will supplant IR.  At another level, debate focuses on the &nbsp;'distinctiveness' of HRM from IR
and/or personnel management theory.  &nbsp;&nbsp;However, the debates between the HRM and IR fields have only
been &nbsp;inter-discourse; HRM literature has been almost silent on the subject of &nbsp;IR, while IR has had little
to say about HRM.  This, &nbsp;despite the fact that it could be argued that IR and HRM are simply &nbsp;different
views of the same set of phenomena.  &nbsp;&nbsp;Neither the HRM or IR fields seem able to incorporate the
strengths of &nbsp;the other.  By mapping the underlying paradigms of these two fields, &nbsp;this paper explores
the question: 'What makes the fields of HRM and IR &nbsp;unable to articulate?<p>

<center><b> INNOVATIONS IN INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS AND THEIR LIMITS: THE EXPERIENCE
OF THE FORTEX GROUP LIMITED.<p>
</center>
</b><p>
<center>Bruce Curtis<p>

<center><i>Department of Sociology<p>
University of Canterbury<p>
</center>
</i><p>
<p>
The paper will trace the innovations in doing business achieved by the &nbsp;Fortex Group Limited which
were largely reliant on a reworking of the &nbsp;forms of industrial relations typical to the meat industry. The
paper &nbsp;will go on to account for why these significant developments failed to &nbsp;secure the firm.<p>
<p>
The innovations used by Fortex included: 1) the &nbsp;integration of niche marketing and new forms of
processing; 2) the use of &nbsp;shift work and the move to the year round employment of meatworkers; 3)
&nbsp;the adoption of TQM and teamwork involving the meatworkers' union; and 4) &nbsp;the attempt at new
contracts with its farmer-suppliers in which the union &nbsp;played an important part.<p>
<p>
The causes of the failure of Fortex included: &nbsp;1) the erosion of its competitive edge; 2) the inability to
subordinate &nbsp;its farmers-suppliers; and 3) the vulnerability of the firm in &nbsp;competition for stock.<p>
<p>
In conclusion it will be argued that the study of &nbsp;industrial relations requires an appreciation of not just
the sites where &nbsp;deals between management and labour are produced but of the embeddedness &nbsp;of these
deals within the networks of the industry. Fortex can be said to &nbsp;have fronted an effort to rework the
networks of the industry and &nbsp;although the firm obtained the close support of the meatworkers' union
in &nbsp;its plants it was nevertheless undone by an alignment of interests outside &nbsp;the firm.&nbsp;<p>

<p>
This paper stresses the need for community responses to the ethnic&nbsp;unemployment problem in New
Zealand.  It aims to show the potential for&nbsp;direct employment creation on the basis of a community
entrepreneurship&nbsp;model as well as a widened definition of human capital, using case study of&nbsp;the labour
market disadvantaged community of Otara, in South Auckland.&nbsp;Projects undertaken by Enterprise Otara
are examined. A participatory&nbsp;research methodology, chiefly Formative Evaluation is used. <p>
<p>
This paper also&nbsp;seeks to break down a prevalent view that grassroots responses to&nbsp;unemployment are
necessarily small-scale ventures and to get away from the&nbsp;'small is beautiful' mind-set when Local
Employment Initiatives (ILEs) are&nbsp;involved.  Additionally, the collaborative role of 'outsiders' in
the&nbsp;'bottom-up' approach to employment creation is shown to be important in&nbsp;'getting things moving' at
the community level.  Constraints faced by ILEs&nbsp;are highlighted. The importance of ILEs and the
partnership concept in the&nbsp;mitigation of high unemployment in disadvantaged communities is affirmed.<p>

Changes in the distribution of individual earnings between 1984 and 1995&nbsp;are examined using data from
the Household Economic&nbsp;Survey.  Several dimensions of the earnings&nbsp;structure are considered: measures
of aggregate earnings dispersion or inequality;&nbsp;the gender earnings gap;&nbsp;trends in relative earnings by
level of educational attainment;&nbsp;trends in relative earnings by skill level, as proxied by
occupational&nbsp;group and  real wage trends.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
Evidence is presented on the direction and size of recent changes in&nbsp;these dimensions of the earnings
distribution.   The paper also examines&nbsp;the relationship between employment growth and wage growth.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>

Internationalisation of capital grew rapidly in the post-war period, driven&nbsp;initially by US-based TNCs.
International capitals were able to trade off&nbsp;production conditions in different economies against national
regimes of&nbsp;regulation. Consequently, these regimes were increasingly subject to amendment&nbsp;in order to
attract mobile investment. Such changes were particularly&nbsp;significant for local and national labour
movements. Growing mobility of&nbsp;capital undermined the organisational and locational specificity of
labour.&nbsp;Labour's response was to seek to internationalise collective bargaining in an&nbsp;attempt to impose
an measure of international regulation on international&nbsp;capital. This response, first theorised in the 1960s,
has generally failed.&nbsp;However, with the growth of international regulation of capital in recent years&nbsp;- for
example, the WTO, proposed measures to control international investment,&nbsp;international production
standards, the creation of powerful economic blocs&nbsp;prepared to place labour standards on the agenda
(NAFTA, EU, APEC) - the&nbsp;possibility has arisen for labour to take advantage of international
regulatory&nbsp;developments to press for the international imposition of core labour&nbsp;standards. Initiatives
taken by the ICFTU-APRO in the Asian/South Pacific&nbsp;region illustrate this development. However,
given the nature of contemporary&nbsp;international regulation, labour strategies in this area are not
guaranteed&nbsp;success.&nbsp;<p>

 Recent immigrants express a number of major concerns as they consider employment options in New
Zealand.  Based on a survey of schools in  Auckland in 1995 many  immigrant children from Hong Kong,
Taiwan and South Korea who are about to leave school aspire to managerial, professional and related
jobs but worry about their future employment prospects in New Zealand. <p>
<p>
Large numbers of children of immigrants were not prepared to seek employment in New Zealand citing
the language barrier, racial discrimination and potential unemployment.  These results are discussed in
the wider context of the integration of new immigrants into the local workforce.<p>

<p>
Waikato Mediation Services was formed in 1994. It provides mediation services&nbsp;in wide range of areas.
The vast majority of cases mediated by this&nbsp;organisation have involved private employment mediations.
This has meant that&nbsp;the organisation mediates conflicts between management and staff and
between&nbsp;managers for a wide range of businesses and organisations. Although each&nbsp;dispute is unique
clear patterns have emerged from the large number of cases&nbsp;dealt with so far.<p>
<p>
This paper examines the factors that have influenced the&nbsp;occurrence of the conflicts and discusses the
patterns that have begun to&nbsp;emerge. The conclusion reached is that certain forms of business structure
and&nbsp;management practices increase the likelihood of disputes within the workplace.&nbsp;The paper concludes
that in order to address workplace disputes it is&nbsp;essential that the context within which the dispute arose
be carefully&nbsp;considered before any action is taken by employers.<p>

<center><b> DEFINING CAREERS<p>

<p>
This  paper is generated from a longitudinal, feminist participatory&nbsp;action research project now in its
eighth year. We discuss attempts by&nbsp;our research participants to define their notion of 'career' and&nbsp;their
difficulties in maintaining a definition which is broader than&nbsp;an occupationally based one. Traditional
career definitions do not&nbsp;ascribe value to unpaid work of child rearing and dependency  care -
&nbsp;responsibilities our participants frequently have mapped into their&nbsp;future.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
The concept of 'career' is undergoing some re-definition in the career&nbsp;literature. However, there are
problems in allocating responsibility for careers to individuals when  access to health,&nbsp;education and
retirement expectation are increasingly income&nbsp;related. Women in particular must consider both their
employment participation and their&nbsp;social responsibilities  in their &nbsp;definition of career and for this reason
we challenge any definition  of career which remains defined purely in employment terms.<p>

Income levels and changes in income levels measured from Census data are&nbsp;difficult to interpret because
of the many other changes in the labour force&nbsp;structure and employment.  Between 1986 and 1991 there
was enormous change&nbsp;in the balance of full time and part time employees, and among those&nbsp;employed,
in the occupation structure and the balance between the sexes.&nbsp;This paper examines these changes and
provides estimates of changes in&nbsp;regional income levels.  As most of this period was prior to the
Employment&nbsp;Contracts Act it is relevant to assessing flexibility in the labour market&nbsp;prior to that act.&nbsp;<p>

<center><b> USING RECREATION TO ENHANCE WORK SKILLS. <p>
TRAINEE'S PERCEPTIONS<p>

</center>
People living in rural areas face a variety of limitations on the amount of employment available.  If
young they also feature highly in unemployment statistics.  In a region such as Motueka,  Private
Training Establishments (PTEs) offer a chance for young people to acquire skills to assist them into
employment.<p>
<p>
This research reports on a case study of 24 young people from the Motueka region who attend
government funded training courses run by PTEs.  Their aim is primarily to find people work however
they all use recreational activities as a way of enhancing individual's work readiness. The PTEs offered
a suitable place where young people could develop skills both practical and personal, gain vocational
and personal guidance during the transition between school and work in an area where there is limited
employment opportunities.<p>
<p>
This paper examines what the young people on the course throught of work, the courses they were
attending, the role of PTEs and what role recreation plays in relation to their courses.  The results show
that young people find the PTS, the courses and the recreation more relevant than school.  <p>

<p>
Our research on new settlers from Hong Kong, Taiwan and South Korea has revealed a general
unhappiness with the lack of government planning and preparation to meet the needs of migrants
who had been actively encouraged to come to New Zealand to help establish links with Asia.<p>
<p>
Those who came under the general points system had the impresstion that jobs were avaiable for
those with their skills and qualifications.  In practice overseas qualifications were  often no
recognised and employers preferred those with New Zealand work experience.  When it proved
impossible to find employment or set up business in New Zealand some immigrants chose to leave
the family in New Zealand and return to work in their country of origin.  Families which
expereinced economic and occupational dislocation, and those who were disrupted or separated
as a result of migration were likely to have undergone a difficult adaption process.  For many, in
the first few years of settlement in New Zealand, the dream of a relaxed life-style based around
professional work or business opportunity,  in a peaceful and friendly country was far from being
realised.<p>

<p>
Certain groups in New Zealand society are trapped in cycles of disadvantage dispite an improved
economy.  Part of this problem is associated with persistent exclusion of certain groups in employment
and the transmission of intergenerational unemployment.<p>
<p>
Overseas research suggests that families can act as either a barrier or a sponsor of employment or
unemployment through the transmission of intergeneration advantage or disadvantage.  The paper
explores the significance of social networks of acquaintances, friends and family and discusses how they
act as important mechanisms for finding employment and draws out public policy implications.<p>
<p>
Persistent long-term unemployment is not entirely an economic process but is related to families passing
on social disadvantages to their children. However public policy which is directed at breaking cycles of
disadvantage needs to go beyond focus on family settings and address employment issues themselves<p>

This paper outlines recent developments in the labour market, and&nbsp;discusses the likely outlook over
coming years.  Changes in labour&nbsp;market measures in the past five years have, to varying degrees,
been&nbsp;reversals of the changes that occurred in the late 1980s.  There are&nbsp;some exceptions to this
statement, and differences in the extent of&nbsp;reversal.  Consequently, today's labour market looks
somewhat different&nbsp;from the labour market of the mid-1980s.  In this paper we discuss how&nbsp;today's
labour market differs from that of the mid-1980s, which&nbsp;differences will persist, and what commentators
forecast for the coming&nbsp;years.&nbsp;<p>

<center><b> INEQUALITY AMONGST WORKERS 1981 TO 1991:<p>
TRENDS AND CAUSES.<p>
</center>

</i><p>
The degree of income inequality within the labour market shrank in the&nbsp;early 1980s and grew in the late
1980s. Disaggregating census data of the&nbsp;labour force into age and work/employment status sub-groups,
the changes in&nbsp;income inequality can be separated into four components: (i) within-group inequality&nbsp;(ii)
the effect of change in relative sizes of sub-groups upon within-group&nbsp;inequality, (iii) the effect of change
in relative sizes of sub-groups upon&nbsp;between-group inequality, (iv) the effect of change in relativities of
mean incomes of sub-groups upon between-group inequality.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
By this methodology we find that: (a) change in composition (ie components&nbsp;(ii) and (iii) had little effect
on aggregate income inequality; (b) change&nbsp;between 1981 and 1986 was driven by the within-group
component; and (c)&nbsp;change between 1986 and 1991 was due to both within-group increases in&nbsp;inequality
and divergence of mean incomes of sub-groups.<p>

The paper presents results from the initial stage of a multi-disciplinary&nbsp;research project aimed at
analysing work, wages and well-being at the&nbsp;workplace level.  The research is primarily concerned with
asking how the&nbsp;nature of work varies across workplaces of different sizes and operating in&nbsp;different
environments.  Matched and 'layered' sources of data were&nbsp;collected from 20 workplaces using a
combination of management interviews&nbsp;and structured questionnaires among both employees and
managers. Matching&nbsp;responses from managers and employees allows the information to be presented&nbsp;as
a series of unique case studies. The paper concentrates on a subset of&nbsp;these, drawing workplace
comparisons on the basis of size and type.&nbsp;Preliminary results suggest that, although the process of wage
determination&nbsp;is quite different between small and large firms there are common influences&nbsp;and variables
that can be measured in both. &nbsp;<p>

<p>
Restructuring of the New Zealand economy is believed to  have had quite uneven spatial outcomes,
leading to greater regional disparaties particularly between the major metropolitan and small rural
settlements.   This paper explores this question by examining the labour market experience of both major
and minor urban areas over the period 1981 to 1991.   Changes in the levels of labour force
participation, unemployment ,  work status and the  industrial and occupational composition of those
employed are examined for different categories and locations of settlement.<p>
<p>
The conventional wisdom on the geographic outcomes of reforms in the decade prior to March 1991
is too simple.  Both the outcomes and the problems of measuring labour market response at the local
labour market level are considerably more complex.  More importantly, they raise a number of questions
about the role of regional councils, local authorities in economic development and local employment
creation and  the related social consequences of the lack of a comprehensive regional development
policy.<p>

In the last quarter of this century New Zealand, in common with other &nbsp;developed countries, has seen
significant changes in levels of female labour &nbsp;force participation, and in levels of fertility.  It has been
argued that &nbsp;these two variables are closely associated but analysis of the relationship has been hindered
by a lack of data.  &nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
We have just have carried out the first nationally representative sample &nbsp;survey of NZ women (N=3,000)
aged between 20 and 59 years, covering life &nbsp;history information including employment and fertility. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;This set of retrospective data provides a base for an analysis of the &nbsp;interrelations between employment
and fertility behaviour.  Using cumulative &nbsp;probabilities and hazards modelling the analysis will assess
the relative &nbsp;roles of cohort, period, socio-economic and socio-cultural characteristics &nbsp;in determining
the relationships between employment and fertility.  &nbsp;<p>

<p>
The New Zealand Public Health sector has undergone significant &nbsp;political, legislative and managerial
changes since 1986.  These changes &nbsp;have had a major impact on the nature of employment relations in
the &nbsp;sector.  The unified, state sector industrial relations regime has been &nbsp;restructured and replaced a
by diverse set of practices.&nbsp;Many of the changes of the last decade have had time to&quot;mature&quot; and
&nbsp;become embedded into the system and it now seems appropriate to start to &nbsp;identify issues that have
arisen from the impact of the new regime of &nbsp;employment relations.&nbsp;<p>
<p>
This paper presents the results of a comprehensive survey of related &nbsp;public health sector organisations
including employers, unions, &nbsp;professional organisations, statutory bodies and funding agencies.  Five
&nbsp;distinct areas for future employment relations research, with varying &nbsp;levels of priority, were identified
by the respondents including: 1)workforce development and planning; &nbsp;2) the nature, scope and
negotiation of employment contracts; &nbsp;3) the problematic of people management of largely &quot;professional&quot;
group &nbsp;of workers; 4) relationships with external organisations such as the NZQA and the &nbsp;Health and
Disability Commissioner and the impact on internal &nbsp;employment relations, and &nbsp;5) the effects of
uncertainty about current health care delivery &nbsp;structures and possible further politically directed
restructuring are &nbsp;having on employment relations.&nbsp;<p>

Work pressure has increased for many people in New Zealand in the 1990s.   &nbsp; Around a third of the
workforce work more than 40 hours a week, the   &nbsp;pressure to continuously upskill or reskill is growing,
more women have   &nbsp;joined the workforce, job and career insecurity has increased, and the   &nbsp;eligibility
age for receiving superannuation has risen.  At the same   &nbsp;time, 'under-employment' exist in terms of
part-time workers wanting more   &nbsp;hours and with unemployment stagnant at around six percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
Innovative Danish leave schemes introduced in the 1990s offer one way of   &nbsp;addressing the problems
of work pressure and under-employment   &nbsp;simultaneously.  The paper describes the leave schemes, the
reaction of   &nbsp;the workforce and outlines the associated social and economic costs and   &nbsp;benefits.  In
particular, the analysis will focus on the trade-off   &nbsp;between more employee flexibility, increased
upskilling and improved   &nbsp;family relationships on one hand, and, on the other hand, minimising both  
&nbsp;the fiscal implications and costs on individual employers.   Finally, a   &nbsp;possible application of similar
leave schemes in New Zealand is   &nbsp;discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>

Adults with intellectual disabilities in paid work have voiced a number of concerns regarding their
employment:  independence at work, the continued need for links with formal support,  choices in
lifestyle opportunities and lack of career path options.<p>
<p>
In a central New Zealand region selected agencies were asked to identify adults with intellectual
disabilities who had paid work.  The agencies then forwarded invitations to adults whom they considered
were successfuly employed.  Seventeen workers responded and were interviewed on how they obtained
and learned their job and the initial and on-going support they received.  If permissions were gained from
both parties then important other persons/s were also interviewed.<p>
<p>
As a result of this survey strategies leading to better opportunities and greater employment rates for
adults with intellectual disabilities are offered<p>

<p>
Since the passage of the Employment Contracts Act in 1991, there has been&nbsp;much debate in New
Zealand about prevailing patterns of labour relations.&nbsp;Within the economy as a whole, it has been
suggested that distinctions can&nbsp;be drawn between those workplaces where the Act has been used to
exploit&nbsp;workers in a disadvantaged labour market position, those where the Act has&nbsp;been used to
develop more positive relationships, and those where little&nbsp;change has been experienced.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
The service sector in general, and the hospitality industry in particular,&nbsp;is generally used as an example
of the first of these three strategies.&nbsp;Nevertheless, this conclusion is generally drawn on the basis of
anecdotal&nbsp;evidence. The paper aims to look more widely at the question of labour&nbsp;relations practices,
reporting survey evidence from 1100 workplaces in the&nbsp;&quot;Accommodation Cafes and Restaurants&quot;
industrial sector in New Zealand,&nbsp;followed up by interviews with managers in the industry.  It focuses
on the&nbsp;nature of employment contracts, wage determination, and representation in&nbsp;the industry.  It
concludes that there is evidence to support the&nbsp;contention that the ECA has resulted in an increased
amount of real&nbsp;negotiation in the industry.  It also concludes, however, that the&nbsp;prevailing pattern of
labour relations should be characterised not as&nbsp;exploitative, but rather as a form of benevolent
paternalism.&nbsp;<p>

With the increasing financial pressures being experienced by New &nbsp;Zealand universities, greater attention
is being placed on the &nbsp;performance of academic staff.  The primary aim of this paper is to &nbsp;explore, by
means of a case study of Lincoln University, the role of &nbsp;performance management in the management
of universities; and its &nbsp;influence on academics' employment relationships and careers.&nbsp;&nbsp;<p>
<p>
The paper reviews the overt contractual changes which have occured in &nbsp;the period 1990-1996, and
contrasts them with the covert changes to &nbsp;academics' related psychological contracts.  A mixture of
methods is &nbsp;used based around a survey of academic &nbsp;colleagues which  includes participatory action
research, and &nbsp;participant observation of management policies and processes over the
&nbsp;period.&nbsp;&nbsp;Conclusions are drawn about the outcomes of changes in management &nbsp;policy and practice. 
Suggestions are made for improved university-&nbsp;academic employment relations and viable academic
careers.<p>

This paper examines the effect that the demographic trends are having on both the workforce and
organisations.  Based on US, Australian as well as New Zealand research the paper draws three main
conclusions: firstly, that the older quartile of the workforce is disproportionately affected by changes in
work patterns;  secondly, that  the extent and nature of this change tends to be hidden and requires
highlighting;  thirdly, overseas evidence suggest that New Zealand organisations will have to reassess
'ageist' attitudes in order to ensure an adequate supply of skilled  labour.<p>

<center><b> PLUS &#231;A CHANGE ....:<p>
THE EMPLOYMENT CONTRACTS ACT AND NON-STANDARD<p>
EMPLOYMENT IN NEW ZEALAND 1991-1995<p>

<p>
The aim of this paper is to discuss and analyse changes in the incidence&nbsp;and distribution of non-standard
employment in New Zealand since the&nbsp;introduction of the Employment Contracts Act in May 1991.
Non-standard&nbsp;employment is defined as employment that is not permanent and full-time.&nbsp;The analysis
is based upon data from national surveys, one of 2000&nbsp;workplaces in May 1991 and another of 5,200
workplaces in May 1995.<p>
<p>
One of&nbsp;the chief policy objectives of the Employment Contracts Act was to enhance&nbsp;labour market
flexibility. Non-standard employment is one indicator of&nbsp;labour market flexibility. Accordingly, the
degree of change in&nbsp;non-standard employment is one indicator of the Act's success or lack of it&nbsp;in
achieving its policy objectives. The results show that the Act has not&nbsp;been associated with a substantial
gorwth in non-standard employment. The&nbsp;1995 New Zealand labour force looks a lot like the 1991
labour force. The&nbsp;proportion of permanent full-time employees has hardly changed since 1991,&nbsp;and
remains at more than than two-thirds of the workforce. The two areas of&nbsp;employment to show
substantial change were casual employment, which has&nbsp;declined since 1991 and fixed term employment
which has increased. The&nbsp;change in casual employment is in the reverse direction from that expected&nbsp;by
both critics and supporters of the Act. The data also show, however,&nbsp;that while employers expect
permanent full-time employment to remain&nbsp;predominant, they also expect non-standard employment to
rise considerably&nbsp;in the next five years.&nbsp;<p>

<center><b> THE TRANSFORMATION ON NEW ZEALAND'S OCCUPATION SAFETY AND HEALTH
(OSH)  LEGISLATION AND ADMINISTRATION FROM 1981 TO 1992: A CASE OF
REACTIONARY POLITICS.<p>
</center>
</b><p>
<center>
John Wren<p>
<p>
<i>Dept Sociology,  Massey University<p>
</i><p>
</center>
From 1981 to 1992 New Zealand's occupational safety and health&nbsp;(OSH) legislation and administration
has undergone a significant&nbsp;transformation. At the beginning of the period the situation can be&nbsp;described
as system of  &quot;Government Management&quot;, by 1990 a system of&nbsp;&quot;Tripartite Management&quot; had been
partially introduced, in 1992 a new system&nbsp;of  &quot;Employer Hazard Management&quot; had replaced existing
arrangements.<p>
<p>
How&nbsp;did this transformation occur, why did it occur, and how does it compare&nbsp;with overseas
examples?&nbsp;&nbsp;The transformation represents a case of  reactionary politics. At the social&nbsp;level, change was
a reaction to fears in the community about&nbsp;the dangers associated with the advent in New Zealand of
large complex&nbsp;industrial plants, and the introduction of new chemicals.  At the&nbsp;institutional level of
organised actors, change was the result of reaction&nbsp;against perceived inadequacies in the existing
legislative and administrative arrangements, and responses to positions adopted by&nbsp;competing actors. 
At the individual level change came about&nbsp;as organisations responded to the initiatives of certain
individuals.   By&nbsp;1992, the colonial reliance upon overseas policy examples had been replaced&nbsp;with policy
initiatives that reflected the level of  knowledge amongst&nbsp;government officials, and the dominant  forms
of OSH management practiced&nbsp;by large New Zealand companies.<p>

<h2>
Casual Employment Contracts- their status in the current climate

<p>

<h3>Key issues for discussion</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>What is casual employment? Definitional issues.
<li>How does casual employment fit within the Employment Contracts Act regime?
On the one hand it seems to be the epitome of the Employment
Contracts Act free market, contractual approach. On the other hand, casual
workers may well be a group in most need of the protection offered in the
personal grievance procedures.  They may be seen as workers with very
little bargaining power and even more volnerable under a strict contractual
approach.
<li>What access to personal grievance remedies is there for casual workers.
particularly at the ned of their employment?
<li>How have the specialist employment courts dealth with grievances brought
before them by what the employers have argued are casual workers?
<li>What are the possible analytical appraoches that could be taken to
casual employment contracts?
<ol>
<li>Each casual engagement is characterised as a separate contract
but it exists within an overall umbrella contract governing the whole
employment relationship.
<li>The concept of legitimate expectation could be developed to
provide ongoing rights fo casual workers.
<li>Fixed term contract principles could be applied to casual
employment contracts.
<li>The casual employment label could be ignored and the reality of
the employment relationship examined, along with any ongoing commitments. 
Only a very limited number of contracts would fall under a true "casual"
label.
</ol>
<li>In the light of the current Court of Appeal decisions, are any of these
scenarios likely?

<h2>
Societal implications of the recommodification of labour
</h2>
<p>
Led by Paul Harris,  Centre for Labour and Trade Union Studies, Waikato
University
</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Discussion points</h3>
<p>
<ol>
<li>The CTU supports the ILO philosophy that 'labour is not a commodity' . 
One of the objectives/effects of the ECA has been to recommodify labour, ie
to have wages determined by market forces rather than social or equity
considerations-as it had been in one form or another from 1894. 
<p>
Q1 To what extent could a change of industrial relations law by a new
government reverse that process?
<p>
<li>In answering the above, we must also note that the recommodification of
labour is only part of a wider process of commidification/recommodification
which includes deregulation and privatisation and which is now in its 12th
year of application.   
<p>
Q2 To what extent does this more general and wide ranging process make it
unlikely/impossible to reverse the recommodification of labour without a
wholesale reorganisation of our whole political economy?
<p>
<li>recommodification process must also be seen in the context of a
trend to decollectivisation and individualisation in the developed Western
democracies that originates at least in the 1960's and cannot be reduced to
the outcomes of a neo-liberal response to economic recession. 
<p>
Q3 What implications do decollectivisation and individualisation have for
the future of social democratic/socialist movements and trade unions? 
<p>
<li>Following Beck, it is arguable that we are now entering a 'post-class'
era of 'risk society' in which pertinent themes are greater individual
choice, greater individual insecurity and the individualisation of
inequality.
<p>
Q4 Can we invent a relevant politics which is based on the new realities
of risk society and at the same time is a rejection of the banalities of
neo-liberalism?

This paper examines the initiatives that local authorities in New Zealand have taken since the late 1970s
to facilitate the economic development of their districts and local employment creation.  The paper will
examine why local autorities have become involved in both issues, the variation across them in both level
and range of initiatives and degrees of effectiveness.  Several case  studies will highlight a number of the
opportunitites as well as the difficulties involved.<p>
<p>
The paper concludes that while local authorities have attempted to play a constructive and responsible
role there are still a number of unresolved issues concerning their role in economic development and
employment creation.  This paper argues that local authorities should be involved,  and have the
autonomy to act and be able to development and implement a range of effective programmes to address
local employment issues.<p>

<h1>Automatic Target Detection and Recognition</h1>

The Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) is
funding a project on 
``Automatic Target Detection and Recognition,'' which represents a
collaborative research effort between the CDSP Center and the Center for
Electromagnetic Research (CER) involving Profs. Anthony Devaney, Mieczyslaw
Kokar, Hanoch Lev-Ari, Elias Manolakos and Ram Raghavan, and spanning
disciplines ranging from electromagnetic theory through digital signal
processing to data fusion.  The major theme of this research is <i>scale
recursive signal processing</i>. In particular, it aims to develop, test, and
evaluate innovative target detection and identification algorithms that
operate recursively from coarse to fine scale in a multiresolution analysis
of target and/or data space.  The models employed in the study apply to
specific classes of applications that include synthetic aperture radar (SAR),
high range resolution radar (HRR), and other imaging modalities. The problems
addressed range from target detection in a high clutter environment through
recursive image deconvolution to neural network classification for the
purpose of target identification from spotlight SAR imagery. One of the goals
of this project is to develop techniques that allow for the use of
complementary data and information from multiple sensors by fusing this data
with available interpretable information about target features.<p>

<h1>System Identification for Robust Control</h1>

An NSF research grant entitled ``System
Identification for Robust Control'' 
was awarded to Clas Jacobson and Gilead Tadmor. The grant No. ECS-9303356 
is  for two years, effective September 15, 1993.<p>
The project concerns the development of effective methodologies for 
experimental measurement based (``black box'') modelling of systems. The 
particular objective is to develop identification algorithms that are 
associated with explicit error bounds (as opposed to mere guarantees of
asymptotic convergence) and that such bounds will be commensurate with
the requirements of state of the art robust design methods in control 
and communications. An emphasis will be made on non stationary processes
and on practical aspects, such as the integration of probabilistic and worse
case methods. The envisioned project will include both a theory
development and a hardware experimental component.<p>

<title>Research on Network Information Theory</title>
<h1>Research in Network Information Theory</h1>

This work  is concerned with research in network information theory with emphasis on the  
development and analysis of new coding techniques for efficient matching of correlated  
information sources to multi-terminal channels and the conditions under which these coding  
schemes are optimal. The new coding schemes are based on joint source and channel coding 
rather than separate coding for source and channel. The performance of new 
coding techniques is compared to the existing schemes and also to separate 
coding for the information source and the communication channel. Special 
emphasis is placed on the investigation of the performance of the proposed 
coding schemes under various types of channel impairments, such as symbol and 
block asynchronism. Different types of source-channel configurations, including 
cases with feedback, are studied and the possibility of optimal separate 
source and channel coding in each case is investigated.<p>

<h1>Multiuser Receiver and Network Protocol Design for Shallow Water
Acoustic Local Area Networks</h1>

Recent effort by WHOI and NU has demonstrated that several cochannel
and asynchronous signals, such as those from independent modems in
the same band, may be demodulated simultaneously without
retransmission.  This ability is critical for the development of
efficient, dynamic protocols to orchestrate the transmission of data
from many modems to a central harbor site, and it would preclude the
need for global synchronization, minimize handshaking and
accompanying delays, and conserve modem battery power by avoiding
retransmissions.  The further development of these multiuser
receivers and accompanying protocols would be the focus of the
student supported by this grant, and the results would contribute
directly to the shallow-water Acoustic Local Area Network (ALAN)
project.<p>

This project provides support for one graduate student to pursue
basic research for a three-year period in issues related to
low-complexity, asynchronous multiuser detection.  It is envisioned
that the graduate student will focus on two areas pertaining directly
to the underwater ALAN project.  The first direction is multiuser
receiver design for dynamic, dispersive, multiple-access channels.
It is of interest to develop low-complexity receivers with known
decoding delay, which demodulate the data from several
symbol-asynchronous modems which operate in the same narrow
transmission band.  Particular attention will be given to receivers
which exhibit some degree of near-far resistance, that is, the
ability to demodulate the data from several modems which exhibit an
imbalance of received power.  In this way, the need for power control
is reduced or obviated entirely at the network protocol level, and
the low probability of intercept is ensured for more distant modems.
In addition, the student is expected to pursue the design of
multiuser receivers which are robust to channel mismatch.  This is a
desirable attribute for receivers which operate in dynamic channels
and are subject to amplitude, Doppler, multipath, and phase tracking
errors.  The student will have access to experimental observations in
a multiple-access, shallow-water channel, which would guide the
receiver design.<p>

The student will also continue the development of network protocols
for shallow-water ALAN.  While the ALAN is conceptually similar to a
terrestrially-based store-and-forward network, there are significant
reasons why existing protocols are not suited to the shallow-water
channel: the speed of acoustical propagation forces handshaking and
ack/nacks to produce a much larger delay than in radio or lightwave
networks, the modems are powered by batteries which are not easily
replaced, and the transmission channel is much more dynamic and
dispersive than coax, optical or mobile radio channels.  The student
will propose and analyze protocols which are suited to these
differences, using in part the OPNET network simulator.<p>

This work of Professor David Brady was funded by ARPA.<p>

<h1>Parallel Processing Algorithms and Architectures Synthesis
            for the Estimation of Higher Order Statistics</h1>

Professor Elias S. Manolakos received  a Research Initiation Award
from the National Science Foundation, totaling \$89,991 for three years.
The research supported by this NSF grant aims at the design of new parallel
algorithms and parallel processing architectures for the estimation
of higher order moments, cumulants and their frequency domain counterparts,
known as polyspectra. The ultimate objectives of the proposed research are:<p>
<ul>
<li>to systematically 
synthesize  optimal VLSI architectures for the estimation of all the
lags of moments and cumulants, up to the fourth order,<p>
<li>to systematically
synthesize VLSI architectures for the computation of the
Bispectrum and the Trispectrum,<p>
<li>to design parallel algorithms for the efficient
estimation of higher order statistics in general purpose SIMD and
MIMD multiprocessor platforms.<p>
</ul>

The proposed research aims to extend the existing space-time 
algorithm-to-architectures mapping methodologies in directions that
will make possible:<p>
<ul>
<li> the localization of nested-loop algorithms driven 
by architectural constraints and designer-specified optimality
criteria,<p>
<li> the systematic synthesis of optimally interfaced multi-stage
     architectures.<p>
<li> establishing a link between mapping methodologies traditionally
used for VLSI architectures synthesis and automated 
techniques used to parallelize scientific code targeting general 
purpose supercomputers,<p>
<li> the development  of intelligent 
and interactive CAD tools assisting the non-expert
scientific programmer in identifying and exploiting the available
parallelism.<p>
</ul>

<h1>Signal Processing with Realistic Constraints
for the Inverse Problem of Electrocardiography</h1>

The objective of this research is to develop
improved methods 
to extract  
information about cardiac electrical activity from non-invasive
measurements of electrical activity on the torso surface, the so-called
``inverse problem of electrocardiography''.  This inverse problem is
ill-conditioned and constraints must be imposed to obtain realistic
solutions. This research will focus on developing a wide variety of
characterizations of electrical activity on the heart surface, including
both time and frequency domain behavior. These characterizations will then
be used as realistic constraints in inverse solutions. Several new
techniques will be applied to the inverse problem itself using these
constraints; these include the use of joint time and space constraints
(designed from a filtering perspective), frequency domain power spectrum
reconstruction techniques, characterization of the solution in terms of
inherent uncertainties, and studying the effects of using error measures
other than least squares.<p>

This work of Professor Dana Brooks was funded by
NSF as a Research Initiation Award, September 1993.<p>

  I am interested in obtaining copies of your papers on recurrent neural
equalization, especially the MILCOM paper. Is there any way to get these
via the Web ? 
   Also, in the "Future Research Directions" section of  "Using Recurrent Neural Networks
for Adaptive Communications Channel Equalisation" there was mention of combining 
a recurrent net with a linear filter, switching between them as dictated by the 
spectral nature of the regime. Have there been any publications since
that used this aapproach ?

 Thanks for your help.

<h1> Sonsie </h1>

Written by <b>George Kechriotis</b>. Any opinions expressed are
purely personal. <p>

November 16, 1995<p>

Sonsie is located in Newbury street, towards the Mass Ave side.
It is being advertised as a "funky" cafe, bistro etc. It is very 
popular lately, it even attracts movie personalities (couple of
weeks ago my friends told me that they recognized Dan Acroyd (spelling?)).
<p>

Till 11.00 it only serves dinner, which is quite expensive. I think 
most of the plates are Italian or French and plates may as expensive as
$20 !!!. I only once ate there and I had the focacia (bread with olive
oil and garlic) that was the only plate I could afford! Well, food is
good there but only go there if you want to take out your girl-friend 
to be, or for some other special occasion. <p>

After 11.00pm it operates as a bar too, so you can go there to have 
a beer or a coffe which are reasonably priced. <p>

If you go there on a weekend (especially Friday or Saturday night)
be prepared to stay in a line. Usually it does not take that long to 
get in and the doorman is very polite, but when its cold outside it
sucks! All kinds of people go there so you can see there rich Arabs
handing their Porsche's and BMW's to the Vallet parking as well as 
students from Northeastern, BU and MIT. <p>

The rumor has it that its the place to be on Thursdays. I personaly
prefer something more quiet. <p>

<h1> ELI Computer junk resellers </h1>

Written by <b>George Kechriotis</b>. Any opinions expressed are
purely personal. <p>

November 16, 1995<p>

ELI, is located in Cambridge somewhere near Kendall Square, and Lechmere.
Its the place where both me and my wife bought our first 
<a href="vt100.htm">VT100</a> terminals
for about $120 back in 1989. It's one of the places I like, although I 
haven't been there for a long time now. I used to have a stock of several 
weird thinds such as used laser diodes, used SUN machines, lots of transistors,
resistors, cables etc. Maybe now it would have some 286's and 386's, so I 
would like to go to check it out sometime. <p>

I remember my friends Vassilis and Vagellis who went there by the T
(public transportation) and happily carried their super-heavy VT100!
all the way back to the tiny dorm rooms at Emanuel College, Fenway 
Park. We were young and innocent back then. <p>

<h1> Trident Cafe </h1>

Written by <b>George Kechriotis</b>. Any opinions expressed are
purely personal. <p>

November 16, 1995<p>

Located on Newbury Street, near the end facing Mass Ave. opposite
to <a href="sonsie.html">Sonsie</a> Cafe and Bistro. Its a compination
of bookstore and cafe. One can take a book or a magazine from the stands
and then go to a table and read it drinking coffe or 
<a href="beer.html">beer</a>.
Students and intellectuals offten go there. It serves some food
too, mainly sandwiches or pastries but the quantity of disanalogous
to the cost. Otherwise, coffe and beer are reasonably priced and given 
the fact that one can sit there and read any magazine (even international 
ones) I highly recommend it if you just want to spend a quiet evening
alone. <p>

<h1> Cafe Armani </h1>

Author: Demetris Lakkas <p>

Cafe Armani is located on 'yuppy' Newbury street in Boston. It is actually more of a restaurant than a cafeteria, although there is some decent coffee there, especially iced (my favorite, which is also reasonably priced at $1.50). <p>

The cafe attracts mainly Boston's yuppies, i.e. young wealthy American professionals and well-off international students. The cafe is relatively small in size, hence the difficulty in finding an empty table most of the time. <p>

Adjacent to the cafe area is located Armani's Emporium, which features the pricey Armani line of clothes (Orientals seem to be extremely fond of them). <p>

The cafe offers a relatively large variety of food items (including desserts like my favorite Torta De La Nona), most of which are quite tasty but overpriced (I guess you pay for the environment too, which is quite nice). <p>

My favorite time of the week at the cafe is Saturday night, between 10 and closing time (around 1 am). There are plenty of interesting people to chat with (most of them fairly regular there) and good music, which is not that loud, allowing for fairly quiet discussion. <p>

Armani's management takes full advantage of the cafe's popularity and well-off clientelle, which is manifested by a handfull of strange house rules (certainly by European standards). No more than five people can sit at any of the outside tables (during the summer season that is). You cannot sit at a table inside unless you actually eat something, even when there are plenty of tables available (this explains my preference in iced coffee at the bar, where nobody bothers you, although it can sometimes be hard to find an empty seat). <p>

Weird rules and early closing hours aside (by 1 am at the latest - way too early for a Greek), the cafe Armani is still my favorite spot on Newbury, probably because it is the closest thing to a true European cafe (being European myself, I admit I am partial in this matter). Even the waitresses are good-looking and generally efficient in their job. <p>

Overall, I recommend the place heartily (that is if you don't mind being turned down from seating at a table without ordering something eadible).
<p>

Cafe Armani is a parallel of a Porsche. There is no alternative.

I'm not that much into bying or listing to music (I only 
bought 2-3 CDs in my life). Maybe Dimitris or Anna know more.

<h1> Averof </h1>

Written by <b>George Kechriotis</b>. Any opinions expressed are
purely personal. <p>

November 16, 1995<p>

Averof was located on Mass Ave, in Porter Square. About 6 months
ago it closed and now its a Korean or Japanese Quisine place. 
Averof was one of the places where the Boston greeks went to 
hear live greek music, and watch bely dancing. The rumor has it
that it was first found by a sailor of the 1912 veteran greek 
battleship Averof and that's where its name came from. Over the
years it has changed many owners, the last one I remember was 
I think Libanese or Palestinian (he could even speek some broken
Greek though!). <p>

Well, I think I've been in Averof two or three times. The first time
it was about the time I first came to Boston and I went there with 
my friends Dimitris (Mitsos) and Vaggelis and my wife Anna. We 
were honored to listen to a unique performance of the cousin (!) 
of the famous greek gupsy singer, Angelopoulos, and the rising 
star of the greek music scene, Eleonora (who used to go from table 
to table and amuse the customers, and who also was known among the
second generation greeks as "Ellinara"). Well, that was fun. <p>

I can not remember any other time I've been in Averof. Once we went 
there with a dozen veteran greek friends and finally they decided 
not to go because the music was too oriental. <p>

that comes with fried potatoes, salad and usually bread. <p>

<h1> The Greek Corner </h1>

Written by <b>George Kechriotis</b>. Any opinions expressed are
purely personal. <p>

November 16, 1995<p>

It's one of the best places for Greek food in Boston. It's 
located on Mass Ave, in Cambridge, I think it's between
Porter and Harvard Square but I might be wrong. I've been 
there last night with 
<a href="anna.html">Anna</a>, 
<a href="tsiounis.html">Yiannis</a>,
<a href="melina.html">Melina</a>, 
<a href="kyriakos.html">Kyriakos</a>, 
Hara, 
George,
<a href="stellak.html">Haris</a>
 and Petros. I highly recommend the soulvaki sandwich
whose taste is very close to the original, Greek souvlaki.
It costs about $3.50. The appetizers are maybe the best 
offering. The <a href=calamari.html>calamari</a>, 
greek loukaniko, saganaki and tzatziki
are excelent. The ideal situation is to go there with many friends
so that you can order as many appetizers as possible and share 
them. It also offers Greek beer (Olympia I think) that is not 
any different from American beer but its about the same price. <p>

Its also known as Themis, (Themis is the very nice owner of
Greek corner, sometimes he cooks as well). It was first 
discovered by Antonis and Athina and since then it has been 
a favorite place of many people, especially Tasos and Julia.
(Elena and Haris like this place too, so it seems). <p>

<h1><b>Oliv</b></h1>
Oliv didn't have to appear here because she isn't a place in Boston,
but Oliv can appear everywhere.
Oliv is not Bostonian either , but Irish by birth and Greek by residency.
What is Oliv? She is not a girl but she is beautiful and clever as one (girl).
Oliv is Anna's dog, black, fat (slightly overweighed) and Cocker Spaniel.
She can understand Greek and she is working (over the phone) on her English.
Anna is very fond of her and she misses her badly.

<P>
<P>Professor Ram Raghavan joined the Department of Electrical and
Computer Engineering in 1985 after having received his PhD degree from
the University of Massachusetts at Amherst.
<P>
Dr. Raghavan's research interests are in the area of
statistical signal processing with applications to adaptive detection
and estimation algorithms. His current work involves the development
of adaptive detection strategies for multi-dimensional signals in
non-stationary noise (sponsored by the U.S. Air Force) and the
development of algorithms for detection and recognition of signals in
a multi-resolution framework (sponsored by ARPA). During the Summer of
1994, Dr. Raghavan worked at the Naval Air Warfare Center (NAWC),
Warminster, PA, as an ASEE faculty research fellow, where he developed
adaptive algorithms for detecting weak targets in non-Gaussian
noise. Dr. Raghavan serves as a regular technical reviewer for the
IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems.

<P>
<P>Professor Tadmor received the BS degree from Tel Aviv University
and the MS 
and PhD degrees from the Weizmann Institute of Science
(Israel) in 
Mathematics (Systems and Controls) in 1977, 1979 and 1984, respectively.
He  spent 
1985-1987 as a Chaim Weizmann Post-Doctoral Fellow, visiting M.I.T.
Before joining Northeastern University in 
1989, he held research and faculty positions also at Brown University and
the University of Texas.
<P>
Dr. Tadmor's past research covered areas of distributed parameter 
systems, discrete event control systems, robust and optimal control and 
system identification. His current interests concern both issues in basic
system theory and applications, particularly to control and estimation 
problems involving electric drives and power. Professor Tadmor is a 
Senior Member of IEEE. His research is currently supported by the National
Science Foundation and the Army Research Office.

<P>
<P>Professor  Brooks received the PhD degree in Electrical Engineering in
1991, the MSEE in 1988, and the BSEE in 1986, all from Northeastern
University. In addition he earned a BA in English from Temple
University in 1972. He was the 
recipient of a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship in 1988 and an
American Electronic Association Fellowship in 1987. He is a
coinventor of a patent in the area of the inverse problem of
electrocardiography.
<P>
<P>Dr. Brooks' research interests focus primarily on biomedical
 applications of digital signal and image processing. His current
 projects in the area of electrocardiography include work on the
 inverse problem of electrocardiography, on  quantification of
 multi-sensor time-varying electrical patterns on the heart and torso
 surface, on the development of realistic bounds on a large number of
 measures of these patterns, and on the use of the wavelet transform to
 study both these multi-sensor patterns as well as single-lead
 signals. He also is 
 involved in projects studying respiration modulation of heart sounds
 during anaesthesia, and a comparison study of time-series based
 features extracted from surface electromyograph signals  for the
 purpose of control of a lower arm prosthesis. He also has research
 interests in higher-order spectra, and digital
 signal processing with chaotic signals and systems.

research scientist with Integrated Systems, Inc., Palo Alto, CA from 1982 to
1984.  During 1985 he held a joint appointment as an adjunct research
professor of Electrical Engineering with the Naval Postgraduate School,
Monterey, CA and as a research associate with the Information Systems
Laboratory at Stanford. During 1987-1988 he also consulted to Saxpy Computer
Corp. He stayed at Stanford as a senior research associate until 1990, when
he joined Northeastern University. Professor Lev-Ari served as an Associate
Editor of <i>Circuits, Systems and Signal Processing</i>, and of <i>Integration, the VLSI
Journal</i>.
<P>
<P>Professor Lev-Ari is currently supervising four PhD candidates and one MS
student. His research interests include model-based spectrum analysis and
estimation for non-stationary signals, scale-recursive (wavelet-based)
detection and estimation of random signals, and adaptive linear and
non-linear filtering techniques, with applications to channel equalization,
over-the horizon (OTH) radar, automatic target detection and recognition, and
array processing of high-frequency signals.  His past research has involved a
number of mathematical techniques and a variety of applications in signal
processing and linear systems, including: lossless cascade models for
multiple-input/multiple-output systems; extension of maximum-entropy
techniques to multi-dimensional signal processing; and characterization of
structured matrices.

<title>Neural Networks for Automatic Target Detection and Recognition</title>
<h1>Neural Networks for Automatic Target Detection and Recognition</h1>

The goal of this research was  to develop multi-layer feedforward neural
network architectures that could effectively distinguish targets (mines) from
background clutter in side-scan sonar images.  We have been
provided  with a very noisy, real-world data set,
and  no information whatsoever about the operating
conditions and the ocean floor where the data
have been acquired. These sonar images contained <i> only</i>
echo-intensity and no frequency-domain information,
making  the formulation of an accurate  statistical model 
extremely difficult. Suitable neural network models able to
``discover" patterns in noisy input data, seemed aptly suited for 
this type of problem.  

<p> A variety of neural network architectures have been considered
simulated, and evaluated in an attempt to find the best approach 
for this particular application [1,2,3]. 
However, constraints have been
imposed upon candidate neural models both by the problem itself 
and by the requirements of the target hardware system which would eventually
be used to implement the detection of mines  in real-time, namely the
Analog VLSI <i> Integrated Neurocomputing Architecture</i> (INCA/1)
developed by the C.S. Draper Laboratory in Cambridge Mass.
The choice of pre-processing algorithms was limited by the goal of 
mear real-time performance. The choice of networks was limited to feed-forward
with less than  $64$ units per layer, such that they could be realized
by  INCA/1.  It has been found that classical statistical 
features extraction is outperformed by a much less computationally intensive
approach that simultaneously compresses and filters the raw data by taking 
a simple window mean. The correct target-detect-clutter-reject rate of the best
network (25-50-50-2) was 97.5% on training data set and 92.8% on test data. 

<p> Recently we started investigating the synergistic role
of <i> multiresolution</i> image analysis (based on wavelet filters) 
and neural networks based classifiers, on the problem of
target detection using  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.
We are considering <i> hierarchical</i> classification schemes, where  
small-size neural networks, attached at different scale-level leaves of the 
analysis tree, provide independent opinions in parallel. These partial
views are then combined using an adaptive decision mechanism.
It is conjectured that appropriately designed simple neural classifiers
may <i> collectively</i> achieve good detection performance in real-time. 
Since each classifier is working with a smaller than the original 
fine-resolution image, and in parallel with the others, 
fast target  detection is expected. 
We are investigating adaptive techniques that will determine
from  the data which scales (and  corresponding neural network opinions)
the global decision mechanism should weight more.

<h1>Our Research</h1>
<hr>

This section provides a summary of  results that have been the
outcome of selected on-going or completed research  projects 
of the <i> Parallel Processing \& Architectures</i> group,
during the last four years.

The group was formed by <a href="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/htmls/manolakos.html">Prof. Elias S. Manolakos</a>, with main
objectives:

<b><ul>
<li> to derive efficient algorithms for challenging
signal/image/neuro processing applications.

<p>
<li>to derive systematic synthesis methods for the transformation of a
sequential algorithm to parallel architectures.

<p>
<li>to investigate how concurrency can be exploited for high performance
in general purpose Massilely Parallel Processing (MPP)
machines, as well as in Application Specific Arrays of Processors (ASAP's).

<p>
<li>to study the fault tolerance capabilities of parallel architectures.
</ul> </b>

The research efforts of the group 
are supported from the <i> National Science Foundation</i>
(NSF) and the <i> Advanced Projects Research Agency</i> (ARPA) through
grants to Dr. Manolakos. Of primary importance to the group was also
to foster collaboration between the CDSP Center and
its industrial affiliates. During the last four years major R \& D 
groups in the greater Boston area (such as the Draper Lab., Digital,
Aware Inc. etc.)  have provided Scholarships/Assistantships to
graduate students doing research on jointly supervised
projects of common interest. <p>

Since 1990, eight (8) <a href="who.html">graduate students</a> of the group,
from either the <i> Signal Processing</i> or the <i> Computer Engineering</i> 
concentrations  of the ECE Dept., have
completed their dissertations/theses  under Prof. Manolakos' guidance.
Currently six other dissertations/theses are in progress (2 started in 1994). <p>

<title>Parallel Processing for the Computation of Higher Order
Statistics</title>
<h1>Parallel Processing for the Computation of Higher Order
Statistics</h1>

This project is concerned with the systematic derivation of parallel
computational structures for the efficient non-parametric
estimation of Higher Order Statistics (HOS), such as the <i> moments</i>,
<i> cumulants</i> and their frequency-domain counterpart <i> (polyspectra)</i>,
directly from the samples on an one-dimensional data sequence.
It aims at synthesizing both Application Specific Array Processor
(ASAP) architectures for real-time performance,  as well as 
parallel algorithms for readily available general purpose
massively parallel machines used to speed-up scientific 
and engineering applications that require the 
computation of Higher Order Statistics. <p>


The starting point of our research is the observation that
traditional array synthesis methodologies suffer from the
following  major drawback.
They are based on the mapping of  a Locally Recursive Algorithm   (LRA)
that is usually selected <i> arbitrarily</i> among the numerous
behavior preserving ones for the a problem. 
This is a consequence of the fact that 
the two synthesis phases (localization of the algorithm's dependencies
and mapping to a parallel architecture) have traditionally been treated 
as two independent steps. Following a two-phase approach, it is possible 
that no architecture is found that meets the design objectives, 
or that a good mapping  choice leads to a suboptimal architectures
due to the inappropriate selection of the LRA in the first place. <p>


To alleviate this problem we have developed <i> Constraint Driven 
Localization</i> (CDL), a unified methodology that starting from a nested-loop 
signal processing algorithm, allows the construction and 
characterization of all equivalent (behavior preserving) algorithms 
with localized data dependencies, that after a linear space-time mapping are
guaranteed to leed to parallel computing structures satisfying
specified architectural constraints and performance levels.
The main advantages of CDL are the following:
First, the search space os maintained as large as possible by not fixing 
from the beginning the LRA. In this way it is possible to  find 
pairs of space-time transformations that yield different, yet optimized,
architectures. Furthermore by deriving closed-form  expressions for all the 
permissible linear schedules and their   latency,
all synthesis results are parametrized by the problem size. 
This is useful when mapping  multi-dimensional nested-loop algorithms 
onto two-dimensional architectures, where the schedule elements 
(and consequently the resulting latency) are functions of the problem size.
In addition, the availability of parameterized 
results is very useful when synthesizing  multi-stage architectures. 
By deriving  and characterizing families of solutions for every 
stage, one may select at the end   <i> the pair</i> of array solutions that is
optimally space-time matched, thus simplifying the in-between 
stages interconnection strategy. <p>


As detailed below, we applied CDL in order to systematically 
synthesize ASAP's for:
(a) the estimation of all moment lags (in a 
non-redundant region of support) up to the fourth order
[1,2] 
(b) the parallel computation of fourth order cumulants,
via the second and fourth order moments [1,3](c) the time-recursive updating of moment estimates based
on a sliding window approach [1,4].
The development of CDL led to substantial improvement of solutions
proposed earlier for the same problems and reported in 
[5,6,7,8,9,10]. <p>

<title>Derivation of a Higher Order Moments Generating Array Architecture</title>
<h1>Derivation of a Higher Order Moments Generating Array Architecture</h1>

By using a unified synthesis methodology we have synthesized 
[2] a family of <i> triangular</i>  $M\times M$ array processors 
that receive as input the $M$ samples of a block of an one-dimensional 
data sequence and provide  estimates of  all higher order moment lags
in a non-redundant region of support, and up to a desired order $k$.
For most applications $k=4$ is sufficient and in that case each
Processing Element (PE) consists of a pipeline of 
Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units 
with $k=4$ stages. All sets of permissible linear schedules that lead to
simple distributed control and achieve minimum latency (equal to $M(M-1)+4$)
have been found and characterized in terms of $M$. For $k>4$,
and if such case becomes of  practical interest in the future, it is possible
to use the same architecture and simply add more MAC  stages to
each PE pipeline, as the maximum desired order of estimates increases. <p>

The number of memory buffers per processor does not depend on the 
data block size $M$ ($O(1)$ local memory requirements per PE),
a very desired property if partitioning and matching to fixed size arrays
is to be used for vary large $M$'s. 
This was made possible by selecting <i> that</i> pair of
minimum latency schedule <b> T</b> and dependencies matrix <b> D</i>, 
among numerous permissible choices, that would yield 
a vector  $<b> T</b>\cdot <b> D</b>$ with elements independent of $M$.
The availability of such a choice was identified by using the unified
synthesis methodology <i> to first construct a good  LRA</i>(<b> D</b>)
before attempting any mapping.
Therefore the family of solutions reported in 
[2] are far more superior (in terms of area and performance),
compared to earlier solutions reported in
[5,6](requiring $O(M)$ local memory per PE and higher
latency) derived using an arbitrarily selected valid LRA, as usually done
when employing  traditional array synthesis methods.

<title>Derivation of a Fourth Order Cumulants Parallel Computing Architecture</title>
<h1>Derivation of a Fourth Order Cumulants Parallel Computing Architecture</h1>

In signal processing applications where the
underlying process assumes a symmetric probability density function
third order cumulants  may not be useful, and since the higher the order the
larger the variance of sample estimators, one is more likely to
employ Fourth Order Cumulants (4OC's).
A typical case arises in digital 
communications where symmetric signal constellations
are common and this  is one of the reasons why 4OC's  based methods have been
proved  successful in blind equalization of non-minimum phase channels.
Other properties that make the estimation of 4OC's desirable
include the capability to detect cubic non-linearities and to
assess the performance (covariance) of second-order methods. 
Among the numerous applications where fourth order statistics
have been recently used successfully we mention: 
system identification, blind sources separation,
object recognition and classification, adaptive noise cancellation
and auditory signal processing. <p>

We synthesized [3,7] array architectures for the efficient estimation of 4OC's. 
First we developed  methods that allow the synthesis of <i> multi-stage</i>
architectures and then we use them  to derive a  family of minimum 
latency solutions for the given problem.
As a result, a <i> farm</i> of independent non-connected 
processors was designed that accepts as inputs estimates of second and 
fourth order moments, produced by the moments generating
triangular array [2], and computes the 4OC's.
The unified array synthesis methodology allowed us to consider 
all valid solutions, derive closed-form expressions for the permissible linear 
scheduling functions, and select a particular <b> S, T</b> pair
that led to an optimal <i> space-time matching</i> with the triangular 
array, so that intermediate delays and data migration are minimized.
We also pursued the synthesis of 
an alternative (to the farm) linear array design that 
is simpler to interface with the moments generating architecture,
at the expense of introducing inter-processor communications and 
moderate additional control complexity.

<title>Time-Recursive Estimation of Higher Order Moments on a Linear Array</title>
<h1>Time-Recursive Estimation of Higher Order Moments on a Linear Array</h1>

To achieve real-time performance in signal processing applications that 
require  new estimates of the fourth and lower order moments
every time a new data sample becomes available, it is 
necessary to (a)  design  adaptive estimation algorithms  and 
(b)  exploit their inherent  parallel  processing and pipelining
capabilities. We have developed  [4,8] two time- and order-recursive estimation 
procedures (using a fixed or growing sliding window respectively)
for updating all moment lag estimates (up to the fourth
order) in one of their primary region of support, using the previous
estimates and the newly arrived data sample in real-time. 
Then we transformed the fixed (size $M$)  moving window recursive  estimation 
algorithm onto an efficient  linear array  architecture with $M$ PE's
that can implement the updating in parallel. 
As a special case a simpler linear array computing only the diagonal
1-D "slice" of the higher order moment lags was also synthesized,
since this subset of moments is most commonly needed in practice.
Under the algorithm-to-architectures transformation the time- and order- 
recursive characteristics of the updating procedure translated
into a scalable array structure  whose processing elements consist of
pipelined stages of Multiply-Accumulate units. 
The unified top-down synthesis of the 
architectures facilitates formal verification of correctness
at the behavioral level, identification of design trade-offs, and
easy introduction  of modifications should the desired  constraints
change during the design phase. <p>

Although applied to a large but specific  class of problems in this project,
our synthesis methodology is general enough and can
be used to formulate suitable Locally Recursive Algorithms (LRA's)
for a given nested-loop algorithm with known index space at compile-time
and static data dependencies. Furthermore the architectural constraints
driving the algorithm's localization do not have to be necessarily
related to the VLSI technology,
making CDL an attractive method for deriving efficient parallel algorithms for
general purpose massively parallel machines.
We are currently investigating the use of CDL 
to synthesize <i> data-parallel</i> HOS estimation algorithms for the 
MasPar-1 SIMD machine [11] and we plan to make available to the scientific
and engineering community through <kbd> ftp</kbd> the code to be
developed.

<title>Recurrent Neural Networks in Digital Communications</title>
<h1>Recurrent Neural Networks in Digital Communications</h1>

 Recurrent Neural Networks (RRNs) are the most general 
    form of single layer neural networks,
    where each unit may be connected
    to every other unit.     Although their modeling and 
    classification capabilities are far more superior than the 
    feedforward networks, training RNNs 
    with stochastic gradient descent algorithms
    is very computationally intensive.     
    In this project we investigate  recurrent neural network based solutions
    to difficult signal processing problems arising in digital
    communications. Furthermore, we investigate the design of parallel 
    algorithms and VLSI architectures for efficient RNN training. <p>

<title>Recurrent Neural Networks for Linear and Nonlinear
Adaptive Channel Equalization</title>
<h1>Recurrent Neural Networks for Linear and Nonlinear
Adaptive Channel Equalization</h1>

An important problem in data communications is that of channel equalization,
i.e. the removal of interferences introduced by linear or nonlinear 
message corrupting mechanisms, so that the 
originally transmitted symbols can be recovered correctly at the receiver.
We have introduced  RNN based equalizers,
whose small size (number of neurons)
and high BER performance makes them attractive
candidates for high-speed adaptive channel equalization
[1,2,3].
RNN structures have been developed for both <i> trained adaptation</i> and 
<i> blind equalization</i>, and their performance was evaluated via 
extensive simulations for a variety of signal modulation and linear/nonlinear
communication channel models. 
It has been  shown that the RNN equalizers achieve comparable performance 
with linear equalizers when the channel interferences are 
relatively mild, but they  outperform RLS based equalizers
by several orders of magnitude when either the channel's transfer function 
has spectral nulls or severe nonlinear distortion is present. In addition,
the very small size  RNNs used (3 to 5 neurons), being essentially infinite
memory systems, are more suitable equalizer models and outperform
finite memory multi-layer perceptrons of much 
larger size and computational complexity; this observation was verified
in both linear and non-linear channel equalization cases.<p>

The Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm 
(proposed by Williams and Zipser) for training fully recurrent
neural networks continuously, was extended to be used for recurrent learning
in networks whose inputs, outputs, weights and activations
functions are complex [4]. 
A practical definition of the complex
activation function was adopted and the complex form of the
conventional RTRL algorithm was derived (CRTRL).  The performance of 
CRTRL was  demonstrated by  applications to complex
communication channel equalization using QAM signaling.

<title>Parallel Processing  for Training Large Recurrent Neural 
Networks</title>
<h1>Parallel Processing  for Training Large Recurrent Neural 
Networks</h1>

In recent years, RNNs have been employed
in  a wide range of applications in dynamical 
systems modeling, prediction and temporal pattern recognition.
However, the large computational complexity of training algorithms
limits the use of large models capable of handling 
real-world complex problems. With the emergence
of Massively Parallel MIMD multiprocessors  as a better 
cost/performance alternative to traditional supercomputers, the interest 
in efficient parallel algorithm/architecture combinations
for simulating large neural network models
has grown. We have shown how the RTRL algorithm 
for training RNN's can be mapped efficiently
into a ring interconnected distributed memory multiprocessor 
architecture.

<p>By careful reformulation and employing linear space-time mapping techniques, 
originally proposed for transforming sequential algorithms with static 
dependencies into systolic arrays, we derived a parallel RTRL 
realization on a ring topology [5].
The ring architecture was selected because it is simple to construct 
using fine grain  VLSI processors for real-time performance
[7], or to embed into  available multiprocessor systems 
with coarse grain powerful processors [7].
An efficient  partitioning method was used that allows to train
using RTRL large RNN models on  a fixed size ring.

<p>The Transputer-based ring array we experimented with can access
up to 4Mbytes $\times$ number of processors
of distributed memory, with a bandwidth that 
is directly proportional to the number of processors.
When the number $n$ of neurons of the RNN grows, the 
memory requirements grow as fast as $O(n^{3</i>)$. For 
the largest RNN we could simulate in  the array 
(19 PEs x 8 neurons/PE = 152 neurons),
the storage requirements were in the order
of 80 Mbytes. Having to access such large amounts of
memory during each iteration makes the 
sequential RTRL algorithm very slow on any uniprocessor machine.
It is interesting to note that for the case of 152 neurons, our 19 nodes
(T-800) array was 15 times faster than a SPARC based  SUN-690 mainframe.
The speedup of the parallel implementation over the serial one has
been estimated analytically and verified for many problem sizes
by extensive simulations [7].

<p>One of the main advantages of 
systematic parallelization is that if the ring realization is proven  to
be slow for a certain application, it is straightforward to
synthesize  a  faster 2-dimensional mesh implementation.
Achieving high efficiency on the mesh 
(something that we are currently investigating) is not trivial,
due to the well known tradeoff of  optimal efficiency versus small parallel 
running time (latency). A comprehensive <i> iso-efficiency</i> analysis 
of many different parallel processing <i> systems</i> (algorithm/architecture 
combinations) needs to be performed before the best combination is found.

<title>Hopfield Neural Network based Receivers for Optimal CDMA Multiuser Detection</title>
<h1>Hopfield Neural Network based Receivers for Optimal CDMA Multiuser Detection</h1>

The optimum centralized demodulation of the information sent simultaneously
by several users through a Gaussian multiple access channel is a very
important problem arising in multipoint-to-point digital
communications (e.g radio networks, local-area networks,
uplink satellite channels, uplink cellular communications).
When using <i> Code Division Multiple Access</i> (CDMA),
each transmitter modulates a different
signature signal waveform, which is known to the  receiver.
The received signal is the superposition of the signals transmitted
by each individual user. As shown by Verdu, in both the <i> synchronous</i> and 
the <i> asynchronous</i> transmission  cases,  Optimal Multiuser Detection
(OMD) is an <i> NP-hard</i> problem that is equivalent to the maximization of
an integer quadratic objective function. Therefore,
research efforts have recently  concentrated on the development of
suboptimal receivers, that are near-far resistant, have reasonable
computational complexity, and their performance is comparable to  that of 
the optimum receiver. 
Among the suboptimal detectors that have been proposed we mention the
<i> decorrelating detector</i> by Lupas and Verdu and  the 
<i> multistage detector</i> by Varanasi and Aazhang.
Recently, Aazhang et. al., U. Mitra and H. V. Poor, have proposed feedforward
neural network based multi-user detectors. While their performance is
very good for a small number of synchronous users,
their hardware complexity (and training time) is <i> exponential</i> in the
number of users.

<p> 
We have investigated the design of a single layer feedback
neural network receiver with $O(K)$ neurons capable of
demodulating the information transmitted by $K$ synchronous
or asynchronous users, sending CDMA packets over the same 
Gaussian channel. It has been shown  that OMD  can 
be formulated as an energy minimization problem and thus be solved in 
practically <i> constant</i> time using a dedicated analog VLSI implemented  
Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) [8,9].
Our simulation results suggest  that the HNN detector outperforms by 
far the conventional matched-filters based detector
and achieves  near-optimal BER performance.

<p>
In practical applications  hundreds of asynchronous
users may share the communication channel and in such case 
even an $O(K)$ size HNN receiver may be difficult to realize in hardware.
However our theoretical results on the nature of the local minima of 
the OMD's objective function  led  to the development
of an efficient  signal pre-processing stage
that can be used to reduce drastically the size of the OMD optimization 
problem [10,11]. 
The pre-processing/problem size reduction stage 
(<i> Reduced Detector</i> (RD)), may then be followed by a 
Hopfield Neural Network (or any other suboptimal algorithm) stage,
assigned to solve a much smaller (residual) optimization
problem of the same form in order to further improve the BER performance. 
The RD receiver was evaluated via simulations
and was found to slightly outperform other suboptimal schemes
(multistage detector),  at a computational cost 
that can be as much as <i> two orders</i> of magnitude smaller.
Therefore, practical <i> hybrid</i> centralized  receivers combining digital 
microprocessors and HNN IC's with few neurons (such as the CLNN Bellcore chip 
with 32 units) may be integrated into cost effective systems
performing the challenging CDMA asynchronous multi-user demodulation 
task in real-time. Such systems will find immediate applications
in mobile telephony and satellite communications.

<title>Parallel Architectures Synthesis for the Wavelet Transforms</title>
<h1>Parallel Architectures Synthesis for the Wavelet Transforms</h1>

The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is a mathematical tool that received
a lot of attention over the last ten years.  
It corresponds to a time-scale
decomposition of finite energy signals used to represent the frequency
content as it evolves in time.
The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
is the discrete-time discrete-scale counterpart of the CWT that can be
realized by using digital computers.  <p>

In this project we address the synthesis of efficient parallel 
architectures for computing the DWT.  Our main objective is twofold: 
to understand and analyze the
parallelism inherent in the DWT algorithm, and to systematically
derive parallel processing structures for its computation.  
We are primarily interested to find  regular computational structures 
which may be implemented by VLSI arrays with simple Processing Elements (PEs)
under <i> distributed memory and control</i>, or embedded into larger granularity
MIMD parallel machines using message passing. We found that the DWT cannot be
described by a set of <i> Uniform</i> or <i> Affine Recurrence Equations</i>
(UREs, AREs), and thus cannot directly be mapped onto a systolic array.
Also, as pointed out in [1], conventional methods developed for
transforming UREs and AREs into arrays will not efficiently
map the DWT\@. Therefore we apply <i> transformations on the index space</i> to
modify the original version of the DWT algorithm (regularize the
inter-octave data dependencies) so that it may then be
efficiently mapped to scalable array architectures by using linear
space-time mapping leading to simple control strategies. <p>

<title>Parallel Architectures for the 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform</title>
<h1>Parallel Architectures for the 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform</h1>

Previous studies on VLSI architectures design for the 1-dimensional (1-D)
DWT can be found in
[2,3,4,5,6].  The architectures reported in
[2,5,6] are neither systolic nor regular, therefore
difficult to scale and extend to 2-D transforms. It is very difficult (if at
all possible) to draw any general conclusions on the performance of these
circuits for problems with more than $J=3$ octaves.  The designs in
[3,4] are based on the principle of reutilizing a pair
of convolvers controlled by a <i> global routing network</i>.
We have found that it is possible to derive better solutions
(in terms of scalability and latency) when  following a
top-down systematic synthesis approach.



<p>The main problem with the pyramidal DWT algorithm, traditionally
formulated over a 3-dimensional index space, is that   the
inter-octave  data dependencies have an irregular structure.
If array architectures are to be derived using space-time
mapping this irregularity will be translated to severe control
complexity for establishing data communication among the 
Processing Elements (PE's) and low efficiency.
In [7,8] we introduced a non-linear index-space
transformation ($\Gamma$)  that regularizes
the inter-octave dependencies and the "shape" of the index space.
As a result of performing a thorough data dependence and 
localization analysis of the transformed algorithm, 
an efficient array  architecture was derived for  3-octaves DWT  parallel
computation.

<p>The  3-octaves distributed memory and control
 DWT array structure derived, consists of only $L$ PEs, 
and achieves a parallel running time (latency) of $3M/2$
using only  7 memory registers per PE,
where $L$ is the wavelet filter length and $M$ the input sequence length.
For comparison, the arrays reported in
\cite{Vish92.2,Vish92.1</i> have latency  of $2M$ and similar
memory requirements. 
The proposed  array may be employed in many
applications that do not require more than $J=3$ octaves of 
signal analysis, since it attains the lower latency
bound that can be achieved by  architectures with $L$ processors
derived using  <i> multiprojection</i>  [9] and linear scheduling. However, higher octave distributed memory
DWT arrays obtained similarly,  will suffer from low efficiency and high
latency  of $\frac{2-2^{1-J</i></i>{J</i>$ and  $JM/2$ respectively,
where $J$ is the highest computable octave.
For example, similar arrays with $L$ PE's computing more than 5-octave 
decompositions will have utilization bellow 34% and 
latency at  least  equal to $3M$.

<p>In [10,11] we have shown 
that these performance limitations  can be removed  by introducing
a second algorithm transformation, ($\Gamma_{m</i>$), that effectively 
reduces the dimensionality of the algorithm's index space,
by "stretching and merging" successive octave planes into 
a single  plane.
Mapping an algorithm with a  2-dim index space onto a linear array is a 
straightforward task because, as long as the mapping matrix is non-singular,
there will be   no data collisions in the communication links. 
Using linear space-time mapping
on the resulting DWT algorithm leads to the derivation of fast and scalable 
array structures suitable for computing <i> any</i> desired number of octaves.

<p>In particular, two  arrays of $L$ PEs for computing <i> any</i>  $J$-octave 
DWT decomposition with latencies of   $M$ and  $2M-1$  respectively have 
been synthesized.
The latency  of both arrays is independent of the highest
 octave $J$, and the former design achieves the <i> lowest possible latency</i>,
 which is equal to the input sequence length $M \geq 2^{J</i>$.
The efficiency of both designs is nearly 100\% for <i> any</i> $M$.
The former array   uses length-$L/2$ data broadcast links
and is otherwise systolic,   and the latter is fully systolic. 
Both arrays consist of modular PEs with only  $O(J)$ local memory buffers.
On the other hand, it does not seem possible to improve on the latency 
of $2M$ reported for Vishwanath's semi-systolic circuits 
[3,4],
and furthermore, memory and control of these designs is <i> centralized</i> \/
because the routing network of registers acts as a  global filter-pair 
controller needed to ensure proper synchronization.
Therefore we believe that our proposed designs are at this point the 
<i> fastest and most scalable implementations</i> of the 1-D DWT with $L$ 
PEs reported in the literature.

<p>Since the derived arrays are both filter-length and octave
scalable, as well as efficient
for computing any number of octaves using  distributed memory 
and simple control, we believe that it is a natural step to use them
as building blocks in order to synthesize parallel architectures
for the  DWT on 2-dimensional sequences, a directions
we are currently pursuing. We are also investigating the potential use of
appropriate index space transformations that could lead to
efficient 1-D and 2-D DWT realizations on massively parallel
general purpose SIMD and MIMD machines, such as the 
MasPar and the Intel Paragon.

<title>Efficient Computation of large-size Multidimensional DFT's on Distributed Memory Parallel Computers</title>
<h1>Efficient Computation of large-size Multidimensional DFT's on Distributed Memory Parallel Computers</h1>

Since the invention of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Fourier 
Transforms (DFT's) have been used extensively as a computational 
tool in almost all areas of signal processing, communications  and 
in numerous other scientific disciplines.  Although 
it has been a common belief that with the  available  modern RISC 
microprocessors there is no need  for new "exotic" DFT
algorithms, substantial computational savings 
can be achieved in a parallel processing environment by using 
flexible problem decomposition  schemes.
Exploiting the separability property of the multidimensional DFT's allows for 
independent computation of a collection of smaller dimensional
sub-problems, in a fashion that minimizes inter-processor communications.

<p> 
This project is a joint effort of a  group of mathematicians from
<i>  Aware Inc.</i>  of Cambridge Mass. (PI: R. Tolimieri)
and computer engineers from the <a href="test.html">Parallel Processing and Architectures Group </a>
of the CDSP Center at Northeastern University, that started in 1992.
The main thrust has been
an attempt to translate algebraic constructs based on the <i>  tensor product</i> 
formalism, used extensively to describe and characterize 
multi-dimensional DFT variants, to algorithmic menus suitable for efficient 
parallel processing.


<p> 
We have developed [1] a strategy for computing a multidimensional DFT
that <i>  hybrids</i>  a relatively new algorithm 
(<i>  Reduced Transform Algorithm</i> ,  (RTA)), with
available  single processor kernel routines.  We used the RTA
to address the reduction and optimization of interprocessor communications.
Our work has been  mainly motivated from the distributed 
memory parallel computing paradigm, which is arguably the most difficult 
to harness due to its exposed interprocessor communication to the 
programmer. 
We make use of algebraic facts in presenting the algorithms [2] ,
and the parameters in algebraic formulas give us the important 
parallel implementation parameters.  Thus the flexibility to address the 
variables in implementations is equated with flexibility in manipulating 
algebraic formalism.

<p> 
In its most general form, the RTA is a full
utilization of the duality between periodic and decimated data in the
Fourier transform.  We have considered [1] the application of RTA to the case
$\nat/P \x \nat/P$, for a prime number $P$.
Tensor product formulation of DFT computation on $\nat/N \x \nat/P \x \nat/P$
is interleaved with the <i>  periodization</i> 
step in the RTA for $\nat/P \x \nat/P$ to produce $P+1$ 
independent data sets of
size $NP$. The RTA can be used to address the imbalance between computation 
and communication rates in current distributed memory parallel machines by 
reducing communication between processors to <i>  cumulative</i>   patterns only 
(broadcast and combine) instead of the <i>  all-to-all</i>    communication 
patterns required in the global matrix transpose
needed by the <i>  Row-Column</i>    (RC) 
implementations of multidimensional DFT's.
Also, since fast algorithms for prime size 1D-DFT's exist [2] 
and the case $\nat/P \x \nat/P$ of the RTA is very efficient, because its
computation requires only $P+1$  1D transforms versus $2P$ for the RC
method, our approach also addresses the issue of storage reduction  by
providing additional transform size options.
For example the ability to perform a $181 \x 181$ point 2D DFT means potential
storage savings up to 50\% over the $256 \x 256$ case, in addition to savings 
in computational time. 
The storage savings can be used for the optimization of the broadcasting step 
needed for the RTA in environments with a long communications latency.

<p> 
Via the Chinese remainder theorem, we have extended our method to compute the 
3-dimensional DFT on $\bZ/N \x \bZ/MP \x \bZ/KP$, where $N$ is an arbitrary
integer, $M$ and $K$ are integers not divisible by $P$, for a prime $P$.
%In this case, essential computation is reduced to computing $(P+1)$
%independent 4-D DFT on $\bZ/N \x \bZ/M \x \bZ/K \x \bZ/P$. 
We transformed [1]  the data set to an equivalent 
5D data set on $<b> Z</b> /N \times 
<b> Z</b> /M \times <b> Z</b> /K \times <b> Z</b> /P \times <b> Z</b> /P$, 
and then employed the RTA on the last two indices
to break the problem into smaller independent sub-problems that can be 
computed in parallel. Each sub-problem is associated with the 
computation of the value of the Fourier Transform along one <i>  line</i>  in 
the set $<b> Z</b> /P \times <b> Z</b> /P$ passing through the 
origin. These lines intersect only at the origin and 
cover the whole index space. 
Three stages are needed to compute the values of the DFT along the 
lines: (1) Periodization stage, which consists of additions of 
data along lines perpendicular to a given line, (2) 3D Cooley-Tukey 
FFT and (3) $P$-point DFT. In a multiprocessor environment, each processor
computes these three steps independently of the others thus allowing 
for maximum parallelism and efficiency. Moreover, the final data 
distribution among the processors is such as to permit further 
processing in a parallel fashion, since every processor holds only 
results belonging to the same geometrical subset. 

<p> 
The hybrid RTA (HRTA) has been implemented on an Intel iPSC/i860 
<i>  hypercube</i>  and extensive timing results are reported in [1]
for large 2D and 3D DFTs with index sets in 
$Z/MP \times Z/KP$ and $Z/N \times Z/MP \times Z/KP$ respectively,
where $N, M, K$ are powers-of-two and $P$ is a small
prime number such as $3,5,7$. The non-optimized 
realizations of the new HRTA approach are shown to outperform by as much as
$70\%$ the optimized assembly coded realizations of the traditional 
Row-Column method on the iPSC/860. A recent comparison study of many different
2-D FFT implementations on the Intel Paragon supercomputer is 
reported in [3] .

<p> 
Moreover the HRTA provides an alternative approach that is suitable for
many different parallel and distributed processing environments.
In a DSP board with 4 powerful compute nodes (such as the Intel i860)
communicating via a shared bus, the HRTA seems to be the 
only viable parallel processing scheme  that would achieve 
real-time performance. In Clusters Of WorkstationS (COWS),  
a rapidly emerging cost-effective model  for parallel computing, 
the need for an all-to-all communication, that is necessary
for  transposition using the RC method, would be
highly inefficient. On the other 
hand, the HRTA has little or no need for communication
between different workstations so that very fast implementations 
can be created. We are currently pursuing experiments to
validate this conjecture.

<p> 
The proposed HRTA approach can be used in applications such as 
<i>  motion estimation</i>  from a sequence of images (multi-frame detection, MFD),
a very important task in computer vision, HDTV and video telephony.
Recently, frequency domain methods have been proposed 
[4] , that processes the frequency 
contents of the images to estimate the velocity and trajectory of the 
moving components. They offer more robust detection and 
huge computational savings since the frequency domain representation 
of the 3D data (sequence of 2D images) is more compact than the 
equivalent time domain representation. 
With all the processors holding data belonging to different lines 
in the frequency domain, each processor can independently test for the 
presence of motion along its assigned direction. <p>

<title>Helicopter Gearbox Fault Diagnosis using Analog Neural Networks</title>
<h1>Helicopter Gearbox Fault Diagnosis using Analog Neural Networks</h1>

The development of a reliable helicopter gearbox <i> Health Monitoring System</i>
(HMS) has been the subject of considerable research over the past 20 years. 
The deployment of such a system could lead to the saving of lives and vehicles,
as well as to a significant reduction in helicopter maintenance costs.  Recent
research results indicate that a neural networks based approach could provide a
viable solution to the problem. However no such system has been 
deployed so far. This project led to the development of  
two different software/hardware systems for monitoring the
health of helicopter gear-boxes.

<p> We have considered neural network models 
[1,2,3] suitable for two different
tasks and target implementations:  (i) A <i> hybrid</i> system,
designed to operate as an extremely accurate off-line 
monitoring tool, primarily  used to reduce maintenance costs. This system 
has the capability to detect whether a fault exists, classify it as
<i> gear</i>  or <i> bearing</i>   fault, and moreover identify the specific
fault-type within each category. (ii) An <i> all-analog</i> neural electronics
based fault/no-fault real-time monitor. With a lead time from fault
development to complete failure and crush of less than 15 minutes, robust 
real-time  fault detection for the helicopter's main gearbox is extremely 
crucial.

<p> For system (i) 128 or 256-point DFT's are computed by a 
digital microprocessor using floating point precision, and are then
fed to software-simulated 3-layer error back-propagation networks, trained
to perform classification/fault-identification.
It was observed that no substantial improvement on classification performance
was obtained by increasing the DFT size beyond 128 points/data window.
For system (ii) an <i> all-analog</i> VLSI implementation was developed, 
exploiting  the ability of an analog
neural network to compute directly (but with low precision)
the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
of the vibration data using the first layer of a feedforward 
multi-layer perceptron. The computed DFT coefficients 
are then feeding  the successive two neural layers that implement
fault  detection. Hardware performance results have been 
 obtained using the Integrated Neurocomputing
Architecture (INCA/1) analog VLSI neural network platform designed and
developed at C. S.  Draper Lab. Extensive simulations
using the INCA/1 system and real helicopter gear-box vibration data 
indicate that  64-point analog DFTs combined with a two-layer feedforward
neural network (with $64$ units/layer) can provide 
perfect performance  (100% detection 0% FAR), within the time frame 
required to process  $27$ non-overlapping windows of data

<title>Parallel Processing for Morphological Image Processing</title>
<h1>Parallel Processing for Morphological Image Processing</h1>

Morphological operations can be applied for image analysis in applications 
requiring defect or object <i> shape recognition</i>, such as robotic vision and
diagnostic medical imaging.  The basic morphological operations are the 
<i> dilation</i> and the <i> erosion</i>.  Although they do not involve 
multiplication, the very high data rates required by real-time applications 
can be achieved only by employing parallel processing and pipelining.

<p>We have  derived systematically  a 2-dimensional mesh-type Application
Specific VLSI array architecture for real-time morphological image processing
[1,2].
The array can perform dilation, erosion, or successive combinations of the two
(<i> opening</i> and <i> closing</i>).  The 2-D image can be gray-scale
(or binary) and the <i> structuring element</i> of arbitrary shape, 
as long as its bounding box is known.  The Locally Sequential Globally
Parallel (LSGP) partitioning scheme may be used to keep the array size small
and independent of the image size.  


<p>We summarize below the  derived array performance characteristics,
assuming that the image is $N \times N$ the structuring element's
bounding box is rectangular $(2M_1</i>+1) \times (2M_2</i>+1)$,
 and the LSGP partitioning factor is equal to $k$. In this case
the target array is a $(2M_2</i>+1) \times N/k$ \, 2-dimensional 
architecture of Processing Elements (PE's). 

<ul>
<li> The <i> throughput rate</i>   for input and output is 
one image pixel  per $(2M_1+1)$ PE cycles.

<li> The time to from start to completion of a morphological
operation (single MOP <i> latency</i> ) is \\
$L= (kN-1)(2M_1+1)+N/k+2(2M_2) =2(kN-1)M_1+kN+N/k+4M_2-1$  PE cycles.

<li> A new morphological operation can start 
(<i> block pipelining period</i>) every $kN \times (2M_1+1)$ PE cycles.

<li> The memory needed  per PE does not exceed $4M_1+3$ buffers.
</ul>


<p> 
For example, let us  assume that  $256 \times 256$  size images arrive
at  video rate (one image every $33.33$   msec) and that
we want to perform one dilation (or erosion) operation on 
every image using   $11 \times 11$  structuring elements.
If $k=8$ an   $11 \times 32$   2-D array can achieve real-time performance
if the PE cycle is not larger than $1.48$ $\mu$<i> sec</i>. 
Since only  integer addition/subtraction operations are involved,
it is reasonable to assume a PE cycle much less than 1  $\mu$<i> sec</i>
using available VLSI technology. 
Clearly the speedup achieved by the array will be  dictated 
by the interprocessor communication latency and the ability
of the PEs to compute and communicate concurrently. 

<p>
The architecture was derived using a vertically integrated
systematic mapping methodology, that allows formal verification at
the behavioral level.  It was validated through simulations
using concurrent programming  on a Transputers-based platform. 
Derivation of SIMD algorithms with near-neighbor communications
on 2-D or 3-D arrays suitable for general purpose supercomputers,
such as the MasPar and CM-2, as well as 
parallel algorithms and architectures for 3-D morphological image 
processing are directions worth pursuing.

<title>Concurrent Error Diagnosis on 2-Dimensional Mesh Array Architectures</title>
<h1>Concurrent Error Diagnosis on 2-Dimensional Mesh Array Architectures</h1>

During the last decade substantial research efforts have focused on the 
development of run-time fault tolerance schemes for  processor arrays. 
They are usually based on the assumption that the Processing Elements (PEs) 
can  identify themselves as being "faulty"  or "healthy" .  
In reality, the PEs do not have this capability, unless if they 
are designed to perform <i> Concurrent Error Diagnosis</i>  (CED) simultaneously
with normal operation, as a first step towards reconfiguration and recovery. 
The array CED techniques proposed in the literature basically follow two
approaches: In the first approach, the main objective is to locate and confine 
the  error in the Processing Element where the fault occurred, by using 
<i> Duplication-With-Comparison</i>  (DWC). Either <i> structure</i>    
[1,2]  or <i> time redundancy</i>  are  used for this 
purpose. 
In both cases, the comparison of two versions of the same computation
is assumed to always be fault-free. 
This approach, although it delivers high coverage and
low latency diagnosis, it imposes at least 100\% hardware or time overheads
and the need for <i> Totally Self Checking</i>  (TSC) checkers. 
The second approach, known as <i> Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance</i>  (ABFT) 
attempts CED in a distributed collective fashion. The detection latency 
is usually higher, and the data encoding scheme employed may vary for every
algorithm implemented by the array.

<p> In this project we have focused on the development of 
CED schemes for 2-Dimensional mesh <i> data-driven</i>  array architectures
[3] . 
We have developed  two techniques that can be implemented
without any added interconnection complexity.
The first CED scheme introduced [4] is based on the concept  of 
<i> overlapping H-processes</i>    
as a run-time fault tolerance mechanism.  An H-process corresponds to
the distributed redundant execution of an H-operation (hop) of the 
general format $(a \, op1 \, b) \, op2 \, (c \, op3 \, d)$ 
(where op1, op2 and op3 are dyadic operators)  in the
two " wings"   on an H-tree of PEs.
Since a very broad class of linear algebra and graph algorithms
can be expressed as a series of hops, the technique is not algorithm-specific. 
Successive hops are assigned to appropriately selected but different 
H-trees of PEs in the mesh, allowing error detection, location and 
masking to be  achieved collectively and " on-the-fly" , i.e. 
without graceful degradation. 

<p> A  realistic functional fault model was used, where there is no need for
hardware duplication and dedicated TSC checkers. The comparison 
(of the two results produced by the two wings of an H-process)
may be performed at the ALU of the H-root PE and is allowed to fail. 
Therefore many different implementations are envisioned from
general purpose microprocessors to custom
designed simple VLSI Processing Elements. The Error Handling Control
Logic is simple and hence it can be very reliable. 
A major advantage of this new  approach is that faults can be detected and
masked during normal array operation, even if they cannot be located 
immediately. No retry is necessary for transient fault handling and
reconfiguration should not be immediate. However some short duration
transients may not be detected.

<p> The second proposed CED mechanism, called 
<i> overlapping $\Gamma$-Processes</i>  [3] ,
 requires every PE to have a comparator, but also  allows comparators to 
fail (individually or along with the computation unit in the same cell).
Permanent errors can be locally detected, located, corrected and 
type-identified (computation vs. comparison).  In addition,
transient and intermittent errors of any duration can be detected and 
corrected, as well as a large class of multiple PE errors.
The overlapping $\Gamma$-Processes technique can be implemented using local 
control of low complexity on a data-driven mesh array of any size.  
Furthermore, it provides the flexibility to decide dynamically
on whether a fault should be treated as transient or permanent
(and initiate reconfiguration), depending on the cell's error 
occurrences history and the operating environment.
Behavioral level modeling (using the Verilog HDL) was used, to validate the 
diagnosis capabilities of the scheme on 2-D wavefront array architectures.
Using the HDL simulator developed, different types of faults may be 
injected in multiple cells; a faulty cell is 
always corrected by a healthy neighbor, and if a faulty cell attempts to 
corrupt a healthy one its action  is rejected.

<title>Extracting Large Linear Arrays out of 2-D Mesh Arrays with Faulty Cells</title>
<h1>Extracting Large Linear Arrays out of 2-D Mesh Arrays with Faulty Cells</h1>

In order to maintain constant
interconnection wire lengths between logically adjacent cells
and avoid introducing
additional tracks of busses and switches when linear arrays are
extracted out of two-dimensional arrays  with faulty processing
elements, the <i> spiral</i> reconfiguration approach has been introduced
[2]. Its main drawback, relative to the <i> tree</i> and 
<i> patching</i> methods, is that
it leads to low <i> harvesting ratio</i>, meaning that many good PEs 
on the mesh may not be included in the embedded linear array. 
We have recently
introduced [5] a two-phase <i> reconfiguration</i>   strategy 
that drastically increases the harvesting ratio of spiral approach techniques.
The algorithm  
of the first phase achieves comparable harvesting to the previously
proposed schemes by Aubusson-Catt and Manning, 
while it is simpler and thus can be implemented 
by on-chip logic. The algorithm of the second phase may complement
any other scheme reported in the literature
in order to raise harvesting to  levels that could so far be expected 
only by using the more difficult to implement tree reconfiguration method.
This improvement is achieved  by reclaiming healthy  PEs left unused by 
the first phase algorithm. 


<p> 
Extensive Monte Carlo simulations have been performed in order to compare
the new two-phase strategy with  existing spiral approach techniques
reported in the literature by Koren (KOR), Aubusson-Catt (AUB),
and Manning (MAN). A 20x20 physical array was
used in  all simulations. For each percentage value of 
fault free PEs (yield) examined, 500 different fault maps have been generated
randomly. The head of the spiral was placed at the upper left
corner PE in every simulation run. If this  PE is 
faulty its right neighbor is used as head and so on.
The <i> mean</i> length of the longest
array extracted  by phase 1, normalized by the number
of PEs was computed. It was observed that  the phase-1 algorithm outperforms
KOR and AUB (in most cases) and gives comparable average harvesting to 
MAN, which is a much more complicated algorithm.
By running phase 2,  in conjunction with <i> all</i>  the above mentioned 
algorithms for phase 1, the harvesting is raised substantially 
and all three algorithms (except KOR) achieve approximately the same 
harvesting across a wide range of yield values.
The observed saturation in  performance suggests 
that our two-phase reconfiguration strategy  approaches the maximum  
harvesting that can be achieved by <i> any</i>  spiral type of  technique.
Since spiral approach schemes  trade harvesting for
interconnection complexity and implementation simplicity, 
our two-phase strategy offers: (i)
a simpler first phase algorithm compared to
AUB and MAN and (ii) an  overall near optimal
harvesting ratio. Also note that applying  the proposed  two-phase 
reconfiguration strategy leads to  better harvesting
relatively  to any other algorithm   used alone.
Similar simulations using <i> clustered</i>   fault distributions
lead to the same type of results and conclusions.

<hr>
Hi, my name is Kalamatianos John and I am currently working on the systematic
synthesis of SIMD algorithms on the MasPar-1 machine. A modified model of a
algorithm-to-architecture mapping methodology used for VLSI systolic arrays, was
employed to accomplish the synthesis procedure. This modified model is taking 
advantage
of the communication and computation properties of the specific machine to
derive minimum latency SIMD algorithms from a nested-loop original description
of the problem. This approach was applied on the Higher-Order moments estimation
problem. We developed SIMD code for estimating all
higher-order moments up to the 4th-order of a one-dimensional process. Actual
experiments done on the MasPar-1 showed significant speedups compared to
simulations run on a series of workstations (including an Alpha!!!). A corresponding synthesis process for a MIMD
machine (propably the Intel Paragon) will soon start to be explored. <p>

Except for parallelizing tools my interests also include VLSI architectures,
High performance uniprocessors, Memory hierarchy design and Shared-Memory
Multiprocessors issues. <p>

From my current research topic, I guess you could conclude that I am a member 
of the <a href="test.html">Parallel Processing and Architectures Group</a> of the <a href="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/">CDSP center </a>. I am also a research assistant in the CDSP
lab and the ECE Dept. at Northeastern University. <p>

<h1>Our Research</h1>
<hr>

This section provides a summary of  results that have been the
outcome of selected on-going or completed research  projects 
of the <i> Parallel Processing \& Architectures</i> group,
during the last four years.

The group was formed by <a href="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/htmls/manolakos.html">Prof. Elias S. Manolakos</a>, with main
objectives:

<b><ul>
<li> to derive efficient algorithms for challenging
signal/image/neuro processing applications.

<p>
<li>to derive systematic synthesis methods for the transformation of a
sequential algorithm to parallel architectures.

<p>
<li>to investigate how concurrency can be exploited for high performance
in general purpose Massilely Parallel Processing (MPP)
machines, as well as in Application Specific Arrays of Processors (ASAP's).

<p>
<li>to study the fault tolerance capabilities of parallel architectures.
</ul> </b>

The research efforts of the group 
are supported from the <i> National Science Foundation</i>
(NSF) and the <i> Advanced Projects Research Agency</i> (ARPA) through
grants to Dr. Manolakos. Of primary importance to the group was also
to foster collaboration between the CDSP Center and
its industrial affiliates. During the last four years major R \& D 
groups in the greater Boston area (such as the Draper Lab., Digital,
Aware Inc. etc.)  have provided Scholarships/Assistantships to
graduate students doing research on jointly supervised
projects of common interest. <p>

Since 1990, eight (8) <a href="who.html">graduate students</a> of the group,
from either the <i> Signal Processing</i> or the <i> Computer Engineering</i> 
concentrations  of the ECE Dept., have
completed their dissertations/theses  under Prof. Manolakos' guidance.
Currently six other dissertations/theses are in progress (2 started in 1994). <p>

<title>Parallel Processing for the Computation of Higher Order
Statistics</title>
<h1>Parallel Processing for the Computation of Higher Order
Statistics</h1>

This project is concerned with the systematic derivation of parallel
computational structures for the efficient non-parametric
estimation of Higher Order Statistics (HOS), such as the <i> moments</i>,
<i> cumulants</i> and their frequency-domain counterpart <i> (polyspectra)</i>,
directly from the samples on an one-dimensional data sequence.
It aims at synthesizing both Application Specific Array Processor
(ASAP) architectures for real-time performance,  as well as 
parallel algorithms for readily available general purpose
massively parallel machines used to speed-up scientific 
and engineering applications that require the 
computation of Higher Order Statistics. <p>


The starting point of our research is the observation that
traditional array synthesis methodologies suffer from the
following  major drawback.
They are based on the mapping of  a Locally Recursive Algorithm   (LRA)
that is usually selected <i> arbitrarily</i> among the numerous
behavior preserving ones for the a problem. 
This is a consequence of the fact that 
the two synthesis phases (localization of the algorithm's dependencies
and mapping to a parallel architecture) have traditionally been treated 
as two independent steps. Following a two-phase approach, it is possible 
that no architecture is found that meets the design objectives, 
or that a good mapping  choice leads to a suboptimal architectures
due to the inappropriate selection of the LRA in the first place. <p>


To alleviate this problem we have developed <i> Constraint Driven 
Localization</i> (CDL), a unified methodology that starting from a nested-loop 
signal processing algorithm, allows the construction and 
characterization of all equivalent (behavior preserving) algorithms 
with localized data dependencies, that after a linear space-time mapping are
guaranteed to leed to parallel computing structures satisfying
specified architectural constraints and performance levels.
The main advantages of CDL are the following:
First, the search space os maintained as large as possible by not fixing 
from the beginning the LRA. In this way it is possible to  find 
pairs of space-time transformations that yield different, yet optimized,
architectures. Furthermore by deriving closed-form  expressions for all the 
permissible linear schedules and their   latency,
all synthesis results are parametrized by the problem size. 
This is useful when mapping  multi-dimensional nested-loop algorithms 
onto two-dimensional architectures, where the schedule elements 
(and consequently the resulting latency) are functions of the problem size.
In addition, the availability of parameterized 
results is very useful when synthesizing  multi-stage architectures. 
By deriving  and characterizing families of solutions for every 
stage, one may select at the end   <i> the pair</i> of array solutions that is
optimally space-time matched, thus simplifying the in-between 
stages interconnection strategy. <p>


As detailed below, we applied CDL in order to systematically 
synthesize ASAP's for:
(a) the estimation of all moment lags (in a 
non-redundant region of support) up to the fourth order
[1,2] 
(b) the parallel computation of fourth order cumulants,
via the second and fourth order moments [1,3](c) the time-recursive updating of moment estimates based
on a sliding window approach [1,4].
The development of CDL led to substantial improvement of solutions
proposed earlier for the same problems and reported in 
[5,6,7,8,9,10]. <p>

<title>Derivation of a Higher Order Moments Generating Array Architecture</title>
<h1>Derivation of a Higher Order Moments Generating Array Architecture</h1>

By using a unified synthesis methodology we have synthesized 
[2] a family of <i> triangular</i>  $M\times M$ array processors 
that receive as input the $M$ samples of a block of an one-dimensional 
data sequence and provide  estimates of  all higher order moment lags
in a non-redundant region of support, and up to a desired order $k$.
For most applications $k=4$ is sufficient and in that case each
Processing Element (PE) consists of a pipeline of 
Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) units 
with $k=4$ stages. All sets of permissible linear schedules that lead to
simple distributed control and achieve minimum latency (equal to $M(M-1)+4$)
have been found and characterized in terms of $M$. For $k>4$,
and if such case becomes of  practical interest in the future, it is possible
to use the same architecture and simply add more MAC  stages to
each PE pipeline, as the maximum desired order of estimates increases. <p>

The number of memory buffers per processor does not depend on the 
data block size $M$ ($O(1)$ local memory requirements per PE),
a very desired property if partitioning and matching to fixed size arrays
is to be used for vary large $M$'s. 
This was made possible by selecting <i> that</i> pair of
minimum latency schedule <b> T</b> and dependencies matrix <b> D</i>, 
among numerous permissible choices, that would yield 
a vector  $<b> T</b>\cdot <b> D</b>$ with elements independent of $M$.
The availability of such a choice was identified by using the unified
synthesis methodology <i> to first construct a good  LRA</i>(<b> D</b>)
before attempting any mapping.
Therefore the family of solutions reported in 
[2] are far more superior (in terms of area and performance),
compared to earlier solutions reported in
[5,6](requiring $O(M)$ local memory per PE and higher
latency) derived using an arbitrarily selected valid LRA, as usually done
when employing  traditional array synthesis methods.

<title>Derivation of a Fourth Order Cumulants Parallel Computing Architecture</title>
<h1>Derivation of a Fourth Order Cumulants Parallel Computing Architecture</h1>

In signal processing applications where the
underlying process assumes a symmetric probability density function
third order cumulants  may not be useful, and since the higher the order the
larger the variance of sample estimators, one is more likely to
employ Fourth Order Cumulants (4OC's).
A typical case arises in digital 
communications where symmetric signal constellations
are common and this  is one of the reasons why 4OC's  based methods have been
proved  successful in blind equalization of non-minimum phase channels.
Other properties that make the estimation of 4OC's desirable
include the capability to detect cubic non-linearities and to
assess the performance (covariance) of second-order methods. 
Among the numerous applications where fourth order statistics
have been recently used successfully we mention: 
system identification, blind sources separation,
object recognition and classification, adaptive noise cancellation
and auditory signal processing. <p>

We synthesized [3,7] array architectures for the efficient estimation of 4OC's. 
First we developed  methods that allow the synthesis of <i> multi-stage</i>
architectures and then we use them  to derive a  family of minimum 
latency solutions for the given problem.
As a result, a <i> farm</i> of independent non-connected 
processors was designed that accepts as inputs estimates of second and 
fourth order moments, produced by the moments generating
triangular array [2], and computes the 4OC's.
The unified array synthesis methodology allowed us to consider 
all valid solutions, derive closed-form expressions for the permissible linear 
scheduling functions, and select a particular <b> S, T</b> pair
that led to an optimal <i> space-time matching</i> with the triangular 
array, so that intermediate delays and data migration are minimized.
We also pursued the synthesis of 
an alternative (to the farm) linear array design that 
is simpler to interface with the moments generating architecture,
at the expense of introducing inter-processor communications and 
moderate additional control complexity.

<title>Time-Recursive Estimation of Higher Order Moments on a Linear Array</title>
<h1>Time-Recursive Estimation of Higher Order Moments on a Linear Array</h1>

To achieve real-time performance in signal processing applications that 
require  new estimates of the fourth and lower order moments
every time a new data sample becomes available, it is 
necessary to (a)  design  adaptive estimation algorithms  and 
(b)  exploit their inherent  parallel  processing and pipelining
capabilities. We have developed  [4,8] two time- and order-recursive estimation 
procedures (using a fixed or growing sliding window respectively)
for updating all moment lag estimates (up to the fourth
order) in one of their primary region of support, using the previous
estimates and the newly arrived data sample in real-time. 
Then we transformed the fixed (size $M$)  moving window recursive  estimation 
algorithm onto an efficient  linear array  architecture with $M$ PE's
that can implement the updating in parallel. 
As a special case a simpler linear array computing only the diagonal
1-D "slice" of the higher order moment lags was also synthesized,
since this subset of moments is most commonly needed in practice.
Under the algorithm-to-architectures transformation the time- and order- 
recursive characteristics of the updating procedure translated
into a scalable array structure  whose processing elements consist of
pipelined stages of Multiply-Accumulate units. 
The unified top-down synthesis of the 
architectures facilitates formal verification of correctness
at the behavioral level, identification of design trade-offs, and
easy introduction  of modifications should the desired  constraints
change during the design phase. <p>

Although applied to a large but specific  class of problems in this project,
our synthesis methodology is general enough and can
be used to formulate suitable Locally Recursive Algorithms (LRA's)
for a given nested-loop algorithm with known index space at compile-time
and static data dependencies. Furthermore the architectural constraints
driving the algorithm's localization do not have to be necessarily
related to the VLSI technology,
making CDL an attractive method for deriving efficient parallel algorithms for
general purpose massively parallel machines.
We are currently investigating the use of CDL 
to synthesize <i> data-parallel</i> HOS estimation algorithms for the 
MasPar-1 SIMD machine [11] and we plan to make available to the scientific
and engineering community through <kbd> ftp</kbd> the code to be
developed.

<title>Recurrent Neural Networks in Digital Communications</title>
<h1>Recurrent Neural Networks in Digital Communications</h1>

 Recurrent Neural Networks (RRNs) are the most general 
    form of single layer neural networks,
    where each unit may be connected
    to every other unit.     Although their modeling and 
    classification capabilities are far more superior than the 
    feedforward networks, training RNNs 
    with stochastic gradient descent algorithms
    is very computationally intensive.     
    In this project we investigate  recurrent neural network based solutions
    to difficult signal processing problems arising in digital
    communications. Furthermore, we investigate the design of parallel 
    algorithms and VLSI architectures for efficient RNN training. <p>

<title>Recurrent Neural Networks for Linear and Nonlinear
Adaptive Channel Equalization</title>
<h1>Recurrent Neural Networks for Linear and Nonlinear
Adaptive Channel Equalization</h1>

An important problem in data communications is that of channel equalization,
i.e. the removal of interferences introduced by linear or nonlinear 
message corrupting mechanisms, so that the 
originally transmitted symbols can be recovered correctly at the receiver.
We have introduced  RNN based equalizers,
whose small size (number of neurons)
and high BER performance makes them attractive
candidates for high-speed adaptive channel equalization
[1,2,3].
RNN structures have been developed for both <i> trained adaptation</i> and 
<i> blind equalization</i>, and their performance was evaluated via 
extensive simulations for a variety of signal modulation and linear/nonlinear
communication channel models. 
It has been  shown that the RNN equalizers achieve comparable performance 
with linear equalizers when the channel interferences are 
relatively mild, but they  outperform RLS based equalizers
by several orders of magnitude when either the channel's transfer function 
has spectral nulls or severe nonlinear distortion is present. In addition,
the very small size  RNNs used (3 to 5 neurons), being essentially infinite
memory systems, are more suitable equalizer models and outperform
finite memory multi-layer perceptrons of much 
larger size and computational complexity; this observation was verified
in both linear and non-linear channel equalization cases.<p>

The Real Time Recurrent Learning (RTRL) algorithm 
(proposed by Williams and Zipser) for training fully recurrent
neural networks continuously, was extended to be used for recurrent learning
in networks whose inputs, outputs, weights and activations
functions are complex [4]. 
A practical definition of the complex
activation function was adopted and the complex form of the
conventional RTRL algorithm was derived (CRTRL).  The performance of 
CRTRL was  demonstrated by  applications to complex
communication channel equalization using QAM signaling.

<title>Parallel Processing  for Training Large Recurrent Neural 
Networks</title>
<h1>Parallel Processing  for Training Large Recurrent Neural 
Networks</h1>

In recent years, RNNs have been employed
in  a wide range of applications in dynamical 
systems modeling, prediction and temporal pattern recognition.
However, the large computational complexity of training algorithms
limits the use of large models capable of handling 
real-world complex problems. With the emergence
of Massively Parallel MIMD multiprocessors  as a better 
cost/performance alternative to traditional supercomputers, the interest 
in efficient parallel algorithm/architecture combinations
for simulating large neural network models
has grown. We have shown how the RTRL algorithm 
for training RNN's can be mapped efficiently
into a ring interconnected distributed memory multiprocessor 
architecture.

<p>By careful reformulation and employing linear space-time mapping techniques, 
originally proposed for transforming sequential algorithms with static 
dependencies into systolic arrays, we derived a parallel RTRL 
realization on a ring topology [5].
The ring architecture was selected because it is simple to construct 
using fine grain  VLSI processors for real-time performance
[7], or to embed into  available multiprocessor systems 
with coarse grain powerful processors [7].
An efficient  partitioning method was used that allows to train
using RTRL large RNN models on  a fixed size ring.

<p>The Transputer-based ring array we experimented with can access
up to 4Mbytes $\times$ number of processors
of distributed memory, with a bandwidth that 
is directly proportional to the number of processors.
When the number $n$ of neurons of the RNN grows, the 
memory requirements grow as fast as $O(n^{3</i>)$. For 
the largest RNN we could simulate in  the array 
(19 PEs x 8 neurons/PE = 152 neurons),
the storage requirements were in the order
of 80 Mbytes. Having to access such large amounts of
memory during each iteration makes the 
sequential RTRL algorithm very slow on any uniprocessor machine.
It is interesting to note that for the case of 152 neurons, our 19 nodes
(T-800) array was 15 times faster than a SPARC based  SUN-690 mainframe.
The speedup of the parallel implementation over the serial one has
been estimated analytically and verified for many problem sizes
by extensive simulations [7].

<p>One of the main advantages of 
systematic parallelization is that if the ring realization is proven  to
be slow for a certain application, it is straightforward to
synthesize  a  faster 2-dimensional mesh implementation.
Achieving high efficiency on the mesh 
(something that we are currently investigating) is not trivial,
due to the well known tradeoff of  optimal efficiency versus small parallel 
running time (latency). A comprehensive <i> iso-efficiency</i> analysis 
of many different parallel processing <i> systems</i> (algorithm/architecture 
combinations) needs to be performed before the best combination is found.

<title>Hopfield Neural Network based Receivers for Optimal CDMA Multiuser Detection</title>
<h1>Hopfield Neural Network based Receivers for Optimal CDMA Multiuser Detection</h1>

The optimum centralized demodulation of the information sent simultaneously
by several users through a Gaussian multiple access channel is a very
important problem arising in multipoint-to-point digital
communications (e.g radio networks, local-area networks,
uplink satellite channels, uplink cellular communications).
When using <i> Code Division Multiple Access</i> (CDMA),
each transmitter modulates a different
signature signal waveform, which is known to the  receiver.
The received signal is the superposition of the signals transmitted
by each individual user. As shown by Verdu, in both the <i> synchronous</i> and 
the <i> asynchronous</i> transmission  cases,  Optimal Multiuser Detection
(OMD) is an <i> NP-hard</i> problem that is equivalent to the maximization of
an integer quadratic objective function. Therefore,
research efforts have recently  concentrated on the development of
suboptimal receivers, that are near-far resistant, have reasonable
computational complexity, and their performance is comparable to  that of 
the optimum receiver. 
Among the suboptimal detectors that have been proposed we mention the
<i> decorrelating detector</i> by Lupas and Verdu and  the 
<i> multistage detector</i> by Varanasi and Aazhang.
Recently, Aazhang et. al., U. Mitra and H. V. Poor, have proposed feedforward
neural network based multi-user detectors. While their performance is
very good for a small number of synchronous users,
their hardware complexity (and training time) is <i> exponential</i> in the
number of users.

<p> 
We have investigated the design of a single layer feedback
neural network receiver with $O(K)$ neurons capable of
demodulating the information transmitted by $K$ synchronous
or asynchronous users, sending CDMA packets over the same 
Gaussian channel. It has been shown  that OMD  can 
be formulated as an energy minimization problem and thus be solved in 
practically <i> constant</i> time using a dedicated analog VLSI implemented  
Hopfield Neural Network (HNN) [8,9].
Our simulation results suggest  that the HNN detector outperforms by 
far the conventional matched-filters based detector
and achieves  near-optimal BER performance.

<p>
In practical applications  hundreds of asynchronous
users may share the communication channel and in such case 
even an $O(K)$ size HNN receiver may be difficult to realize in hardware.
However our theoretical results on the nature of the local minima of 
the OMD's objective function  led  to the development
of an efficient  signal pre-processing stage
that can be used to reduce drastically the size of the OMD optimization 
problem [10,11]. 
The pre-processing/problem size reduction stage 
(<i> Reduced Detector</i> (RD)), may then be followed by a 
Hopfield Neural Network (or any other suboptimal algorithm) stage,
assigned to solve a much smaller (residual) optimization
problem of the same form in order to further improve the BER performance. 
The RD receiver was evaluated via simulations
and was found to slightly outperform other suboptimal schemes
(multistage detector),  at a computational cost 
that can be as much as <i> two orders</i> of magnitude smaller.
Therefore, practical <i> hybrid</i> centralized  receivers combining digital 
microprocessors and HNN IC's with few neurons (such as the CLNN Bellcore chip 
with 32 units) may be integrated into cost effective systems
performing the challenging CDMA asynchronous multi-user demodulation 
task in real-time. Such systems will find immediate applications
in mobile telephony and satellite communications.

<title>Parallel Architectures Synthesis for the Wavelet Transforms</title>
<h1>Parallel Architectures Synthesis for the Wavelet Transforms</h1>

The Continuous Wavelet Transform (CWT) is a mathematical tool that received
a lot of attention over the last ten years.  
It corresponds to a time-scale
decomposition of finite energy signals used to represent the frequency
content as it evolves in time.
The Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT)
is the discrete-time discrete-scale counterpart of the CWT that can be
realized by using digital computers.  <p>

In this project we address the synthesis of efficient parallel 
architectures for computing the DWT.  Our main objective is twofold: 
to understand and analyze the
parallelism inherent in the DWT algorithm, and to systematically
derive parallel processing structures for its computation.  
We are primarily interested to find  regular computational structures 
which may be implemented by VLSI arrays with simple Processing Elements (PEs)
under <i> distributed memory and control</i>, or embedded into larger granularity
MIMD parallel machines using message passing. We found that the DWT cannot be
described by a set of <i> Uniform</i> or <i> Affine Recurrence Equations</i>
(UREs, AREs), and thus cannot directly be mapped onto a systolic array.
Also, as pointed out in [1], conventional methods developed for
transforming UREs and AREs into arrays will not efficiently
map the DWT\@. Therefore we apply <i> transformations on the index space</i> to
modify the original version of the DWT algorithm (regularize the
inter-octave data dependencies) so that it may then be
efficiently mapped to scalable array architectures by using linear
space-time mapping leading to simple control strategies. <p>

<title>Parallel Architectures for the 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform</title>
<h1>Parallel Architectures for the 1-D Discrete Wavelet Transform</h1>

Previous studies on VLSI architectures design for the 1-dimensional (1-D)
DWT can be found in
[2,3,4,5,6].  The architectures reported in
[2,5,6] are neither systolic nor regular, therefore
difficult to scale and extend to 2-D transforms. It is very difficult (if at
all possible) to draw any general conclusions on the performance of these
circuits for problems with more than $J=3$ octaves.  The designs in
[3,4] are based on the principle of reutilizing a pair
of convolvers controlled by a <i> global routing network</i>.
We have found that it is possible to derive better solutions
(in terms of scalability and latency) when  following a
top-down systematic synthesis approach.



<p>The main problem with the pyramidal DWT algorithm, traditionally
formulated over a 3-dimensional index space, is that   the
inter-octave  data dependencies have an irregular structure.
If array architectures are to be derived using space-time
mapping this irregularity will be translated to severe control
complexity for establishing data communication among the 
Processing Elements (PE's) and low efficiency.
In [7,8] we introduced a non-linear index-space
transformation ($\Gamma$)  that regularizes
the inter-octave dependencies and the "shape" of the index space.
As a result of performing a thorough data dependence and 
localization analysis of the transformed algorithm, 
an efficient array  architecture was derived for  3-octaves DWT  parallel
computation.

<p>The  3-octaves distributed memory and control
 DWT array structure derived, consists of only $L$ PEs, 
and achieves a parallel running time (latency) of $3M/2$
using only  7 memory registers per PE,
where $L$ is the wavelet filter length and $M$ the input sequence length.
For comparison, the arrays reported in
\cite{Vish92.2,Vish92.1</i> have latency  of $2M$ and similar
memory requirements. 
The proposed  array may be employed in many
applications that do not require more than $J=3$ octaves of 
signal analysis, since it attains the lower latency
bound that can be achieved by  architectures with $L$ processors
derived using  <i> multiprojection</i>  [9] and linear scheduling. However, higher octave distributed memory
DWT arrays obtained similarly,  will suffer from low efficiency and high
latency  of $\frac{2-2^{1-J</i></i>{J</i>$ and  $JM/2$ respectively,
where $J$ is the highest computable octave.
For example, similar arrays with $L$ PE's computing more than 5-octave 
decompositions will have utilization bellow 34% and 
latency at  least  equal to $3M$.

<p>In [10,11] we have shown 
that these performance limitations  can be removed  by introducing
a second algorithm transformation, ($\Gamma_{m</i>$), that effectively 
reduces the dimensionality of the algorithm's index space,
by "stretching and merging" successive octave planes into 
a single  plane.
Mapping an algorithm with a  2-dim index space onto a linear array is a 
straightforward task because, as long as the mapping matrix is non-singular,
there will be   no data collisions in the communication links. 
Using linear space-time mapping
on the resulting DWT algorithm leads to the derivation of fast and scalable 
array structures suitable for computing <i> any</i> desired number of octaves.

<p>In particular, two  arrays of $L$ PEs for computing <i> any</i>  $J$-octave 
DWT decomposition with latencies of   $M$ and  $2M-1$  respectively have 
been synthesized.
The latency  of both arrays is independent of the highest
 octave $J$, and the former design achieves the <i> lowest possible latency</i>,
 which is equal to the input sequence length $M \geq 2^{J</i>$.
The efficiency of both designs is nearly 100\% for <i> any</i> $M$.
The former array   uses length-$L/2$ data broadcast links
and is otherwise systolic,   and the latter is fully systolic. 
Both arrays consist of modular PEs with only  $O(J)$ local memory buffers.
On the other hand, it does not seem possible to improve on the latency 
of $2M$ reported for Vishwanath's semi-systolic circuits 
[3,4],
and furthermore, memory and control of these designs is <i> centralized</i> \/
because the routing network of registers acts as a  global filter-pair 
controller needed to ensure proper synchronization.
Therefore we believe that our proposed designs are at this point the 
<i> fastest and most scalable implementations</i> of the 1-D DWT with $L$ 
PEs reported in the literature.

<p>Since the derived arrays are both filter-length and octave
scalable, as well as efficient
for computing any number of octaves using  distributed memory 
and simple control, we believe that it is a natural step to use them
as building blocks in order to synthesize parallel architectures
for the  DWT on 2-dimensional sequences, a directions
we are currently pursuing. We are also investigating the potential use of
appropriate index space transformations that could lead to
efficient 1-D and 2-D DWT realizations on massively parallel
general purpose SIMD and MIMD machines, such as the 
MasPar and the Intel Paragon.

<title>Efficient Computation of large-size Multidimensional DFT's on Distributed Memory Parallel Computers</title>
<h1>Efficient Computation of large-size Multidimensional DFT's on Distributed Memory Parallel Computers</h1>

Since the invention of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), Discrete Fourier 
Transforms (DFT's) have been used extensively as a computational 
tool in almost all areas of signal processing, communications  and 
in numerous other scientific disciplines.  Although 
it has been a common belief that with the  available  modern RISC 
microprocessors there is no need  for new "exotic" DFT
algorithms, substantial computational savings 
can be achieved in a parallel processing environment by using 
flexible problem decomposition  schemes.
Exploiting the separability property of the multidimensional DFT's allows for 
independent computation of a collection of smaller dimensional
sub-problems, in a fashion that minimizes inter-processor communications.

<p> 
This project is a joint effort of a  group of mathematicians from
<i>  Aware Inc.</i>  of Cambridge Mass. (PI: R. Tolimieri)
and computer engineers from the <a href="test.html">Parallel Processing and Architectures Group </a>
of the CDSP Center at Northeastern University, that started in 1992.
The main thrust has been
an attempt to translate algebraic constructs based on the <i>  tensor product</i> 
formalism, used extensively to describe and characterize 
multi-dimensional DFT variants, to algorithmic menus suitable for efficient 
parallel processing.


<p> 
We have developed [1] a strategy for computing a multidimensional DFT
that <i>  hybrids</i>  a relatively new algorithm 
(<i>  Reduced Transform Algorithm</i> ,  (RTA)), with
available  single processor kernel routines.  We used the RTA
to address the reduction and optimization of interprocessor communications.
Our work has been  mainly motivated from the distributed 
memory parallel computing paradigm, which is arguably the most difficult 
to harness due to its exposed interprocessor communication to the 
programmer. 
We make use of algebraic facts in presenting the algorithms [2] ,
and the parameters in algebraic formulas give us the important 
parallel implementation parameters.  Thus the flexibility to address the 
variables in implementations is equated with flexibility in manipulating 
algebraic formalism.

<p> 
In its most general form, the RTA is a full
utilization of the duality between periodic and decimated data in the
Fourier transform.  We have considered [1] the application of RTA to the case
$\nat/P \x \nat/P$, for a prime number $P$.
Tensor product formulation of DFT computation on $\nat/N \x \nat/P \x \nat/P$
is interleaved with the <i>  periodization</i> 
step in the RTA for $\nat/P \x \nat/P$ to produce $P+1$ 
independent data sets of
size $NP$. The RTA can be used to address the imbalance between computation 
and communication rates in current distributed memory parallel machines by 
reducing communication between processors to <i>  cumulative</i>   patterns only 
(broadcast and combine) instead of the <i>  all-to-all</i>    communication 
patterns required in the global matrix transpose
needed by the <i>  Row-Column</i>    (RC) 
implementations of multidimensional DFT's.
Also, since fast algorithms for prime size 1D-DFT's exist [2] 
and the case $\nat/P \x \nat/P$ of the RTA is very efficient, because its
computation requires only $P+1$  1D transforms versus $2P$ for the RC
method, our approach also addresses the issue of storage reduction  by
providing additional transform size options.
For example the ability to perform a $181 \x 181$ point 2D DFT means potential
storage savings up to 50\% over the $256 \x 256$ case, in addition to savings 
in computational time. 
The storage savings can be used for the optimization of the broadcasting step 
needed for the RTA in environments with a long communications latency.

<p> 
Via the Chinese remainder theorem, we have extended our method to compute the 
3-dimensional DFT on $\bZ/N \x \bZ/MP \x \bZ/KP$, where $N$ is an arbitrary
integer, $M$ and $K$ are integers not divisible by $P$, for a prime $P$.
%In this case, essential computation is reduced to computing $(P+1)$
%independent 4-D DFT on $\bZ/N \x \bZ/M \x \bZ/K \x \bZ/P$. 
We transformed [1]  the data set to an equivalent 
5D data set on $<b> Z</b> /N \times 
<b> Z</b> /M \times <b> Z</b> /K \times <b> Z</b> /P \times <b> Z</b> /P$, 
and then employed the RTA on the last two indices
to break the problem into smaller independent sub-problems that can be 
computed in parallel. Each sub-problem is associated with the 
computation of the value of the Fourier Transform along one <i>  line</i>  in 
the set $<b> Z</b> /P \times <b> Z</b> /P$ passing through the 
origin. These lines intersect only at the origin and 
cover the whole index space. 
Three stages are needed to compute the values of the DFT along the 
lines: (1) Periodization stage, which consists of additions of 
data along lines perpendicular to a given line, (2) 3D Cooley-Tukey 
FFT and (3) $P$-point DFT. In a multiprocessor environment, each processor
computes these three steps independently of the others thus allowing 
for maximum parallelism and efficiency. Moreover, the final data 
distribution among the processors is such as to permit further 
processing in a parallel fashion, since every processor holds only 
results belonging to the same geometrical subset. 

<p> 
The hybrid RTA (HRTA) has been implemented on an Intel iPSC/i860 
<i>  hypercube</i>  and extensive timing results are reported in [1]
for large 2D and 3D DFTs with index sets in 
$Z/MP \times Z/KP$ and $Z/N \times Z/MP \times Z/KP$ respectively,
where $N, M, K$ are powers-of-two and $P$ is a small
prime number such as $3,5,7$. The non-optimized 
realizations of the new HRTA approach are shown to outperform by as much as
$70\%$ the optimized assembly coded realizations of the traditional 
Row-Column method on the iPSC/860. A recent comparison study of many different
2-D FFT implementations on the Intel Paragon supercomputer is 
reported in [3] .

<p> 
Moreover the HRTA provides an alternative approach that is suitable for
many different parallel and distributed processing environments.
In a DSP board with 4 powerful compute nodes (such as the Intel i860)
communicating via a shared bus, the HRTA seems to be the 
only viable parallel processing scheme  that would achieve 
real-time performance. In Clusters Of WorkstationS (COWS),  
a rapidly emerging cost-effective model  for parallel computing, 
the need for an all-to-all communication, that is necessary
for  transposition using the RC method, would be
highly inefficient. On the other 
hand, the HRTA has little or no need for communication
between different workstations so that very fast implementations 
can be created. We are currently pursuing experiments to
validate this conjecture.

<p> 
The proposed HRTA approach can be used in applications such as 
<i>  motion estimation</i>  from a sequence of images (multi-frame detection, MFD),
a very important task in computer vision, HDTV and video telephony.
Recently, frequency domain methods have been proposed 
[4] , that processes the frequency 
contents of the images to estimate the velocity and trajectory of the 
moving components. They offer more robust detection and 
huge computational savings since the frequency domain representation 
of the 3D data (sequence of 2D images) is more compact than the 
equivalent time domain representation. 
With all the processors holding data belonging to different lines 
in the frequency domain, each processor can independently test for the 
presence of motion along its assigned direction. <p>

<title>Helicopter Gearbox Fault Diagnosis using Analog Neural Networks</title>
<h1>Helicopter Gearbox Fault Diagnosis using Analog Neural Networks</h1>

The development of a reliable helicopter gearbox <i> Health Monitoring System</i>
(HMS) has been the subject of considerable research over the past 20 years. 
The deployment of such a system could lead to the saving of lives and vehicles,
as well as to a significant reduction in helicopter maintenance costs.  Recent
research results indicate that a neural networks based approach could provide a
viable solution to the problem. However no such system has been 
deployed so far. This project led to the development of  
two different software/hardware systems for monitoring the
health of helicopter gear-boxes.

<p> We have considered neural network models 
[1,2,3] suitable for two different
tasks and target implementations:  (i) A <i> hybrid</i> system,
designed to operate as an extremely accurate off-line 
monitoring tool, primarily  used to reduce maintenance costs. This system 
has the capability to detect whether a fault exists, classify it as
<i> gear</i>  or <i> bearing</i>   fault, and moreover identify the specific
fault-type within each category. (ii) An <i> all-analog</i> neural electronics
based fault/no-fault real-time monitor. With a lead time from fault
development to complete failure and crush of less than 15 minutes, robust 
real-time  fault detection for the helicopter's main gearbox is extremely 
crucial.

<p> For system (i) 128 or 256-point DFT's are computed by a 
digital microprocessor using floating point precision, and are then
fed to software-simulated 3-layer error back-propagation networks, trained
to perform classification/fault-identification.
It was observed that no substantial improvement on classification performance
was obtained by increasing the DFT size beyond 128 points/data window.
For system (ii) an <i> all-analog</i> VLSI implementation was developed, 
exploiting  the ability of an analog
neural network to compute directly (but with low precision)
the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
of the vibration data using the first layer of a feedforward 
multi-layer perceptron. The computed DFT coefficients 
are then feeding  the successive two neural layers that implement
fault  detection. Hardware performance results have been 
 obtained using the Integrated Neurocomputing
Architecture (INCA/1) analog VLSI neural network platform designed and
developed at C. S.  Draper Lab. Extensive simulations
using the INCA/1 system and real helicopter gear-box vibration data 
indicate that  64-point analog DFTs combined with a two-layer feedforward
neural network (with $64$ units/layer) can provide 
perfect performance  (100% detection 0% FAR), within the time frame 
required to process  $27$ non-overlapping windows of data

<title>Neural Networks for Automatic Target Detection and Recognition</title>
<h1>Neural Networks for Automatic Target Detection and Recognition</h1>

The goal of this research was  to develop multi-layer feedforward neural
network architectures that could effectively distinguish targets (mines) from
background clutter in side-scan sonar images.  We have been
provided  with a very noisy, real-world data set,
and  no information whatsoever about the operating
conditions and the ocean floor where the data
have been acquired. These sonar images contained <i> only</i>
echo-intensity and no frequency-domain information,
making  the formulation of an accurate  statistical model 
extremely difficult. Suitable neural network models able to
``discover" patterns in noisy input data, seemed aptly suited for 
this type of problem.  

<p> A variety of neural network architectures have been considered
simulated, and evaluated in an attempt to find the best approach 
for this particular application [1,2,3]. 
However, constraints have been
imposed upon candidate neural models both by the problem itself 
and by the requirements of the target hardware system which would eventually
be used to implement the detection of mines  in real-time, namely the
Analog VLSI <i> Integrated Neurocomputing Architecture</i> (INCA/1)
developed by the C.S. Draper Laboratory in Cambridge Mass.
The choice of pre-processing algorithms was limited by the goal of 
mear real-time performance. The choice of networks was limited to feed-forward
with less than  $64$ units per layer, such that they could be realized
by  INCA/1.  It has been found that classical statistical 
features extraction is outperformed by a much less computationally intensive
approach that simultaneously compresses and filters the raw data by taking 
a simple window mean. The correct target-detect-clutter-reject rate of the best
network (25-50-50-2) was 97.5% on training data set and 92.8% on test data. 

<p> Recently we started investigating the synergistic role
of <i> multiresolution</i> image analysis (based on wavelet filters) 
and neural networks based classifiers, on the problem of
target detection using  Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images.
We are considering <i> hierarchical</i> classification schemes, where  
small-size neural networks, attached at different scale-level leaves of the 
analysis tree, provide independent opinions in parallel. These partial
views are then combined using an adaptive decision mechanism.
It is conjectured that appropriately designed simple neural classifiers
may <i> collectively</i> achieve good detection performance in real-time. 
Since each classifier is working with a smaller than the original 
fine-resolution image, and in parallel with the others, 
fast target  detection is expected. 
We are investigating adaptive techniques that will determine
from  the data which scales (and  corresponding neural network opinions)
the global decision mechanism should weight more.

<title>Parallel Processing for Morphological Image Processing</title>
<h1>Parallel Processing for Morphological Image Processing</h1>

Morphological operations can be applied for image analysis in applications 
requiring defect or object <i> shape recognition</i>, such as robotic vision and
diagnostic medical imaging.  The basic morphological operations are the 
<i> dilation</i> and the <i> erosion</i>.  Although they do not involve 
multiplication, the very high data rates required by real-time applications 
can be achieved only by employing parallel processing and pipelining.

<p>We have  derived systematically  a 2-dimensional mesh-type Application
Specific VLSI array architecture for real-time morphological image processing
[1,2].
The array can perform dilation, erosion, or successive combinations of the two
(<i> opening</i> and <i> closing</i>).  The 2-D image can be gray-scale
(or binary) and the <i> structuring element</i> of arbitrary shape, 
as long as its bounding box is known.  The Locally Sequential Globally
Parallel (LSGP) partitioning scheme may be used to keep the array size small
and independent of the image size.  


<p>We summarize below the  derived array performance characteristics,
assuming that the image is $N \times N$ the structuring element's
bounding box is rectangular $(2M_1</i>+1) \times (2M_2</i>+1)$,
 and the LSGP partitioning factor is equal to $k$. In this case
the target array is a $(2M_2</i>+1) \times N/k$ \, 2-dimensional 
architecture of Processing Elements (PE's). 

<ul>
<li> The <i> throughput rate</i>   for input and output is 
one image pixel  per $(2M_1+1)$ PE cycles.

<li> The time to from start to completion of a morphological
operation (single MOP <i> latency</i> ) is \\
$L= (kN-1)(2M_1+1)+N/k+2(2M_2) =2(kN-1)M_1+kN+N/k+4M_2-1$  PE cycles.

<li> A new morphological operation can start 
(<i> block pipelining period</i>) every $kN \times (2M_1+1)$ PE cycles.

<li> The memory needed  per PE does not exceed $4M_1+3$ buffers.
</ul>


<p> 
For example, let us  assume that  $256 \times 256$  size images arrive
at  video rate (one image every $33.33$   msec) and that
we want to perform one dilation (or erosion) operation on 
every image using   $11 \times 11$  structuring elements.
If $k=8$ an   $11 \times 32$   2-D array can achieve real-time performance
if the PE cycle is not larger than $1.48$ $\mu$<i> sec</i>. 
Since only  integer addition/subtraction operations are involved,
it is reasonable to assume a PE cycle much less than 1  $\mu$<i> sec</i>
using available VLSI technology. 
Clearly the speedup achieved by the array will be  dictated 
by the interprocessor communication latency and the ability
of the PEs to compute and communicate concurrently. 

<p>
The architecture was derived using a vertically integrated
systematic mapping methodology, that allows formal verification at
the behavioral level.  It was validated through simulations
using concurrent programming  on a Transputers-based platform. 
Derivation of SIMD algorithms with near-neighbor communications
on 2-D or 3-D arrays suitable for general purpose supercomputers,
such as the MasPar and CM-2, as well as 
parallel algorithms and architectures for 3-D morphological image 
processing are directions worth pursuing.

<title>Concurrent Error Diagnosis on 2-Dimensional Mesh Array Architectures</title>
<h1>Concurrent Error Diagnosis on 2-Dimensional Mesh Array Architectures</h1>

During the last decade substantial research efforts have focused on the 
development of run-time fault tolerance schemes for  processor arrays. 
They are usually based on the assumption that the Processing Elements (PEs) 
can  identify themselves as being "faulty"  or "healthy" .  
In reality, the PEs do not have this capability, unless if they 
are designed to perform <i> Concurrent Error Diagnosis</i>  (CED) simultaneously
with normal operation, as a first step towards reconfiguration and recovery. 
The array CED techniques proposed in the literature basically follow two
approaches: In the first approach, the main objective is to locate and confine 
the  error in the Processing Element where the fault occurred, by using 
<i> Duplication-With-Comparison</i>  (DWC). Either <i> structure</i>    
[1,2]  or <i> time redundancy</i>  are  used for this 
purpose. 
In both cases, the comparison of two versions of the same computation
is assumed to always be fault-free. 
This approach, although it delivers high coverage and
low latency diagnosis, it imposes at least 100\% hardware or time overheads
and the need for <i> Totally Self Checking</i>  (TSC) checkers. 
The second approach, known as <i> Algorithm Based Fault Tolerance</i>  (ABFT) 
attempts CED in a distributed collective fashion. The detection latency 
is usually higher, and the data encoding scheme employed may vary for every
algorithm implemented by the array.

<p> In this project we have focused on the development of 
CED schemes for 2-Dimensional mesh <i> data-driven</i>  array architectures
[3] . 
We have developed  two techniques that can be implemented
without any added interconnection complexity.
The first CED scheme introduced [4] is based on the concept  of 
<i> overlapping H-processes</i>    
as a run-time fault tolerance mechanism.  An H-process corresponds to
the distributed redundant execution of an H-operation (hop) of the 
general format $(a \, op1 \, b) \, op2 \, (c \, op3 \, d)$ 
(where op1, op2 and op3 are dyadic operators)  in the
two " wings"   on an H-tree of PEs.
Since a very broad class of linear algebra and graph algorithms
can be expressed as a series of hops, the technique is not algorithm-specific. 
Successive hops are assigned to appropriately selected but different 
H-trees of PEs in the mesh, allowing error detection, location and 
masking to be  achieved collectively and " on-the-fly" , i.e. 
without graceful degradation. 

<p> A  realistic functional fault model was used, where there is no need for
hardware duplication and dedicated TSC checkers. The comparison 
(of the two results produced by the two wings of an H-process)
may be performed at the ALU of the H-root PE and is allowed to fail. 
Therefore many different implementations are envisioned from
general purpose microprocessors to custom
designed simple VLSI Processing Elements. The Error Handling Control
Logic is simple and hence it can be very reliable. 
A major advantage of this new  approach is that faults can be detected and
masked during normal array operation, even if they cannot be located 
immediately. No retry is necessary for transient fault handling and
reconfiguration should not be immediate. However some short duration
transients may not be detected.

<p> The second proposed CED mechanism, called 
<i> overlapping $\Gamma$-Processes</i>  [3] ,
 requires every PE to have a comparator, but also  allows comparators to 
fail (individually or along with the computation unit in the same cell).
Permanent errors can be locally detected, located, corrected and 
type-identified (computation vs. comparison).  In addition,
transient and intermittent errors of any duration can be detected and 
corrected, as well as a large class of multiple PE errors.
The overlapping $\Gamma$-Processes technique can be implemented using local 
control of low complexity on a data-driven mesh array of any size.  
Furthermore, it provides the flexibility to decide dynamically
on whether a fault should be treated as transient or permanent
(and initiate reconfiguration), depending on the cell's error 
occurrences history and the operating environment.
Behavioral level modeling (using the Verilog HDL) was used, to validate the 
diagnosis capabilities of the scheme on 2-D wavefront array architectures.
Using the HDL simulator developed, different types of faults may be 
injected in multiple cells; a faulty cell is 
always corrected by a healthy neighbor, and if a faulty cell attempts to 
corrupt a healthy one its action  is rejected.

<title>Extracting Large Linear Arrays out of 2-D Mesh Arrays with Faulty Cells</title>
<h1>Extracting Large Linear Arrays out of 2-D Mesh Arrays with Faulty Cells</h1>

In order to maintain constant
interconnection wire lengths between logically adjacent cells
and avoid introducing
additional tracks of busses and switches when linear arrays are
extracted out of two-dimensional arrays  with faulty processing
elements, the <i> spiral</i> reconfiguration approach has been introduced
[2]. Its main drawback, relative to the <i> tree</i> and 
<i> patching</i> methods, is that
it leads to low <i> harvesting ratio</i>, meaning that many good PEs 
on the mesh may not be included in the embedded linear array. 
We have recently
introduced [5] a two-phase <i> reconfiguration</i>   strategy 
that drastically increases the harvesting ratio of spiral approach techniques.
The algorithm  
of the first phase achieves comparable harvesting to the previously
proposed schemes by Aubusson-Catt and Manning, 
while it is simpler and thus can be implemented 
by on-chip logic. The algorithm of the second phase may complement
any other scheme reported in the literature
in order to raise harvesting to  levels that could so far be expected 
only by using the more difficult to implement tree reconfiguration method.
This improvement is achieved  by reclaiming healthy  PEs left unused by 
the first phase algorithm. 


<p> 
Extensive Monte Carlo simulations have been performed in order to compare
the new two-phase strategy with  existing spiral approach techniques
reported in the literature by Koren (KOR), Aubusson-Catt (AUB),
and Manning (MAN). A 20x20 physical array was
used in  all simulations. For each percentage value of 
fault free PEs (yield) examined, 500 different fault maps have been generated
randomly. The head of the spiral was placed at the upper left
corner PE in every simulation run. If this  PE is 
faulty its right neighbor is used as head and so on.
The <i> mean</i> length of the longest
array extracted  by phase 1, normalized by the number
of PEs was computed. It was observed that  the phase-1 algorithm outperforms
KOR and AUB (in most cases) and gives comparable average harvesting to 
MAN, which is a much more complicated algorithm.
By running phase 2,  in conjunction with <i> all</i>  the above mentioned 
algorithms for phase 1, the harvesting is raised substantially 
and all three algorithms (except KOR) achieve approximately the same 
harvesting across a wide range of yield values.
The observed saturation in  performance suggests 
that our two-phase reconfiguration strategy  approaches the maximum  
harvesting that can be achieved by <i> any</i>  spiral type of  technique.
Since spiral approach schemes  trade harvesting for
interconnection complexity and implementation simplicity, 
our two-phase strategy offers: (i)
a simpler first phase algorithm compared to
AUB and MAN and (ii) an  overall near optimal
harvesting ratio. Also note that applying  the proposed  two-phase 
reconfiguration strategy leads to  better harvesting
relatively  to any other algorithm   used alone.
Similar simulations using <i> clustered</i>   fault distributions
lead to the same type of results and conclusions.

<p>
<li> <a href="./ece3473/sch.ps"> Course Syllabus </a> [Postcript 61K]
</ul>

<h3> Course Overview </h3>
This introductory graduate level Network Northeastern course deals with 
how the <i>  concurrency </i>  inherently present 
in signal/image processing algorithms can be
exploited for high performance in <i>massively parallel</i>
computers, as well as <i>application specific VLSI
architectures</i>. First we introduce the basics 
including models of parallel computation, regular grid processor
topologies, message routing mechanisms, communication primitives,
performance and scalability evaluation methods.
Then we discuss how a sequential algorithm can be 
transformed <i>systematically</i> into an application specific
array processor or embedded into a general purpose 
massively parallel machine. Many examples of  <i>numerical
linear algebra</i> often encountered in signal/image processing, are used to 
highlight the key issues.
Specific DSP algorithms such as the FFT, linear system solvers,
transitive closure, higher order spectral estimators, discrete wavelet 
transform, are studied and parallel processing implementations are derived. 
Time permitting, neural networks are
introduced as an emerging  computational tool and their implementation
using VLSI architectures is discussed.

<p>


<h3>  Preparation </h3>
The course is self-contained and <i> has no graduate course 
prerequisites </i>. 
It is directed towards both graduate students of the ECE Dept. 
and  other disciplines (such as Computer Science, Mathematics, Physics)
as well as any practicing engineers/scientists interested to learn more
about <i> high performance signal processing </i> and scientific
computing. Knowledge of Linear Systems Theory, Computer Architecture and 
High Level Language Programming at a mature undergraduate level is 
assumed.

<p>
<h3> Reading Material </h3>
<ul>
<li> <b> Textbook: 
<a  href= "ftp://bc.aw.com/bc/authors/kumar/paracomp/"> Introduction to 
Parallel Computing </a> </b>, (required)
by V. Kumar, A. Grama, A. Gupta, G. Karypis, Benjamin/Cummings Publ., 1994.

<p>
<li>
<b> Class Packets: </b> (required). 
Will be made available at <i> Gnomon Copies </i>
(just across the street on Huntington Ave.). Network students
after registration should make arrangements with NNU in order to receive these
packets. They contain additional reading material to supplement
the Textbook and help you with the computer assignments.
Packet #1 will be available the first day of classes.
</ul>


<h3> Computer Assignments </h3>
Each student will be  provided with a computer account on the Sparc/Unix host
of a <b> Meiko Sc. Computing Surface </b> (CS-1400) multiprocessor system.
The CS-1400 is a multi-user Transputer (T-800) based MIMD machine with 
currently 20 processors (4Mb/T-800). It can be accessed
from the Internet or directly via  modem from any remote terminal/PC/MAC.

<p>
We will teach you how to develop code  that runs 
efficiently on a distributed memory, message-passing 
parallel processing system. Two simple computer assignments will be
used first to gradually introduce you to parallel programming.
During the second half of the course each student
should carry out a <i> term project </i>.
You can do what I assign or better 
pick your favorite DSP algorithm, study the parallel
processing schemes proposed for it in the literature, select one of them or
propose a new one and implement it on the CS-1400. In the
past such projects have been the starting point of graduate theses work
and papers presented to conferences.
Group projects (2 students) are acceptable if the amount
of work involved is substantial. 
A report (in the form of a technical paper) summarizing 
the results of the term project is due the last class meeting.

<title>Research Areas</title>  
<h1>Research Areas</h1>  

<hr>

Our classification of power system  research areas and topics follows 
in part the traditional utility organization. It is meant only as an aid in defining the topical areas  and is in no way rigid or exclusive. This is especially true today  when much of the utility and manufacturing  industry is
in a state of transition, and when many  problems of of technical importance transcend the traditional borders along the lines of the generation-transmission-distribution scheme. We also recognize the need for
utilities and manufacturers to be ever more  responsive regarding customer service  quality. 

<h2>Background on Power Systems Research at Northeastern University</h2>

Our general point of view  in writing these guidelines is that the economic and legal environment for the utility business  in the next decade will be an extrapolation of the current conditions. We expect  the following trends:
<ul>
<li>Continued environmental legislation concerning power plant chemical
emissions and possibly even electromagnetic emissions in power transmission,
<li>Increased deregulation, with continued emphasis on cogeneration and open access to the utility grid,
<li>Increased competition from other energy providers, with added customer emphasis on the quality of energy supply,
<li>Financial environment that makes large capital investment difficult, often resulting in delayed replacement of major plants and equipment,
<li>Increased problems in obtaining ``rights of way'' and other documentation
for new transmission facilities, with the resulting pressures to better utilize
available facilities, even for tasks that were not part of the original design,
<li>Increasing energy imports in areas deficient in generation (New England
being a prime example). 
</ul>
The aforementioned trends will force the utility planners and operators to face a list of challenging technical problems. These problems will have to be solved with a proper blend of traditional, time-tested engineering with an increased use of new technologies and control and decision support systems. The new  technologies include: 
<ol>
<li>Power electronics that will influence both the transmission subsystem (along the lines of EPRI Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS) initiative), and bring about changes in loads and loading patterns as seen in the
distribution subsystem;
<li>New control methodologies that explicitly include uncertainties present in
a large-scale power systems;
<li>New communication capabilities based on fiber optics and microwave
equipment,
<li>New measurement equipment (phasor measurements being an example) 
</ol>

The term distributed intelligence is sometimes used  in this area to denote the integration of measurement, communication and computational resources in power systems. We think that the term is largely unnecessary as it seems to 
signify a qualitative  deviation from the current utility control practice,
which is not the case. The concept of hierarchical control, with closed-loop
operation at different levels (generation, transmission, distribution),
has been a part of power systems for almost three decades. The communication and and computational  technology have reached the stage  capable of delivering the required level of performance at an acceptable cost.<p>

Our goal is to help achieve robust and economical operation of power systems
through better control and communication methodologies that disperse data 
acquisition and processing, as well as the   control authority,  throughout the 
power system. <p>

In summary, our research program  specifically targets utilities that  will
acquire little new power generation or transmission hardware in the
  foreseeable
future, that will operate in a challenging legal and financial environment, and
will have to satisfy increased consumer demands, particularly in the power
quality area. 
 Building on the hands-on, real world experiences of the Northeastern's 
cooperative education program, we have developed the strong utility and manufacturing focus that differentiates our program from others.  The main thrust of our cooperative research  program is in developing and
testing new control and communication techniques that rely on diverse resources
in terms of measurements, communication channels and computing facilities.

<h2>Background on Power Electronics and Motion Control Research</h2>

Our research in power electronics and  motion control
is centered around a system--theoretic approach to analysis
and design of such systems. In particular,
<ul>   
<li> We rely on coursework in signal processing and system and 
       control theory to provide our students with the  proficiency needed 
       to address applied control and estimation problems encountered in 
       motion control and power electronics.
 <li> Our Power Conditioning and Motion Control Laboratory provides 
       facilities for prototyping  and testing built around easily 
       reconfigurable hardware
       and software blocks.
 <li>We extensively use system simulation tools (Matlab and Simulink) and
       detailed circuit simulation tools (Saber) to test and tune our 
       controllers. The main intentions are to
         reduce the development time and costs, and to
        explore the intrinsic limits of techniques under investigation.
</ul>

<title>Utility Customer Concerns</title>
<h1>Utility Customer Concerns</h1>
<hr>

 The term power quality has come to include
many quantities, usually seen at the  utility/customer interface. These include
as examples: harmonic content of currents and voltages, effects of new customer loads
(variable speed drives being an important example), non-sinusoidal operation
observed on some  distribution  feeders, time-domain characteristics of voltages
and currents, availability of service. We describe these research topics
from a utility  point of view, although the same methods are applicable  for large
e speed drives being an important example), non-sinusoidal operation
observed ocustomers.

  
<h2>Harmonics in the Utility Network</h2>
The topic of harmonics in the utility networks is a very timely one. IEEE 519 is
the document summarizing the engineering practice in the area, but many standards
coexist (IEC 555-2 and others). Our opinion is that some parts of these documents
will have to be updated to account for new sources of harmonics in distribution
networks. Examples   include converters operating under randomized and hysteretic
switching disciplines, which exhibit dominant inter-harmonic (or subharmonic)
behavior. Professor Stankovic 
 gave an invited presentation to  the Harmonics Working Group
at IEEE PES 1994 winter meeting, and the responses from both utilities and
equipment manufacturers were positive. Most of the analytical tools needed to
study this problem are available (some developed at CDSP), and we are looking
for a close collaboration with a utility  that would provide measurements and
case studies for quantification and refinement of theoretical concepts. Professors
James  Feldman and Hanoch Lev-Ari
are other faculty members interested in this area.

<h2>Variable Speed Drives</h2>

This class of AC drives is steadily spreading, both on the customers'
 side (large
industrial loads) and within the utilities (large pumps, fans, air-intakes in
generating plants). Variable speed drives influence the distribution network
through harmonic injections and through transient behavior. 
 Many control problems associated with variable speed drives for   utility
applications require further attention. Faculty members with interests in these 
problems are Professors Clas Jacobson, Gilead Tadmor and Alex Stankovic.


<h2>Non-sinusoidal Operation</h2>
Non-sinusoidal, and particularly non-periodic operation (in the mathematical
sense that all cycles are not identical) has been observed in power networks.
Some of these questions are addressed by the  IEEE PES Working Group on
Nonsinusoidal Situations. The issues here are not solely theoretical, since new,
costly measurements might be required to resolve certain operating problems.
Non-periodic operation of networks containing switching converters has not been
properly modeled in terms of active, reactive and apparent power, and we would
like to explore that set of questions. The faculty members interested in
collaboration in this area are Professors Gilead Tadmor,
Hanoch Lev-Ari  and Alex Stankovic.

<title>Power Distribution</title>
<h1>Power Distribution</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Probabilistic Modeling of Loads</h2>
This work is a collaboration between Alex Stankovic and
 Professor Bernard Lesieutre of MIT Laboratory 
for Electromagnetic and Electronic Systems. Initially, the 
attention was  
 focused on deriving probabilistic steady-state 
and dynamical models for clusters
of induction machines. Preliminary results  are described in papers presented
 at the  1994 North American Power Symposium and submitted to 1995 
IEEE PES Summer Meeting. 
The
same methodology is  applicable to other classes of machines, drives and loads in
general.

<h2>Distribution Automation and Feeder Reconfiguration</h2>

Research in this area would follow Professor Stankovic's
 efforts in using a graph theory
approach to feeder reconfiguration following a major line/transformer outage. The
results of such studies are of use to both system operators (in real-time) and to
distribution system planners (for network design evaluation). We are looking for case
studies that would help us explore the capabilities of  the algorithms, and lead
to the development of distribution system security enhancement procedures.

<title>Power Transmission and System-Wide Control</title>
<h1>Power Transmission and System-Wide Control</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Power Electronics in Bulk Transmission Systems</h2>

Power electronics is likely to play a major role in increasing the transfer
capability of existing transmission systems, as well as making new transactions
between the utilities (``power wheeling'') feasible and predictable. 
It is also expected that the
power electronics apparatus will help in preparing power systems to face 
transient  and small-signal stability problems.  The importance of power
electronics has been recognized by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI)
initiative in Flexible AC Transmission Systems (FACTS). This program involves
collaboration between utilities and manufacturers  of high-voltage power
electronics equipment. <p>

While some of the FACTS devices have been demonstrated in practice, much work
still needs to be done in the areas of modeling and control, especially in the
domain of transient behavior. This work also  complements ongoing research and
teaching efforts in power electronics, with the emphasis on control.
The faculty members working in  this problem area are
Professors Jacobson, Tadmor and Stankovic. 



<h2>Real Time Control of Transmission Networks</h2>

Operational modes in power transmission systems in the near future will likely
involve larger power transfers, mostly dictated by economics and generation
shortages in some areas (New England again coming to mind). Since a major
expansion of transmission facilities in the same time horizon is unlikely, lines
will have to be exploited closer to their thermal and stability limits. 
 The importance of real-time control of transmission facilities is bound to grow
in  such operational mode. <p>

A critical ingredient for real-time control of transmission networks is  the
availability of accurate models of the interconnection (as seen by each
participating utility). The problem of unreliable system data has been recognized
in power systems for a long time, and the pressures of real-time operation are
going to make the problem even more difficult. We propose to develop systematic
procedures for real-time estimation of equivalents of neighboring utilities for
the specific purpose of stability studies. This direction is different from the
present practice in that the purpose of the equivalents (reduced models of the
neighboring subsystems) is prescribed explicitly. Most of the models in current
use are based on circuit theory and on  load flow equivalents, and we tend to
believe that the precise focus on stability problems will lead to better models
(for that particular purpose). For example, the robust and the worst-case
identification  theory (parts of which have been developed at CDSP) are
applicable in that setup. We also propose to critically examine different
identification methods, both in terms of accuracy and in terms of their
requirements for real-time power system measurements. Faculty members with
interests in this area are Professors Clas Jacobson, Gilead Tadmor and  
Alex Stankovic.

<h2>Siting of New Measurement Devices</h2>

Phasor measurement devices are being increasingly deployed in parts of power
systems where that information is deemed important. These devices rely on very
accurate time-information (sometimes obtained from the Global Positioning System
Satellites (GPSS)) to estimate both the magnitude and the phase of sinusoidal
variables. The devices are commonly considered to be accurate and robust, but
their price is substantial, and precludes their installation in all nodes of the
network. Thus the siting problem arises, and  has received  increased
attention recently. In its mathematical structure, it is quite similar to certain
problems in distribution feeder reconfiguration, and we plan to use that
similarity as a starting point in our work. Professors James Feldman and 
Alex Stankovic  are 
faculty members  interested in this research  area.



<h2>Communications in Normal and Post-Contingency Operation</h2>

 Modern power system communications are mostly  based on fiber optics and
microwave radio technology, while the power line carrier technology is often
reserved for relaying protection purpose. The role of modern communication
systems for power system monitoring and control can not be overemphasized. If the
components are to be loaded closer to their technical limits, then timely control
signals become crucial. These control signals are in turn   based on measurements
obtained almost simultaneously at very distant geographical locations, and some
control signals themselves have to be transmitted over large distances.
Communications play an 
even bigger role in the unlikely, but very important case of
restoration of power system following a major contingency. In that case
communication resources have to be very carefully budgeted and coordinated. The
faculty members with interests in this research area are Professors David Brady
and  Alex Stankovic.

<h2>Reliability of Power Systems</h2>

Probability theory  and stochastic processes have a long 
 tradition of application  in power systems. Reliability studies and load
forecasting are only two examples of such developments. While such classical
areas continue to be important, probabilistic modeling of loads and sources of
harmonics in power systems  are gaining prominence.  The faculty members with
interests in this research area are Professors 
Hanoch Lev-Ari and Alex Stankovic.


<h2>Simulation of Power Systems</h2>

Work on this topic is concerned with  improvements in computer--aided 
methods of power system simulation in order to ensure uninterrupted supply
within the set limits of frequency and voltage deviations. The methods  of 
interest include expert systems and other artificial intelligence tools. 
The research in this area is supervised by Professor Sarma Mulukutla.

<h1>Power Generation</h1>
<hr>

<h2>Design of Power System Stabilizers (PSS)</h2>

The concept of dissipativity provides a natural framework for analysis and 
design of high--performance electromechanical systems, and of electrical
generators in particular. A technical  note describing a way to formulate
this robust design problem in the $H_{\infty}$ framework
has been recently submitted to IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control
by Professors Jacobson, Tadmor and Stankovic. While this is an on--going 
project, preliminary results are very encouraging, 
and are presently undergoing testing with 
 a variety of EPRI--developed software tools.

<h2>Switched Reluctance Machines in Power Plants</h2>
Switched reluctance machines (SRM) are increasingly being used in applications
where the reliability of operation is the main concern. This  affordable class of
machines has a built-in fault tolerance, as they  continue to rotate even when
some phase windings become
 completely unoperational (while providing a reduced torque).
A research program headed  by Professors Clas Jacobson, Gilead Tadmor and 
Alex Stankovic  plans to explore  robust control and 
fault detection of switched
reluctance machines. We are looking for partnerships with both utilities and
manufacturers that  would study the capabilities of 
SRM in key positions in large
power plants (pumps, fans, valves) and in major power system equipment. 

<h2>Effects of Co-generation on Power Systems</h2>

The increased spread of cogeneration in power systems is driven by both legal and
economic concerns. Most of these non-utility owned facilities  (also known as
Independent Power Producers (IPP)    are going to be connected to the
distribution network, and this in turn 
  will  substantially change the energy flow
patterns in parts of the distribution subsystem. Since the system   was not
designed for such operational mode,  systemwide studies are needed to evaluate the
effects of cogeneration. System protection that previously 
relied on the known, fixed
direction of the energy flow  will have to be redesigned and tested.
We propose to study the capabilities of digital signal processing (DSP) based
protection to meet these goals while keeping the costs acceptable. Our CDSP
laboratory is completely equipped to support the experiments that would be part
of this research project. The faculty members with
interests in this topic  are Professors Hanoch Lev-Ari and Alex Stankovic.

<title>Power System Apparatus and Equipment</title>
<h1>Power System Apparatus and Equipment</h1>
<hr>

One of our  initiatives in this domain is the research program 
that addresses control and fault detection of switched reluctance machines. Our
starting point is the previous theoretical work by Professor Clas Jacobson
on compensators providing both  fault detection and control function.
We propose to examine the effectiveness of structures that combine the control
and fault detection functions. Such configurations are characterized by minimal
increase in hardware components due to the addition of real-time
 fault detection
tasks to the standard control function. 
This model-based fault detection approach is based on modern system theory  and
holds promise in achieving  robust operation in environments characterized by
uncertainty.  A related  problem that we would like to address is the real-time
thermal monitoring of power system apparatus that would include thermal model
development and validation.  We think that our fault-detection  concept is
applicable to various power system components (circuit breakers, transformers),
and we are looking for collaboration with both utilities and manufacturers. In
utility daily operation the fault detection approach 
 would allow for emergency 
maintenance  prior
to  potentially catastrophic faults, and also for 
adaptive scheduling of regular
maintenance.<p> 

We are also interested in real-time equipment monitoring for control purposes.
The actual operating conditions are  valuable information 
in real-time control,
especially following contingencies. In that respect manufacturers'
 name-plate data
provide only a reference point  and operators may need to use the
 equipment with
loadings that differ from nominal operating practices. These procedures
 are  a
part of dynamical estimation techniques that would provide model and 
measurement
based estimates not only of  steady-state quantities, but of suitable reduced
dynamical models as well.<p>


Research on electromagnetic fields in electrical devices  is headed by 
Professor Sarma Mulukutla. The program is concerned with the application
 of analytical, experimental and computational methods for the determination
 of electric fields in electrical devices while taking full account of the 
magnetic saturation. The techniques have been applied to permanent--magnet 
aerospace instruments and to large synchronous as well as DC machines,
photo--voltaic cells and windmill motors.<p>


A research program that will address design and signal processing
for vibration sensors in electric apparatus and in civil infrastructure is
 being  initiated   by ECE professors McGruer, Zavracky and Stankovic.
It is a response to a joint NSF/EPRI initiative on sensors in power
systems.
The  program  will involve fabrication of micro--machined accelerometers
optimized for the particular monitoring task, and a development of 
tailored signal processing schemes. <p>

<title>Motion Control</title>
<h1>Motion Control</h1>
<hr>

Our main project in this area is a theoretical characterization and an
experimental verification of a robust, torque ripple--free controller for  a
switch reluctance motor. Some of our results are contained in a paper that
will be presented at the International Conference on Power Electronics
and Drives, PEDS'95, in Singapore, in February 1995. We plan to extend our
 approach to switched permanent magnet machines, and laboratory equipment 
acquisitions are under way. <p>

We are also interested in low--speed operation of electric
drives equipped with shaft encoders and in the  use of piezo--electric
actuators for active noise suppression in electric 
drives. Faculty with interests in this area include
Professors Jacobson, Tadmor and Stankovic.

<h1>Power Electronics</h1>
<hr>


There are presently three initiatives at  Northeastern University in this
  research area. One of them is the NSF sponsored project on 
Markov chain control of randomized switching in power converters,
 under the direction of Professor Stankovic.
Current standard practice in power
converters  operation is based on the generation of periodic 
switching functions. 
Periodic switching policies are energy efficient, but can  require
 extensive filtering,
 and can produce excessive  acoustic noise in motor applications due to 
interactions of harmonics  with  mechanical structures.
 The purpose of this project is to mitigate these and other related effects  
through the development of a unified design  procedure for randomized
  switching
waveforms in  power converters. 
 The starting point for the research  is a set of recently proposed randomized  switching  schemes, where a stochastic
 signal with
appropriately chosen statistical properties is added to the reference 
 switching
function. Randomization then alters the frequency  content   without 
 affecting
the proper operation. The  development of design procedures for switching  governed by Markov
chains will further  enhance this approach by enabling  time-domain adaptation
and waveform optimization in both  time and   frequency domains. The new
approach is also practical and interesting for manufacturing,
 as it does not require any major hardware  changes in existing equipment.<p>

The second  initiative deals with robust control of DC/DC converters.
Our attention is presently focused on  series resonant converters,
and we are comparing and contrasting several robust design methodologies.
An experimental verification is planned for early spring.<p>

The third research 
program deals with problems arising in power management in 
portable electronic equipment and in autonomous underwater
vehicles (in collaboration with the Northeastern University Marine
Systems Laboratory).<p>

The faculty members with interests in this area are Clas Jacobson, Gilead
 Tadmor and Alex Stankovic.

<h2>Wildcats thump defenseless Dogs</h2><p> 
<font size=3> 
<b>By Christopher Doscher and Jason J. Meserve</b><br> 
<i>News Staff</i><p> 
 
Reality moved into Matthews Arena Friday night.<p>
It took over the space where defence once resided.<p>
The men's hockey team came into their weekend contests with New Hampshire riding high, following last Sunday's win over sixth-ranked Michigan State.  They opened their Hockey East schedule with two losses to UNH, 7-3 at home on Friday and a 9-4 drubbing at UNH on Saturday.<p>
"They're an explosive team," NU Coach Bruce Crowder said of UNH.  "They just kept coming."<p>
"We've got a young defense, and we're just going to get better each and every game.  We just have to learn from our mistakes, and hopefully we're not going to continue to make them," Crowder said.<p>
On Friday, the Huskies stayed close through the first two periods, despite being outshot 29-20.  The game remained scoreless until 14:16 of the first period, when UNH forward Jason Krog stole a pass during an NU power play and went in for an unassisted shorthanded goal.  NU responded quickly with a goal by freshman forward Todd Barclay, assisted by freshman Roger Holeczy.<p>
UNH took a 2-1 lead in the second on a goal by forward Mike Souza.  In the third, Erik Kaminski's goal at 4:19 tied the score at 2.  But even before Kaminski's goal could be announced, UNH responded with the first of three consecutive goals.<p>
A goal by Huskies forward Eric Peterson brought the Huskies to within two, but goals by UNH forwards Jason Shipulski and Mark Mowers at 13:15 and 13:36 respectively, put the game out of reach for NU.<p>
Throughout much of Friday's game, the Huskies had problems advancing out of their own zone.<p>
"We've struggled a little bit," Crowder said.  "But again, they've got such quick forwards, and they're on you right away.  I don't think we executed our breakouts very well."<p>
The Huskies also struggled on the power plays, with several errant passes leading to UNH breakaways.<p>
"We've worked on it in practice, but we've got guys who are individualizing it, and you just can't do that.  You've got to keep the puck moving," Crowder said.<p>
Saturday's game was played two days late; it should have been held on Halloween.  It was that scary.<p>
The Huskies had trouble in their own zone all night.  The defense couldn't keep people from parking in front of the NU cage, nor could they stop many of the odd-man rushes created by forwards caught up ice.  UNH looked like Ferraris, while NU could be compared to Ford Pintos.<p>
It was 1-1 with 12:25 left to go in the first as Wildcat Eric Boguniecki and NU's Scott Campbell traded tallies.  Campbell scored his second of the game (a beautiful rush from his own zone - one of the only highlights), unfortunately it was sandwiched between seven Wildcat goals.<p>
Robitaille was victimized for six goals in the first half of the game, while junior Kevin Noke, making his first appearance of the season, surrendered three goals.<p>
"I thought [Robitaille] was getting beat up a bit, so I decided to give Noke some playing time," said Crowder when asked why he pulled his starting goalie.<p>
NU also received goals from Geoff Wilkinson (first collegiate) and Barclay.  Enthousiastic Wildcat fans were treated to a hat trick by Nickulas.<p>
"Mama told me there would be days like this," Crowder said after the game.<p>
Let's hope there's not too many more like this, or it could be a cold winter at Matthews.<p>

<h1> Zagreb Cracks Down on Dissent</h1><br>
       <h2> Reporters, Opposition Leaders Could Face Prosecution</h2>

 

 
<h2><i> by Yigal Chazan <p>
  The Gazette, 6/9/92, Montreal, Canada<p></i></h2><p>

The Croatian government has launched a crackdown on ploitical dissent by threatening to prosecute prominent journalists and opposition leaders in the run-up to parliamentary elections.  Civil-rights campaigners say the action represents a serious restriction of freedom of expression in the new state.<p>

Six reporters are facing charges of publishing ``false information," ``disturbing the public" and ``offending the state president," Franjo Tudjman.<p>

Members of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) are said to want to <A HREF = "indcen.html">take over</A> the country's leading independent newspaper, <i>Slobodna Dalmacija</i>, which has been consistently critical of the Zagreb [Croatian capital] leadership.<p>

<h2>Juxtaposed Photos</h2><p>

Three of the paper's staff are being investigated by the state prosecutor, Vladimir Seks, for designing a photo montage in the satirical weekly insert <i>Feral Tribune</i>, comparint Tudjman to Hitler and Stalin.<p>

Under the banner headline ``One school, one class, one pupil," the offending page featured juxtaposed photographs of the three as students.<p>

The journalists responsible have a reputation for upsetting the authorities.  During the Communist period, they were investigated 10 times and twice appeared in court, but the charges were dropped on each occasion.<p>

The <i>Feral Tribune</i> team said Tudjman, a former Communist army general, is increasingly assuming the autocratic style of the late Yugoslav leader Josip Broz Tito, and filling key government positions with figures from the old regime.<p>

``Tudjman is trying to be a new Tito here," said Boris Dezulovic, one of the three journalists threatened with prosecution.  ``He has the power to dissolve parliament.  he is also creating a personality cult."<p>

``He and the others have changed their suits but they are still Bolsheviks.  it is difficult to expect true democracy in time of war, but a war cannot be an excuse for the things that are happening."<p>

Journalists at <i>Slobodna</i>, which has a circulation of nearly 140,000, said Tudjman and his party are datermined to take it over.<p>

At an HDZ meeting in Split last week, one local official, Dr. Smilja Grgurev, reportedly said the party would need to gain the control of the paper to win the forthcoming elections, expected in July.  She called its reporters bandits and accused them of never publishing a line oabout the HDZ.<p>

``We are applying for private company status, but the authorities are taking a long time to consider our request," said Dezulovic.<p>

``If they reject it, there is nothing to stop the government moving in and appointing its own editorial team."<p>

<i>Slobodna</i> journalists, who have received support from readers and opposition parties, say they will set up another newspaper if forced to bow to the government.<p>

While the press has been the main target of the state prosecutor, he has also brought court proceedings against two political thorns in the government's side.<p>

Dobroslav Paraga, the right-wing leader of the Croatian party of Rights, is threatened with prosecution for stating that the president [Tudjman] gave up part of eastern Croatia during European Community-sponsored negotiations in the Hague.<p>

<h2>Pressure to Convert</h2><p>

Milorad Pupavac, leader of an alliance of moderate Croatian Serbs seeking to forge links with liberal members of the government, is under investigation for claiming that up to 11,000 Serbian children in Croatian schools, generally Ortodox Christians, are being pressured to take Chatolic catechism and convert to Catholicism.<p>

Pupovac, a professor of linguistics at Zagreb university, said that many Croatian Serbs are being expelled from the republic while those who remain behind will have difficulty gaining Croatian citizenship.<p>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><h2>Demonstrations in Serbia</h2>

On November 17, in the second round of the local elections, opposition parties won overwelming victories in all the major cities in Serbia.  After at first admitting defeat, the ruling Socialist party of president Slobodan Milosevic, has <a HREF="/info/students/marko/nasaborba/nasaborba2.html">annulled the elections</a> in most of the cities and towns where the opposition had won.  Most notable examples are the capital Belgrade and third largest city
in Serbia, Nis.  When the first news about the annulment and other <a HREF="/info/students/marko/nasaborba/nasaborba3.html">irregularities</a> became public, opposition supporters started daily street protests in all major cities and towns all over Serbia which still go on.  The opposition has been able to draw hundreds of thousands of protesters on a daily bases for more than 14 days.
While the state controlled media have totally ignored the demonstrations, several independent newpapers and radio stations have managed to break the
information blokade:  Radio B92, the only independent radio station in Belgrade has managed to inform the citizens of Belgrade and the world (through its WWW site) about the events in Serbia.  Since November 27 the authorities have <a HREF="http://www.siicom.com/odrazb/b92-danger.html">started to jam
the station's only transmitter</a> in Belgrade and banned the local radio stations
all over Serbia which had retransmitted B92 program. On December 3, the authorities have finally switched off B92 transmitter and blocked the broadcasts of a smaller radio station, radio Index, which has also followed the protests.  Another independent radio station, Radio BOOM 93 from Pozarevac, Milosevic's birth place, was taken off air. However, B92 program will be broadcasted to Serbia by Voice of America on <strong>792kHz</strong> for 20 minutes, every day at midnight local time. The station should now cover all of Serbia.  If you know someone in Serbia let them know about this.  They are under a total media blocade.<P>
 
Only three days later, on Friday, December 6, after a strong international outcry and the largest demonstrations since November 17 in Belgrade, the station transmitter was switched on again.  Radio Index was also broadcasting, while Radio BOOM 93 was still banned.  In another development, the authorities have started a wave of arrests aimed at the demonstrators.  So far more than 60 protesters have been arrested all over Serbia.  They are usually immediatelly sent to prisons and no contact with lawyers or families is allowed.  In the latest escalation, the police arrested the student who had been carrying Mr. Milosevic's effigy in prison garb during the last four days.  He was beaten (broken nose and ribs) and tortured (sodomized by a police batton, deprived of food, drink and sleep) in the prison.<P>

Today, December 9, the Supreme Court of Serbia again confirmed its earlier decision and annulled the local elections in Belgrade.  Its decision was issued in response to a petition from the City Electoral Commission.  CEC contested the earlier court ruling which gave the failure of the CEC to consider all complaints regarding the regularity of the election procedure as the reason for the annulment of the elections.  In its petition CEC said that <strong>all complaints were considered</strong>.  Todays ruling rejected the petition since the original election records were only signed by the CEC chair and his deputy, <strong>as is required by law</strong>.<P>

The protests continued today, December 8.  Independent unions have announced that they will join the protests the next week if the Supreme Court doesn't reinstate the original election results.  New police reinforcements are arriving to the cities all over Serbia.<P>  

We take this opportunity to appeal to the visitors of this site to all in their power to protect the democracy and independent media in Serbia.  Urge your government to support the Serbian opposition!  Urge them to stop supporting Mr. Milosevic and his authoritarian thugs. Also, you can let Mr. Milosevic and his information minister, Mr. Tijanic, know that the world cares:<P>

<h1>Ruling party Engages in Widespread Obstruction, Vote Rigging and Lawlessness</h1>
                
<strong><em>by Slobodan Vucetic (Serbian Constitutional Court judge)</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 11/25 1996</h2>

The most recent elections for the lower house of the Federation and the local  
government, which after the second round still haven't been completed, demonstrate
the complicated nature of the political situation in Serbia.  After unexpectedly
convincing victory for the Socialists in the federal elections, their leaders
expected equally convincing victory in the local elections.  That is why they
hurried with the statements about the early elections for the Serbian parliament,
which were supposed to ensure absolute majority for the Socialist Party of Serbia
in all three levels of government: federal, republican and local.  However,
the outcome of the local elections, especially in the second round, was a very
unpleasant surprise for the Socialists: they lost the elections and power in all
the largest cities in Serbia: Belgrade, Novi Sad, Kragujevac, Nis, Kraljevo, 
Uzice, Cacak, Sombor, Zrenjanin, Pancevo etc.  Defeat in largest cultural and
industrial centers in Serbia, where more than 50 percent of registered voters
voted for the opposition parties, removed the shine from the victory in the
federal elections and made the results of the future state elections uncertain 
(which made it likely that these elections will be postponed).<P>

Accepting the risk that, because of incomplete official results, one could
sometimes be mistaken, the results of the most recent elections lead to several
conclusions.  Above all, there are two major reasons for the convincing 
victory for the Socialists in the federal elections.  The first factor is the unprecedented
unconstitutional and unlawful use of all the electronic media and
high circulation newspapers by the ruling party and the exclusion of the opposition and opinions which differ from
those offered, more correctly imposed, by the Socialist Party of Serbia (SPS) from the same media.
Undoubtedly, this factor had the crucial influence on the voting preferences
of a large number of citizens, who, because of a lack of education, received the
only information about the global political and economic issues through the media
strictly controlled by SPS and the United Yugoslav Left (JUL).  This situation
denied democratic goal and character of the elections which became illegitimate
 and illegal.<P>

<h2>Tidy Records</h2>

Second factor which has had decisive influence in all republican and federal
elections until now and contributed to the good results of the Socialists was
the election boycott by the Albanians.  Because of the boycott, all the mandates
in Kosovo and Metohija were won by SPS ("no one dare hit you!").<P>

Regarding the local elections in municipalities and cities, none of the above
mentioned factors could have had significant influence.  Unlike in the federal
elections, which an average citizens experiences as "complicated state politics",
local policies and their results in the cities and municipalities (deteriorating
public transport, lack of heating, cleanliness, arrogant and corrupt local authorities etc.)
are daily visible and obvious to any citizen; this image cannot be corrected by 
party propaganda on the Television screens.  Above all, this applied to large
cities where public service firms exhibited the worst performance, and are much more important in
the daily life of citizens.<P>

Also, in large industrial centers the imposition of international
sanctions (the whole previous mandate, 1992-96) led to the total breakdown of many
large companies which provided livelihood for a majority of citizens ("Zastava"
in Kragujevac, Electronic Industry and Machine Industry in Nis, Rakovica, IMT and others
in Belgrade).  The position of people in those large industrial centers has 
become so desperate that they, naturally, voted for the change in government.
True, in the last federal elections the opposition won more mandates than SPS
in Belgrade, Novi Sad, Nis and other large cities, but in the local elections
the victory was much more convincing.<P>

Both federal and local elections demonstrated that the nationalism is still 
strong in Serbia, as indicated the unexpected success of Radicals and the expected
debacle of the so called JUL in the local elections.  That proved that JUL is
a marginal party whose members join the party because of personal need or self
interest and which has entered the federal parliament only because of the marital
coalition with SPS [Ms Mira Markovic, the founder of JUL, is married to Slobodan Milosevic, the president
of SPS].  The same goes for New Democracy.<P>

Facing an unexpected and convincing defeat in the second round of the local elections
in largest cities, the ruling party has obviously engaged in obstruction of the
second election round through fabrication and submission of a large number of
complaints because of alleged irregularities in the running of the elections.
Based on the available information, it is obvious that the goal of this obstruction
was to unlawfully forge the election results.  The fact that on this occasion
there were more objections than at all earlier elections taken together, and that
the objections come from the party which ran the elections process, SPS, is
enough to make one wonder.  This paradox becomes even more jarring taking into
account that the state-controlled television, during the whole day on November
17 when the second round of municipal elections took place, broadcasted numerous "live"
statements from election committee members in which they stated that the voting was
progressing in the best possible conditions and that there were no irregularities in
the election process.  The election records taken by the election committees,
(who effectively run the voting process, distribute ballots to the voters, count
votes and enter results in election records) were almost everywhere completed on time
and signed by the members from all political parties without objections.  These records are
the strongest evidence for foul play by the Socialists.<P>

The key question is: how come that suddenly, during the sessions of district
electoral commissions, there was an avalanche of objections because of alleged irregularities
most commonly because of the surplus of ballots in ballot boxes.  The objections were, 
as the press informs us, lodged by the Socialists only after it became clear
that SPS had lost the elections.  The surplus of ballots was not recorded
by original election commissions which actually counted the ballots, but after
the delivery of ballot boxes and election commission reports to the district
electoral commission.  After the delivery, election commissions and their 
members who represent the opposition have no more control over the election material.
Therefore, the surplus ballots could have only been added by the Socialist representatives
, since they controlled the printing of ballots and had the opportunity to stuff
the ballot boxes once they were delivered by the election committees.<P>

<h2>Danger in the Post election Period</h2>

The [independent] press wrote that in Nis, electoral commission, after establishing
existence of irregularities (surplus ballots etc.), instead of annulling the elections
and dismissing the responsible electoral committees, took upon itself to correct
the results and declare new winners, which is outside its jurisdiction; no one,
not even a court has the right to modify the election results; legally, the electoral
commission can only verify or annul the results of elections in certain precincts.
The electoral commission declared new results, based on modified (forged)
election records, and chose to ignore the copies of the same records held by
the opposition representatives, which prove the opposition victory.<P>

In connection with the elections, one should keep in mind that the election record
becomes valid once all the electoral committee members sign identical copies of
the original record.  Unlike electoral committees which have to reach decisions
through consensus, district electoral commissions reach decisions through majority vote;
a majority of district electoral commissions members are chosen by the regime, while
the minority is nominated by larger political parties.  The legality of the
process depends on the conscience of the judges and their ability or willingness
to resist the pressure of the regime.<P>

Today the radio said that the courts have annulled the results in some precincts in Belgrade
which had been verified by the city electoral commission, allegedly because the
agenda showed that the commission hadn't considered all objections.  At the same time
we could hear that the opposition representatives in the city electoral commission
have original agenda notes which differ from those held by the court and which
show that the commission had considered all objections.  If that is true, it can
only mean that the courts were given forged notes from the session of the city
electoral commission or that that commission didn't know anything about its legal
obligations.  One should expect that the appeals to the Supreme Court of Serbia
will stop the wave of electoral fraud.<P>

Based on the dramatic events in connection with the alleged irregularities during
the municipal elections, one could conclude that SPS, using even illegal means,
is trying to at any cost annul elections in as many localities as possible
and to try to reverse the results in the third round, again using all available
means, starting with the total control over the media and ending with various
pre-election and post-election tricks.  In the meantime, the Serbian parliament will
probably vote on and enact laws which will reduce the jurisdiction of local authorities
(funding, media, revenue etc.).<P>

Objectively, the results of municipal elections will be in greatest danger
after the elections.  The third round of elections, will probably produce the
same results as the second round.  Everything else is a robbery.  The third
election round demands additional training and readiness of the election
committee members who represent opposition as well as the presence of international
observers.<P>

<h2>Civic Resistance</h2>

Actually, only after the definite end of the municipal elections, one can expect
the real attack on the opposition controlled local authorities, coming from
the republican authorities and their publicly owned companies and banks on whose
co-operation depends functioning of many crucial services in towns and cities 
all over Serbia.  If that happens, the regime will after several months of
"unsuccessful opposition rule", using the total control over the media, and
previously again taking over <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/studioB.html">Studio B</a>, try to politically compromise new
local authorities and through aggressive propaganda prepare the population for
the dismissal of the newly elected opposition municipal authorities and
introduction of direct rule by the Serbian government, actually SPS.  That
would constitute an unconstitutional annulment of the will of citizens for an indefinite
period of time.<P>

All that would be highly risky for the regime and would certainly cause
civic disturbances in Serbia which would easily slip out of control and turn
into bloody clashes between the citizens and police (and maybe military),
into a civil war.  In that case, the full responsibility for that chain
of events would fall on the ruling regime and its head [Slobodan Milosevic].
The citizens have the right to respond to blatant unlawfulness and suppression
of basic constitutional freedoms and rights with incessant peaceful protests,
including peaceful blockade of vital institutions, and also demand foreign arbitration.
Let us hope that this will be avoided and that the ruling regime will find
enough common sense and realise that the further worsening of the situation
would be disastrous for everyone and especially for him, since he [Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia] would be forced
from power.<P>

I believe that the decisions by courts, whatever they may be, and the third 
round of voting will open a way out of this crisis and herald a new phase
in the democratic development of Serbia and its integration with Europe and the
rest of the developed world.  I am encouraged in this belief by the fact that
the largest cities and towns in Serbia have voted for this option, and they
are the brain and backbone of the country.  The destiny of Serbia has always been determined by
the political events and political climate in its largest intellectual, industrial,
scientific and cultural centers.  Such development of history can not be
stopped by the police and the Serbian Television; they can only slow it down.<P>

<h1>One Measure, Two Measurement Units</h1>
                
<strong><em>by S. Grkinic</em></strong><P>

<h2>Nasa Borba, Beograd, FR Yugoslavia, 11/25 1996</h2>

<strong>Jagodina</strong> - Indications that the electoral commission and the
district court will decide according to the calculations of the local SPS 
turned out to be correct.  These two bodies made the clear victory of the
opposition coalition "Zajedno" ["Together"] uncertain by annulling 12 victories
of the coalition candidates and one of the Serbian Radical Party, which has
in Jagodina openly sided with "Zajedno".  All 13 mandates were annulled because
of the surplus of ballots [more ballots than votes cast], which amounted 
to one to two ballots; victory margins
in all cases were between 50 and 250 votes.<P>

The same measure was not applied in precinct Tabane 4, where the socialist
candidate won by seven votes, and the official results showed that there
was a surplus of 101 ballots in the ballot box.  In the village of Majur, the SPS candidate
won by one vote while there were two ballots too many in the ballot box; that
victory was verified [by the district electoral commission].  Hunger strike
of four "Zajedno" members and two Jagodina citizens hasn't been successful.
Socialist "representatives" remained consistent in their intentions to keep
Jagodina "red" at any cost.  Because of that, the hunger strike was called
off and the local "Zajedno" headquarters have been in session preparing
to confirm the victory in 12 precincts which will be open for a third time
on December 1.<P>

Massive demonstrations in Jagodina which were attended by the citizens from
other towns (Cuprija, Paracin, Svilajnac, Despotovac and Rekovac) began on
Saturday [November 23, 1996] in front of the city hall and were continued
by a walk through the town.<P>

Coalition "Zajedno" needs a 50% success rate in the third round in order to
win the city hall.  Nevertheless, they expect 12 victories.  Citizens of
Jagodina were informed about vote rigging through messengers and fliers which
are printed almost every day, since the media are out of reach [for opposition].
The aforementioned dishonourable actions resulted in the split between the Socialists
and their coalition partner, United Yugoslav Left (JUL): two elected JUL representatives
expressed desire to join "Zajedno", which should be made official before
the first session of the new town assembly.<P>

<h1>All Independent media on the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia Publish AIM Articles: interview with Dragica Mugos, AIM coordinator in Paris </h1>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<h2><em>by Stojan Obradovic (STINA)</em>, Bumerang, Osijek, Croatia, 9/7/95</h2>

E-mail: BUMERANG_OS@ZAMIR-ZG.ztn.zer.de<P>

in October, 1992, a group of independent journalists from all states of the former Yugoslavia met in the Ukrainian city of Uzgorod, at a media conference  organized by the European federation of local radio stations (FERL) and decided to start an independent news service which would cover the territory of the former Yugoslavia and confront the information blockades and wartime abuse of the media.  About half way through 1993, this service began to function under the name of <strong>Alternative Information Network [Alternativna Informaciona Mreza]</strong> (AIM); today, AIM has collaborators in all regions of the former Yugoslavia and is used by almost all independent media in this region; AIM also has its own English service which can be used by the media and institutions outside the former Yugoslavia.  The main coordination and distribution AIM center is located in Paris and <strong>Dragica Mugos</strong> is one of the coordinators.<P>

<strong>What is AIM and how does it function?</strong><P>

AIM is above all a human project and a human response to the situation in which all peoples of the former Yugoslavia found themselves.  AIM was conceived as a <em>mail-box</em> system linking computers in editorial rooms in all states of the former Yugoslavia with the central computer in Paris; through this computer we conduct information exchange.  So far, AIM has seven sections (in the capitals and one in Kosovo) which regularly send articles about their surroundings to the network; in that they guarantee the objectivity and high professional standard of reporting.<P> 

<strong>What was your motive in starting a project of this kind?</strong><P>

It was a response to the information blockade which existed between the countries of the former Yugoslavia at the moment when AIM was founded (October 1992).  The situation was extremely difficult.  A large number of journalists had been fired  defending the integrity of their profession, refusing to join the nationalist propaganda and spread the hate and manipulations through the use of half truths which used (used?) to be a characteristic of the official media.  A small number of independent media which succeeded in resisting the pressure coming from the ruling regimes and remained on the market, didn't have objective and high quality information about the events in other countries of the former Yugoslavia, which might have helped to break the circle of hate.  Immediate goals of AIM were to break the information blockade, and provide an opportunity for the fired independent journalists to stay in the profession and to obtain the high quality information about the events in other states of the former Yugoslavia.<P>

<strong>This type of media project, at least in Croatia, has been constantly accused of being in service of the old state and its renewal;  it is claimed  that your goal is to overthrow "new democratic authorities", that you are in the service of different foreign factors...  Who, in your opinion, actually feels threatened by you?</strong><P>

The attacks don't only come from Croatia.  If there is one thing in which the nationalist elites in the states of the former Yugoslavia are united, this is it.  But that only reveals the true nature of those regimes.  Let us start with the terminology which is used by our critics: "enemies of the state", "foreign mercenaries" etc.  These attempts to discredit political opponents bring us back to the former Yugoslav regime [communists], from which all these regimes try to distance themselves, with all their might.  This indicates the basis of these "new democratic authorities".  Let us not get deeper into this; independent media, by offering information about other communities, break a uniform picture about the enemy and sabotage the efforts of the regime to form a monolithic, unanimous public opinion.  There are two parallel images, on one hand all the horrors of the war: crimes against the population, refugees, destruction and on the other hand impoverishment of the population, destruction of the value system and the regime which holds on to the power by manipulating the first image.  A transnational project like AIM raises the fundamental question: whether the existing regimes could stay in power if is wasn't for the war and everything it brings along?  From there we come to a conclusion that it is possible to have good neighborly relations and that the road to the understanding of "the other" is not that long.  The answer is in the construction of the democratic systems for which all nationalist elites have declared themselves and whose development they try to stop with all their might.<P>

<strong>Do AIM editors and collaborators have problems with authorities in their environs?</strong><P>

Yes, although not the same kind of problems; it depends on the priorities of the authorities at a given moment: AIM was attacked in Croatia by the head of the state himself and, after that, the state-controlled media published the lists with names of AIM journalists; in Bosnia our editor has been sued; in Serbia, AIM journalists didn't receive their accreditations; in Macedonia, the nationalist press attacked our editor etc.  The whole problem is that the independent media, no matter how much they are being obstructed in their work, at the end of the line, can be used to give democratic legitimacy to a given regime in front of the international community.  The common characteristics of those regimes sharply come into focus in the case of institutional  organizing of the journalists from the whole area of the former Yugoslavia.  False claims that a group of journalists (at the moment there are 70 journalists working for AIM) wants to rebuild Yugoslavia aim to hide that fact.  AIM doesn't want nor is its goal renewal of Yugoslavia.  We do support development and spreading of democratic processes in all states of the former Yugoslavia through better understanding of the conditions in those countries, in similar movements and initiatives.<P>

<strong>Many consider the former Yugoslav media to be the main culprits or at least accomplices in this war; alternatively, the media are accused that they have significantly influenced the bestial character of the war.  In your opinion, what was the role of the media in the war?</strong><P>

Today in the world, media undeniably have a crucial role in shaping of the public opinion.  In our region they have proven their absolute power.  Official media used half truths, misinformation, lies and shameless propaganda of nationalistic exclusivity to penetrate homes of the great majority of population and to turn the tangible sense of dissatisfaction with the old state into "the impossibility of living together".  From there, it was maybe still possible to think about the peaceful divorce if there wasn't so much hatred and exclusiveness, which were spread by the official media.  I would like to question the responsibility of journalists.   The attitude of the local authorities toward journalists clearly shows their responsibility and their significant role.  They are still the strongest support of the authorities and, because of that, the space given to the independent media is very narrow.  On the other hand, this shows that the journalistic profession is yet to develop its status.  Between a "journalist as a social-political worker" [i.e. the propagandist of the ruling regime]  and the todays "journalist-patriot" we need to find space for the real, professional journalism which won't require personal courage of an individual.<P>

<strong>How do you assess the current media situation on the territory of the former Yugoslavia?  What is the role and influence of the independent media? Are they capable of confronting and competing with the official state media monopolies?  How successful is AIM in that?</strong><P>

At the moment, the media situation is quite complicated.  There are official and private media, which is often confusing.  In the West, privately owned media are usually considered to be independent.  When we say independent media we include only those who in their editorial policy do not depend on a ruling party, or on other parties, and which follow the journalistic code of conduct.  Media of that kind occupy only ten percent of the total media space in the former Yugoslavia, which in itself determines their power and real influence on the public opinion.  Likewise, in comparison with the official media there is a negligible number of the independent electronic media and, consequently, far less opportunity to use picture and live word to directly influence the public.  AIM shares the destiny of the other independent media, above all that of the independent press, since the independent press is its main customer.  As our goal is to develop communication and understanding among the peoples between which all links have been severed, we view even the smallest breakthrough in that field as a success.  Our work is gradual and we have long term goals.  We would like to contribute to the development of the foundations for the future democratic societies and we can do that only with an objective and timely information.  Because of that, we consider a success when, for example, <em>Koha</em>, an independent weekly published in Albanian in Pristina, publishes an article written by our journalist from Belgrade, or if the same article appears in Albanian and Macedonian in Macedonia.  We also feel honored when a newly started magazine <em>Izbor</em> in Tuzla states that "AIM is a reliable, well tested source of information  ... which has distributed thousands of articles in which is denounces stupidity and mortal danger coming from exclusion of the other, totalitarianism and fascism."<P>

<strong>Where do you see the future of the independent media projects and, specifically AIM?  Can these projects develop through self financing, without outside help</strong><P>

The future of independent media depends on the development of situation in each one of the successor states of the former Yugoslavia.  Where democratic development wins in the end, the independent media will to a large extent become an engine for those developments and gain much more media space than today.  However, if the current situation goes on, the future of independent media, including AIM, is more than uncertain in the situation where the ruling regimes absolutely control the market on which the independent media are supposed to survive; therefore, it is hard to talk about their self financing in those circumstances.  Let me list a few examples: starting with the newsprint price which is, for example in Serbia, three times higher for the independent media than the price for the official media, difficulties in obtaining printing services (Croatia), to the complete inaccessibility of the distribution network [most newspapers are sold on kiosks, which are property of the state-controlled media] controlled by the official media, let alone the problems facing electronic independent media for which it is impossible to obtain free bandwidth [which is distributed by the state].  Anyway, it is a common practise everywhere in the world to subsidize large media houses; in our case this is only true for the official media, which can also obtain additional income from advertising.  Because of that it is necessary to still count on financial help coming from the institutions and foundations which are willing to to help, taking into account extremely important role and difficult position of the independent media.<P>

<strong>Can you reveal who is AIM's financial backer, what are your expenses and how do you assess the relation between the invested resources and the achieved results?</strong><P>

Variety of the AIM's financial backers testifies that a lot of organizations are ready to support an undertaking of this kind; also we cannot rely on a small number of financial supporters, because that wouldn't be sufficient.  Our more important backers are the European Union, European Council, UNESCO and also numerous humanitarian and non-governmental organizations.  As far as the AIM's budget is concerned, we work with what we get and are unable to plan more than two to three months in advance.  Because of all that we should consider the relationship between the invested resources and achieved results in a different light.  In my opinion, the most important investment is related to the human commitment, extending the friendly hand to "the other" who is in the same situation and shares identical democratic values.  In these, sort of gloomy, times, this kind of project has awakened the hope that it is possible to build bridges of understanding.  The greatest recognition we have received, and this is at the same time a measure of our success, is that all independent media on the territory of Yugoslavia regularly publish AIM's articles.<P>

<strong>There are different opinions about the aid and investment of various international foundations and institutions into development and support of independent media.  Was this assistance structured and organized appropriately, was it sufficient, were there any mistakes?</strong><P>

I think that at the beginning, the attitude of international foundations and institutions only reflected unpreparedness of the international community for the break out of war in the former Yugoslavia.  Only the first report by <strong>Mazowiecki</strong> about the role of the official media in the preparation and the break out of the war brought about the realization and the decision to help the independent media.  From there, a gradual, unorganized flow of assistance began; there, we could talk about mistakes since a lot of things depended on a lobby abroad, but that cannot decrease the importance of the offered assistance and the readiness of the ordinary citizens, outside institutions, to contribute to that.  I would criticize one thing, regarding "large" benefactors, since the 'small" ones usually give aid unconditionally:  the fact that they expect an independent media outlet to quickly prove itself on the market.  That is, to say the least, unrealistic, since the assistance was given in order to develop democratic processes (therefore they start from the realization that there is no democracy), and than they behave as if everything in a certain country functions in a most normal fashion.  Besides everything I have already listed as problems for independent media breakthrough to the market, it is enough to remind that they cannot advertise themselves through the official media outlets and usually remain unknown as far as the wider audience is concerned.  Because of all that, I think that the assistance, not only must continue, but also must be increased, because it is an investment in peace in Europe and it turned out that a war is much more expensive.<P>

<strong>From time to time, we hear rumors that AIM will fold because of the lack of funds.  Is this possible, and how do you see the future of AIM and its perspectives?</strong><P>

From the very beginning we work without knowing how long we will be able to survive.  And this lasts since October 1992.  In that sense we share the destiny of  the majority of independent media in the former Yugoslavia.  We are fighting with all our strength to survive, because we are deeply convinced that the project which proved its value by breaking the information blockade has a lot of sense in the domain of conflict prevention; we accomplish that by offering information which contributes to the mutual understanding and peaceful coexistence of peoples between which the nationalistic regimes have erected barriers of hate.<P>

<h1>RADIO 101</h1>

<em> The Wall Street Journal  -- July 25, 1996</em><P>

<h2> Croatian President Seeks to Shut Radio Station
Where He Started</h2>

<strong><em> By Mark M. Nelson - Staff Reporter of The WSJ</em></strong><P>

 Croatian President Franjo Tudjman, who was
 imprisoned by the Communists for his nationalist
 leanings, got his political start seven years ago
 on Radio 101, the only Zagreb station that had the
 guts to air his views. Now that he's running the
 country, Mr. Tudjman and his cronies want to close
 it down.<P>

 Owned and run by a group of young, free-thinking
 journalists, Radio 101 has resolutely turned down
 an offer from members of the ruling party to buy a
 controlling interest. Now the government has
 threatened to auction off its FM frequency. And
 Radio 101 -- the station that beamed the sexual
 revolution and rock 'n' roll behind the Iron
 Curtain -- fears that soon it will be reading out
 its own obituary. For now, the station has
 temporary broadcasting permission until October,
 when a final decision about its fate is expected.<P>

 The 12-year-old, 800-watt station can barely reach
 the outskirts of this city of one million people.
 But these young journalists have megawatts of
 influence. Their lively tongue-in-cheek newscasts
 set the political agenda in a timeworn Hapsburgian
 city that just five years ago was still an outpost
 of the old Yugoslavia. And by trying to tell the
 truth about what's going on in Croatia's
 often-corrupt political culture, they are
 responsible for some of the most important
 stirrings of real democracy anywhere in the
 Balkans.<P>

 "They want to turn us off," says Zrinka
 Vrabec-Mojzes, editor in chief of the station. "We
 try to be objective and allow listeners to express
 their opinions, and the ruling party doesn't like
 that."<P>

 No wonder. It was on Radio 101 that Zagreb voters
 heard a real debate about how their city was being
 run, leading to the victory of a coalition of
 opposition parties in last October's local and
 parliamentary elections. The result so infuriated
 Mr. Tudjman that he refused to recognize the
 election results and appointed his own mayor of
 Zagreb.<P>

 That led to widespread international condemnation:
 The Council of Europe, the 39-country organization
 that monitors human rights and democracy,
 immediately suspended Croatia's membership
 application. And the U.S., which has developed a
 close relationship with Mr. Tudjman because of his
 influence in neighboring Bosnia, has also begun
 pressuring him to clean up his act.<P>

<h2> Post-Communist Repression</h2>

 The president "blamed Radio 101 for his party's
 defeat in Zagreb," says Anita Malenica, a leading
 political journalist here. "And in a way, he was
 probably right. It was there that people heard the
 truth."<P>

 Now that the war in Bosnia has quieted down, the
 battle over Radio 101 and other free media is
 shaping up as the highest-profile test of the
 democratic revolution that was supposed to be
 sweeping the Balkans. Journalists, newspapers and
 television stations in the region are facing
 charges of everything from libel and spying to tax
 evasion. And rather than being privatized, most of
 the main newspaper and television stations continue
 to be owned by the state -- or by members of the
 ruling party. In Croatia, for example, members of
 Mr. Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic Union
 serve on the boards or own outright most of the
 major nationwide media.<P>

 "There's a real state of siege in the media in this
 part of the world," says Biljana Tatomir, a media
 specialist at Zagreb's Open Society Institute, the
 democracy advocacy group operating throughout
 Central and Eastern Europe and financed by American
 billionaire George Soros. "And it is really holding
 back the region's economic and political
 development."<P>

 For Radio 101, adversity is nothing new. Croatia's
 first commercial station, it started in 1984 when
 Yugoslavia was a one-party Communist state. Topics
 like Croatian independence, private ownership,
 democracy and religious freedom made the station
 both popular and controversial. "We've always been
 somewhere between jail and freedom," says news
 anchorwoman Tamara Novak, who started as a
 volunteer at the age of 17. "Now it's no
 different."<P>

 For the time being at least, Radio 101 is
 continuing to put out its wild and crazy version of
 the news. Mixing the latest music, on-the-scene
 interviews and innovative advertising, its shows
 are by far the quirkiest and most entertaining
 broadcasts in the region. The station's 32% share
 of the Zagreb audience, according to several
 independent telephone surveys, is nearly twice that
 of any other station in town.<P>

 <h2>Rude News</h2>

 Staffed by eager but poorly paid journalists, Radio
 101 goes where no state-owned broadcaster dares. On
 days when there is news about the Irish Republican
 Army, for example, the announcer introduces the
 topic with the song "Sunday Bloody Sunday" by the
 Irish band U-2. Once a year, when it does the news
 about President Tudjman's birthday, it pulls out
 Marilyn Monroe purring "Happy Birthday, Mr.
 President" recorded in 1962 at John F. Kennedy's
 45th birthday party at Madison Square Garden in New
 York.<P>

 "It's a kind of urban humor," says Ms. Novak, who
 like all the newscasters here calls the president
 by his first name. "But it makes people pay
 attention."<P>

 To be sure, part of Radio 101's high ratings must
 be credited to the 74-year-old Mr. Tudjman himself
 and to his increasingly exotic regime. He makes for
 colorful copy. A former Yugoslav general and open
 imitator of the late Yugoslav dictator Marshal
 Tito, Mr. Tudjman runs this nation of 4.7 million
 people as if it were his private domain, appearing
 in public in flashy white uniforms and personally
 determining most of Croatia's business. At his
 office -- a former Tito mansion on a leafy hill
 outside Zagreb -- crimson-clad guards looking like
 transplants from the Magic Kingdom stand ready to
 open his limousine doors or whisk visitors into an
 audience with the man admirers call "the father of
 the nation."<P>

 <h2>Affronting the President</h2>

 But somehow, little Radio 101 is getting under his
 skin. Some politicians here say the reason is the
 enterprising political coverage -- often featuring
 members of the opposition or citizens talking about
 their problems on phone-in shows. During the
 October election campaign, Radio 101 had aired
 programs about corruption of government officials
 and the president's unilateral and highly unpopular
 decision to change the name of the city's soccer
 team to Football Club Croatia, from Dinamo.<P>

 "It's the radio that roared," says Bozo Kovacevic,
 an opposition member of the Parliament's committee
 on foreign affairs. "This weak little station seems
 to make the president very nervous."<P>

 If the Tudjman regime closes the station, the scene
 could get ugly. Already, Radio 101 listeners are on
 edge. Earlier this year, during a power outage, the
 station's signal went dead and some listeners
 thought the government had finally moved in and cut
 it off. The phones started ringing with devotees
 offering to organize public protests. "They were
 ready to go out on the streets. It was incredible,"
 says Ms. Vrabec-Mojzes, the editor in chief. "Our
 listeners are very dedicated."<P>

 Radio 101 isn't alone in its tribulations. A new
 media law designed to make it much tougher to
 criticize the government -- specifically protecting
 the president and four other high government
 officials -- has already generated its first court
 cases. The weekly satirical newspaper Feral Tribune
 faces ruin if it loses a court challenge in which
 it is charged under the new law with criminal
 defamation of the president.<P>

<h2> Sudden Wealth</h2>

 Many of the Feral Tribune's favorite taunts also
 are aimed at the president and his lavish
 lifestyle. A recent edition, for example, shows Mr.
 Tudjman's grinning face inserted onto the head of
 an Egyptian Pharaoh accompanied by an article about
 the discovery of the ancient tomb of
 "Tudjmankhamen."<P>

 Privately-owned media like Feral Tribune and Radio
 101 have reported the growing wealth of Mr.
 Tudjman's family. A story about how Mr. Tudjman's
 23-year-old grandson, for example, suddenly became
 an allegedly wealthy and successful banker here has
 deeply damaged the president's prestige and public
 support for "privatization" of state-owned
 property. The newspaper is also being sued by Mr.
 Tudjman's daughter over articles it published about
 her alleged acquisition of a Ministry of Defense
 building, where she now runs a boutique.<P>

 Mr. Tudjman has been assiduously avoiding real
 privatization of newspapers and TV stations. "The
 president and his party have tolerated a bit of
 free press here in Zagreb because not many people
 can get it or afford it. But he wants complete
 control over television," says opposition leader
 Vlado Gotovac. "That way, they have complete
 control over public opinion. It's an incredible
 obstacle to the development of democracy."<P>

<h2> Official Denial</h2>

 For his part, President Tudjman has repeatedly
 denied that he is cracking down on the media. He
 says the court cases are against journalists who
 are nostalgic for the old "Yugoslav Communist
 regime." And a Croatian official refused to
 speculate about what would happen in the review of
 Radio 101's broadcasting license, but he added that
 such a procedure is "a normal part of the state's
 responsibilities."<P>

 Back at Radio 101, where it is coming up on 4
 o'clock, Ms. Novak puts on her headset, readies a
 stack of papers and takes a cue from her producer.
 Manipulating vintage tape-players and old sound
 mixers, the program leads off with a lively
 commercial for Zagreb's new drive-through
 McDonald's. Then it's a K.D. Lang hit, "Constant
 Craving." And as the minute hand is straight up on
 12, the bustling studio -- and much of Zagreb
 itself -- goes dead silent as Ms. Novak's deep and
 throaty Lauren Bacall voice opens the news: "Good
 afternoon, Zagreb, this is Radio 101."<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">

 International mediators regarded the signature of Slobodan Milosevic as the
 key to the success of the Dayton Agreement, which has brought a fragile
 peace to Bosnia. But has he taken his commitment to establish democracy and
 justice in the rump Yugoslavia seriously?<P>

 A growing list of violations aimed at the independent media and the
opposition suggests not. First, the Belgrade municipal council assumed control of the
only independent television station, Studio B, in the Yugoslav capital. Then the
Serbian government closed down the Soros Fund Yugoslavia, funded by the billionaire
 American philanthropist George Soros. Live broadcasts from the Serbian
assembly have been cancelled while parliamentary life has degenerated into a crude
 instrument of control wielded by Milosevic's party, the SPS. The authorities
have stepped up domestic repression throughout the republic.<P>

 Milosevic is in a fundamentally weak position. In addition to the established
 opposition, the hundreds of thousands of refugees from formerly Serb-held
 territory in Croatia and  Bosnia regard him as a traitor who sold them out
after having encouraged them to resist rule from Zagreb and  Sarajevo. Serbia's
large minorities, especially the Albanian community in the southern Serbian
province of Kosovo, also reject Milosevic and his programme.<P>

  As a consequence, he now seeks support from the international community. The
 deal he offers is  continuing peace in Bosnia-Hercegovina in exchange for
 complete control over the internal life of  Serbia and Montenegro. To achieve
this, Milosevic has to destroy the relationship between the independent media and
the opposition, on the one hand, and the democratic institutions of the
international community on the other.<P>


 The elevation of Milosevic in the West to the position of chief guarantor of
the Dayton Accords has been greeted with the deepest despair inside Serbia. There
is a strong suspicion that the international community is prepared to turn a blind
eye to violations of democratic procedures because he has proven to be so
 accommodating on the Bosnian issue. But even that issue is being compromised.
 In the Republic of Srpska, the Serb entity in Bosnia, international
organizations have shown no inclination to support civic movements or the independent
media. This will ensure that nationalists will win the elections, if they even take
place, and the results of ethnic cleansing will be accepted.<P>


 Nobody can wish away Slobodan Milosevic and he is, of course, the most
 important political partner in the region. But he is not the only person upon
whom peace and stability in the Balkans depends. If too much emphasis his placed
on his role, and that of Franjo Tudjman in Croatia and the growing nationalist
position of President Izetbegovic's party in Bosnia, then the three leaderships will be
 encouraged to feed off one another's political strategy. A suffocation of
democracy in Serbia aids anti-democratic forces in Croatia and Bosnia. The bonds
connecting Milosevic and Tudjman are secret and perhaps even subconscious but no less
real for that.<P>

  Autocracy seems to come naturally to Slobodan Milosevic. But today, in
contrast to previous years, he is able to garnish it with a rational explanation: I
have to be given a free hand to deal with all those crazy Serbs or they will be intent
on continuing the war.<P>

 But in order to sustain his autocracy, Milosevic and his government
constantly needs to manufacture new enemies. These used to be Croats, Muslims, or
 Albanians. But now they are the fundamental core of civil society - the Soros
 foundation, peace groups and the liberal intelligentsia - groups who can
hardly be accused of wanting to foment war in Bosnia.The police, the media and the
 economy remain firmly in the grip of one man.<P>

  Paradoxically, the continuing exclusion of Yugoslavia from international
 organisations like the OSCE promotes such a development. It would be much
more difficult for the Serbian government to shut down Studio B or the Soros
foundation if the country were more closely in tegrated diplomatically with Europe. The
worst of all possible solutions is the combination of diplomatic exclusion whilst
relying on the good offices of the regime to keep the peace. The absence of
international standards in Yugoslavia aggravates the arbitrary rule of state power.<P>

  There is no vision for the future of the Balkans. This cannot but jeapordise
the overall long-term stability and democracy in Europe. A policy which confers
total political power in Serbia to Slobodan Milosevic is bound to backfire on the
 international community and lead to a further deterioration of a calamitous
 political and economic situation in the region.<P>

<h1> Serbia's Democrats Need Support</h1>
 
<strong><em>By Veran Matic</em></strong><P>

<h3>Thursday, April 11, 1996</h3>
 
 	BELGRADE - What does it feel like to be the editor of an
 independent radio station in Belgrade today? It's like being under siege.
 The same answer will be given today by many young urban intellectuals in
 Serbia when asked what their lives are like. We remain where we are, with
 only our determination and readiness to struggle for the principles we
 believe in. <P>
 	From the very outset, Radio B92 was not only a place from which 
 we broadcast an authentic news program, but also the hub of an entire 
 antiwar, pro-democracy movement. Our activities are intended only to 
 enlighten - not to brainwash or proselytize, but to help individuals 
 resist all forms of dogmatism.<P>
 	Our radio station has been broadcasting on a provisional frequency
 for more than five years now. It can be interrupted at any moment, and
 because of our unregulated frequency status we are unable to extend the
 geographic range or our broadcasts (beyond Belgrade). Indeed, outside
 Belgrade, inhabitants of Serbia have almost no access to non-government
 media and therefore little unbiased information about domestic and
 international events. The only way we could reach the outlying regions was
 to link up with local, independent radio stations in Serbia and
 Montenegro, which retransmit parts of our program.<P>
 	This line of work is not only a daily struggle to get out the 
 truth, but a battle with red tape and countless technical problems. Every 
 day is a race for electricians and spare parts. Every day we receive ever 
 bigger bills from the communal services department. It's a constant 
 struggle to avoid being ripped off. Every day I call the local officials, 
 begging, so that we can be hooked up to a few more telephone lines (we 
 have also become providers of an Internet service).<P>
 	In addition to the radio program, we organize programs in our own
 independent cultural center, "Cinema Rex". We are also publishers of books
 and magazines like David Owen's "Balkan Odyssey" and Laura Silber and Alan
 Little's "Death of Yugoslavia". We have our own music and television
 production unit, we organize exhibitions, and we communicate with all
 parts of the former Yugoslavia. We managed to organize mass actions
 against the war and humanitarian aid for the refugees.<P>
 	While providing these services, we must at the same time resist
 the growing repression in Yugoslavia. The state has recently taken over
 the independent television station NTV Studio B, and has closed down the
 Soros Yugoslavia Foundation and all of its humanitarian relief, as well as
 its cultural, scientific and media projects. These were important elements
 in a growing, but still disparate, opposition movement. Citizens need to
 be encouraged to resist.<P>
 	The Belgrade regime and its own media arms launches daily attacks,
 most of them hysterical in tone, against the democratic wing of the
 opposition. Responding to these attacks by disseminating more information,
 more real news and analysis, helps. But the main, everyday challenge is to
 remain normal. In a country that has turned toward a Chinese model of
 economics and politics, in which during the congress of the leading party
 ovations were reserved for the representative of Cuba, in which politics
 is criminalized and criminality politicized, it is only with great
 difficulty and effort that one retains peace of mind.<P>
 	I am aware that the authoritarian regime has no wish to understand
 us, much less accommodate our work, but it comes as something of a
 surprise that the developed, democratic world has not fully grasped that
 without democratization in the territories of the former Yugoslavia, there
 will be no peace in the Balkans. Perhaps some of the reticence from the
 West stems from the belief that Serbia's opposition doesn't offer a viable
 alternative to the powerful President Slobodan Milosevic. Yet for the
 first time, the democratic opposition here has turned for its model to
 European and American ideals rather than flirting with nationalist
 sentiments. Their rallies have more EU flags present now than symbols of
 Serbin nationalism. Europe and the U.S. must not fail to make use of this
 readiness to oppose totalitarianism in Serbia.<P>
 	President Slobodan Milosevic must be compelled to comply with
 European and international standards in the field of human and minority
 rights, and freedom of the press. The mild reaction of international
 public opinion and politicians concerning the repression of democratic and
 independent institutions in Serbia only encourages the Belgrade regime in
 their conviction that the West will continue to tolerate repression in
 Belgrade so long as Mr. Milosevic pretends to play along with the peace
 game. It's time the West see that a democratic alternative, against all
 odds, is taking root. It needs help to grow.<P>

Dear Friends of the Zamir Transnational Net,<P>


We are in great need of support. Funding for our international
data transfers, which we had expected did not yet come through.<P>

At the moment we do not have any more money for our international
data transfers. For the whole network we need about 10 to 12
thousand  (10,000 - 12,000) Deutsch Marks  (approximately 7 to
8,000 US$) for each month. Of this sum, about 2,000-3,000 DEM
(US$ 1-2,000) is covered.<P>

About 6,000-8,000 DM  (US$ 4,000-6,000) is needed. Very quickly,
we need some additional funding to be able to continue with our
network.<P>

<strong>Can you help us?</strong><P>

        Donations can be sent to the account below.<P>

As you know, since 1992 we have been providing free Internet
email and electronic conferencing for NGO's, human rights,
anti-war, women's, environmental, humanitarian aid groups and also
for individuals in the post-Yugoslavian countries. We have about
2,500 users. Many of whom also send and receive mail for others
who do not have access to computers. Our communication network
here has enabled many people to regularly connect up with
friends, relatives, co-workers, partners all over the world.<P>

Only recently (1995) did we begin to take user fees from users in
te systems in Zagreb and Belgrade. The other systems still offer
free access. Especially in Bosnia, where the economy was destroyed
by the war, the users do not have enough funds to cover the real
costs and depend upon the subsidized systems for communication.<P>

Although we are working to get cheaper international connections,
we will still be dependent upon expensive dial-up connections for
a while.<P>

Thank you for your support,<br>
Eric<P>

Dear ZAMIR-BG users,<P>

I have received many complaints from people all over the world
that ZAMIR-BG was down. Since I could not get accurate information
via email, I came for a quick visit to Belgrade to find out what
was happening. This is what I discovered.<P>


      <h2>  CAA and ZAMIR-BG</h2>

The CAA is not able to continue to keep the system ZAMIR-BG
running. I was told that there were two reasons for this.<P>

1. The local costs are not being covered by the fees that users
are paying.<P>

        The local costs for the past year (to pay system
        operators, telephone costs within Yugoslavia, computer
        repairs and improvements) were 12,968 Dinar , and the
        income from users was 3,040 Dinar.  That leaves an amount
        of 9,928 Dinar that was covered by general CAA this past
        year. Additionally the CAA did covered the costs of rent,
        local telephone, electricity, fotocopies and other office
        materials for the ZAMIR-BG.<P>

        You should also know that the international data transfer
        costs which vary from about 2000 to 4000 DEM a month are
        not included included in the above because they were
        being covered by donations from other sources.<P>

        I talked with a number of users and some did not know
        that the users of ZAMIR-BG were required to pay a fee.
        Others did know that it should cost something, but never
        received an invoice and therefore did not pay. Some had
        paid something once or twice but did not know if they
        should pay more. It seems to me that the users need to be
        more clearly informed about the costs of using the
        system.<P>


2. The CAA does not have enough money to continue to pay staff
carry out the necessary tasks to keep the system running and to
enable it to grow to become a more reliable system.<P>

        The staff is too limited to be able to invest time and
        energy in the work needed to find, for example additional
        telephone lines and a new office space for the ZAMIR-BG.<P>

        For the ZAMIR-BG to be able to offer reliable, regular
        email and electronic conferences, we will need at least
        one if not two or three more telephone lines. The one
        line that we now have is overloaded by the many users who
        want to use it. The offices which we now use are not a
        long term solution. More staff persons are needed to
        offer regular hot-line support to new and old users. The
        present support team are working only a few hours a day
        and this time is needed for the daily maintenance of the
        system.<P>


I also observed that the CAA has its own email connection
without using ZAMIR-BG.<P>

I would like to clearly point out that in the past the CAA
has covered the local running costs and is therefore the to be
praised for keeping this line of international access open in very
difficult times.<P>

Now since the CAA no longer wants to administer the system, a new
administrative structure needs to be developed. Until this is
done, the CAA will continue to provide that salary for the sysops
to keep the system up and running. But beginning in 1996 the
entire local costs for the system need to be covered by the
users.<P>



       <h2> On the SYSOPS and ZAMIR-BG</h2>


The system operators put in a lot of energy and time to keep the
system running. In their hope to provide better access and make
changes they unfortunately did not consider the needs of the
users for continuous reliable connectivity and switched of the
system for two weeks for testing new connections and new
software.<P>

To enable you to to have an immediate return of access the
existing system has been turned on again. Your existing online
passwords and CrossPoint access will again work as before.<P>

I am very sorry that your needs for continuous and reliable
communication were neglected for the past weeks.<P>

I must say that I am very happy that the system operators are
willing to continue to run the system and expect them to be more
responsive to the users needs.<P>



<h3>Steps for the future</h3>


Even though we have found a way to keep the system running for a
few months, we will need to develop a real plan for the future. A
new administration of the system must be set up. Either an
non-governmental organization (NGO) or a group of NGO's. The
costs for these developments must be carried by the users of the
system. It may also be possible to look for sponsors and
donations for the system.<P>

We will only be able to provide reliable service and regular user
support if we can pay for more staff and if we can buy additional
telephone lines.<P>

I would appreciate hearing from anyone that has some ideas about
overcoming this crisis.<P>

Yours,<br>

<h1>><A HREF="http://www.siicom.com/odrazb/index.html" >OdrazB</A>, Feb. 15 1996</h1>

BELGRADE - Today, the Corporate court in Belgrade, returned the independent TV and Radio broadcasting company, Studio B, back to state ownership; according to the court, the city of Belgrade is Studio B's legal owner.  Judge Milena Arezina accepted the demand from the state Agency for evaluation of social [i.e. state owned] capital submitted on 2/3/96 and declared the registration of independent radio and TV station Studio B to be invalid.  Based on that decision, the Belgrade city council named the station's new executive board and the director.<P>

The Corporate court invalidated the registration of Studio B as a shareholding company, dating from April 1991, after finding that Studio B, as an "infrastructure related company" (companies having to do with electro-distribution, rail transport and radio and television) did not have a right to constitute itself as a shareholder owned company.<P>

The court decision cites the Serbian law which regulates privatization of public [state owned] property, according to which infrastructure related companies cannot complete their ownership transformation before an enactment of a law regulating protection, use and development of property of common interest and procedure under which those goods can be privatized.<P>

According to that law, the ownership transformation of companies related to infrastructure is null and void if it was carried out after 3/19/1991.  As it was established without a doubt that the decisions about the transformation of Studio B into a shareholding company, were made on 15 and 25 April 1991, this was enough to erase the company from a register of public companies.<P>

The Corporate court overruled Studio B's objection that the deadline for the removal from the register, of four years after the initial registration, has expired.  It also rejected an objection that the decision of the state Agency for estimation of the value of capital is unlawful, because of which a suit has been filed in the Supreme court of Serbia.  The Corporate court stated that its verdict was the final executive order, which was implementable regardless of whether any other cases were pending.<P>

The court also stated that in spite of the above mentioned fact, it had stopped the hearing to allow the Supreme court to make its decision; since the Supreme court had rejected Studio B's suit on 12/26/1995, the Agency's decision to  invalidate Studio B's transformation became valid.<P>

The Belgrade city council is listed as a founder [i.e. owner] of the station; as the court says, the council has never given up its rights nor ownership of the company.<P>

After the verdict, the Belgrade city council appointed the secretary general of the council, Ljubomir Milic,  to the position of the president of the independent TV and radio station NTV Studio B's executive board.<P>

According to Beta [independent news agency], Dragisa Kovacevic (former director of channel SOS) was appointed to the position of the caretaker director general of Studio B; he will start at his new position today, February 15 1996 and will stay at this position until a permanent director is appointed.<P>

At the same time Dragisa Kovacevic will carry out duties of the editor in chief until the permanent editor is appointed.<P>

Besides president Milic, another four persons were appointed to the new executive board: two parliamentarians from SPS [ruling party in Serbia], Pedrag Petrovic (director of the credit department in Beobanka) and Goran Vujcic (also from Beobanka), than the member of the executive city council in charge of the media, Mira Durovic and the deputy information secretary from the city government, Branka Dikanovic.<P>

Kovacevic confirmed for Beta that three Studio B employees were also appointed to the new executive board: Dragan Kojadinovic (the president of the old executive board), Vesna Vojvodic and Dimitrije Sladic.<P>

Here are the first reactions:<P>

This morning, opposition parties in Serbia sharply criticized the decision of the Corporate court in Belgrade to nullify the registration of NTV Studio B as a shareholding company, and the decision of the Belgrade city council to appoint a new executive board for the station and assume the ownership of the station.<P>

The Democratic party of Serbia (DSS), stated that "the takeover of a TV station in which name there is a word 'independent', clearly shows that this act has long term political consequences."  The DSS press release also says that "the opposition in Serbia must adequately respond to this challenge of the ruling regime; regarding that, DSS invites all democratically oriented parties to take a common action."<P>

The Serbian radical party (SRS) declared that at the todays meeting of its executive council it was decided that SRS "would do everything in its power in order to help the survival of the only media house out of the state control, whose unbiased and objective reporting went against the present power brokers." According to the press release from the SRS information center, SRS believes that "the ruling party and its president [Slobodan Milosevic] have finally institutionalized their dictatorship in Serbia by this takeover of the independent television Studio B."<P>

The Civic Alliance of Serbia (GFS) assessed that the events around Studio B, "only confirm the necessity of cooperation between democratic forces in Serbia, as the only way to free our country from a regime whose aim is to destroy every, even a smallest one, beacon of freedom."<P>

The Serbian renewal movement emphasized in the press release issued by its presidency that the television station - "a symbol of independent journalism", was taken over by "political commissars from JUL [Yugoslav United left, former hard line communists and army generals] and SPS," based on a verdict of the Supreme court of Serbia which will "soon, in a new Serbia, be an object of study as an example of shame for the law and the judicial profession."<P>

Former Studio B's executive board president, Dragan Kojadinovic, said that the takeover of the station by the Belgrade city authorities was "the end of an illusion that we are different from Croatia."<P>

Belgrade Circle vicepresident, Miladin Zivotic, stated that the takeover was a sign that the authorities "have lost their mind."<P>

Vicepresident of the New Democracy party (ND) [SPS' coalition partner in the Serbian parliament], Cedomir Mirkovic, supported the decision of the Belgrade authorities to assume ownership of the station Studio B. This is what Mirkovic stated for the news agency Beta: "I believe that the decision of the city authorities was a solution which will both in the organizational and financial sense stabilize the situation in Studio B and ensure the job security of the journalists."<P> 

<hr>

	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP, Feb 15 1996) -- The Serbian government took over the  
country's first independent television station Thursday, annulling 
its privatization and dealing the most serious blow yet to freedom 
of the press.<P> 
	Police entered Studio B TV to switch off its broadcast antenna,  
interrupting an address to viewers by Milorad Roganovic, the 
station's chief editor.<P> 
	``Only stupid authorities like these can deprivatize something  
that existed successfully for six years as a private company,'' 
said Roganovic, who was ousted.<P> 
	``Who is now going to invest in Serbia when there's obviously  
complete uncertainty for private companies?'' he asked.<P> 
	The government launched a similar takeover in 1994, when  
journalists from the independent daily newspaper Borba were forced 
out of the company. Those journalists founded a separate daily, 
called Nasa Borba, but circulation has remained low due to high 
paper prices and distribution difficulties.<P> 
	Studio B was founded in 1972 as a state-run radio station with a  
liberal streak. It was allowed to privatize in 1990 by the ruling 
Socialists as a wave of democratic changes swept through eastern 
Europe.<P> 
	Still, Studio B journalists were under constant pressure because  
of critical reports on the nationalist regime headed by Serbian 
President Slobodan Milosevic.<P> 
	Despite his involvement in the Bosnian peace accord, Milosevic  
has remained an autocrat at home and continues to hold a firm grip 
on the economy, media and Parliament.<P> 
	Several other independent television stations remain in Serbia,  
but most carry just entertainment programs. <P>
	Studio B returned to the air later Thursday, broadcasting music  
videos. <P>

CROATIA: Independent radio station, Radio LAE, subject to
harassment<p>

ORIGINATOR: International Federation of Journalists (IFJ),
Brussels<P>

           **Updates alert dated 29 August 1995**<P>

Radio Labin Art Express (Radio LAE), an independent radio station
which provides Croatia with news and cultural programming, has
been subject to harassment by Croatian authorities attempting to
shut it down. A letter dated 18 January 1996 was sent by the
Ministry of Maritime Affairs, Transport and Communication to
Radio LAE indicating that Radio LAE no longer held a valid
broadcasting permit and that it must shut down immediately.<P>

Radio LAE's frequency is to be awarded to an as yet non-existent
radio station run by Zeljko Paliska, a shareholder in Radio LAE's
competitor, FFI Commerce. Paliska is also an active member of the
ruling Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ), and it is believed that
he has been granted Radio LAE's frequency in order to remove
Radio LAE from the airwaves.<P>

A week after the letter was sent, Igor Vukic, deputy general
manager of Radio LAE, and Kresimir Farkas, editor-in-chief of the
station, were threatened with physical violence by three men
believed to have been sent by Paliska. The three threatened the
two men in a cafe, telling them to hand over Radio LAE's
transmitter by 31 January. The same day, the apartment of Dean
Zahtila, general manager of Radio LAE, was broken into. Both the
threats and the burglary were reported to the police.<P>

This recent harassment follows several government decisions
granting almost all available frequencies to persons or groups
close to the ruling HDZ.<P>

BACKGROUND:<br>
Broadcasting since 1993, Radio LAE is Croatia's only independent
source of information. It broadcasts programmes devoted to
alternative music, culture and art. Radio LAE's information
programming features local news gathered by the station's staff
and regional and world information from sources such as the
British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and Deutsche Welle. In
August 1995, the Croatian Council for Telecommunications
announced that it was to grant FFI Commerce a licence to
broadcast on Radio LAE's frequency (see IFEX alert).<P>


RECOMMENDED ACTION:<br>

Send appeals to authorities:<P>
<ul>
<li>condemning the harassment as an attack on freedom of expression
and press freedom
<li>stressing the need for an independent press and urging that
Radio LAE be allowed to continue broadcasting
<li>asking that a full investigation be made into both the assaults
and the burglary
</ul><P>

RADIO L.A.E. IN DANGER!

<p>

From last week the only independent radio station in Croatia is in life
danger.<p>

On 27th January Radio L.A.E. received an official letter from the Croatian
Ministry of Transport, Communications and Maritime Affairs signed by the
state inspector for telecommunications, in which Radio L.A.E. was summoned
to stop broadcasting immediately.<p>

On 30th January three oppressors have physically threaten Mr. Igor Vukic,
deputy general manager, and  Mr.Kresimir Farkas, editor in chief, with the
purpose to make them give up the transmitters of Radio L.A.E., what they
refused to do. The very same afternoon the oppressors broke into the flat
of Mr. Dean Zahtila, general manager of Radio L.A.E., while he was on
busines trip abroad.<p>

Local police station in Labin confirmed that three oppressors have been
sent by Mr.Zeljko Paliska, shareholder of the company FFI COMMERCE which
was given the frequencies of Radio L.A.E. by the political decission of
the Ministry (shareholders of FFI COMMERCE are members of HDZ, the leading
Croatian party, yet having no force in Labin and Istria County). Croatian
authority can be expected to close down the radio by force and to
confiscate radio equipment, which would still not be in disagreement to
the Croatian legislation.<p>
An urgent international action and pressure on Croatian government is
needed!

<h2><i> by Tim Judah<br>  The Times, 12/28/94</i></h2><p>

<hr>

BELGRADE: A battle for the freedom of press in Serbia has moved from the courts to the streets.<p>

After an attempt on Friday by the authorities to impose editorial control on Borba, Serbia's only independent national daily, two editions are being printed.  On the streets readers have a choice between an ``official" pro-government version and on ``independent" edition.  Both are published under the same masthead and, even more confusingly, both appear to be illegal.<p>

For the past few years, Borba has consistently published opposition voices while most other papers have toed an editorial line reflecting President Milosevic's policies.  For several months, however, the authorities have been attacking Borba through the courts by challenging its ownership.  Last week they appointed a new editor, Dragutin Brcin, rump Yugoslavia's State Secretary for Information.  This move sparked the rebellion.<p>

An attempt to evict Borba journalists from their building failed.  They are continuing to work while the pro-government version is apparently being prepared on government premises.  According to Gordana Logar, editor of the independent edition, only four out of more than 100 journalists have defected to the rival.<p>

On Saturday, the European Union condemned the move, calling it ``a further repressive measure" against the independent media.  Yesterday, Mrs. Logar said she was baffled because the paper had supported Mr Milosevic's recent peace moves.  She said that she was even more puzzled by a court ruling on Tuesday which in effect declared pro-government paper illegal as well.<p>

Borba may have irritated Mr Milosevic by continuing to report on the Bosnian Serbs.  Most other papers and state television ignore Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader.  The attempt to curb Borba may also indicate a trend towards further authoritarianism.  Mira Markovic, Mr. Milosevic's wife, writes a magazine column which often presages her husband's next move.  In her last article she wrote that while ``parliamentarianism suits the English so well, it really does not seem to fit the Serbs at all".

<h1>Yugoslavia-Media: Belgrade Regime Cannot Crush the Daily " Borba"</h1>     

                                                                                
<h2>by Vesna Peric Zimonjic, Inter Press  Service,  January 7, 1995</h2>                                                
<em>Copyright 1995  Inter Press  Service</em><P>                                                                                 
                                                                          
   In spite of having its funds frozen, the only independent newspaper in rump  
Yugoslavia continues to publish, using secret printing  presses  and enlisting a
large number of volunteers to distribute the essentially                        
oppositionist publication.<P>                                                      
                                                                                
   At the same, time the government of Slobodan Milosevic has appointed the     
federal minister of information, Dragutin Brcin, as the editor of the new       
official daily " Borba".<P>                                                       
                                                                                
   The fact the now underground  Borba  continues to publish is due mainly to   
the fact that the 100 or so journalists remained loyal to the editor Gordana    
Logar and only a handful defected to the new government mouthpiece.<P>             
                                                                                
   The Christmas assault by the Serbian judiciary on the  Borba  took place     
under the guise that the transformation from a "socially owned" firm into a     
joint stock company had not been properly constructed. It was decided that the  
paper did not have the legal right to publish some 30,000 copies daily.<P>         
                                                                                
   Currently two Serbian judges and two representatives of the State Bankruptcy 
Commission are in residence at the independent  Borba's  editorial offices. This
is despite the fact that its editors refused to sign a document appointing a    
state official to manage the paper's liquidation.<P>                               
                                                                                
   Journalists at the independent  Borba  fought back by forming a new          
publishing company to ensure the paper's survival.<P>                              
                                                                                
   "The  Borba  had to fight back, and this was the only way," says the         
independent daily's lawyer, Branislav Tapuskovic.<P>                               
                                                                                
   The new company, called "Fininvest" has been registered with the Yugoslav    
Board of Trade at the town of Novi Sad -- which is some 70 kilometers north of  
Belgrade -- one of the journalists, Rasko Kovacevic, told a  press  conference  
in Belgrade yesterday.<P>                                                          
                                                                                
   Kovacevic said the new company would issue the new paper "very soon" under   
its slightly changed name, " Nasa Borba"  (Our Fight).<P>                                                                              
   The change of name would be made "following suggestions from readers" he     
said. In the meantime, the pirate version is to be published as long as         
possible. The owner of "Fininvest" is Dusan Mijic.<P>                              
                                                                                
   He is already the  Borba's  leading shareholder, and it is his intention that
the current editor Gordana Logar should remain at the helm of the new           
publication.<P>                                                                    
                                                                                
   In addition, all the journalists effectively sacked following the Belgrade   
commercial court's ruling will be taken on by the new paper, Kovacevic said.<P>    
                                                                                
   Since Dec. 26, two editions of the  Borba  have appeared. A no-confidence    
vote against the federal government has been placed before parliament and       
demonstrations of support for  Borba  were held in the streets of Belgrade.<P>     
                                                                                
   The rival versions of  Borba  mean that the government-controlled one, edited
by Brcin and his team and created at the Ministry of Information itself, carries
only unsigned articles or official state  agency  Tanjug news.<P>                  
                                                                                
   According to the independent  Borba  journalists, the print run of their     
pirate edition is now not more than 10,000 copies. It's being sold by volunteer 
vendors on the streets. Sales of the official edition, appearing on newsstands, 
have not so far been revealed by the authorities.<P>                               
                                                                                
   Most of the political observers and analysts question the motives of Serbian 
president Slobodan Milosevic and his ruling socialist takeover of  Borba.  Many 
of them stress the fact that with its regular 60,000 circulation in a country of
more than 9 million people, the  Borba  was not a dangerous paper for Milosevic.<P>
                                                                                
   According to Stojan Cerovic, noted columnist of the independent Belgrade     
weekly the "Vreme",  Borba's  problems should be seen in much broader context of
developments in Serbia.<P>                                                         
                                                                                
   According to him, Milosevic, who inspired the rebellions of the Croatian     
Serbs and Bosnian Serbs and wars in Croatia and Bosnia, desperately needs peace 
in order to stay in power. He has had enough of war, hatred and Serbian         
propaganda," Cerovic says.<P>                                                      

   "Milosevic now needs to improve official history of what has been happening  
in recent years. The business of creating an official version is very important.
The legitimacy and longevity of his regime -- especially after the chaos, war   
and breakdown of what has happened here, depends on who is telling the story    
and how.<P>                                                                        
                                                                                
   "The official version has to be presented and forced into people's minds and 
different opinions rejected," Cerovic explains.  "Milosevic needs the history that will make him innocent of all that happened in the recent past," he concluded.<P>                                              
                                                                                
   Danielle Mitterrand, wife of French president and a human rights campaigner, 
wrote to Milosevic himself earlier this week, asking him to reverse the takeover
of the  Borba.<P>                                                                  
                                                                                
   The London-based international center for censorship has also protested to   
the Serbian president, complaining of "escalating censorship in the Serbian     
media."<P>

<h1> MEPs Express Concern for Press Freedom inCroatia and Serbia</h1><br>
       
 
<h2><i> European Parliament Green Group Press Release <p>
  The Reuter European Community Report, 1/10/95<p></i></h2><p>


Members of European parliament from six countries representing a broad cross section of political opinion have sent telegrams to the presidents of Serbia and of Croatia expressing concern over measures to stifle press freedom in both those countries.<p>

The telegram to President Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia expressed concern over the fate of the daily newspaper <i>Borba</i>, whose staff has been resisting a government takeover since last December 23, when the Belgrade government [Serbian capital] imposed its own Minister of Information as the newspaper's new Director.  The MEPs stressed that restoring Borba's independence ``must be considered as a major yardstick for defining our position on our relations to Serbia and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia [``Rump" Yugoslavia]."<p>

A similar telegram to President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia focused on the case of the satirical weekly <i>Feral Tribune</i>, which is being harassed out of exsistence by imposition of a heavy state tax for ``pornography" (not imposed on any other newspaper) combined with a cascade of libel suits brought by politicians who object to the paper's critical coverage. <p>

The MEPs, following a meeting in the European Parliament in Brussels condemning [lack of] media freedom in both Croatia and Serbia, told president Tudjman that they had agreed that ``unhindered freedom for <i>Feral Tribune</i> (especially with respect to absolutely abnormal taxes imposed on this paper) must be considered as a major yardstick for the media situation and democracy in your country and in defining our position in our relations to Croatia."<p>

In their message to both presidents, the MEPs stressed that:``We consider media freedom as essential for development of democracy in each country, and for improvement of relations between your country and European Union."<p>

They also reminded President Milosevic that European Parliament, in its December plenary session in Strasbourg, adopted a resolution of support for <i>Borba</i>.<p>

The initial signatories of the messages to the two Presidents were:

<ul>
<li> Alexander Langer, Italy, President of the Green Group in the European Parliament</li>
<li> Doris pack, Germany (CDU), President of the EP Southeastern Europe Delegation</li>
<li> Bernard Kouchner, France (Socialist), President of the Development Committee</li>
<li> Gijs de Vries, Netherlands, President of the Liberal Group in the European Parliament</li>
<li> Katarina Daskalaki, Greece (European Democratic Alliance), Foreign Affairs Committee</li>
<li> Jan Willem Bertens, Netherlands (Liberal), Foreign Affairs Committee</li>
<li> Magda Aelvoet, Belgium (Green),  Foreign Affairs Committee</li> 
<li> Pierre Pradier, France (Radical), Legal Affairs Committee</li>
</ul><p>

At their meeting, the MEPs agreed to intensify eforts to put press freedom high on the European Union's list of priorities in regard to relations with Croatia, Serbia and other countries in the region.

<H2> Index on Censorship, 1/1993</H2><p>

On 2/10/92, the entire Board of Directors of the Split daily ``Slobodna Dalmacija" was replaced by a board appointed by the State Agency for Restructuring and Development, on the grounds that it failed to carry out actions necessary to achieve complete privatisation.  The papers editorial staff said the move represented unwarranted interference with the freedom of a paper known for its independent and critical stance.  Its journalists were reportedly instructed by the new Board not to discuss the changes within the pages of the paper.  Staff responded by publishing a black ``Mourning" band across the paper's front page, defying instructions issued by the new Board for its masthead to be changed from traditional red to blue<p>

<h2> Index on Censorship, 5/1993</h2><P>

On 3/8/93, journalists at ``Slobodna Dalmacija" went on strike in protest at a government decision to impose a new editorial board on the newspaper.  On 3/11/93, the new government-imposed board dismissed a number of the paper's leading editors and writers including editor in chief <b> Josko Kulusic</b>, and the paper appeared without its usual satirical supplement ``Feral Tribune" on 3/17/93.  A new board of directors had been imposed in October of 1992.<p>

<h1> Free Press Says it is Threatened in Independent Croatia</h1><br>
       

 <h2><i> by Mark Heinrich <p>
  The Reuter Library Raport, 3/17/93, Zagreb, Croatia<p></i></h2><p>

Journalists at Croatia's only independent national newspaper say the government is trying to take it over in a campaign to stifle a free press.<p>

The right-wing government has imposed a management board on <i>SLobodna Dalmacija</i> (SD) to amend what it says was the fraudulent privatisation of the paper in 1990, when Croatia was still a part of Yugoslavia.  It denies trying to muzzle it.<p>

But U.S. embassy spokeswoman said Washington had told the government it was concerned about ``the appearance of a politically motivated takeover" of the daily.<p>

Staff at SD, founded by anti-Nazi Yugoslav partizans during World War Two, contend the board's purpose is to turn the paper into a government lapdog to choke off criticism over economic mismanagement as war with rebel Serbs continues.<p>

``Our post-communist political elite has no awareness of the importance of a free media in developing democratic culture," Slaven Letica, a former adviser to president Tudjman, told Reuters.<p>

``The government is using the patriotic frustrations of Croatians to crack down on <i>Slobodna Dalmacija</i>.  But this approach to the press has caused major damage to Croatia's profile abroad."<p>

SD's editorial staff shut down the paper with a three-day strike last week in a bid to pre-empt the appointment of two new pro-government chief editors by the board and state bank shareholders' meeting to ratify the transition.<p>

Both steps were carried out anyway and the journalists returned to work after being assured that none of their senior colleagues would be sacked for political reasons.<p>

SD's critical editorial tone has diminished perceptibly since the paper returned to news stands.<p>

Some journalists have resigned themselves to accepting the change and are staying on, fearing the alternative of unemployment. <p>

At least 30 others have said they will start a new independent daily if SD's editorial integrity is further undermined, apparently unfazed by the fact that newspaper distribution in Croatia remains a state monopoly.<p>

All beleive the best solution is the supervision of the privatisation process by Western media watchdog groups and have appealed to several for help.<p>

Press freedom advocates from West have come to Croatia for a first-hand look.  The U.S.-based International media Fund has written to Tudjman urging him not to strangle SD under ``the guise of a privatisation efort."<p>

``It will reflect poorly on the reputation of Croatia in the world community," said the Fund chairman marvin Stone.  ``It could serve to discourage foreign investment because Croatia would be viewed in the category of ... oppressors of press freedom."<p>

SD - the name means Free Dalmatia - is based in Split, Croatia's second city on the Dalmatian Adriatic coast.<p>

It claims a circulation of 100,000 in this republic of 4.7 million people - down from 160,000 in old Yugoslavia - and another 20,000 among Croats living in Germany and Austria.<p>

Although under ultimate state control in former federal Yugaslavia, SD achieved considerable editorial independence.<p>

It gained reputation for exposing corruption and incompetence in the old communist federation and under Tudjman's Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) after Croatia's secession in mid-1991 sparked war with Serbs.<p>

In 1990, SD parcelled out most of its shares to employees under a loose privatisation law passed by Yugoslavia's last functioning federal government.<p>

After independence, Tudjman's government said it had found major irregularities, including under-valuation of assets, in the privatisation and ordered a total overhaul of the process.<p>

Zlatko Matesa, head of the government privatisation agency, said SD employees were offered 55 per cent of the paper's stock but bought just 25 per cent.  the rest was turned over to  three state owned banks for eventual sale by public auction.<p>

``The government of Croatia has no reason or interest to control SD.  The point is simply that newspapers must go through the same process of privatisation as other Croatian companies," said Matesa.<p>

But Zoran Erceg, SD's Zagreb [Croatian capital] news editor who lost his post in the changeover, said the paper was being punished for not being a government cheerleader at a time whan Serb forces still occupy  a third of Croatia.<p>

Croatian television, the sole source of information for the vast majority of Croats, is run by HDZ functionaries.<p>

The two big Zagreb dailies, 70 per cent state owned, echo HDZ line and brim in lurid, scarcely substantiated report about Serb control of four enclaves in Croatia.<p>

Croatia has sought acceptance in the European Community by contrasting itself with Serbia, ruled by nationalists widely blamed for Yugoslavia's bloody brakeup.<p>

Critics say Serbian state talevision is being used to misinform its viewers about who is to blame for the war and to attack government opponents.  The press restrains itself to avoid annoying the authorities.<p>

Croatia's media are not much better off, diplomats say.<p>

SD staff fears the fate of <i>Danas</i>, a Zagreb weekly noted for its crusading against official abuses in old Yugoslavia.<p>

Danas was forced to close last year, a victim of its dependence on state subsidies and distribution networks.  A new <i>Danas</i> with new writers does not challenge Tudjman.<p>

<h2>CROATIA-MEDIA: Press Faces Subtle And Severe State Suppression</h2>

<em>By Drago Hedl, 8/4/95</em><p>

OSIJEK, Croatia, Aug 4 (IPS) - Every so often Dr. Zarko Domljan,
vice-president of the Croatian parliament, receives an unpleasant
letter protesting about the state of press freedom in Croatia --
be it from the Croatian independent media or human rights
watchdogs.<p>

Reporters have learned that one such letter arrived on his desk
sent by the Council of Europe -- which promotes democracy and
respect for human rights in on the continent -- soon after the
<A NAME="burn">Jun. 27 attacks against</a> the satirical weekly newspaper 
the 'Feral Tribune', published in the Croatian coastal town of Split.<p>

There, on the main town square, a gang confiscated copies of the
'Feral Tribune' from newsboys and newsstands and publicly burned
them at several locations on the streets of Split.<P>

This incident could not have occurred at a worse time for Croatia
as the newspapers were burned on the streets at the same time as
the PHARE -- a European Union development programme for central
and eastern Europe -- delegation was visiting Zagreb.<P>

The embarrassment of the Split incident was enormous since the
PHARE Programme delegation had canceled a previously scheduled
visit. Indeed, concerns about Press freedoms in the former
Yugoslav republic was one of the main reasons for the postponement
of Croatia's membership of the PHARE Programme.<P>

Domljan attributed the public burning to a freak ''group of
extremists who only wanted to express their political opinions,
that were different to that of the weekly.''<P>

However, this is only one incident indicating a strategy towards
thwarting the freedom of the independent media in Croatia.<p>

In the past, the 'Feral Tribune' editor was violently thrown out
of his office by the army due to the weekly's open and frank
reporting on the abuses of power by the Croatian government and
President Franjo Tudjman.<P>

Later, it was burdened with a hefty tax -- normally only levied
on pornographic magazines.   After numerous protests and pressure
from around the world, the tax was abolished.<P>

Now, the latest strategy for its financial ruin is a wave of
libel cases filed privately, mainly by high government officials
demanding heavy damages.<P>

Indeed, since the early days when unruly editors were thrown out
of their editorial offices at gun point, the Croatian authorities
have learned that there are more subtle and fruitful methods of
dealing with them.<P>

The taxation ploy did not work, and it is yet to be determined
what gains will be made from the lawsuits. In the meanwhile, the
government is employing another strategy aimed not only at
underming the independent Press, but at trying to convince the
international community that the media scene is vibrant in
Croatia.<P>

<A NAME="hrslovo">One high official</a> in the Croatian government recently commented on the level of freedom of the media in Croatia by pointing at the
enormous number of publications. ''Just look at the newsstands,
there have never been so many different newspapers there!''<P>

Whether intentionally or not, in these few words he expounded the
governments strategy for dealing with foreign enquiries about
media freedom in Croatia.<P>

The reasoning behind such a philosophy is that in a country where
the newsstands are too crammed to hold the immense number of
publications on sale, there should be no doubt about the freedom
of the press.<P>

Although the state already strictly controls the national
television and radio stations, as well as four of the five daily
newspapers in the country, in the last few months, there have been
a flood of new newspaper titles that have been started and
financed by the state.<P>

They range from newspapers dedicated to demographic renewal to
satirical magazines aimed at competing with the 'Feral Tribune'.<p>

<em>'Obzor' (Horizon), 'Drzavnost' (Statehood), 'Velebit' (Mt.
Velebit), 'Narod' (People), 'Zora' (Dawn), 'Hrvatsko Slovo'
(Croatian Voice), and 'Zalac' (Sting)</em> are some of the titles that
have appeared. The hope seems to be that their sheer numbers will
squeeze out the independent papers on the stands.<p>

The circulation of all these papers is meagre, making it quite
obvious that they would quickly disappear if state financial
support dried out.<p>

Apart from crowding out space on the Croatian newspaper market,
they also perform the role of creating the illusion of pluralist,
diverse journalism that is present in democratic societies.<p>

Newspaper distribution in Croatia, including the largest network
of newsstands, is monopolised by ''Tisak'' the state-controlled
distributor. And it is hard not to infer that the 'state media'
are afforded the most prominent positions on the newsstands, no
matter how meagre their sales.<p>

When such a sophisticated way of state control over the media is
added to the confiscation and even burning copies of the 'Feral
Tribune', one gets a very powerful and efficient means of
suppression.<p>

After the burning of 'Feral Tribune', many newsstand vendors hid
their copies of the weekly out of fear. In the flood of state
newspapers, the gap was not even noticed.<p>

Another role fulfilled by the newpapers is raising the level of
media noise by screaming hysterically from their front pages
against the alleged national betrayal and the 'Yugo-nostalgia' of
the independent media and journalists.<P>

President Tudjman once said independent journalists had ''sold
themselves to the enemies''.<P>

The frenzied campaign that state journalists conduct against
their independent colleagues has already taken the form of a real
media war on a par with the one that was conducted against
Serbia's independent journalists in Belgrade in the wake of
Serbian aggression.<P>

The most drastic division made between state journalists and
independent journalists was made by the President himself at a
recent national awards ceremony when he handed out numerous
decorations to journalists from the state-controlled media, for
their part in the ''homeland war'' against the Croatian Serbs.<P>

Some of the decorated journalists had barely spent an hour
reporting from the frontlines, while others were the foremost
advocates of the media war and campaigns of hate.<P>

On the other hand, not one journalist from the independent media
was decorated, although some have spent months reporting from the
front lines.<P>

And it was not a case of the president being economical with the
medals -- he allotted no less than nine decorations to himself!<P>

The irony of it all was not lost on Viktor Ivancic, the 'Feral
Tribune editor who said the whole exercise was a farce. ''These
are very hard times for satire. Whatever we write, the state will
come up with something far funnier than us,'' he said.<P>

<h1> Magazine makes Assault On Serbian Nationalism: Scrappy Vreme Has Emerged As Yugoslavia's Most Trusted Chronicle Of War</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by Carol J. Williams<br>  Los Angeles Times, 3/23/93</i></h2><p>


<hr>

BELGRADE: Empty whiskey bottles, owercrowding ashtrays and walls plastered with political posters give the crowded nerve center of Vreme magazine the high-intensity, low-budget look of a 1960s campus newsroom.<p>

The magazine's defiant battle against Serbian nationalism and the senseless destruction of the Yugosalv war is also reminiscent of idealistic student struggles waged a quarter century ago against another Establishment embroiled in an unpopular war.<p>

Staunchly committed to the liberal principle that it is a moral duty to question authority, Vreme has grown in its 2 1/2-year life span from an opposition voice in the wilderness to Yugoslavia's most trustworthy chronicle of the gruesome Balkan war.<p>

The weekly offering of articles and commentary provides a window on Serbia's puzzling national mind-set and explains the roots and course of the conflict with chilling accuracy and detail.<p>

Writers and editors who hold court in a cramped office that is a model of Balkan disorder have gained wide respect among foreign diplomats and are frequently quoted by the Western press.<p>

But for all its laudable crusading, Vreme is largely preaching to the converted.  Only 30,000 copies are produced each week, and at least 25% of them are sold abroad.<p>

Vreme's exposure is a paltry fraction of that enjoyed by state-run TV Serbia, but its limited appeal explains its survival in a country mesmerized by propaganda.<p>

"In a way we are an alibi for the regime," said Executive Editor Petar Lukovic, noting that Vreme's so-far-unfettered autonomy gives the Serbian leadership something to point to as evidence that it tolerates a free press.<p>

"Under different circumstances, if the majority were to begin reading Vreme, this would be very, very dangerous for us," Lukovic said, predicting the magazine's suppression in the event of the upsurge of readers.  "But I wouldn't mind seeing that happen, because it would mean that there had been serious change in Serbia.  We would be willing to sacrifice our cult status for a change in the Serbian mentality."<p>

It is Serbia's collective persecution complex that compels most of the country's 10 million citizens to believe the heavy-handed propaganda aired nightly on state television.<p>


Throughout the nearly six years that Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic has been in power, television has convinced the public that its political isolation and economic ruin are the consequences of a heinous international conspiracy concocted by the Vatican, Islam and the West.<p>

With monthly salaries gutted from their prewar average of $500 to less than $30 by hyper-inflation, few in Serbia can afford to buy magazines of newspapers to get a different perspective on their problems.  Vreme costs 10,000 dinars, less than 50 cents at the galloping exchange rate but more than a day's pay for many struggling Yugoslavs.<p>

Western diplomats agree with the Vreme editors' assessment that the magazine will have a free hand only as long as it remains limited to the open-minded fringe.<p>

"If they were a danger to the regime, the regime would do something about it, but they are not," one Belgrade based envoy obsereved.  "The bigger risk is that over time Vreme's editorial staff could be weakened by attrition as people get fed up with this society and leave, especially those with children.  It's one thing for an adult to suffer for a hopeless cause, but most of these guys have families they may not be willing, in a long run, to put at risk."<p>

The magazine's most respected writers, like Stojan Cerovic and Milos Vasic, are experienced preofessionals in their late 30s and 40s, but the bulk of Vreme's staff is wide-eyed, energetic and young.<p>

Vreme is a place where those fresh out of college can rise from street vendor to management within six months, as evidenced by three top ad salesmen, who are all years shy of 30.<p>

Twentysomething reporters and editors, like brother-sister team of Dejan and Duska Anastasijevic, are attracted by the psychological rewards of having front-row seat on history and taking part in what they believe will some day be judged a courageous effort to spread the truth.<p>

Many of the 30-odd employees say they thrive in the loose, chummy atmosphere of the Vreme office, where liquor flows freely through the workday, staff meetings are banned, the phone rings incessantly and no one would think of wearing anything dressier than jeans.<p>

"Nobody is working here for the money, although our salaries are better than the average," said Lukovic, who despite his senior position, earns only about $70 per month.<p>

"The greatest satisfaction is providing our readers with a mirror in which they can look and say to themselves, 'Thank God there are still some people who think like me'," he said.<p>

Though far from the Serbian mainstream, Vreme has a loyal following in the educated professional circles for which the magazine was intended.<p>

It first appeared in October, 1990, during a brief phase of economic reform under former prime minister Ante Markovic and under a patronage of a prominent Serbian lawyer, Srdjan Popovic, who was willing to bankroll a touchstone for those clinging to reason.<p>

As the only fully independent medium in what remains of Yugoslavia -- which now consists of just Serbia and Montenegro -- Vreme's clearly defined audience of intellectuals and foreigners attracts more advertising than any other publication.  Even in bancrupt Serbia.  Vreme earns its founders a modest but growing profit.<p>

A few publications, like the federal daily Borba, have joined Vreme in straying from the official line that Serbia is a victim of unscrupulous outside forces.  But none aside from Vreme has so forcefully attacked Serbia's penchant for self delusion.<p>

In an eloquent critique last month on the rise of fascism in Serbia, Deputy Editor Cerovic denounced fellow Serbs for indifference to the destruction rained on Croatian and Bosnian cities by nationalist rebels.  Pointing to the recent beating of a Muslim actor at a Belgrade restaurant, Cerovic likened the fearful atmosphere  paralyzing the real Serbian rsistance to that of Nazi Germany 50 years ago.<p>

"Once Vukovar has been digested (By Serbian rebels), once we become used to the destruction of Sarajevo," Cerovic wrote, "we are halfway down the road to peacefully continuing with our supper while someone from the neighboring table is dragged off into the darkness."<p>

<center><h2>BOSNIA-HERZEGOVINA:  REBUILDING THE FREE PRESS IN SARAJEVO
</h2></center>

<em>Commentary by Zoran Udovicic(*)</em><P>

   SARAJEVO, Jan. 23 (IPS) -- Media Plan, an association for the
restoration and development of media was founded in Sarajevo in
early 1995 with the slogan, &quot;Think of the future, so that peace
does not surprise you.&quot;<P>
   Now that some form of peace has come, if the training of
journalists and preparations for the opening of the free market
does not start soon, some important media projects in Sarajevo will surely fail.<P>
   At the beginning of the war, the best-selling newspaper in
Sarajevo was a free advertisement paper, Oglasi, with circulation
of 1,500. It sold for one German mark (68 U.S. cents), a phenomenal
price when monthly salaries averaged at about six marks.<P>
   In comparison, mainly because of shortages of newsprint, ink,
and electricity the daily Oslobodjenje only had a circulation of
500, though its' readership was far wider, reaching its public by
being hung up on walls and notice boards throughout the city.<P>
   The Sarajevo media scene has stabilized since. Oglasi is still
published and read with undiminished interest, but Oslobodjenje has
now reached a circulation of 7,500, even though still limited by
availability of newsprint and its relatively low price of 50
Bosnian dinars, or about 35 cents.<P>
   The first phase of war journalism in Sarajevo was characterized
by a high level of enthusiasm, the non-existence of a media market,
and irregular working conditions, which offered opportunities to
media that were more resourceful than professionally endowed.<P>
   Greater press freedom gave rise to newspapers expressing a
bewildering variety of ambitions, hobbies, and even business
interests. Some of the businessmen tried to use their newspapers
to promote their other interests, while others used them to obtain
the occasional benefits, mainly access, that came with U.N. press
accreditation.<P>
   Sarajevo now has no less than 45 different newspapers and
magazines.<P>
   However, it is far easier to start a newspaper than ensure its
continuity, which is why some papers flopped after very few issues.
The solid line of Sarajevo journalism is today maintained by three
dailies, and a handful of magazines.<P>
   And despite the war and siege, the city's media structure is
pluralist. Apart from standard publications, there are seven
children's and educational, mainly irregular, magazines, three
women's magazines, one business magazine, three cultural magazines
published by various national cultural societies, six religious and
religious educational magazines, seven general interest magazines,
and even comic, sports, crosswords and video magazines.<P>
   The Sarajevan electronic media have had a far more stable
history than the print media. Not one of the new radio or TV
stations has stopped broadcasting yet, probably because of the high
costs of setting up such ventures in the first place.<P>
   Nine radio and three TV stations now broadcast in the city at
the moment, which is a marked improvement on the pre-war situation,
when there were only four radio and two TV stations.<P>
   All four Sarajevan press agencies were started at the beginning,
or during the war. Two of them are of general variety: the
state-owned Bosnia-Herzegovina Press Agency, and the independent
agency Onasa. Of the other two, one is of national-religious
orientation, the Muslim Press Agency, and the other one, Sarajevo
fax (SAFAX) is a specialized news service.<P>
   Officially, of all the political magazines, only Hrvatska Rijec
(Croat) and Ljiljan (Muslim) cater exclusively for a particular
ethnic group, while the magazine formerly known as Bosniak Avaz has
cut its ethnic title to become just Avaz.<P>
   Only Radio and TV Bosnia-Herzegovina are formally state-owned,
although its ownership has not yet been officially transformed from
the former form of social ownership into state ownership. The
government has announced a revision of the pre-war transformation
of formerly state-owned enterprises, such as Oslobodjenje, into
joint-stock companies.<P>
   All other media are privately-owned. Discussion on media
independence and the potential for media use and abuse by the
government or political parties have rekindled recently,
particularly since the series of incidents such as the demolition
of Studio 99 transmitter mast, a clash of opposition parties with
the director of RTV B-H, and threats to some journalists and media
for their &quot;excessive openness.&quot;<P>
   Those pressures come less from the government and state
institutions than from the ruling party and clandestine informal
power centers.<P>
   However, the greatest danger for many Sarajevo media is their
unreadiness to enter the free market media battle, inevitable with
the peace. A reliance on donations has disabled the entrepreneurial
zeal of many media.<P>
   Only the Ljiljan and Avaz magazines and the independent radio
and TV station Hajat, have so far worked out a long-term business
strategy and are investing in management, marketing and
development. The Avaz publishers recently drew attention by
starting a daily paper after only one month of preparation, which
involved a collective defection of a team of 40 journalists from
the competing Vecernje Novine.<P>
   Some say this is the harbinger of a coming free market, but
rivals warn it is only muscle-flexing and a sign of Avaz's
willingness to exploit their high-level connections. They point out
that while their distributors had to queue up at the old
checkpoints on the edge of Sarajevo like everyone else, Avaz was
regularly taken out of town in the early morning hours by police.<P>
   Another factor contributing to the bad situation of the
Sarajevan media is the personnel crisis, which has taken its toll
on the professional outlook of most media.<P>
   Only five professional journalists on average work in any one
of Sarajevan media today, while others are usually young,
inexperienced and inadequately trained freelancers.<P>
   Most of the media do not see this as a major problem, and
concentrate on fund-raising. The owner of one Sarajevan radio
station said that it is now easier to raise 100,000 marks for
technical equipment than to find three good journalists.<P>

<h3>Date: Mon, 18 Sep 1995 6:00:24 PDT</h3>

 <strong>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP)</strong> -- An independent radio and  television station known for its criticism of the Bosnian government has been crippled by a mysterious fire.<P>
 
Residents of the besieged capital were troubled by the destruction at Studio 99, seen as a symbol of democracy.<P>
  
``There is no democratic society without democratic and free media,'' the Association of Independent Media said in a statement. ``The right to a different opinion is guaranteed and it has to be defended.''<P>
  
The fire Friday destroyed a $70,000 repeater that amplifies the station's signal. Police cordoned off the repeater in Ciglane, north of the city center, and refused to comment on the fire pending an investigation.<P>
  
By Sunday morning, only the radio station was back on the air but reaching only a small fraction of its usual audience. <P>
 
Asim Abdurahmanovic, a founder of Studio 99, said he thinks the fire was set. He said bars surrounding the repeater and some of its cables were cut.<P>
  
Abdurahmanovic said previous attempts have been made to shut down the station, which is often critical of the Bosnian government and particularly of President Alija Izetbegovic. <P>
 
``We are deeply convinced that behind all this are our political enemies,'' Abdurahmanovic said. <P>
 
The station's latest attacks on Izetbegovic came after a meeting last month in Geneva where he supported a U.S.-backed peace proposal to end the war in Bosnia. Studio 99 blasted the Geneva deal, saying it rewards Serb aggression.<P>
  
The attacks triggered a media war between Studio 99 and television station Hayat, which many consider pro-government.<P>
  
Prior to Friday's fire, Studio 99 often lost electricity and its talk show telephone lines were occasionally jammed by callers dialing the numbers and not hanging up.<P>
  
Studio 99 was equipped five months ago by UNESCO and other foreign donors who support the development of democracy in Bosnia.<P>

 SARAJEVO, Feb. 20 :   Each day Bosnian Serb rebels continue to resist the Big Five's offer of half 
of  Bosnia -Herzegovina, the alliance between the joint heirs to the other half,
 Bosnia's  Croat and Muslim communities, comes under new strain.<P>                           
   An open rift has emerged between Haris Silajdzic, prime minister of the      
Bosnian-Croat federation, and the right wing of his own Party of Democratic     
Action (SDA). At the same time, the SDA and the Croatian Democratic Community   
(HDZ), the two ruling parties of the federation, are in fundamental             disagreement over the shape and character of the fledgling state. <P>                                                                                             
   The two disputes are closely related and can be said to represent a battle   
for  Bosnia -Herzegovina's soul. Silajdzic is a strong proponent of a           
multinational  Bosnia.  The right wing of the SDA, meanwhile, is dominated by   
Muslim nationalists. And the HDZ is led by Croatian nationalists.<P>                    
   The Washington agreement established the framework for a Bosnian-Croat       
federation but it left the details to be worked out between the parties. <P>           
   At the Constitutive Assembly in Zenica in mid-December, the SDA and HDZ could
not agree on a common program, both favoring measures that would, in effect,    
establish national statelets in  Bosnia -Herzegovina. The critical issues       
concern rotation of the presidency; the relationship between the federation,    
cantons and municipalities; and the criteria for establishing municipalities.<P>          
   The current president of the federation is Kresimir Zubak (HDZ) and Ejup     
Ganic (SDA) is his deputy. According to the terms of the Washington agreement,  
they are due to swap places at the end of an initial transition period. <P>         
   The HDZ opposes rotation at this time. They maintain that the transition     
period has not yet ended, which is true, but they also seem to be resisting     
full integration of the Bosnian-Croat "state" they call "Herzeg-Bosna" into the 
federation. <P>                                                                      
   Consider, for instance, their position on the army. The HDZ opposes the      
creation of a single army, which the SDA has proposed, and instead insists on   
maintaining two separate armies. Similarly, they refuse to set up a common      
customs zone.<P>                                                                     
   And since Herzeg-Bosna is now  Bosnia -Herzegovina's only land connection to 
the rest of the world, the Croatian authorities, and not the federal government,
are pocketing all the money from customs revenues.<P>                                 
   The determination to create exclusive national territories has not died      
either. The HDZ's demand for the establishment of a Croat municipality in       
Sarajevo and the actual establishment of one in the Tuzla-Podrinje canton is not
only unconstitutional but reinforces divisions which the Washington agreement   
sought to overcome.<P>                                                               
   The Washington accord defines administrative units only in economic and      
geographic terms, not national terms.<P>                                            
   These problems have not only strained the SDA-HDZ relationship. They have    
also exacerbated tensions between Silajdzic and the SDA. Silajdzic's popularity 
has grown steadily since he assumed the prime ministry but he has never         
developed a strong party base. <P>                                                   
   So while his charisma and vision of a multi-ethnic  Bosnia -Herzegovina bring
him new supporters daily, it has also made him a target of TV BiH, the state    
television.<P> 
   Under the direction of Amila Omersoftic, TV BiH is becoming an instrument of 
the SDA. Omersoftic came from the party leadership to run the TV station, even  
though she has no experience as a journalist. <P> 
   Her first move was to dismiss all politically undesirable journalists -- that
is, reputable, even award-winning professionals who would not bow to her        
pressures and report uncritically on the government of Bosnian president Alija  
Izetbegovic.<P>  
   The Serbian regime expelled its own politically objectionable TV journalists 
long ago. Croatia cleaned house, too. Now, it seems, Sarajevo is determined to  
keep up with its neighbors.<P> 
   Three journalists, Raska Denjalic, Mladen Paunovic, and Mladen Bosnjak, were 
dismissed in January for their reports from the Zenica session of the           
Constitutive Assembly. One report about a  press  conference of the Social      
Democratic Party (SDP), the non-nationalist challenger to the SDA, was embargoed
by TV BiH.<P> 
   At that conference Nijaz Skenderagic, the SDP's vice-president, criticized TV
BiH for its tendencies towards censorship.<P> 
   Skenderagic also expressed the SDP's support for the Silajdzic government and
applauded the fact that the government "did not give in to pressures from the   
ruling parties."<P> 
   It is said that Omersoftic, a member of the SDA's Executive Board, is        
spearheading a campaign to topple the prime minister, who enjoys international  
as well as domestic support. Omersoftic took the decision personally to embargo 
Skenderagic's statement.<P>
   She did not disguise her belief that the Silajdzic government deserved to be 
criticized, not applauded.<P>  
   Mladen Paunovic, a journalist from Sarajevo, writes that "the general public 
was astounded and shocked at the tone of this unsubstantiated attack on the     
prime minister; it sounded like a call for a lynching." <P>   
   Even Enes Karic, the Minister of Culture and Education and one of the SDA's  
hardliners, was surprised by her tone. "If it was within my power," Karic       
stated, "I would have ousted her immediately. I have never seen such hysterical 
rage expressed publicly." <P>  
   The government issued its own statement in reaction: "It is hard to find a   
country in the world in which the director of the state TV appoints and         
dismisses prime ministers at her will or seeks to provoke a crisis in a         
government that has won 100 percent support in parliament.<P>
   "The director of TV BiH is playing a very dangerous game not just for the    
prime minister or the government but for the democratic system." <P> 
   Omersoftic has also been criticized by the Union of Independent Journalists  
of  Bosnia -Herzegovina for her actions.<P> 
   The union, which includes such prestigious writers as Senad Pecanin,         
editor-in-chief of Sarajevo Dani, and Mehmed Halilovic, editor-in-chief of the  
daily Oslobodjenje, has opposed the manipulation of the media for political     
purposes. Although the present conflict is only between members of the same     
party, its resolution could be a long and difficult one.<P> 
   There are rumors that Silajdzic may step down as prime minister and accept   
the post of foreign minister, or resign altogether and form his own political   
party. In the meantime journalists, unfortunately, can expect to be used as     
cannon fodder to settle accounts among                                          
politicians.<P>

<A HREF="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/info/students/zoran/photo.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/info/students/zoran/pictures/refpic2small.gif" ALIGN="LEFT"></a> In August of 1995 some 200,000 Krajina Serbs fled Croatia in front of advancing Croatian troops.  Gordana Todorov was in <A HREF="http://www.ecn.uoknor.edu/~nsfdesmm/vojvodina/novisad/ns.html">Novi Sad</a> in Serbia at the time when the refugees were arriving.  She visited a central "collection center" at the SPENS sports center in Novi Sad and and taped a number of conversations with the refugees.  Take a look at the <A HREF="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/info/students/zoran/photo.html">photos</a> taken during these visits and excerpts from the conversations.(10/30/95) <P>

<IMG SRC="/info/students/marko/pictures/krnj2.gif" ALT="Krnjaca Refugee Camp" Align=LEFT>Where are the refugees now?  Most have been "resettled" all over Serbia: some moved in with <a HREF="/info/students/marko/VOAref.html">relatives and friends</a>, some were sent to abandoned villages in eastern Serbia, disused buildings, large households with the elderly...  Some of them, however, still have nowhere to go.  Makeshift camps reportedly still line the road from the border with Croatia to Belgrade.  The largest refugee camp in Serbia is located in Krnjaca, near Belgrade.  The Serb-American journalist from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Dejan Kovacevic, visited the camp in early September and spent a few days with its inhabitants.  He describes a typical <a HREF="/info/students/marko/krnj1.html">day in a life of a refugee</a>, writes about <a HREF="/info/students/marko/krnj2.html">a few Croats caught up in this Serb exodus</a> from Croatia, and <a HREF="/info/students/marko/krnj3.html">the appalling conditions</a> in which the refugees live. On about 600 refugees , quite a few of whom are critically ill, there is only one doctor, no medications nor medical materials.  For more information about the camp and the ways to send assistance, please contact Jasenka Rakas at <em>yugo@wam.umd.edu</em>.<P>

Note the photo's of "pro-Serb Muslim refugees living among the ruins in Turanj in Croatia" from 1994.  These people returned to their homes in and around Velika Kladusa in the so called Bihac pocket in North Western Bosnia in the Spring of 1995, only to flee the area in front of the Bosnian Army advance in August 1995.  Some 20,000 of them are presently living in a <A HREF="ref3.html#otoci">makeshift camp along the road near the deserted town of Vojnic</a> in Croatia.  As 1995 was coming to an end, the governments of Croatia, Bosnia-Hercegovina and Turkey agreed on setting up a joint police force in the Velika Kladusa area.  This joint police force was supposed to guarantee safety of the returnees.  The agreement was greeted with encouraging noises by the UN representatives.  Reportedly, some of the refugees voluntarily moved back while the majority decided to stay put.  At the end of January, 1996, UN reported that it was getting <a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/nklad.html">daily reports of cases of intimidation and violent attacks against the returning refugees</a>.

<h2> Yugoslav Resources on the Internet</h2>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><a HREF="http://www.umiacs.umd.edu/users/lpv/YU/HTML/yu.html"> Yugoslav Home Page</a> with general information (places, culture, language ..) about the federal republic of Yugoslavia (also known as Serbia-Montenegro).  It also has links to Internet resources related to former Yugoslavia. A new (permanent) site for the same pages: <A HREF="http://www.yugoslavia.com/" >www.yugoslavia.com</A>.  
<a HREF="http://www.het.brown.edu/people/stojkov/yu/yu.html"> Book of Home </a> is another Yugoslav home page.<P>

Two new servers  are vying for the honor of representing Belgrade on the Web: <A HREF="http://www.beograd.com/">beograd.com</A>, located in Boston, USA, and <a HREF="http://www.beonet.com/index.html">BeoNET.com</a>, located in Switzerland.
BeoNET is the first commercial Internet provider in Yugoslavia (server in Belgrade: <a HREF="http://www.beonet.yu">http://www.beonet.yu</a>).  They offer daily updated news from Belgrade (Politika and Nedeljni Telegraf).

What about other independent weeklies in Serbia and Croatia?  Views about the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia, political scene, minority rights and more.<p>

 <a HREF="http://MediaFilter.org/MFF/MonIdx.html">BALKAN MEDIA & POLICY MONITOR</a> offers a by-monthly compilation of abridged translated articles from the "independent" press in Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Yugoslavia.<p>

<A HREF="/info/students/marko/refugees.html"><IMG SRC="http://www.cdsp.neu.edu/info/students/zoran/pictures/refpic2small.gif" ALIGN="LEFT" ALT="refugees on the way to Serbia"></a> In August of 1995 some 200,000 Krajina Serbs fled Croatia in front of advancing Croatian troops.  Gordana Todorov was in <A HREF="http://www.ecn.uoknor.edu/~nsfdesmm/vojvodina/novisad/ns.html">Novi Sad</a> in Serbia at the time when the refugees were arriving.  She visited a central "collection center" at the SPENS sports center in Novi Sad and and taped a number of conversations with the refugees.  Take a look at the <A HREF="/info/students/zoran/photo.html">photos</a> taken during these visits and excerpts from the conversations.(10/30/95) <P>

Where are the refugees now?  Most have been "resettled" all over Serbia: some moved in with <a HREF="/info/students/marko/VOAref.html">relatives and friends</a>, some were sent to abandoned villages in eastern Serbia, disused buildings, large households with the elderly...  Some of them, however, still have nowhere to go.  Makeshift camps reportedly still line the road from the border with Croatia to Belgrade.  The largest refugee camp in Serbia is located in Krnjaca, near Belgrade. Serb-American journalist from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Dejan Kovacevic, visited the camp in early September and spent a few days with its inhabitants.  He describes a typical <a HREF="/info/students/marko/krnj1.html">day in a life of a refugee</a>, writes about <a HREF="/info/students/marko/krnj2.html">a few Croats caught up in this Serb exodus</a> from Croatia, and <a HREF="/info/students/marko/krnj3.html">the appalling conditions</a> in which the refugees live. On about 600 refugees , quite a few of whom suffer from are critically ill, there is only one doctor, no medications nor medical materials.  For more information about the camp and the ways to send assistance, please contact Jasenka Rakas at <em>yugo@wam.umd.edu</em>.<P>

<a HREF="/home/marko/public_html/iocc/iocc.html">International Orthodox Christian Charities</a> is one of a few international humanitarian organizations which have worked throughout the war on the Serb side of the front.

The propagandist seldom wants careful scrutiny and criticism; his object is to bring about a specific action...  Articles about propaganda in war and politics.<P>

<FONT SIZE="+1">Borba, an ex-Communist Party newspaper, established itself as an independent daily during the break up of the Yugoslav Communist Party and ``old" Yugoslavia.  It has frequently ignored the Government line in its reporting and has continuously covered the Bosnian Serb leadership and the war in Bosnia.  The pro-government media have largely stopped the coverage of the Bosnian conflict after the beginning of the Serbian Government's blockade of the Bosnian Serbs in  August of 1994.  In Novemeber 1994 the Government, after obtaining the Court decision which declared ``Borba's" privatisation in 1991 invalid, seized the paper's assets (as the paper legally became the Government property) and appointed the Yugoslav Minister for Informations for the Chief editor.  After several weeks during which <A HREF = "times.html">two editions of ``Borba"</A> ( one ``official" the other ``independent") were available on the streets, the original editorial board and most of employees, moved to Novi Sad (Serbia's third largest city) and started a new paper ``Nasa Borba" (Our Borba). <p>

 <a HREF="vreme/vreme.html">Vreme</a> was founded in 1990 by a group of jurnalists from the largest Serbian publishing house "Politika".  The weekly was modeled after its U.S. counterparts "Time" and "Newsweek" as its name, time in Serbo-Croatian, shows.  <i> Vreme </i> has established reputation as one of the most reliable media sources on the territory of ex-Yugoslavia and its writers/experts have been profusely quoted by the Western media.  Since 1990, <em>Vreme</em> has started a number of supplements (Vreme Novca (time of money) , Vreme Zabave (time for fun) etc.)  and a publishing house.  <em> Vreme</em> is also available in <a HREF="http://www.siicom.com/vreme/subscription.vreme.html">English in a digest form for a small fee</a>.

<h2>Nezavisna Svetlost</h2>

Following the example of <em>Nasa Borba</em>, the editorial board and journalists of weekly <em>Svetlost</em> (light), reacted to the August 1995 takeover of the paper by the authorities by submitting a collective resignation and starting a new weekly: <a HREF="http://www.yurope.com/zines/svetlost/"><em>Independent Svetlost</em></a>.  Magazine is of civil-liberal orientation and the basic aims of the editorial policy are: the contribution to the creation of democratic, free, and open society, multiparty parliamentarism, open market, freedom of the media and struggle for human rights.  The magazine is published in 6,000 copies whish are distributed in the region (Sumadija, in central Serbia) but, according to the polls, is read in 25,000 households (out of total 55,000).  The editorial policy of the magazine is lead by the desire to defend and promote "free world and journalist honor".  Because of that <em>Nezavisna Svetlost</em> initiated association of independent local media of Serbia (see Press Now report on <a HREF="http://www.dds.nl/~pressnow/media/servie/serbia.htm">independent media in Serbia</a>). Recent issues, in Serbian, can be found at the <A HREF="http://www.yurope.com/zines/">Yurope</a> server.<P>

<h2>Republika</h2>

Another magazine presented by Yurope.  <a HREF="http://www.yurope.com/zines/republika/">Republika</a> has been published intermittently since the early ninetees.  It has been a voice of the peace and civic movement in Serbia (the Association for Yugoslav Democratic Initiative) during the war.  Republika declares itself as the "Journal of civic self-liberation" and the "Journal with no hatred and scandals".  It is consistently anti-war oriented.  At present it is a bi-weekly which covers political and cultural topics.  In Serbian.<P> 


<h2>Blic</h2>

<a HREF="http://www.gates96.com/blic/blic.htm">Blic</a> is the youngest addition to the Serbian independent press scene.  A tabloid owned by German publishers, it has quickly won a large readership with low price, and a mixture of serious news and scandal stories.  During the recent street demonstrations in Serbia, <em>Blic</em> jumped in the media vacuum formed by the decision of the state-controlled media to completely ignore the protests and the inability of more established independent media to satisfy the demand for news.  At one point, the circulation reached 250,000 sold copies.  Naturally, the authorities couldn't tolerate such impertinence and the state-controlled print works refused to publish the paper.  Representative of the German owner hurried to assure the authorities that the paper will cut down its reporting about the demonstrations and reduce its circulation.  Imeediately, almost all journalists on the editorial board resigned and continued publishing as <em>Blic-Demokratija</em>,
now a daily affiliated with the Democratic Party.  This week, <em>Blic</em> sued
<em>Blic-Demokratija</em> for copyright infringement, despite a clear warning on the front page of the new paper: <em>This is not Blic; this is Blic-Demokratija</em>.<P>

<h2><A HREF="http://www.webworld.org/feral/"><IMG ALT="Feral Tribune" SRC="feral/feral.gif" ALIGN=BOTTOM border=1></a> </h2>

<FONT SIZE="+1"><a NAME="feral">Feral Tribune</a> is the best known Croatian independent left-leaning weekly.  It was founded as a satirical weekly supplement to <A HREF = "SD.html">``Slobodna Dalmacija"</A>,  the largest daily newspaper in Dalmacija (coastal Croatia).  When the parent paper was <A HREF = "indcen.html">taken over by the government</A> in 1992,  ``Feral Tribune" began its independent life as a weekly satirical newspaper.  Over the time its contents have taken a more serious nature, resulting in the imposition of a 50 percent sales tax by the Croatian government in 1994.  The official justification for the tax (not imposed on the government controlled media outlets) was the <A HREF = "euro.html">``pornographic content"</A> of the paper.  In the late March the Constitutional Court exempted ``Feral Tribune" from the  tax levied on pornographic publications after intense international pressure.  Since then, in addition to almost constant defamation of the paper's journalists and editors in the so-called "patrioatic" [drzavotvorna] press, the weekly has come under open attack from time to time.  For example, on 26-27 June 1995, thugs <A HREF="cromedia.html#burn"> publicly burned</a> copies of "Feral Tribune" in the center of Split. The action on the 27th also involved stealing large quantities of the paper from kiosks. Journalists and television crews were present, but the police were not to be seen (source: Patrick Moore, OMRI, Inc.,Thur Jun 29 1995).   The most recent spate of attacks is perhaps the most serious yet.  In March 1996 Croatian parliament passed the new media law which made it punishable to publicly criticize highest state officials. Immediately after that, Croatian police (department for terrorism) on May 3
interrogated Viktor Ivancic, editor of "Feral
Tribune".  In June, Viktor Ivancic and Marinko Culic were indicted for their two <a HREF="feral/feral26.html">articles</a> in which they criticized the proposal of the Croatian President Franjo Tudman to rebury the bones of WWII Croatian fascists, Ustashe, together with those of their victims at the site of former concentration camp in Jasenovac.  The trial was adjourned after the first hearing and the journalists were acquited at the second hearing in September.  The State Prosecutor's office is appealing the decision.<P>

<a HREF="http://open.hr/com/EuropaPress/">Globus</a> is the Croatian weekly with largest circulation.  Although independent and highly critical of the government, it is also staunchly "patriotic" unlike its more liberal counterparts, <em>Feral Tribune</em> and <em>ARKzin</em>.  For example, the detailed analyses of the latest changes on the fronts in Bosnia-Hercegovina were a regular feature in the paper.  In one of these articles, Globus "liberated" Drvar in western Bosnia about a month before the Croatian army actually entered the town.  The rumors of imminent takeover of the paper by the government or individuals close to the ruling party, HDZ, surface from time to time, but Globus is still preserving its independence.<P>

	<h2><a NAME="election">Exultant Croatia</a> heads for murderous election</h2>

<h5>By Jon Swain, The Sunday Times, October 22, 1995</h5>


  MARKO BERIC was too old and weak to run away when Croatia's army rolled
through the Serbian-held region of Krajina. So the 80-year-old grandfather and
nine other Serbs between the ages of 60 and 85 in the village of Varivode were
all murdered in their homes.<P>

  Croatia's authorities tried to cover up the crime. But when United Nations
officers found bullet holes, blood stains and bits of flesh in the houses of 
the victims and freshly dug graves in a cemetery at Knin they were forced to
investigate. Last week they announced they had arrested several uniformed men
who would be charged with the killings.<P>

  The murder of helpless elderly Serbian peasant men and women who stayed
behind in Krajina has been continuing, however, if at a reduced pace. A recent
report by European monitors said that up to six elderly Serbs were being
murdered a day. Many people remain unaccounted for.<P>

  ''There are no limits to the bestiality,'' said a human rights worker,
revealing that Croats had killed a 74-year-old woman by tying her up with a
fishing net, placing a tyre round her neck and setting it on fire. Even Serb
cattle are being singled out for the purposes of revenge. Cows have had their
eyes poked out and tendons cut. Hardly a village has escaped the destruction.<P>

  The Croatian army denies active involvement in killings, blaming criminal
bands of civilians dressed up as soldiers. However, few Croats are distressed 
by the violence against the Krajinan Serbs, who broke away from Croatia at the
beginning of the war. The majority view is that the Serbs have got what they
deserved.<P>

  The country is riding on a wave of nationalist hysteria after recapturing
vast areas of Serbian-held lands. Next Sunday it goes to the polls,
deliberately brought forward from 1996 to capitalise on the jingoistic mood.
President Franjo Tudjman, who delivered the victory in Krajina, is assured of 
a resounding win for his ruling Croatian Democratic Union party (HDZ).<P>

  The parliamentary elections precede the Bosnian peace talks in the United
States by a couple of days. So when Tudjman confronts Slobodan Milosevic, the
president of Serbia and his adversary, at the talks at Wright-Patterson 
airforce base in Dayton, Ohio, on October 31, it will be with his countrymen's
endorsement ringing in his ears. He is on a roll.<P>

  Each day he clatters across the country in a helicopter to another electoral
rally. The 73-year-old former communist general is revered and respected. In
more ways than one he has adopted some of the traits of Tito he is spry for his
age, an unashamed womaniser who loves white uniforms and gold braid. He brooks
no opposition, running a tight, highly personalised regime controlling all the
levers of power. One son commands military intelligence, another supplies the
army with military supplies. His wife is a foreign affairs spokesman.<P>

  Election posters plastered on street walls from Zagreb to Split show a
relaxed Tudjman in white jacket and chequered bow tie Croatia proudly claims 
the bow tie as its own invention with the slogan ''the right man in the right 
place at the right time''. Another HDZ poster of a newborn baby in the muscular
arms of a Croatian bodybuilding champion proclaims: ''In the arms of a safe 
future.''<P>

  Tudjman's purpose when he took Croatia out of the Yugoslav federation was a 
strong, consolidated sovereign state. He has achieved that in almost every
sphere without letting the economy go to ruin, despite tens of thousands of
refugees, high military spending and massive dislocation to the country's
infrastructure caused by the war.<P>

  The slaughter in Krajina and the treatment of the hundreds of thousands of
Serbs who had lived there for decades and whose homes have been destroyed to
stop them returning they have fled to Serbia in the war's biggest exodus of
civilians has not cost him sleepless nights.<P>

  He has no intention of letting the Serbs come back in any significant
numbers. After the retaking of Krajina, only about 150,000 urban Serbs remain 
in Croatia in large cities and they, too, are increasingly being pressured as 
the country moves inexorably towards Tudjman's ideal of an ethnically pure 
state.<P>

  Cases have come to light of Serbian families being hounded out of their
apartments and workplaces for no apparent reason other than their ethnic
origins. Next Sunday's elections will just about complete the elimination of
Croatia's Serbs from the political picture.<P>

  There has been condemnation from the UN, but no western leader has yet
spoken out firmly against Croatia's behaviour. The postponement of Croatia's
membership of the Council of Europe and the suspension of some western loans 
are insufficient punishment to deflect Tudjman from his two foreign policy
objectives: the recovery of all Croatia's lost territory and the achievement of
full membership of the European Community.<P>

  Tudjman has succeeded in creating the impression of a multi-party democracy 
in Croatia with all the right constitutional provisions for the protection of
minorities. The fact that these provisions have not been honoured in the case 
of the Croatian Serbs has met with a muted response from the West.<P>

  America and Germany, who have championed the Croatian cause, have only just 
begun to show signs of embarrassment at Croatia's human rights violations. The
Americans are worried that their largely uncritical support of Tudjman may have
created an uncontrollable monster whose ambitions to recover all of Croatia's
lost territory will derail the fragile Bosnian peace process.<P>

  The Germans, having obtained assurances from the Croatian president that he 
would not attempt to take Krajina by force, feel betrayed. Bonn is also worried
about tens of thousands of Serbian refugees from Krajina ending up in Germany,
swelling the ranks of the largest concentration in the world of refugees from
the former Yugoslavia.<P>

  Next Sunday's polls, the second parliamentary elections since Croatia's
Serb-Croat war of independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, will highlight how far
Tudjman falls short of the democratic standards that Europe demands. Croatia,
whose pre-war population was 4.7m, has expanded the ballot to allow 350,000
Croats who live permanently outside Croatia 10% of the seats.<P>

  The small Serbian Independent party is contesting the elections from an
anonymous Zagreb office without a name plate on the door. Its supporters dare
not stick posters in the street for fear of provocation. Milorad Pupavac, a
university professor of philosophy and one of its leaders, said the Serbs
remaining in Croatia were now left with two choices to be assimilated or to
leave.<P>

  He spoke with passion about the ''fence of silence'' the West had erected
around Croatia, whereby it ignores its human rights abuses because it regards
the creation of the Croatian state as a more important political objective than
protecting the people in it.<P>

  ''During the cold war,'' he said, ''the West used human rights as a weapon
to bring down the communist states of eastern Europe. Now that the iron
curtain has been brought down, however, it views the struggle of people for
human rights within Croatia as an embarrassment.''<P>

  Human rights activists warn that the West, in its rush to prevent the
emergence of a Greater Serbia in the former Yugoslavia, is creating conditions
for the establishment of a Greater Croatia equally intransigent, driven by the
same narrow nationalism and likely to be every bit as ethnically intolerant.<P>

<h2> <A NAME="tudjman">Croatian leader Tudjman</a> shrugs off atrocities</h2>

<h5> Fri, 6 Oct 1995</h5>

  	  	
ZAGREB, Croatia (Reuter) - Croatian President Franjo Tudjman Friday shrugged off atrocities blamed on his troops in areas they recently recaptured from Serb rebels, saying their actions were ``inevitable'' in any war.<P>
  
Tudjman admitted civilians were killed and Serb homes looted and torched after ``Operation Storm,'' a Croatian army offensive which overran the Serb-held Krajina region in August.<P>
  
``There was lawlessness following initial liberation, there was looting and robbery, scorching and bombing, even killing,'' Tudjman told a news conference. <P>
 
 But he played down the extent and seriousness of the abuses, which have alarmed the United Nations and Western governments and brought Croatia under international pressure.<P>
  
``It is forgotten that these are unfortunately inevitable occurrences since the beginning of time, during and after every war so far,'' the stone-faced former general said.<P>
  
 Tudjman said his government did everything it could to prevent what he called ``acts of revenge'' by thousands of Croatian refugees who poured back to their homes four years after being driven out by the rebel Serbs.<P>
  
Some 120,000 Croats fled areas Serb rebels seized in the six-month war in 1991, sparked by Croatia's declaration of independence from former Yugoslavia.<P>
  
Tudjman said that so far 24 suspects were in jail in connection with abuses, while investigations had been launched into 611 cases of looting, 27 bombings and seven murders.<P>  
	
 A further 36 killings were being investigated to establish if they occurred during legitimate military operations or not, the president said. <P>
 
He dismissed any suggestion of government complacency, a charge implicit in reports by international bodies who have accused Croatia of doing too little to stop the abuses. <P> 
	
``Croatian authorities neither approve of (crimes) nor sit and watch with complacency, but have undertaken steps. I do not condone any retaliatory act by any Croatian national, Tudjman said.''<P>
  
He also dismissed charges of ethnic cleansing of Serbs from Krajina -- some 150,000 Serbs left Croatia after the recapture of the region.<P>
  
 He said those who applied for Croatian citizenship would be allowed to come back, but there would be no ``mass return.''<P>
  
Tudjman said Croatia was the target of a vicious slander campaign aimed at destabilizing democratic rule and weakening it ahead of peace talks on the Bosnian and Croatian wars as well as looming parliamentary elections. <P>

<h2> <A NAME="UNatrocities">U.N. Notes Croatia Atrocities</a></h2>

<h5> Tue, 3 Oct 1995 </h5>

  	  	
ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) -- Nine elderly Serb civilians were murdered in a village that had been recaptured by the Croatian army, apparently by men in military uniforms, a top U.N. official said Tuesday.<P>
  
Yasushi Akashi, the senior U.N. envoy to former Yugoslavia, said U.N. personnel had ``first-hand evidence'' of the murders, which includes bloodstains, human hair and skin found in the homes of the victims. <P> 

Relatives of the victims, who ranged in age from 66 to 84, discovered the bodies in the village of Varivode on Thursday. Akashi said they reportedly were killed by ``three to four men in uniform.'' <P> 

Croatian police acknowledged the murders on Monday but did not assign blame.<P> 
 
Croatian troops have been accused of atrocities, including 
murder and intimidation of Serbs as well as the systematic destruction of thousands of Serb homes, in Krajina in the months since they retook the region from rebel Serbs. More than 180,000 Serb civilians fled the August offensive; only about 2,500 Serbs are believed to remain in the region.  <P>

Akashi, in a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Zagreb, said that Varivode evidence ``highlights the plight of the few vulnerable, mostly elderly, Serb civilians'' left in the retaken territories. <P>
 
During a visit to Varivode on Sept. 11, U.N. personnel found all 17 Serb inhabitants alive and well. On Monday, the names of nine of the Varivode villagers were noted by U.N. workers on fresh graves in the cemetery in Knin, formerly the Serbs' stronghold about 20 miles northeast of the village. <P> 

During a visit to the village itself on Monday, U.N. officials ``found eight houses spotted with blood,'' said U.N. spokesman Chris Gunness.<P>
  
``Near one house, there was a 15-meter trail of blood. In another (house), blood stains were found on the wall, along with fragments of human hair and skin,'' Gunness said. ``From these fragments, we believe that someone was shot standing in the entrance of the house.''<P> 
 
A report this weekend from the Croatian Helsinki Committee published a list of 12 slain villagers.<P>
  
Nine of the names matched those in the Knin cemetery, Gunness said. One person remained missing, and the other two were reportedly in Knin hospital, but it was unclear why they had been admitted. <P>
 
Two other villagers of the total of 17 were alive and well, while the fates of the other three were unclear, he said. <P>

BYLINE=DOUGLAS ROBERTS<P>

BELGRADE: MORE THAN HALF THE KRAJINA REFUGEES WERE SENT TO THE  VOJVODINA REGION -- A BROAD AGRICULTURAL PLAIN NORTHWEST OF BELGRADE THAT IS HOME TO LARGE NUMBERS OF ETHNIC HUNGARIANS AND CROATS AS WELL AS SERBS.<P>

U-N OFFICIALS HERE SAY AROUND 500 CROATS AND SOME HUNGARIANS WERE EVICTED FROM THEIR HOMES BY THE REFUGEES AND LOCAL SERBS IN THE INITIAL STAGES OF THE INFLUX.<P>

THE EVICTIONS SPARKED PROTESTS BY ETHNIC HUNGARIAN LEADERS IN VOJVODINA, AND A FORMAL DEMARCHE (DIPLOMATIC COMPLAINT) TO BELGRADE FROM THE HUNGARIAN GOVERNMENT.<P>

WHILE SOME CROATS AND HUNGARIANS ARE CONTINUING TO LEAVE VOJVODINA, U-N OFFICIALS SAY THE EVICTIONS APPEAR TO HAVE STOPPED.  IKA TODOROVIC, A LEGAL OFFICER WITH THE U-N HIGH COMMISSIONER FOR REFUGEES HERE, SAYS YUGOSLAV AUTHORITIES HAVE MADE GENUINE EFFORTS TO EASE THE ETHNIC TENSIONS IN VOJVODINA SPARKED BY THE ARRIVAL OF THE REFUGEES.<P>

      <pre>              
         NOW, MORE OR LESS, THINGS HAVE STABILIZED.  AND THE 
         REASON WHY IS BECAUSE THE POLICE HAVE BEEN MORE 
         AGGRESSIVE IN PATROLLING THE STREETS, GOING INTO THE 
         VILLAGES, CREATING MORE OF A PERMANENT PRESENCE THAT 
         THEY ARE THERE TO MONITOR THE SITUATION.  THE OTHER  
         REASON IS IS THAT MOST OF THESE ETHNIC GROUPS, THE 
         MINORITY ETHNIC GROUPS, HAVE ALREADY TAKEN IN REFUGEES.</pre>

                    
U-N OFFICIALS SAY THE IMPROVING SITUATION IN VOJVODINA IS IN SHARP  CONTRAST TO THE ESCALATING TENSIONS IN THE SOUTHERN PROVINCE OF  KOSOVO, WHERE ETHNIC ALBANIANS MAKE UP AROUND 90 PERCENT OF THE POPULATION.<P>

ABOUT 10-THOUSAND OF THE KRAJINA REFUGEES HAVE BEEN SENT TO KOSOVO SO FAR, AND LOCAL SERB AUTHORITIES SAY THAT FIGURE COULD RISE SHARPLY AS BELGRADE MOVES AHEAD WITH ITS PERMANENT RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM.<P>

U-N OFFICIALS, WESTERN DIPLOMATS, AND SERBIAN POLITICAL ANALYSTS HERE SAY THERE IS  NO  DOUBT THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE REFUGEES HAS SEVERELY EXACERBATED AN ALREADY EXPLOSIVE SITUATION IN KOSOVO.  AND THEY SAY THE YUGOSLAV GOVERNMENT HAS DONE  NOTHING  TO EASE THE TENSIONS.<P>

BELGRADE RESCINDED KOSOVO'S STATUS AS AN AUTONOMOUS REGION SIX YEARS AGO.  THERE IS A HEAVY POLICE AND ARMY PRESENCE IN THE PROVINCE AIMED AT CONTROLLING THE LOCAL ALBANIAN POPULATION WHOSE LEADERS SHARPLY OPPOSE BELGRADE'S RULE.<P>

LOCAL LEADERS SAY ELEVEN ETHNIC ALBANIANS HAVE BEEN KILLED BY YUGOSLAV POLICE AND TROOPS THIS YEAR ALONE.  NINE OTHERS WERE GIVEN LENGTHY PRISON SENTENCES LAST MONTH ON CHARGES OF LEADING A SECESSIONIST MOVEMENT.<P>

THE ETHNIC ALBANIAN LEADERSHIP SEES THE KRAJINA REFUGEES AS COLONIZERS, DISPATCHED TO KOSOVO BY A BELGRADE GOVERNMENT INTENT ON ALTERING THE ETHNIC BALANCE OF THE PROVINCE.  YUGOSLAV AUTHORITIES DISMISS THE ALLEGATIONS AS LUDICROUS.  THEY SAY THAT EVEN IF ALL THE KRAJINA REFUGEES WERE SETTLED IN KOSOVO, THERE WOULD STILL BE A LARGE ALBANIAN MAJORITY IN THE PROVINCE.[KOSOVO HAS APPROX. 1.8 MILLION INHABITANTS.  ARRIVAL AND PERMANENT RESETTLEMENT OF , SAY, 50,000 SERB REFUGEES WOULD SHIFT THE BALANCE OF POPULATION FROM PRESENT 90%-10% TO 88%-12%.  EVEN THE PERMANENT RESETTLEMENT OF EVERY SINGLE SERB REFUGEE FROM KRAJINA WOULD SHIFT THE COMPOSITION OF POPULATION TO 83%-17%, MY REMARK]<P>

U-N OFFICIALS ACKNOWLEDGE BELGRADE'S RIGHT TO RESETTLE THE REFUGEES WHERE IT SEES FIT.  BUT THEY HAVE ALSO QUIETLY URGED YUGOSLAV LEADERS TO CONSIDER THE ETHNIC SENSITIVITIES IN KOSOVO.<P>

THE U-N-H-C-R'S IKA TODOROVIC EXPLAINS THE CONCERN.

                     <pre>  // TODOROVIC ACT //

         THE ALBANIANS, THERE IS A SEGMENT OF THEM THAT ARE 
         RADICALIZED.  THESE REFUGEES, THERE COULD BE A SEGMENT 
         -- I AM  NOT  SAYING ALL OF THEM -- BUT A SEGMENT OF 
         THEM COULD BE QUITE RADICALIZED.  YOU PUT THEM TOGETHER 
         IN THE SAME POT, AND YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE AN EXPLOSIVE 
         SOUP.  I THINK THAT IS THE CONCERN.

                          // END ACT //</pre>

BUT BELGRADE HAS GIVEN  NO  SIGN IT IS PREPARED TO ALTER ITS RESETTLEMENT POLICY.  THE GOVERNMENT SAYS IT HAS MORE TO OFFER THE REFUGEES -- INCLUDING LAND, HOUSES, AND JOBS -- IN KOSOVO THAN IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY.<P>

BUT IT IS  NOT  CLEAR HOW MANY OF THE KRAJINA SERBS WILL BE ENTICED BY THE YUGOSLAV OFFER.  U-N OFFICIALS SAY MANY OF THE REFUGEES HAVE PROTESTED OVER .THEIR RESETTLEMENT IN KOSOVO.  SOME EVEN JUMPED OFF TRAINS WHEN TOLD THAT IT WAS THEIR DESTINATION.<P>

MANY ARE STILL TRAUMATIZED BY THEIR FLIGHT FROM KRAJINA, SAYS ONE U-N OFFICIAL, AND THEY HAVE  NO  DESIRE TO GO TO ANOTHER TENSE AND TROUBLED REGION.<P>

<h2><A NAME="EUaccuse"> European Union</a> report accuses Croats of atrocities</h2>

(c) Copyright the News & Observer Publishing Co.<br>
<h4> Associated Press, 9/30/95</h4><p>

   ZAGREB, Croatia -- In some of the most damning criticism yet of Croatia's army, European Union monitors are accusing it of widespread murder, looting and burning in a campaign to drive ethnic Serbs out.<p>

   A copy of their report, obtained by The Associated Press, alleges that Croatia committed "grave breaches of international law" during and after an August military offensive against rebel Serbs.<p>

 ....<P>

   U.N. officials estimate that fewer than 2,500 Croatian Serbs from a pre-August total of 180,000 remain in the Krajina area. Most fled the fighting, many taking refuge in Serb-held areas of Bosnia.<p>

   Serb leaders complain that the West has issued only muted criticism of Croatia's actions after years of routinely condemning Serb atrocities in neighboring Bosnia.<p>

   "The few Serbs who have remained ... have been subjected to a deliberate, hostile policy which included killings, burning of houses, looting of property and various legal obstacles," the report alleges.<p>

   "It looks as if there has been a free-for-all 'take what you can' throughout the conquered land with the consent (albeit tacit) of the highest authorities in Croatia."<p>

   The word "confidential" was stamped on the report, apparently intended only for EU officials. The document was signed by Sanchez Rau of Spain, who heads the EU's military monitoring mission in former Yugoslavia.<p>

   Aides to President Franjo Tudjman refused to comment on the report Friday.<p>

.....<P>

   Tudjman, who has called early elections next month to capitalize on the success of the offensive, previously has dismissed allegations of Croat atrocities.<p>

   However, more than 400 people, including dozens of Croatian police and soldiers, have been arrested on suspicion of looting and torching Serb homes, the United Nations announced Wednesday. No one has yet been arrested on murder charges.<p>

   In addition to "killings of civilians during the actual fighting .... without any military justification," the EU report says monitors found bodies of recently slain Serbs over a month after fighting stopped.<p>

   "Reports of killings are numerous, especially in the Knin area, where at some point newly killed Serbs were found at a rate of six per day," the report states, adding the Serbs were killed by shots to the back of the head or slit throats.<p>

   Knin, located in Croatia's southwestern arm, was the capital of the Serbs' self-declared republic within Croatia. The report said 60 percent of Serb homes were destroyed in the Knin area.<p>

   As late as Sept. 11, the report said, EU monitors in Knin found "two elderly women recently shot through their heads."<p>

   Continuing "grave breaches of international law" by Croatian authorities has encouraged "the disappearance of a sizable and unwanted minority," the EU report said. In one instance, soldiers pistol-whipped an 81-year-old woman and fired shots around her head after placing her up against a wall, it said.<p>

   The number of houses torched will "effectively prevent Serbs from returning home," it said.<p>

   It said some villages were destroyed well after fighting stopped, while a handful of others "have been spared and are used as showcases."<p>

   The report also criticizes new laws apparently intended to make it all but impossible for Serbs who fled to prevent their property from being seized by the state.<p>

   The EU report said it was sometimes dangerous for authorities to try to halt the looting and burning.<p>

   "Firefighters were threatened with death when trying to extinguish some of the burning houses," the report said.<p></FONT>

text:  Dara Plavsic is one of the lucky ones.  It took her only  
three days to cover the 500 kilometers from Krajina to the  
Yugoslav border.  And she knew even before she arrived in this  
small farming town that she would find refuge with the Bursac  
family, her former neighbors in the Krajinan provincial capital,  
Knin.  <P>

Dara Plavsic looks far younger than her 47 years.  But the   
strain is evident on her face, and there is a tightness in her  
voice  as she recalls the trauma of her flight from Krajina.   <P>

She remembers those hours with great precision:  the long day  
spent in the basement of her apartment building, still dressed in
her nightgown, sheltering from the Croatian artillery  
bombardment; the night-long bus ride out of Krajina,  not  even  
knowing her destination.  <P>

The buses finally stopped in the Bosnian Serb stronghold of Banja
Luka, half way to the Yugoslav border, and from there Ms. Plavsic
was able to telephone the Bursac family, her friends here in  
Irig.  <P>

Now, Ms. Plavsic is one of 13 Krajina refugees living with Mr.  
and Mrs. Bursac in a small house on the edge of town.  <P>

Mr. Bursac, a part-time driver at an agricultural cooperative,   
clearly earns barely enough to support his own family, let alone  
the refugees.  But his wife, Andja, says she just thanks god they
reached Irig in safety.  Whatever we have, she says, we will  
share with them, down to the last crumb.  <P>

Dara Plavsic and the other refugees have been given some supplies
-- flour, cooking oil and a few canned goods -- by the Yugoslav  
Red Cross.  But she knows it is  not  sufficient, and she  
suspects Andja Bursac has already dipped into some hidden savings
to ensure there is enough to eat.  <P>

Eighty-one-year-old Dusan Bugic and his friend Ljuban Matut have  
received almost  no supplies since they arrived in Irig from  
Krajina more than a month ago.  We are hungry all the time now,  
they told a visitor, we do  not  even like to talk about food  
anymore.  <P>

The two old men are among a small group of refugees living in a  
shabby workers' dormitory on the outskirts of Irig.  Their one  
room has a small stove for cooking and warmth, but almost nothing
else.  On this day, their only meal is potato soup, the potatos  
plucked from an adjoining farm.  <P>

Mr. Bugic, Mr. Matut and four others in the group came to Irig  
from their village in Krajina on an ageing red tractor, in a now  
infamous convoy through Croatian territory.  <P>

U-N officials had supposedly obtained safe passage for the  
refugees from the Zagreb government.  But their passage was  
anything but safe.  <P>

Mr. Bugic angrily recalls the Croatian civilians who lined the  
roadside as the convoy passed, pelting the Serb refugees with  
stones and other debris.  Once, he says, Croatian police  
intervened to stop the attacks.  But in most cases, he adds, the  
police merely watched and did  nothing.  <P>

Mr. Bugic is old enough to remember the persecution of Serbs,  
Jews and other minorities by the Nazi-installed regime in Croatia
during the second world war.  And he bitterly denounces the  
present Croatian government as  no  better.  <P>

Few if any of the refugees here see any hope of ever going back  
to their homes in Krajina.  And U-N officials in Belgrade confirm
there is little prospect that the Croatian government will allow  
the Serbs to return, even though thousands have already applied.  <P>

But it is equally clear that the Serb refugees face bleak  
prospects in Yugoslavia, where the economy has been crippled by  
years of U-N sanctions.  <P>

They came with  nothing  but the clothes on their backs, and  
there is  no  work for them here, says Irig's refugee  
commissioner Milan Budimcic.  Most, he adds, feel total despair.  <P>

Mr. Budimcic spends his days visiting the refugees scattered  
around the municipality, trying to see to their needs, and asking
them to compile lists of the property they left behind in  
Croatia.  <P>

He displays one of the hand-written documents, just handed in by  
a Krajina farmer.  It lists a house, a barn, a mill, 400 square  
meters of corn and wheat, a tractor, a plow, a sewing machine and
10 barrels of brandy.  <P>

There is little chance the refugees will ever be able to reclaim  
the property, says Mr. Budimcic.  But putting their losses on  
record, he adds, seems to have a calming effect, giving them some
tangible hope and a small psychological boost.   <P>

Mr. Budimcic sums up the feelings of many of the refugees here  
with a Serb proverb:  "There is  no  worse curse than to have,  
and then  not  to have". <P>

text:  In this small farming town an hour's drive from the  
Yugoslav capital, one in four residents is a refugee.<P>

Some have been here for years -- Serbs and even a few Muslims who
fled across the nearby border with Bosnia when the conflict  
erupted there.<P>

Now, they have been joined by Croatian Serbs from Krajina.  And  
it is clear that this latest influx is severely straining Irig's  
ability to cope.<P>

By all accounts, Irig should be a prosperous town.  It lies in  
the heart of the Vojvodina region -- rich farmland that  
traditionally produces wheat, corn, fruits, and vegetables that  
in the past made the area Yugoslavia's breadbasket.<P>

But for more than three years, Irig, like the rest of the  
country, has labored under the weight of sweeping U-N sanctions,  
imposed in response to Belgrade's role in the Balkan conflicts.<P>

Fuel for this region's tractors and other farm equipment is now  
in chronically short supply, and there is little money for  
fertilizer.  Eighty percent of the employees in the area's few  
factories have been placed on compulsory leave.<P>

Irig's deputy mayor, Stevan Radonjic, says the situation would be
bad enough even without the added burden of the growing refugee  
population.<P>
<pre>
 ///  radonjic act in serbian, fade to english translation  ///

         Naturally, after several years of U-N sanctions, we are  
         generally and completely impoverished.  The local  
         economy is completely inactive, also.  And we are all  
         together exhausted, and it is very difficult for us to  
         provide assistance to the people.

                        ///  End act  ///</pre>

Most of the refugees here have been taken in by local families --
a fact that has impressed U-N and relief agency officials who  
also have high praise for the local government's efforts to  
support the refugees.<P>

But a substantial number of the latest arrivals -- the Krajina   
Serbs -- have  not  been so fortunate.  There are fewer host  
families available now.  And many of the new refugees have been  
sent to collective centers.<P>

One group of mainly elderly Serbs from Krajina is living in a  
squalid workers' dormitory on the outskirts of town -- their only
possession, the aging red tractor that brought them here five  
weeks ago.<P>

U-N and local officials say as many as 300 of the latest refugees
have received almost  no  assistance since they arrived here.<P>

Many are in total despair, says Irig's refugee commissioner,  
Milan Budimcic.  But they are  not  complaining, he adds, because
they realize we have nothing more to offer.<P>

Deputy mayor Radonjic says the situation can only get worse with  
the approach of winter.<P>
<pre>
 ///  radonjic act in serbian, fade to english translation  ///

         Now we are looking at the winter coming.  The school  
         year began.  We are looking at problems of  
         transportation of children to school and back.  We are  
         looking at problems of heating schools, houses,  
         everything.  Everybody's reserves are just simply  
         depleted.  And these people are poor now, and it is  
         going to be extremely difficult.

                        ///  End act  ///</pre>

Mr. Radonjic says an average of 10 people visit the mayor's  
office each day to appeal for help, some asking for  no  more  
than a few sticks of firewood.  He recalled one old man, a  
retired clerk, who came in tears, trying to sell a second-hand  
typewriter to get money to support himself and the seven refugees
who now live in his home.<P>

U-N officials say more than 170-thousand Krajina Serbs crossed  
into Yugoslavia during last month's mass exodus.  They are now  
scattered throughout the country, with more than half in the  
Vojvodina region.<P>

The Belgrade government says it has literally emptied its food  
warehouses to support the new arrivals.<P>

Two weeks ago, senior Yugoslav envoys won a pledge of some  
additional assistance in talks with U-N and relief agency  
officials in Geneva.  The U-N refugee agency has doubled its  
budget for Yugoslavia, with  half the additional funds earmarked  
to renovate and heat collective centers for the Krajina refugees.<P>

But both U-N and Yugoslav officials question whether the new  
funds will be sufficient.  They point out that upwards of  
100-thousand Bosnian Serbs have been forced to flee their homes  
over the past few weeks in the face of attacks by Muslim and  
Croat forces.  And there is acute concern in Belgrade that these  
refugees also could seek asylum in Yugoslavia.<P>


One U-N official here says he does  not  even want to contemplate
that prospect.  We are already overstretched, he says, and so is  
the Yugoslav government.  <P>

   KRNJACA,  Yugoslavia: ''They have stripped the soul from my hometown, but they cannot take my soul 
away from me.'' With those words, Jadranka Knezevic, 42, lives through days no  soul would want to endure -- the kind that finish exactly as they begin, with   
many worries and little hope.<P>                                                                                                                                                                                                          
   Knezevic is a Serb born and raised in Sarajevo, Bosnia-Herzegovina, before   
the bloody war tore the once-proud city and its people to pieces. She and       
daughter Tijana, now 12, fled only days before the fighting began. They have    
been here, a few miles outside the capital city of Belgrade, for almost two     
years.<P>                                                                          
                                                                                
   The days here at the PIM refugee camp, one of the worst in the country, don't
vary much. This is one of them: <P>                                                
                                                                                
   6:30 a.m. -- Time for Jadranka to wake up and walk Tijana up the narrow,     
cracked cement road that leads from the camp to the highway, where she takes a  
bus to a school in Belgrade. ''I used to be afraid to send her to school because
I was worried how children would treat her as a refugee,'' the mother says.     
''Not so much anymore. She is a tough girl.''<P>                                   
                                                                                
   Almost everyone at the camp rises with the sun, some to head into town on    
temporary jobs, most simply out of habit. Many are villagers accustomed to      
working on their land at the crack of dawn. But their land is lost, and there is
little work here. Most just stay in their rooms.<P>                                
                                                                                
   6:50 a.m. -- Jadranka isn't good at being idle. She had been working at a    
nearby food factory, similar to the one that employed her in Sarajevo, but had  
realized her stamina was slipping. ''I have been getting sick a lot lately,''   
she says. ''There is always food here, but it is not very good.''<P>               
                                                                                
   She points to the corner of their room, no bigger than most folks' closet. A 
bunk bed takes up most of the space. There also is a small table in one corner  
next to a tiny refrigerator. About six square feet are left over.<P>               
                                                                                
   Behind the refrigerator, under a dusty sheet of plastic wrap, are three      
layers of eggs and apples. ''I always try to keep something back here when I can
get it. It is good to be able to offer something good once in a while.'' Talk of
food reminds her that it's time for breakfast. <P>                                 
                                                                                
   7:10 a.m. -- She says the first meal varies daily and that today's -- bread  
served with a popular meat paste -- is better than the norm. Breakfast is served
at the camp's classroom-sized cafeteria over a three-hour period to ensure there
is enough room and time for all 580 refugees to eat. <P>                           
                                                                                
   7:30 a.m. -- Jadranka goes outside to wash clothes by hand. Pouring detergent
and water into a large white bowl, she rubs the fabric together before pinning  
each garment on a clothesline to dry in the hot sun. ''I was never really very  
good at this kind of thing before the war,'' she says, seemingly embarrassed by 
her efficiency. <P>                                                                

                                                                                
   8:15 a.m. -- Jadranka sinks back to reality, performing the one activity she 
most despises but says is her most common: Doing nothing. ''I cross my legs,    
smoke a cigarette and look out the window. This is terrible ... . But I can tell
you I have become good at this, throwing away the day.'' She turns to watch the 
clothes dry. <P>                                                                   
                                                                                
   8:45 a.m. -- An older woman hanging her own clothes outside Jadranka's window
notices an American reporter. It's the closest the woman has been to the enemy. 
She becomes incensed. ''How can you people drop your bombs on us?'' she yells,  
still continuing her work. ''You are all responsible for this, how we are, how  
our children are.'' Jadranka doesn't flinch. With a flick of her cigarette, she 
expresses her disdain for such talk. ''It is one reason I do not like to talk to
some refugees much. It is usually not very nice. They are very negative. I am   
also angry, but I prefer to look forward.''<P>                                     
                                                                                
   9:30 a.m. -- She gazes around the room for remnants of her former life, and  
finds a photo album. There is one of her and Tijana on vacation at the beach in 
1990, laughing and playing, wearing clothes she now considers extravagant. A    
tear streams down her left cheek. ''What a life we had ... . I'm 42 and I have  
to start over again. I feel like somebody threw me right out of my shoes. I     
lived a normal life in Sarajevo. There is nowhere else I would rather live than 
in that city.'' She pauses. ''The way it was, of course. Not now.'' <P>            

   10:20 a.m. -- There is a knock at the door, unusual only because most camp   
dwellers simply enter each other's rooms unannounced. Jadranka jumps. It's the  
camp director with a letter from San Francisco. Jadranka knows immediately it's 
from her sister. She opens it to find $ 100 in cash along with a note. ''My     
sister wants me to use the money to buy books for myself.'' She points to a     
well-worn Harold Robbins paperback and to a 3-by-4 shelf holding about 20       
novels, most of them American mysteries. ''I love to read, and so does Tijana. I
can get the books at the library, or trade the ones I have to other people      
here.'' She runs outside to show the neighbors her letter.<P>                      
                                                                                
   11 a.m. -- She's already got it all figured out. On a napkin, she writes out 
how she will spend the $ 100. She will buy one pair of pants, one set of pajamas
and one shirt each for herself and Tijana, who also will get new shoes. What    
about the books? ''All of this will cost only $ 40, but I must save the rest for
winter. The books I can keep getting how I am getting them now. I will manage.''
She says she doesn't need much to get by. She recalls how much she packed when  
fleeing Sarajevo: ''My photo album, two shirts, two pants, some underwear and   
three records.'' Records? She grins. ''I just couldn't live without them.''<P>     
                                                                                
   Noon -- It's lunchtime. Today's special: Bean soup. Tomorrow's special: Bean 
soup. The day after that ... ''It changes everyday,'' Jadranka says, holding up 
a bowl and laughing. ''Sometimes it is not very good and sometimes it is very   
bad. Sometimes we get meat in it. Those are good days.''<P>                        
                                                                                
   12:15 p.m. -- The happiest moment of the day is always when Tijana arrives   
from school. Tijana, big blue eyes bulging from her smiling face, wraps her arms
around her mother from behind and eyes the food. ''It is all the same to her,'' 
Jadranka says, looking down at the bean soup. ''She just loves to eat. She is   
going through puberty and takes down twice as much as I do.'' Tijana says       
nothing while gulping the soup.<P>                                                 
                                                                                
   1:30 p.m. -- Jadranka continues reading her Harold Robbins novel but lasts   
only 15 minutes before falling asleep. Tijana, meanwhile, cuts out a picture of 
American pop singer Sheryl Crow, and pastes it onto the wall next to her bed on 
the upper bunk. After placing it neatly next to a Beverly Hills 90210 sticker,  
she utters her first words of the afternoon. ''Crash Test Dummies!''<P>            
                                                                                
   She leaps down to the floor to adjust the antenna on the tiny transistor     
radio. After turning up the volume on one of her favorite hits, she shyly       
explains, ''I like them,'' in English, which she is learning in school. Tijana  
takes pride in being hip. She rattles off names of a few other pop groups and   
movie stars. Although she hasn't seen many films and owns no cassette tapes, she
collects magazines that other students no longer want. And she listens to the   
radio with a precise ear. ''I want to live in America,'' she says. ''They have  everything.'' Before long, Tijana, too, dozes off for her afternoon nap. <P>       
                                                                                
   4 p.m. -- Tijana is outside playing with other children at the side of one of
the 12 long, single-floor buildings that make up this unsightly compound. Most  
children play by jumping on each other or by simply running around. Tijana      
seldom gets involved much anymore. ''She thinks she is getting to be too        
grown-up,'' her mother moans. ''It is tough for her when the children are always
sick and some even die here. I am afraid all of this will leave a permanent mark
on her, a scar that will never heal.''<P>                                          
                                                                                
   6 p.m. -- Dinner is the biggest meal of the day, something uncommon in this  
country. Tonight, it is spaghetti without tomato sauce -- ''or something like   
that,'' Jadranka says, eying the pasta quizically.<P>                              
                                                                                
   7 p.m. -- Tijana studies while her mother prepares for a rare evening out.   
She and a few friends have decided to walk to a nearby cafe. It will cost them  
less than 20 cents to buy something to drink and enjoy some company in a        
slightly more pleasant setting. Things turn sour, however, as they often do in  
these gatherings. <P>                                                              
                                                                                
   One old Serbian woman begins screeching about the recent NATO bombings over  
Bosnia. Everyone chimes in simultaneously, except Jadranka, who turns to        explain: ''How can you blame them for their anger? Each of these people has     
someone there right now, as do I with my brother. My mother and sister are still
trapped in a Muslim section of Sarajevo.''<P>                                      
                                                                                 
   9 p.m. -- Another day is over, and the future is no clearer for Jadranka and 
Tijana Knezevic. There is talk the camp will be moving some refugees to other   
parts of Yugoslavia in the next month or two. That would mean yet another school
for Tijana, another uprooting for both. Before the lights go out, Jadranka runs 
her hand gently through Tijana's long, brown hair. ''This is very difficult for 
her. She is so smart and remembers everything. That frightens me more than      
anything.''<P>                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                                </FONT>

<h2>by Dejan Kovacevic, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette,  September 10, 1995, Sunday</h2>

<em> Copyright 1995 P.G. Publishing Co.</em> <P>                                                                                                                                                                                                
 KRNJACA,  Yugoslavia :  As Snezana Jenosevic and her family were fleeing the fighting in the western 
Slavonija portion of Croatia in 1991, they barely had time to grab any          
belongings.<P>                                                                     
                                                                                
   ''Actually, I carried a little bit more than most,'' she recalls now,        
smiling. ''I had a full stomach.'' In addition to carrying a baby, she had      plenty of other baggage. She also took with her the burden of being a Croat     
heading to enemy Serbian territory for asylum.<P>                                  
                                                                                
   ''I knew what I was doing,'' says Jenosevic, 28. ''I knew that this was the  
only way I could keep myself and my family together.'' She cites two reasons    
that all her roads pointed to Serb-led Yugoslavia: She had breast cancer and    
believed she could receive the best treatment in Belgrade, Yugoslavia's capital.
And four months before the war broke out, she had married Dragan Jenosevic, a   
Serb.<P>                                                                           
                                                                                
   Today, they are still together, here along with about 580 other refugees at  
the PIM camp a few miles outside Belgrade. They have been here two years, their 
daughter will soon turn 4 and, after two operations, Snezana's breast cancer is 
in remission. But her left arm has swollen to almost twice its normal size, and 
she still hasn't received a medical explanation.<P>                                
                                                                                
   And other uncertainties are worrying her. She isn't sure how she will be     
received by the Serbian community when she and her family are no longer         
refugees. Serbs and Croats speak the same language, but Snezana's Croatian      
accent is thick. She knows she will not be able to disguise her nationality.    
''Here at the camp, there are no problems. But how can I know what will be?''<P>   

   The tension is evident at this camp. The directors say there are 10 Croats   
here, but the Post-Gazette was repeatedly denied access to them. Each time, a   
different reason was given, the most common being that the Croats were too      
afraid of their surroundings to talk to reporters. Jenosevic laughed at that.   
''I am afraid of many things, but journalists are not among them.'' She also    
isn't fearful for the future of her marriage.<P>                                   
                                                                                
   Dragan and Snezana were wed in the Croatian town of Darvar. Their honeymoon  
was cut short when Serbs and Croats battled in that region for months. Croats   
eventually gained control of the territory. ''Nobody ever thought it would come 
to this,'' Snezana says. ''When we first came here, we thought this fighting    
would last for 14 days, and we would go home and pick up our lives again. That  
can never happen now. <P>                                                          
                                                                                
   ''When we lived in Slavonija, there were no problems with a Serb marrying a  
Croat. But if we were to go back there now, there would be problems.'' All of   
Snezana's family is still there, with one notable exception. Her brother,       
Tihomir, 32, is fighting Serbs in Sarajevo on the Croat-Muslim side. She says   
she has managed some contact with her parents, but none with her brother.       
Meanwhile, she knows she must resume her life in an environment where she might 
feel like a stranger for many years. <P>

 BELGRADE, Yugoslavia : Ranko Nenadic was numb by the time he reached the train station in this      
capital city. Exhausted from 10 days of grueling travel across                  
Bosnia-Herzegovina and suffocated by the suffering on all sides, he was barely  
aware of the whimpers and moans of the humanity sprawled over nearly every      
concrete inch of the old place.<P> 

    Until he heard a voice.<P>                                                       
                                                                                
   ''Ranko!'' someone cried.<P>                                                     
                                                                                
   He didn't dare turn his head and raise his hopes. It couldn't be. <P>            
                                                                                
   ''Ranko!'' the scream came again.<P>                                             
                                                                                
   This time he turned to face reality -- and his family, which he thought he'd 
lost forever. His wife and four children ran to him and embraced as they'd never
done before.<P>                                                                     
                                                                                
   Only 11 days earlier, while he was away from his home in Knin, the capital of
Serbian Krajina, a whirlwind Croatian attack triggered the largest exodus of    
refugees in Europe since World War II. <P>                                          
                                                                                
   Among them was Nenadic's family. With husband and father gone and no time to 
take any possessions, they climbed onto a neighbor's tractor to join the long   
convoy toward Yugoslavia. Ranko returned to town later that day, found the      
devastation and an empty home, grabbed his gun and set out on the same 350-mile 
journey.<P>                                                                         

   ''Sometimes by car,'' he said, ''sometimes by foot, tractor, whatever there  
was.''<P>                                                                           
                                                                                
   At each stop, he cried their names in vain. <P>                                  
                                                                                
   ''There was one place where the Croatians in the hills were playing a        
cassette tape of a child crying out for its mother. It was very painful for some
people. Many people ran to it.''<P>                                                 
                                                                                
   The United Nations High Commission on Refugees estimates the refugee movement
in the past month at about 300,000. Some settled in the Serb-dominated town of  
Banja Luka in Bosnia, but most made the long trek to Yugoslavia. Many are here, 
in the nation's capital, but most were sent north to the food-rich Vojvodina    
province. A handful also was dispatched to the Albanian-dominated southern      
province of Kosovo. <P>                                                             
                                                                                
   The camp in  Krnjaca,  six miles outside Belgrade, has cared for most of the 
refugees to enter the capital since the former Yugoslavia began to crumble in   
1991. Most of its workers have been there since the beginning. You can see it by
watching them even if only for a few minutes. They seldom smile, always whisper 
and seem to know at least a little bit about each one of the 580 refugees in    
camp, even though few stay very long. <P>  

  They take special pride in giving equal treatment to Croats and Muslims --   
the Serbs' enemies in the Bosnian war -- as they do to their own. <P>               
                                                                                
   ''We're not interested at all where anybody's from,'' said one refugee who   
has been there more than a year and regularly helps the staff. ''We're all      
together once we get here.'' <P>                                                    
                                                                                
   But there is little the workers can do. The refugees are crammed into rooms  
that make college dorms look spacious, eat one meal a day and are treated at a  
one-bed medical facility which ''doesn't even have a bandage,'' says Andjelka   
Petrovic, one of three doctors on duty. <P>                                         
                                                                               
   The long, indistinguishable one-story buildings line up in two rows that make
the place look more like a Rent-a-Space facility than a refugee camp. That is,  
until you see the children's tattered socks and shoes, the refuse that oozes    
past each front door in an open-air canal, the bedsheets that stick to your legs
when you get up ... and the despair. <P>                                            
                                                                                
   There is no other word to describe the look on the chiseled face of Vukosava 
Ognjenovic, 65, who sat silently for 15 minutes while her son, Zoran, 41, was   
interviewed for this story. While her son spoke of his daughter's diabetic      
condition and his family's escape from Knin, Vukosava slowly began to weep.<P>                                                                                      
When the child, in Zoran's arms, also began to cry, Zoran excused himself and   
took her for a walk outside. <P>                                                    
                                                                                
   Vukosava, the customary Serbian scarf around her head and dressed all in     
black, finally began to speak of the long journey, by horse, cattle, tractor,   
and cars. She spoke of warplanes buzzing the convoy with bullets and watching   
people die. But she did not speak of the day of the attack on Knin. She couldn't
have. She wasn't there. And the guilt was crushing her.  <P>                        
                                                                                
   ''She doesn't know where her husband is,'' said Zoran, returning with his    
daughter and seeing Vukosava in tears. ''We've been looking everywhere, but when
we are all lost, where can you look?''<P>                                           
                                                                                
   Vukosava held her thumb and forefinger to her forehead, as if ashamed of what
was revealed. ''I was spending the night in a village outside Knin. I didn't    
know what was happening.'' <P>                                                      
                                                                                
   Like the Nenadic family and so many others, the question these refugees most 
disliked was the most obvious one: ''Where will you go now?'' <P>                   
                                                                                
   Zoran Ognjenovic gave an equally obvious answer: ''We will just go to        
wherever we can find the man we're looking for.''                                                                                                               <P> 
   And Ranko Nenadic, who already has found his family? He shrugged. <P>            
                                                                                
   ''I don't know. That house that we lived in once belonged to my grandfather's
grandfather. So many years you cannot imagine. Where can we go?''<P>

IOCC is one of a few international humanitarian organizations which have provided assistance on the Serb side of the front throughout the war.  Although most of the people whose stories are presented here are refugees and ethnic Serbs, IOCC helps all victims of the war and poverty regardless of their religion and ethnicity, as the book clearly shows.  The proceeds from the sale of the book will be used to help the refugees in the former Yugoslavia.

"How soon can you move to Belgrade?" the confident British voice asked as if he already knew the answer.  "Two weeks," I heard myself respond.<P>

Glancing through ny journal more than two years ago I am humbly reminded of how little I really knew or understood about the former Yugoslavia.  I knew there was a war, but did not know that so many people of so many different ethnic backgeounds were suffering.<P>

Now, I have traveled thousands of kilometers by car through most of the regions of the former yugoslavia.  I have seen the beauty of the coasts, the fields, the mountains, the waterfalls, and of the people who live there.  Travelling in and out of war zones and frontlines, I have also seen destruction, the pain, and the sorrow war brings along with it.<P>

And I still don't really understand what is happening nor can I say how will it end.<P>

These stories are not an attempt to explain what is happening in the former Yugoslavia.  This is not a report on how many tons of food IOCC has delivered of how many millons of dollars of medical aid we have provided.  It is an attempt - albeit a necessarily subjective one - to tell the stories of some of the people who are suffering in this war.<P>

The stories and faces represent the individuals IOCC has assisted during 1994.  Whether they are Serbs, Muslims, Hungarians, Croats, Gypsies; whetehr they are refugees of locals who had been hard-hit by economic disintegration; all of them feel pain, despair, loneliness or hunger.<P>

TEXT: <A NAME="uncrocrimes"> THE CHICKENS, PIGS, </a>AND CATTLE THAT WERE  NOT  SHOT WHEN THE VILLAGE OF GRUBORI WAS ATTACKED AND SET ON FIRE TWO WEEKS  
AGO, NOW WANDER AROUND THE SMOLDERING REMAINS OF THE HOUSES AND  
BARNS.<P>

INSIDE ONE OF THE FEW UNDAMAGED HOMES, PLATES OF UNEATEN FOOD SIT
ON THE KITCHEN TABLE, LEFT BEHIND BY THE HANDFUL OF TERRIFIED  
SURVIVORS WHO ARE NOW UNDER THE PROTECTION OF THE UNITED NATIONS.<P>

U-N SPOKESMAN ALUN ROBERTS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST PEOPLE TO ARRIVE  
AT THE SCENE OF THE AUGUST 25TH INCIDENT.<P>

        <pre>                // ROBERTS ACT //

         THE WHOLE VILLAGE WAS ALIGHT.  THREE OLD WOMEN WERE  
         STILL HERE, OR HAD JUST COME BACK TO THE VILLAGE, TOOK  
         US AROUND ALL THE BUILDINGS WHICH WERE BURNING.  CATTLE  
         WERE INSIDE THEM.  THERE WAS FOUR OR FIVE DEAD PIGS,  
         SHOT DEAD.  LATER WHEN WE CAME BACK IN THE EVENING TO  
         SEE HOW THEY WERE, THEY SHOWED US THE BODIES OF THE  
         PEOPLE, ONE WAS THE BODY OF AN ELDERLY MAN IN A ROOM.   
         THE HOUSE WAS A LITTLE BIT BURNED.  HE WAS IN HIS  
         PAJAMAS BY HIS BED, LYING IN A POOL OF BLOOD.  U-N  
         CIVILIAN POLICE CHECKED THE BODY WITH A U-N HUMAN RIGHTS
         TEAM.  HE HAD BEEN SHOT BEHIND THE EAR, HOLE THROUGH THE
         THROAT.  A LITTLE WAY ALONG THE LANE THERE WAS ANOTHER  
         HOUSE WITH A BODY ON THE FLOOR.  WE COULDN'T BE SURE  
         WHAT IT WAS.  THE GENTLEMAN WHO WAS AT A MEETING WITH US
         ACROSS THE VALLEY SAID HE HAD BROUGHT HIM IN IN THE  
         AFTERNOON WHILE WE WERE AWAY AND HE TURNED HIM OVER AND  
         IT WAS REALLY DISTURBING, HIS WHOLE THROAT HAD BEEN CUT  
         COMPLETELY IN TWO.

                          // END ACT //</pre><P>

HE SAID THAT THE FOLLOWING DAY, U-N CIVILIAN POLICE RETURNED TO  
THE VILLAGE AND WERE SHOWN THE BODIES OF TWO OTHER ELDERLY SERB  
VILLAGERS WHO HAD BEEN FOUND SHOT IN THE HEAD AT CLOSE RANGE.   
INSIDE A GUTTED HOUSE, THEY SAW THE REMAINS OF A 90-YEAR-OLD  
WOMAN.<P>

THE CROATIAN MILITARY COMMANDER FOR THE REGION, GENERAL IVAN  
CERMAK, HAS EXPRESSED REGRET FOR THE CIVILIAN CASUALTIES, SAYING  
THEY WERE KILLED ACCIDENTALLY WHEN CROATIAN TROOPS CAME UNDER  
FIRE DURING MOPING UP OPERATIONS AGAINST WHAT HE CALLED ENEMY  
RAIDERS AND TERRORISTS.<P>

U-N OFFICIALS SAY THE KILLINGS APPEAR TO BE PART OF A PATTERN OF  
HARASSMENT AND REVENGE AIMED AT DRIVING THE REMAINING SERBS OUT  
OF THE COUNTRY.  CROATIAN OFFICIALS IN ZAGREB DENY THIS, BUT THEY
EXPRESSED LITTLE SYMPATHY FOR THE SERBS.<P>

// OPT //  CROAT GOVERNMENT SPOKESWOMAN VESNA SKARE OZBOLT SAYS

   <h2>Updated Situational Report on Former Sector North</h2>


[Zagreb, 6-9-95]<P>

On Monday 4 September Otvorene Oci undertook at trip through former 
Sector North to Vojnic to ascertain the situation of sixteen displaced Serbs.<P>

<h3>Petrinja, Glina</h3>

	We traveled via Sisak to Petrinja and Glina where there are more 
and more signs that life is returning to these areas.  Shops are beginning to 
open and generally there are more people around, although the vast majority 
are still police and soldiers......  Looting is still continuing not only by civilians but by HV troops as well, as was witnessed in the area around Glina.  Some arrivals are removing the possessions of houses and burning them in the street as they move in.<P> 

	On the road from Glina to Topusko we were met with the strange 
sight of a line of "RSK" military uniforms and gear along the side of the 
road.  Every half meter was a pile of military gear, as if the Serb soldiers 
had disrobed while standing in formation on the side of the road.  However, 
we could not determine if this had been the case, and further investigation 
will be necessary to determine what had happened at this site.<P>

<h3>Topusko to Vojnic</h3>

	We traveled to Vojnic via Topusko, and south to Stara Selo along 
the road which runs close to the Bosnian border.....  Every few kilometers or so were military posts, but we were not stopped again.  Many of the houses in this area have been destroyed by fire in recent weeks. We observed a couple of burnt barns with dead horses and cows in the stalls.<P>

<h3>Vojnic Refugee Camp</h3>

	To visit the sixteen displaced Serb persons we had come to see we 
had to pass through the "refugee camp" at Vonjic.  For the past three weeks 
over 25,000 people (25,000 officially registered plus an unknown number 
of unregistered persons) from the Velika Kladusa and Cazin areas have 
been living along an 7 km stretch of road.  They are, according to UN 
reports, predominantly Bosnian Muslims who were loyal to Fikret Abdic.  
(However, the mayor of Velika Kladusa reported to UN representatives that 
only 20% of the people in the camp are Abdic followers, and that they are 
preventing the others from returning to the Bihac area)  The recent 
offensive resulted in their displacement.  When they first arrived they did 
not want to return to the Bihac area unless some security conditions could 
be reached, specifically, a zone of separation from 5th Corps, monitored by 
international organizations.  Refugees interviewed by UN HRAT reported 
mistreatment by 5th Corps before they left the area, including beatings, 
threats and sexual abuse.  The latest reports coming in from the UN are that 
the refugees do not wish to return to Western Bosnian at all and that they 
wish to be protected by Croatian Authorities in accordance with 
international standards.  Croatia, however, refuses to recognize these people 
as refugees.<P>
	On the 12th of August, according to a UN report, Zagreb and 
Sarajevo came to an agreement whereby all ex-combatants had the option to 
either join the HV; the ABiH; or to return to Velika Kladusa as civilians In 
the camp there are many military aged men, and they fear conscription into 
the Bosnian army.<P>
	We were stopped by Croatian military before entering the camp, as 
there are checkpoints at the two entrances.  They did not seem at all 
bothered by our presence, and they allowed us access to the camp.  We 
were told to be very careful as tensions were high and that violence could be 
expected. "Drive through, don't stop, and keep your windows up."  
However, we experienced no problems and did not feel threatened.<P>
	The camp is situated in a valley, the bottom of which is not very 
wide.  Most people live either beside the road or on the bottoms of the 
slopes. Temporary shelters have been or are in the process of being built by 
the refugees, who scavenge the material from the surrounding forest and 
burnt out houses.  All the houses  along the road are also completely 
occupied.  UN water tanks are situated every couple of kilometers.  
However, according to an Oxfam report, this water supply is insufficient, so 
people are taking water from the streams.  The overall conditions are 
appalling, and the recent bad weather has reduced much of the area to a 
quagmire. International organizations are operating in the area- UNHCR 
have a couple of tents, ICRC and MSF have also established a presence.<P>

<h3>Displaced Serbs</h3>

	The initial intention of our visit was to check on a group of 16 
displaced Serbs who wish to return to their homes but are waiting for the 
correct papers and transport which will give them access to their homes, 
which are situated on the opposite side of the refugee camp in villages near 
Velika Kladusa on the Croatian side of the river.  Initially, they were in 
Sisak and the Croatian army asked them if they would like to return to their 
homes.  Transport was arranged, but instead of being returned to their 
homes they were dropped off on the road north of the refugee camp.  An 
elderly woman who lives nearby took them in.  However, her house is in a 
poor state, and subsequently their living conditions are sub-human.  Most of 
the people in the house are elderly and ill, all are in need of medical 
attention, and two of the party are younger and mentally impaired.  They  
also have very little food.  Oxfam have taken on this case and are arranging 
for medical care to be provided.<P>

 
<h2>Possible return of Krajina Serb Population?</h2>
 
[Split, 29-08-95]<p>
 
Otvorene Oci has visited Knin and former sector South 4 times
so far and has spoken to representatives of the Croatian
authorities, UNHCR, the refugees within the UN compound and
the local population. The team returned yesterday from another
visit to Knin and surroundings...... <P>
 
 The possible return of the Krajina Serb population to their
homeland is getting less likely by the day. Three weeks after
the start of the Croatian military operation "Storm", Serb
houses are still being looted and burned down, some of their
inhabitants are still being killed and more Serbs seek refuge
in the UN compound for obvious safety reasons.<P>
 
On Friday, August 26, UN representatives saw the village of
Grubori burning and UN Television recorded the event. The
pictures were later televised by the BBC. Later the UN
representatives returned and found the bodies of 5 old Serbs,
shot in the head from short range. One of them was lying face
down next to his bed in his pyjamas.<P>
 
The representative of a UN "Human Rights Action Team", Mr.
E.J. Flynn, states that there is no security basis for the
remaining Serb population. So far 25 to 30 dead bodies have
been found in the area.<P>
 
A refugee himself and now working in the `refugee-hospital'
within the UN compound, Dr. Torbica, states that every day 10
to 15 new people arrive at the gates of the compound to seek
refuge for security reasons. He mentions a refugee couple who
decided to stay in the Krajina, left the UN compound and
returned to their homes. Soon after they returned to the
compound because they were beaten up. During the last Otvorene
Oci visit the team was told that 56 of the refugees in the
compound wanted to remain in the Krajina, according to Dr.
Torbica this number of people is now down to 30.<P>
 
 
The UNHCR protection officer Mr. B. Otim states that the
authorities have so far not undertaken any action to prevent
the atrocities. E.J. Flynn reported that the local authorities
were attributing the burning of houses to "unknown elements"
in uniform and to electrical faults within those houses
concerned. During a visit with the Dalmatian Committee of
Solidarity (DOS) to the representative of the Croatian
authorities in Knin, Mr. P. Pasic, the DOS members tried to
convince Mr. Pasic to motivate the refugees in the UN compound
to stay instead of leaving for Beograd. He was not prepared to
do that.<P>

<h2> <A NAME="tudjman">Tudjman</a> triumphant but reconquered land is empty</h2>
<h5>Sun, 27 Aug 95 4:30:08 PDT, Reuter</h5>

	 SPLIT, Croatia, Aug 27 (Reuter) - It was Croatia's ``Freedom
Train,'' showering national glory on its pre-eminent passenger,
President Franjo Tudjman -- but the reconquered territory he
passed through was a wasteland and he admitted as much......<P>

	 Tudjman's journey through the vanquished rebel heartland was
covered the entire way by state television, reflecting his
authoritarian cult of personality.<P>
	 His penchant for nationalist rhetoric, with crude touches,
was on display and the crowds, savouring the fall of Serbs
blamed for every indignity suffered by Croats under Yugoslav
royal and then communist rule, loved it.<P>
	 ``On this day we can say Croatia stopped bearing its
historical cross. This is not just the liberation of land but
the creation of a foundation for a free and independent Croatia
for centuries to come,'' he said.<P>
	 ``The Serbs just vanished from this area as if they never
lived here at all,'' Tudjman said of the 150,000 who fled his
``Operation Storm'' blitz over U.N. truce lines. Croatian troops
found most towns deserted when they entered.<P>
	 ``They didn't even have time to collect their dirty currency
and their dirty underwear!'' he shouted to 100,000 faithful in
the Adriatic port of Split, the train's destination.<P>
	 But Tudjman acknowledged during his train tour that
Operation Storm was not an unalloyed success.<P>
	 He decried looting and burning of Serb homes by Croats, a
rampage said by diplomats to have hardened European Union
sentiment against resuming association talks with Zagreb.<P>
	 Tudjman also said Croatia had inherited a vast amount of
land but without people to rebuild and make it productive.<P>
	 Resettling Croat refugees from Krajina would not be enough
because much of the region had a Serb majority.<P>
	 So Tudjman launched an appeal to Croat expatriates
worldwide, many of whom emigrated after the post-1945 Yugoslav
Communist takeover, to return and help resuscitate Krajina.<P>
	 ``Now is the time...for Croats on all continents -- from
distant Chile, Argentina and Paraguay, from Canada and the USA
to Australia and New Zealand -- to return to the deserted,
liberated areas. We will offer them land and farms,'' he said.<P>
	 ``Half the Croat people live abroad. The future of our
country hinges on the number of people we have. We did not
liberate Croatia to gain empty lands without Croats.''<P>
	 Tudjman, always tuned to Western opinion, said Serbs could
come back too if they accepted Croatian state authority. But no
one believes they will, especially after the wave of arson and
pillaging that Croatian police did little to stop.<P>
	 But diplomats believe EU outrage will blow over eventually.
	 Zagreb's key backers, the Germans and Americans who see
Croatia as a counterweight to Serb nationalism that ignited the
Yugoslav wars in the 1990s, accepted Operation Storm with only
muted criticism for the human suffering it caused........<P>

<h2><A NAME="crohomes">CROATS DISCOVER</a> SADNESS OF FINDING HOMES</h2>

<h5>By RAYMOND BONNERc. 8/27/1995 New York Times News Service</h5>

   DONJI HRASTOVAC, Croatia  If this were upstate New York, or
western Connecticut, it is easy to imagine the ad: quaint,
two-bedroom house, with attic in quiet rural setting one hour from
the capital; needs work; large orchard.<p>
   Vera and Zoran Pranic, and another couple, stopped to look at
it. Then, in their small white Yugo, the couples, in their 30s,
moved on to examine other available houses in the area. Another
couple, Anton and Mira Homa, looked for a house that would be near
a school for their two boys.<P>
   Down the road, the Kolar brothers found houses they liked across
the road from each other. One has several sheds, with farm animals
in them; the other is modern, two stories with a small swimming
pool, in a narrow, deep orchard.<P>
   But all this real estate activity was marked by sadness, not the
joy and excitement that usually accompanies finding a new home.
   The Pranics, the Homas and the Kolars are refugees  Croats
thrown out of Banja Luka in Bosnia. And they, along with several
thousand other Croat refugees, are moving into houses that belonged
to Serbs until they were driven from Croatia earlier this month
when the Croatian army took the Krajina region from rebel Serbs.<P>
   The house hunting is a period  if not an exclamation point  on
another chapter of the Balkan war. It marks the death of a
multiethnic Croatia, along with much of the civility that once
characterized life here.<P>
   Croats, who do not have to pay for their new homes, are taking
over Serb communities with the approval and assistance of the
Croatian government, which says that it must finding housing for
200,000 refugees; at the school in nearby Sunja, officials match
refugees with Serb houses.<P>
   The Croatian refugees hope to find furnished houses, since most
arrived with only what they could carry. But if they do not, they
are instructed to take what they want from other houses.......<P>
   President Franjo Tudjman of Croatia has said that his government
did not want the Serbs to leave the Krajina region and Western
Slavonia after the army's offensives. But diplomats and U.N.
officials point out that beyond such statements the Croatian
government took no steps to persuade the Serbs to remain and did
nothing to insure their safety. Though no one seems to have
accurate figures, it is believed that more than 150,000 Serbs fled
the Krajina and Western Slavonia.<P>
   Only elderly Serbs remain.<P>
   ``I was born here, I want to die here,'' said 72-year-old Nikola
Vrlinic, a Serb, explaining why he didn't flee Donji Hrastovac.
With a grizzled face, and looking beaten, he leaned on the
weathered wooden fence in front of his ramshackle wooden house, a
shed in back for his two cows and three pigs and 10 chickens.<P>
   ``Before the war, we lived as brothers,'' he said about the
Serbs and Croats here. ``There was no home here that didn't have a
mixed marriage.'' His daughter is married to a Croat; he hasn't
heard from her since the family fled when the Croats launched the
Krajina offensive on Aug. 4, he said, beginning to cry.<P>
   All around Vrlinic, Croat refugees are taking possession of
houses that had once belonged to Serbs. The official document they
are given says their occupancy is ``temporary,'' but it is hard to
imagine that it won't become permanent........<P>
 
   In the house across the road, Mrs. Cukijati found a couch, table
and some chairs, which she took to her new home.<P>
   ``I don't like doing it,'' she said about taking the property.
``I'm sorry for these people, even though they are the ones who
caused us the problems.''<P>
   Four Croatian men on tractors went by, then stopped at an
abandoned farm. They said they were looking for farm equipment
stolen from them by Serbs four years ago.<P>
   At the end of the day, they were seen driving slowly down the
road in Donja Hrastovac, their wagons piled with furniture.<P>
   They drove past the couple in the white Yugo, who were
continuing their search. They found one house they liked, but when
they came back from registering it with the authorities, they found
a hand-lettered sign saying that it ``belonged'' to the police.<P>
   They were offered another house, but it was too big. ``We don't
have the time or energy to clean it,'' Mrs. Pranic said.<P>
   As the day ended, frustrated, they hung a hand-lettered sign on
the fence of a house, thus claiming it. ``We just took this house
because everything else is taken,'' said Mrs. Pranic, as she began
watering flowers. A huge muddy sow wandered in the yard.<P>
   Her husband and a friend set about fixing the lock on the back
door, to prevent any theft until they moved in permanently, which
they planned to do the next day.<P>

<h5>By Sarah Helm,<a NAME="independent"> The Independent</a>, 24 August 1995</h5>

<h2>'What was once home to 300 families is now a graveyard'</h2>


The village of Kistanje, in what was Serb-held Krajina, is no more.<p>

For two weeks, explosions blasted the streets; Croat soldiers and
civilians in groups of four or five roamed the village, looting what
they could, and then started big bonfires.  House after house was set on
fire.  Finally yesterday, all was quiet, because there was nothing else
to burn.  What was once a prosperous, agricultural community of sturdy,
proud, stone houscs on tree-lined roads, home to 300 Serbian families,
is a graveyard of gutted, blackened masonry and twisted timber.<p>

In the two weeks which have elapsed since Croatia recaptured Krajina,
village after village has been incinerated.  In the southern sector,
near the former Serb "capital" of Knin, United Nations monitors have
classified 20 Serb villages as "completely destroyed" and as many - if
not more as "badly burned".  The UN has reported similar destruction in
the north.<P>

Throughout the Bukovice valley, west of Knin, the air is filled with the
stench of incineration and of rotting flesh.  Strewn around are the
carcasses of stiffened, rotting animals.  On the road towards Kistanje
yesterday lay the bloated bodies of a man and a woman, face down in a
ditch.  It seems they were killed in mid-flight - their shot-up trailer
lay beside them....<P>

There is no body-count, yet.  But there are 96 neat wooden crosses on 96
neat mounds at a makeshift cemetery at Knin and more rows of crosses at
a similar "cemetery" at Gracac.  Yesterday, Croat workmen arrived with
shovels to spread gravel on the top of the mounds.  Some crosses had
numbers, but there was no sequence.  "252 NN", said one cross -
apparently signifying that the body had "no name".  "158 Sava Besevic"
said another cross, next to "NN 170".<P>

The mounds were built on top of giant troughs, say UN monitors who saw
the diggers at work before the offensive begun.  But nobody can know how
many bodies lie beneath.  And nobody can say how many bodies will be
hurled into a second giant trough which yesterday was waiting to be
filled.<P>

It has been useful for US and some European politicians to view the
Krajina offensive as quick and clean.  The West's peace-makers argue
that the Croat assault, however distasteful, may have laid the ground
for a settlement.  They want to believe the means used by Croatia will
justify the end of lasting peace.<P>

It has been important for Croatia to present its offensive in Krajina as
a relatively clean war.  President Franjo Tudjman promised the United
States that his assault would not endanger civilians, and that human
rights would at all times be observed.  Croatia wants to build its
relationship with the West, and particularly the European Union.
President Tudjman says Serb refugees will be able to return to the area
to live, along with Croats who fled from the Serbian assault in 1991.<P>

Yet the destruction wrought in the past two weeks bears horrific
testimony to Croatian determination to annihilate all trace of Serb life
from the land - just as the Serbs sought to annihilate all Croat life by
similar destruction four years before.  The destruction makes a mockery
of Western calls for a "right of return for refugees."<P>

No one who has witnessed the carnage believes the refugees can return.
There is nothing to return to.  The carefully constructed dry stone
walls, which may have stood for generations, still mark out patches of
farmland, but in many areas the crops have been burned as well.<P>

In areas that were spared burning, the grapes are ripening on the vines.
But there will be no one here to gather them when harvest comes around
in about two weeks time.  More than 1,000 refugees - too old or
petrified to join the mass flight which followed the assault - still
wait at the UN compound in Knin for a convoy out to safety in Serbia or
Serb-held areas of Bosnia.<P>

As they pass the time in make-shift shelters they hear the news of their
burning villages and they have learnt to give up any hope of returning
to their homes.<P>

"Individual acts", is how many Western diplomats have dismissed reports
of burning and looting.  But UN monitors and other humanitarian agencies
are building up a dossier of what they term a "systematic" campaign of
destruction.<P>

The dossier contains an endless litany of horror, reported by teams of
human rights monitors whose words go unheeded.  The monitors complain
their access has been barred by the Croat authorities.  The reports cite
eye-witness accounts of Croats in uniform and civilians near the scene
of burning houses.<P>

The UN has evidence of uniformed soldiers and civilians looting and
vandalising property:  "The entire village of Bobodol has been
destroyed, 50 houses have been burned down."  Burning houses were
observed at the villages of Kaldrma, Siroka Kula, Serdari and Podgonje.<P>

"A team found a dead woman at Ivonici, shot in the legs," says the same
report.<P>

At the village of Rajici:  "ten houses have been destroyed".  At Perna,
25 houses have been burned down.  At Katinovac 26 houses "have been
completely burned."  In Cresmunica, the monitors reported 20 houses
burned.<P>

In Dugo Selo, seven houses were burned and one house destroyed by an
explosion:  "It is a fair assessment to say that Krajina is burning.
Kistanje, Devrske, Otrie and other towns have become virtually
unlivable."<P>

<strong> ZAGREB, Aug 17 (Reuter)</strong> -<a NAME="croburn1"> Croatian</a> troops and civilians are methodically destroying homes abandoned by Serbs in a mass flight from the reconquest of the rebel Krajina region this month, United Nations officials say.<p>
         Since the Krajina fell to Croatian forces 12 days ago,
Croats have torched dozens of ghost towns in an orgy of
destruction sure to deter the minority Serbs from returning to a
land they had inhabited for centuries, say the officials.<p>
         The rampage was in part motivated by a desire to avenge the
damage done by Serb insurgents who expelled Croats and burnt
their homes and churches when seizing the Krajina region four
years ago.<P>
         But it called into question the sincerity of Croatian
government appeals to civilian Serbs to stay, with guarantees of
human and property rights. The Croatian calls were were ignored
by the Serbs.<p>
         ``If you loot and burn, saying to the Serbs that you want
them to stay sounds pretty phony,'' said a U.N. relief official.<P>
         Around 150,000 refugees fled the Krajina in convoys of cars
and tractors after it fell. Many reached Serbia on a motorway
which Zagreb closed to Croatians for days to speed the exodus.<P>
         Hundreds of refugees were stoned and beaten by Croat mobs
along the road while police stood by. Croatian authorities
stopped the assaults only after strong protests from the U.N.
peacekeeping mission (UNCRO).<P>
         U.N. officials described the pillaging and burning of Serb
homes and farm crops as ``ethnic cleansing by the back door.''<P>
         Confidential daily reports from UNCRO observers obtained by
Reuters depict devastation across the stark highlands above the
Adriatic Sea where Serb peasants, traders and railway workers
lived in large numbers.<P>
         ``Widespread, systematic and organised looting and
deliberate destruction, usually by burning, of houses, crops and
anything else of value is observed wherever the Croatian army
allows us to travel,'' said one UNCRO report.<P>
         ``While travelling the Drnis-Knin road (on August 10), every
building was aflame, as were haystacks... No civilians could be
seen, but police cars and vans were in the area.''<P>
         In the village of Mircete, which was on fire, ``six armed HV
(Croatian) soldiers were in attendance drinking wine from
bottles.''<P>
         An UNCRO general blamed the destruction on ``agencies of the
Croatian government.''<P>
         ``We are seeing revenge for 1991. But if you cannot control
such things, what kind of country is it?'' he said of Croatia
which aspires to European Union membership.<P>
         Natasa Rajakovic, spokeswoman for President Franjo Tudjman,
said ``uncontrollable troops and civilians'' were responsible.<P>
         ``I can guarantee this is not policy. We do not even condone
or encourage this but our people are only human,'' she said.<P>
         ``Yes, we want to be different from the Serbs. Yes, we want
to be part of the West. But our people feel that what the Serbs
did to us in 1991 is forgotten by the outside world.<P>
         ``What the Serbs did to us then was 10 times worse. What's
worse -- torching the home of a Serb who has no desire to return
to live in independent Croatia anyway, or murdering and
expelling Croats from their homes?''<P>
         U.N. reports said Croatian troops also seized and looted a
large number of UNCRO observation posts and bases.<P>
         ``Hijacking and blatant theft of U.N. property, once the
preserve of the Krajina Serb army, now seems the modus operandi
of the new landlords,'' wrote Colonel Andrew Leslie, U.N.
commander in the Knin region, in one report.<P>

<h2><a NAME="cromob">CROAT MOB</a> ATTACKS NUNS IN FLEEING CONVOY</h2>

By Patrick Bishop in Zagreb<p>

  A MOB of Croats attacked a column of Serb refugees, smashing car
windscreens with stones and wounding one woman so badly that she bled to
death, the United Nations reported yesterday. A UN spokesman also said
Croats had beaten up a group of Serb Orthodox nuns who were among the
refugees.<p>

The crowd was waiting for the Serbs as they drove in cars and tractors past
the town of Sisak, southeast of Zagreb, on their way to exile in Serbia.
For four hours on Wednesday night they hurled chunks of concrete and stones
at the passing convoy, smashing windscreens and wounding those huddled
inside.<p>

"The windows of almost every vehicle were smashed and almost every person
was bleeding from being hit by some object," said a UN spokesman, Rida
Ettarashany.<p>

These incidents were witnessed by UN civil policemen patrolling the route
along which about 55,000 Serb refugees, who had been trapped in the area
around Topusko, travelled on their way into exile.<p>

The crowd, mostly men in civilian clothes, yelled obscenities and abuse as
they punched and kicked the departing Serbs and showered them with missiles
as Croatian police and soldiers stood idly by.<p>

The UN said their own police felt powerless to intervene, but claimed that
the Croat police stepped in to restrain the mob when they turned up.
However, the violence resumed as soon as they moved on to monitor other
parts of the route.<p>

Another UN spokesman, Chris Gunness, said a group of nuns had been beaten
by members of the crowd. The incident was not witnessed by the UN but by
reporters who said four nuns were attacked. The fate of a woman who bled to
death from injuries sustained in the attack was reported by UN personnel
when the column passed into Serb-held territory. The conduct of the Croats
in victory has cast a pall over Croatia's lightning victory to retake the
Krajina and seriously undermined President Franjo Tudjman's claims that
refugees would be treated in a civilised manner. Details of the mob attack
at Sisak come on top of reports of widespread arson by the conquering
troops as they set fire to the homes of the defeated Serbs.<p>

<h3>1,000 refugees an hour arriving in the Belgrade area</h3><p>

The refugee exodus continued yesterday, with 1,000 an hour arriving in the
Belgrade area. The Croat authorities have closed the motorway linking
Zagreb to the Serb border, allowing the fleeing Krajina Serbs to reach
safety in a variety of cars, lorries and tractors.<p>

...............<p>

Many of them carried chunks of concrete and rocks that had been hurled at
the them when they ran the gauntlet at Sisak.<p>

A reporter asked 31-year-old Nada Bobic why they did so. She replied:
"Well, lost things should be returned to their owners. I am going to send
this back one day."<p>

<h2><A NAME="gauntlet">Serbs run</a> an angry Croatian gauntlet</h2> 

Associated Press 8/10/95<p>

SISAK, Croatia -- The victors unleashed a barrage of bricks, boulders,
manure and spit. The losers sat frozen in their cars, blood and sweat
streaming down their faces, hoping to get out of Croatia alive.<P>

When convoys of Serb refugees began crawling down School Street, a mile-long
lane on Sisak's southern outskirts, several hundred Croats saw a chance to
taste revenge -- and Croat authorities did little to stop them.<P>

"Monkeys!" "Murderers!" "Go back to Serbia!" were some of the cries as the
first convoy of 180 cars and trucks arrived Wednesday afternoon. Police and
soldiers had already safely shepherded the Serbs through other Croat areas,
but here the rocks and abuse flew.<P>

When the second convoy arrived two hours later a youth rushed in front of
one car and hurled a brick through the windshield, splitting open the
driver's forehead and sending the car careening out of control.<P>

Another rock smashed his side window, hitting the woman beside him in the
shoulder. The woman, choking back tears, plucked splinters of glass from the
blanket wrapped around a baby in her lap.<P>

About 50 police and soldiers stood in pockets along the road. A few lectured
stone-throwers, to no discernible effect. Most of the security forces smoked
nonchalantly and shrugged off the violence as inevitable. Some laughed at
what they considered overdue entertainment.<P>

By the time the third convoy arrived at 6 p.m., many locals carried shopping
bags full of rocks, laughing and chatting with contentment that after four
years of Serb aggression they were exacting retribution. Few cars escaped
without shattered windows.<P>

"We just want to see their faces," said Sdepan Panezic, 36, holding a
Croatian flag.<P>

He said the wounding of passing refugees was justified, but added: "We do
want the army here to protect them. We don't want to be killers."<p>

"Have you been to Petrinja? Have you been to Vukovar?" asked 66-year-old
Ivica Milekovic, referring to two predominantly Croat towns destroyed by
invading Serbs in 1991. "What we are doing to them is nothing compared to
what they have done to us.<p>

Petrinja was her hometown. Her husband was killed when Petrinja fell; her
niece, she said, was shot down while fleeingm the town.<p>

"These people passing by supported this killing. Some did this killing," she
said with fury.<p>

Some people, from young boys to elderly women, lobbed rocks into the already
broken windows of passing cars as though feeding pigeons; others fired the
stones like fastballs. A cry of pain from a Serb woman sparked impromptu
cheers from the crowd.<p>

The third convoy ground to a halt when a truck couldn't get under a railway
bridge at the east end of the lane. Attackers surged onto the road, pulling
license plates from cars, jumping onto the backs of trucks and spitting at
the elderly refugees cowering inside, and looting trucks.<p>

Several fighting-age men sat covering their faces on the back of a
tractor-trailer.<p>

Police intervened when one man was pulled from his car and repeatedly kicked
in the face, stomach and groin. The officers pulled him away and tossed him
onto a truck already crammed with refugees. A local man commandeered the car
and drove it onto a side road, getting a handshake from a Croat soldier as
he did so.<p>

Another man stood in the middle of the road, heaving a foot-wide rock at a
vehicle, retrieving it and throwing it at the next vehicle, over and over.<p>

He halted only when a car containing an Orthodox nun passed by. Others
jeered him and peppered the car with smaller rocks.<p>

All the while, other Croats watched silently from houses, their faces set in
unmistakable sadness.<p>

During lulls between convoys the owners of the Bistro El Piaf midway along
the road turned up the pop music and sold cold beer on the terrace.<p>

The United Nations deployed about 20 civilian police at the end of School
Street, but a senior officer said they had a mandate only to document the
actions, not to stop them.<p>

As darkness approached, two truckloads of Croatian troops arrived,
apparently a response to U.N. protests of the attacks. There were some
25,000 refugees who had yet to run the School Street gauntlet.<p>

Soldiers patrolled the streets here on Monday, flashing the victory sign,
drinking beer, and looting. From the air, above the Knin area, houses could be
seen burning in nearby villages, the smoke and embers suggesting they had been
recently set afire.<p>

A few old women shuffled among the rubble on the main street on Monday, where
just about every shop, its plate glass window shattered, has been looted. Serbs
were nearly 90 percent of the population before war first broke out in 1991,
leading to rebel Serb control here. But most of them have fled. Some 800 people,
most of them old people, women, and children, have taken refugee in the U.N.
compound here.<p>

From the stories of those who remained behind, it is clear that fear and hatred
will make it almost impossible for Croats and Serbs to live here together again.<p>

They are traumatized. They are afraid. They cry. "I don't know where my head
is," said an 80-year old woman wrapped in blankets on a warm day. "I can't talk
to anyone. Everything aches. I don't know where my family is," she said,
coughing badly.<p>

On Monday, the Croatian army allowed a few journalists into Knin, but their
movements were severely restricted to driving through town in a U.N. convoy and
visiting the hospital. There was also a limited opportunity to talk to refugees
at the U.N. compound.<p>

"They want to cover it up from you," said one man, from the village of Polace,
about 5 miles south of Knin, listing villages where he said people had been
killed by soldiers. "But please show that evil was done."<p>

It is still not known how many people died during the shelling. The Croatian
army has refused to allow the U.N. personnel here to venture outside their
compound on the outskirts of town, saying that it was necessary to confine them
for their own safety.<p>

The U.N. commander in the region, Gen. Alain Forand, dismissed that argument as
bogus. "I think we can take care of our safety," he said.<p>

U.N. officials here said on Monday that they have been hearing trucks at night,
and they fear that they are being used to haul away bodies.<p>

But the refugees' stories present a mixed picture of the Croatian army -- of
some soldiers who seemed careful to preserve human rights and others who were
bent on killing every Serbian male and who engaged in wholesale banditry and
burning.<p>

Two sisters -- both too frightened to give their names -- said they had been
treated well by soldiers, that they had not been molested. But when a soldier
took the older sister back to allow her to look for the younger one, she saw a
"pile of bodies" -- seven of her other relatives.<p>

If there was a pattern to the soldiers' conduct, it was that the people in the
town of Knin apparently were treated better than those in the villages.<p>


............................<p>

At the news conference in Zagreb on Monday, Susak said that during the war,
civilians had been treated in accordance with international law, and he said
that only military targets had been shelled in Knin.<p>

He said that a soldier had been arrested in connection with the episode in which
peacekeepers were used as human shields. Over the past two days, a Defense
Ministry spokesman, Gen. Ivan Tolj, had heatedly denied the allegations.<p>

..........................<p>

As refugees in the U.N. compound described what had happened, their stories
tumbled out, sometimes too fast to get all the details. One man, Stevan Grujo
said that when he and a small group were trying to flee their village on
Saturday evening, they were stopped by Croatian soldiers.<p>

The soldiers forced a 26-year old man off his tractor and shot him, Grujo said.
They killed four other men who were in uniform but were not carrying weapons.<p>

"The only reason they didn't kill me was because I was with my wife," he said.<p>

A woman in her 60s said: "They killed my dog in front of my eyes." Then she
showed a bruise on her left leg, where she said a soldier had hit her with a
rifle butt.<p>

A Serbian man who would give only his first name, Jovo, and his wife, Danica,
were fleeing from their village of Polaca with about 20 others, when they were
fired on by soldiers, he said. Four people were killed and 3 wounded, he said.<p>

Branko Dobrota said the politicians have destroyed his life twice. He had lived
in Sibenik, on the coast southwest of Knin, until 1990, when "the hatred
started." His grandson was beaten up by his Croatian playmates because he was
Serb.<P>

To get away from the anti-Serb animus, Dobrota said, he exchanged his house in
Sibenik for a house in Knin that belonged to a Croat who was being harassed by
Serbs there.<P>

Last week, Croatian shells hit Dobrota's house here, while he and his family hid
in the basement; his granddaughter's arm was broken. His family fled, and he
will soon follow.<P>

"I have to leave. I have no house here or in Sibenik."<P>

    Ukrainian U.N. peacekeepers in observation posts west of Dvor saw at least six villages burning after Bosnian 5th Corps attacks.<P>

    "The Ukrainians have also heard small-arms fire and screaming of inhabitants. These may be reprisals for earlier Krajina Serb attacks on Bihac (inside Bosnia) or just undisciplined soldiers," Lepage said.<P>

	Three 12-mile-long refugee convoys, each with about 15,000
people, were snaking toward or through Serb-held territory in
northern Bosnia, said Alemka Lisinski, the spokeswoman for the U.N.
High Commissioner for Refugees in Croatia.<p>

	Some 50,000 to 60,000 more refugees were expected to follow the
same route in the coming days, she added.<p>

.........<p>


	One column of exhausted people crammed into hot, overloaded
cars, trucks and tractors passed through Banja Luka on Saturday
afternoon. They were heading east on a journey that had begun 12
hours earlier under heavy bombardment in Knin, the collapsed
Croatian Serb stronghold about 200 miles away.<P>

 .........<P>


	When the convoy made brief stops, local Bosnian Serbs served the
refugees cold water and food. A woman with a plate full of homemade
cakes approached one car, urging the refugees to ``take some,
please,'' as she fought back tears.<P>

	``Ordinary people seem to understand us, but police here, for
example, look at us like we are cowards, deserters, like we gave up
Knin,'' said Nikola Kotaras, whose family fled Knin late Friday
night.<P>

	His wife, Grozdana, said, ``We had only 10 minutes to pack up
and leave. I didn't take any of my papers ... nothing.''<p>

	The Kotaras family, like many ethnic Croat and Muslim refugees
before them, were fleeing for the second time since Yugoslavia
disintegrated into war in 1991. They were forced to leave the
Croatian coastal town of Zadar when the first Serb-Croat war broke
out in the summer of 1991.<P>

	But that time was easier, Grozdana said, because she had time to
prepare.<P>

	``We left Zadar with the Yugoslav army. I knew we would have to
in advance and had time to take almost all our things. This time I
left my closet doors open,'' she said, crying.<P>

ZAGREB, Croatia -- The United Nations accused Croatian troops Sunday 
of using U.N. peacekeepers as human shields, detaining hundreds of 
others and going on a looting spree as they recaptured rebel Serb-held 
territory.<p>

U.N. officials also expressed fears that victorious Croat troops might 
be shooting Serbs and burning houses that belonged to Serbs in their 
fallen stronghold of Knin.<p>

Sounds of gunfire and smoke were coming from Knin. But Croats, who 
claim complete control of the city, have prevented U.N. officials from 
entering to see for themselves what was occurring.<p>

"We need access to see what exactly is going on," Alun Roberts, a U.N. 
spokesman, said by telephone from a U.N. base a half-mile north of 
Knin. <P>

"We can only presume the Croatian authorities have things they wish to 
hide."<P>

Croat forces have blockaded the base, where 340 peacekeepers were 
joined by 750 refugees and 45 wounded. Croats stationed a tank outside 
the front gate.<P>

"We don't know how these fires started or what was burning," Roberts 
said. <P>

"We heard sporadic gunfire throughout the night, but can only guess as 
to what it was."<P>

...................................<P>

Roberts said U.N. military officials have seen clear evidence of the 
looting by Croat soldiers of Serb houses in Knin.<P>

"Soldiers don't usually go in to battle clutching video recorders, 
televisions and radios," Roberts said. "But we have seen Croat soldiers 
holding such things triumphantly while they sit on top of their tanks."<P>

He also said Croatian soldiers had been seen driving cars that were 
left as Serb civilians fled Knin in advance of its fall on Saturday.<P>

There were growing fears of large civilian casualties in the Croats' 
two-day shelling of the town.<P>

"It appears there are very many dead," Roberts said, citing reports by 
some of the Serb refugees huddled at the U.N. base.<P>

"Some people say they were offered bread and water by soldiers when 
they were taken from their basements, but one woman said her husband 
had been killed by Croats when they discovered him."<P>

The United Nations was treating several dozen wounded in a makeshift 
hospital set up in a gymnasium. The fate of an untold number of other 
patients at Knin hospital, which was shelled on Saturday, was not 
known.<P>

Three U.N. peacekeepers have been killed and nine others wounded in the 
three-day Croatian offensive across Serb-held lands. U.N. officials 
blame Croatian army attacks for some of the casualties.<P>

Croatian troops also have detained hundred of peacekeepers and used 
some as human shields in their attacks on Serb positions, U.N. 
officials said.<P>

Croats forced seven disarmed Danish peacekeepers to walk with Serb 
prisoners as human shields in front of a Croatian battalion on Friday 
and Saturday, said Chris Gunness, a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb. The 
peacekeepers were later released unharmed.<P>

"It's totally unacceptable and constitutes a serious violation of the 
basic international humanitarian law," Gunness said, adding it was 
worthy of consideration by the international war crimes tribunal.<P>

In Knin, the rebel Serbs' capital, which was retaken by Croatia on 
Saturday, the situation was described on Sunday by the United Nations 
as "desperate." Sections of the city were "ablaze," and there were 
"bodies in the streets," said a U.N. spokesman, Chris Gunness. 
The United Nations also reported "significant looting" in the city 
by Croatian soldiers.<p>

As the fighting eased, the focus began to shift to the plight of 
civilians, and the United Nations said it was running into difficulties 
from the Croatian government in assisting them.<p>

A U.N. patrol that tried to go into the center of Knin was stopped just 
outside its base on the outskirts of town by a Croatian combat unit 
with tanks, Gunness said.<P>

......................<P>

In order to assist civilians caught by the war in the Krajina, and 
monitor the human rights situation, the United Nations has demanded 
access to the areas most affected by the fighting. The United Nations 
also wants to use its equipment and manpower to restore water and 
electricity in areas where utilities have been damaged by fighting and 
to get bread back in the stores.<P>

But U.N. officials said on Sunday that the Croatian government was 
blocking its efforts.<P>

Later in the day, Croatia agreed to allow U.N. agencies and the 
International Committee of the Red Cross to monitor the human rights 
situation in the area.<P>

The U.N. officials and diplomats fear a repeat of what happened in 
Western Slavonia, another region that had been held by rebel Serbs, 
after the Croatian government launched a successful military operation 
there in May. <P>

The Croatian forces committed a large number of human rights abuses and 
thousands of Serbs fled. The United Nations was kept out of the area 
for six days.<P>

Tolj said that there was no reason for people to flee, that Serbs would 
be given the same rights as all citizens of Croatia. "Those who stayed 
in Western Slavonia today lead a happy life," he said.<P>

Residents who remained in Western Slavonia, as well as U.N. officials 
and diplomats, say, however, that they are mistreated by Croats and 
live in fear.<P>

....................<p>

The United Nations said on Sunday, however, that three of its 
peacekeepers had been killed and eight wounded, all in attacks by the 
Croatian army. <P>

The Croats assaulted 65 U.N. posts, forcing 315 soldiers to abandon 
their duties, they said, and the whereabouts of 61 peacekeepers -- 28 
Czechs and 33 Kenyans -- is unknown.<P>

In its protest about the treatment of its peacekeepers, the Danish 
government said that on Friday, seven peacekeepers and two Serbian 
prisoners had been forced to walk in front of an advancing Croatian 
battalion. The next day, the same seven Danes and six Serbian prisoners 
had been forced to walk "in front of the attacking Croatian forces for 
two hours." They were later released unharmed.<P>

The Geneva conventions on the conduct of war prohibit treating 
prisoners of war in this manner.<P>

In rejecting the allegations, Tolj said they were motivated by a desire 
"to diminish the brilliance of the military victory," and were made "to 
stain the international reputation of the Republic of Croatia."<P>

BOSNIAN TROOPS HARASS VELIKA KLADUSA AND CAZIN RETURNEES. Meanwhile in
northwest Bosnia, another question was under consideration: Muslim vs.
Muslim. At a 24 January press briefing in Bihac, a UN spokesman accused
Bosnian soldiers of mistreating Muslim renegades going home, AFP said
the next day. Kris Janowski reported 20 cases of intimidation over the
past month, mostly beatings of people returning to the Velika Kladusa
and Cazin areas. Involved were either soldiers of the Bosnian Fifth
Corps or Bosnian special police, and there was also one killing. The UN
civilian police report at least five complaints daily of intimidation
and outright violence against the followers of local kingpin Fikret
Abdic. Janowski said that the intimidations resulted in a "marked
decrease in returns from the Kuplensko camp in Croatia to Velika
Kladusa," and that some returnees found conditions in Bihac area so
frustrating that they decided to go back to the wretched camp instead.
These Muslims stood by Abdic -- affectionately known as "Babo," or daddy
-- and fled to Croatia last summer after Croatian and Bosnian government
forces captured Abdic's fiefdom. The tycoon had once put together a
business empire known as Agrokomerc, which brought jobs and prosperity
to the area. In the 1980s it emerged that his commercial realm had been
built on smoke, mirrors, and bad loans, and virtually the whole
structure came tumbling down. He was jailed by the authorities, but
hailed by the locals as a Muslim victim of big-time politics. Abdic
later rebuilt Agrokomerc and became an important figure in postcommunist
Bosnian political life. He eventually broke with President Alija
Izetbegovic and declared his own republic. Supporters regard him as the
defender of his region's peace and prosperity, while detractors call him
a crook who is available to the highest bidder. Until last summer he
worked closely with the Serbs but was then captured by the advancing
Croats. Babo reportedly has since lived comfortably in Croatia -- while
his followers have been crammed into pitiful camps along the border,
unwanted by either Zagreb or Sarajevo. The Dayton agreement specifies
that all refugees have the right to return in safety to their homes and
property, which presumably includes these poor people who backed the
wrong horse. -- Patrick Moore and Daria Sito Sucic, copyright OMRI 1996<P>

<h1>Either Babo Or Abroad!</h1>
 
<strong><em>by Vanja Novak</em></strong><P>

<h2>ARKzin, Zagreb, Croatia, 12/22 1995</h2>


Almost five months after the signing of the the first agreement (on August 8) on the return of the refugees from the Kupljensko camp to their homes which is supposed to guarantee everything one could wish for, the return seems more hopeless than ever.  All the agreements signed so far are worthless, since nothing from them has been implemented so far.  Instead of human and civic rights in the town of Velika Kladusa in Bosnia-Hercegovina, there is terror, instead of security and protection of property, there is looting, instead of an amnesty, murders, rapes ... darkness.<P>

If they want to avoid the terror imposed by the Fifth Corps of the Bosnian Army, the refugees from Kladusa have nowhere to go.  Presently, the West does not want them and Croatia refuses to give them refugee status, as purportedly they can return to their homes, which was supposedly settled by the above mentioned agreement; according to the agreement three different police forces were supposed to guarantee the security of the returning refugees: Turkish, Croatian and Bosnian police.  The influence of the international police (sic!) is small and does not mean much in practice.<P>

<h2>Coexistence and Dollars</h2>

When the refugees came to Croatia on August 7, and temporarily settled on both sides of the 5 kilometers long road they were convinced that the ordeal would be bearable and short.  There were about 25,000 of them; so far about 8,500 have returned to their homes.  Another 3,500 (mostly men) escaped, mostly illegally, to other countries.  The refugees arrived with a lot of arms and several tanks which they turned over to Croatian authorities.  A small amount of arms was kept in the camp which later proved to be an additional problem.<P>

At the time, there were 6,500 children younger than 15 at the camp; today there are about 5,500 of them.  There were 380 pregnant women, five thousand people older than 65, about 12,000 adults, 52 orphans and many more children without one of the parents.<P>

Today, there are at least 12-13,000 refugees in the camp.  With every new day they have less and less hope for survival.  The children are getting ill, there are infectious diseases, there is a shortage of everything besides bread and fresh air!<P>

Taking into the account the conditions in which they live (without heating, water, electricity, in hovels and stables), every normal person must wonder why the refugees do not want to willingly return to their homes when the Bosnian government has promised that everything would be OK?  The reply is, on the other hand, in Kladusa, where the Fifth Bosnian army Corps lives, works and acts together with the local bosses who obviously have a political trump card to do what they are doing - to rape, kill and burn.  Three months ago a girl from Kladusa was brought to a Karlovac hospital; she had been raped about ten times by about ten "buzimci" (elite soldiers of the Fifth Corps).  Doctors almost couldn't sew her up.<P>

<h2>Go to Alija!</h2>

As was mentioned above, Croatia also does not want (muslim) political hangers-on in its territory and is doing everything it can to move them all together back to Alija and let him deal with them, in his own way.  Today, Croatian refugee policy is elegant, perfidious and effective and without a trace of christianity.  In the first phase the authorities tried to resolve the problem by force; today, they are waiting for the time, cold and poverty to take their toll.  It is obvious that the Croatian authorities intend to (permanently) settle Croat refugees from Banja Luka and the surrounding villages in this territory.  For example, during October, Croatian special police, following the order from VONS, was ready for action, but the authorities changed their mind.  Now, they are waiting for winter to finish the job and force the refugees to leave.  It is assumed that only 2-3 thousands of the most stubborn people will remain in the camp.  And then, it will be easy.<P>

The West also doesn't give a damn for the position of the refugees, although it, as early as 1992, secretly suggested a referendum and later autonomy [for the Western Bosnia], and the colorful humanitarian crowd plays its own tune and usually doesn't do anything positive.  If they show an intention to do something positive, Croatian administration quickly changes their mind.<P>

In all this, it is interesting that no one has so far asked the people from Kupljensko what they really want and feel, where would they like to go and how.  However, at the beginning of December, Doctors Without Borders  conducted a poll in Kupljensko.  It consisted from three questions: How long do you think you can stay in the camp?  Under what conditions would you return home?  Do you want to move abroad?<P>

<h2>We Want Abroad</h2>

The goal of the poll was the honest political wish that the victims speak out about their own life, and also a means to find the way to represent the refugee interests (since no one else has come to this idea), especially those who wish to move abroad.  Every question had a few sub-questions and multiple choice answers which were added for improved clarity.  For example there were several suggested answers to the second question: self-government, no mobilization, international observers and so on.<P>

The third question about the relocation abroad gives three possible choices and includes one sub-question.  The first reply absolutely excludes relocation abroad, the second one conditions the return to Kladusa on security (human rights, property), and the third answer was chosen by those who wouldn't return to Velika Kladusa even if it were New York.  At the end of the third question the respondents were asked to choose a country to which they would like to relocate and to state the reasons for that choice (relatives, language, cultural advantages).<P>

ARKzin has found out the preliminary results of the poll which will be officially published at the end of this month.  The Western governments, because of whom this poll was conducted will have to face the facts.  We will find out their reaction and whether they will really help the people who expect their assistance in January.  Let us return to the results of the poll.  More than 90% of the respondents stated that they couldn't stay in the camp for more than another month.  Out of that number, about a half said that they couldn't take more than another two weeks in the camp, which can be concluded from small, but frequent groups on the road to Kladusa.  Only 10 percent had decided to stay in the camp to the very end, until everything is conclusively resolved.<P>

Germany, Canada and Scandinavian countries are at the top of the wish list (50 percent) of those who wish to relocate abroad.  Another 24 countries were mentioned on the list.  The reasons given for the desire to relocate to those countries are different.  Relatives are the most important reason (45 percent), then language (15 percent) and other reasons (20 percent) - humanitarian, cultural, political democracy, human rights) good and good looking people (mostly women).  About 20 percent didn't respond to this question.<P>

There are another several important problems which cannot be solved by the people in the camp. Wood, winter and fear are at the top, but almost every one of the participants mentioned in the poll, apart from the the questions and responses, a moral problem.  The feeling of rejection, perception of moral destruction of everything that surrounds them, despite their will, influences their willingness to return to Kladusa.<P>

85 percent of refugees want to relocate abroad; they can be divided into those who would leave in any case and those who would only leave if the situation at home is very difficult (40 percent).<P>

The second question almost unanimously confirmed the political will of the refugees who expressed desire for their own government, Fikret Abdic as its leader and the autonomy for Western Bosnia.  Almost 90 percent of participants chose that answer, while the rest chose non mobilization and minimal safety guarantees.<P>

<h2>Are Wise Guys Blocking the Return?</h2>  

These data indicate that <strong>Adalbert Rebic's</strong> interpretation of the situation, that the camp of deceived men and women is run by a handful of war criminals, does not correspond to reality.  Anyone who has ever been to Kupljensko knows that this is preposterous, since it is very unlikely that several hundred wise guys could control 25,000 people for almost five months.<P>

Every Western Bosnian knows that if he accepts Sarajevo crescendo he will live in a reservation, insecure for property and personal safety, with chances for worse.  Their stories about fear are not fabrications.  Between mid-October and mid-December, 95 beatings of the returnees were recorded in Velika Kladusa and the surrounding villages; several of those ended with the death of a beaten refugee.  Those who need medical assistance do not have a right to see a physician and helplessly await death in their homes.  If they have a home, of course.<P>

Coordinator of the Kupljensko camp, <strong>Ramo Hirkic</STRONG> believes that the situation will not change until the regime in Sarajevo is pressured to ensure secure return for the refugees in the camp.<P>

House burning, especially in the villages, is a daily occurrence.  The fear is greater every day and the hope for (promised) peaceful life smaller.  Until now, at least 8,500 people have returned; refugees in Kupljensko know very little about the experiences of the returnees.  UNHCR tried to be sympathetic and started gathering (reliable) information about the returnees.  The action started well, first two times, but was later banned by the Fifth Corps; probably because the truth would have revealed the real nature of their crocodile tears for the destiny of their ethnic brethren in Kupljensko. UNHCR got scared and since then regularly gives out false information about the experiences of the returnees in Kladusa.  It is still recruiting people for the return to Kladusa, and people have nowhere to return to.  And nobody cares about that.<P>

All that the people from Kupljensko want, and do not have, can be put in one sentence.  Trust in the state and its legal system, personal safety and a place to return to.  In other words, protection for their property.<P>

In order to stop the uncertainty regarding their own destiny, the refugees offered five demands at their demonstration in Kupljensko which took place on December 11.  The refugees stated that if these conditions were fulfilled they would consider collective return.  They demand to have a say in decisions regarding their own destiny.  Then, they demand respect for all international conventions regarding the rights of refugees, another meeting of the signatories of the August 8 agreement, informative and humanitarian blockade.  The last demand can be explained by that old revolutionary motto : "Better to die than to be a slave."<P>

Unfortunately, the Bosnian government is not ready to consider a compromise.  It actually wants to eliminate <strong>Fikret Abdic</strong> as it has publicly stated.  In addition they object that Croatia is still protecting and tolerating Abdic.  On the other hand Croatia is feigning sincerity, the West sympathy and all together trade in human misery.  The one with better cards wins.  In this case there is no winner.<P>

<h2>James Derieg, Doctors Without Borders information officer</h2>

<strong>What were the motives for your poll?</strong><P>

It was a response to the needs of the refugees.  Despite all agreements regarding the refugees in this camp, no one has ever sought their opinion.<P>

<strong>What do you intend to do with the results of the poll?  Will you use them in lobbying, as a recommendation, or something else?</strong><P>

I am hoping that we will be able to use these results in order to make the world more aware of the refugee problems in the widest geopolitical sense.  We will demonstrate through this poll that this is a specific group of people which cannot be defined through narrow ethnic criteria which have so far been the basis for all agreements.<P>

<strong>So, how can you define that sort of a group?</strong><P>

My personal opinion is that these people desire peace, not war.  They only lack a strong ideology which would hold them together.  They simply gathered around a strong leader, Fikret Abdic.  Exactly because they lacked an aggressive ideology, they couldn't defend themselves from nationalism which penetrated and burned them from all sides.<P>

<strong>What will happen with them this winter?</strong><P>

The next two months will be the hardest.  Winter conditions in the camp are hard.  I am hoping for the reduction in restrictions regarding the humanitarian aid so that we can receive more warm clothes, better food...  This would improve humanitarian conditions in the following few months, since the governments and everyone else understand that the camp will remain here until the following spring.  This is a humanitarian tragedy.  There is not one international organization which hasn't had problems with financing, coordination, organization and which hasn't been surprised with the conditions.  All that produced a lot of confusion.  Still, Croatian authorities bear a lot of responsibility because of their refusal to cooperate in the improvement of conditions in the camp.  For example, relatives are not allowed to visit the people in the camp, sick people are not admitted to the Karlovac hospital because of the Croatian authorities; there are a lot of similar examples.<P>

<strong>The reason is that they do not have a refugee status.</strong><P>

The reason is the politics, although according to the international law and the opinion of all international organizations, these people are definitely refugees.  Croatian government can not give them a refugee status because that would imply a sharp criticism of its federal partner.  It is a serious accusation to state that your partner in the Federation is unable to protect its own people.  The giving of the refugee status to these people would confirm that.<P>

<strong>If the Federal partner says that these people are traitors, then they are traitors, aren't they?</strong><P>

Something like that.  But also because these people cannot be put in one of the categories which are used for the solution of the war in the former Yugoslavia.  Refugees from Velika Kladusa are often forgotten and misunderstood.  The fact that they are misunderstood allows journalists and TV reporters to represent them as they wish, since everything goes.  They call them Abdic terrorists, Chetniks [derogatory term for Serbs, WWII nationalist Serb resistance fighters who committed crimes against Croats, Muslims and Serbs who fought with the communists], war criminals and similar names.  These people are traitors because they wanted peace in their own freedom.  If your state, regardless whether you agree or not says; "You live in my territory and have to be on my side," and you aren't, then you automatically become a traitor.  On the other hand it is possible that these people were traitors, but in that case, both Izetbegovic and Tudman are also traitors, since they simply signed an agreement which these people had signed two years ago.<P>

<TITLE>Bosnia 101</TITLE>
<FONT SIZE="+1">
<H1>Bosnia 101</h1>

<em> by Nikolaos A. Stavrou (Dr N.A. Stavrou is professor of International Affairs at Howard University. Among his publications are <strong>Edvard Kardelj and the Historical Roots of Non-Alignment</strong>)</em><P>

The Bosnian mess is getting worse by the day.  Yet, the American people are kept in the dark by a misinformation cabal and a masterful censorship of truth that would have made many dictators envious.  Instead of enlightenment, a new science of victimology has been developed to hide facts and force upon us a policy based on emotions.<P>

Everywhere I traveled and every conference I attended in the past four years, one question always pops up: Where is the other side to the Bosnia story? I have no answer.  But out of civic duty and being a professor who taught (and wrote extensively) Balkan affairs for a quarter of a century I hereby offer <strong>Bosnia 101</strong>.  The course has no prerequisites.<P>

<strong>Bosnia</strong>: It was an administrative unit (republic) of the Former Yugoslav Federation.  On April 6 1992 it declared independence in violation of Helsinki accords, the CSCE process and its own constitution.  There was never a Bosnian state nor a Bosnian nation.  Over 80% its inhabitants are Serbs in origin, 44 percent of which converted to Islam in the 16th century.  The rest are Croats but they all speak the same language and share the same culture.  Why do they hate each other is traceable to World War II.  Here is what happened in Yugoslavia during that time: the Croats established a Nazi puppet state, declared war on the western allies and slaughtered approximately 860,000 Serbs, Jews and Gypsies.  Upon independence, the first thing they did was to destroy the Jasenovac memorial to their victims; it was too visible a reminder to their atrocities.  The Bosnians responded to a higher call: The Mufti of Jerusalem had promised to Hitler and delivered two Islamic Divisions to help assure Fuhrer's victory, who in turn would help the Mufti cleanse Jerusalem of all Jews.  The most notorious of the two Muslim outfits was the <strong>SS Hanjar</strong> (<em>Cleaver</em>) maned by the direct ancestors of some of today's Bosnian leaders.  Not to be outdone, the Albanian Muslims of Kosovo, too, fielded the <strong>SS Skenderbeg</strong>, which slaughtered thousands of Serbs and expelled even more from their homes.  The Slovenes had it much easier: they were declared members of the "Aryan race," were drafted into the Nazi army, fought and died in Nazi uniforms in Montecassino and Stalingrad.  Finally the Serbs and Montenegrins fought on the side of the allies and the cause of democracy only to be told today that <strong>they</strong> are the Fascists.  With such a caricature of history, no wonder they are telling the rest of the world to go to hell.  Finally, in 1963 Tito, a Communist, and by definition an atheist, invoked religion (<em>Islam</em>) and declared existence of a new nation in Yugoslavia: the Muslims.<P>

<strong>Helsinki Accords</strong>:  The Islamic leaders of Bosnia violated these accords, the CSCE process and the constitution of Bosnia Hercegovina when they declared independence in 1992.  The center piece of Helsinki accords was the finalization and acceptance of post-world war II European borders as inviolable.  Changes of borders could come only by peaceful means and after negotiations and agreement among parties affected. <strong>Peaceful change of borders</strong> (even when caused by declaration of independence as was the case of Bosnia) meant, above all else, adherence to the constitutional provisions of parties affected.  The Bosnian constitution in effect when Muslims declared independence (<em>with the tacit support of Croats</em>) required a <strong>consensus</strong> of the three ethnic groups, Croats , Muslims and Serbs (<em>not a technical majority</em>) prior to secetion from the Yugoslav Federation.  The plurality group, i.e. the Muslims, violated this provision.  The Serbs opted for the mountains.<P>

<strong>Alija Izetbegovic</strong>: President of Bosnia, father of the Bosnian mess and author of the <strong>Islamic Declaration</strong>: <strong>A program for the Islamization of the Muslims and the Muslim Peoples</strong> (<em>Sarajevo, 1990</em>).  In this treatise Izetbegovic offers his "vision" for Bosnia and the Muslim world.  Here I will selectively quote few passages from the 1990 edition (<em>which he never renounced</em>) on issues that the western press choose to ignore, perhaps fearing that the American people might understand why the Serbs fight on.<P>

"The Islamic movement," Izetbegovic assured us, "can and should take over power as soon as it is morally and numerically strong enough to be able to overturn not only the existing non-Islamic government [of Bosnia] but also to build a new Islamic one." (p. 56).  For the Serbs this meant that when Muslims reach 51% percent of the population in Bosnia in short six years, given their birth rate and other means.  The Islamic order which would follow this overturn is defined as " a unity of religion and law, upbringing and power, ideal and interest." (p. 26).  In this new order citizenship, too, is given an Islamic bend.  "In the Muslim world," Izetbegovic admonishes, "there is no patriotism without Islam." (p. 64) In short, in this ideal state, the only way left for the Serbs to be considered full citizens and "patriots" would have been conversion to Islam.  That is what their ancestors did in 16th century to please the Sultan and earn the right to own Orthodox Christian serfs and append the suffix "-bey" to their last names.  Finally, in Izetbegovic's "Islamic order" separation of doctrine and faith from politics has no place.  "There can be neither peace nor co-existance between the Islamic religion and the non-Islamic social and political institutions." (p. 30)<P>

<strong>Lisbon Agreement on Bosnia</strong>: On March 18, 1992, or twenty three days prior to any shot being fired or a life lost in Bosnia, the European Community, following Helsinki and CSCE principles, summoned the leaders of the three Bosnian ethnic groups to Lisbon.  They were persuaded to reach a consensus prior to the declaration of independence, as required by their Constitution.  The leaders of these groups signed an agreement, maps and all, which became known as the Lisbon Agreement.  Concessions were made on all sides.  The Serbs agreed to a 44% of the territory (for local administrative purposes only) and the new state would have only one international personality.  The Europeans envisioned a loose confederate system with borders to be recognized by all, including rump Yugoslavia (<em>Serbia and Montenegro</em>).  A strong central government, proportionally representing all groups, and a rotating presidency were part of the accords, as was the case up to that point.  The Lisbon Agreement was torpedoed ten days later by the then U.S. ambassador to Belgrade, Warren Zimmermann, who lately expounds a wimpy mea culpa.  Zimmermann appeared in Sarajevo on March 28 1992 as Izetbegovic's Deus ex Machina.  The American diplomat thought the solution achieved in Lisbon to the thorny Bosnian problem would set a bad precedent for the former Soviet Union that was also collapsing along ethnic lines.<P>

Izetbegovic, who always dreamed of a unitary Islamic state, was encouraged by our Ambassador to withdraw his signature.  Thirteen days later, full scale civil war commenced.  Who started it?  Izetbegovic's boys.  Among their other "achievements", they can also claim the slaughtered 92 cadets of "Marshal Tito Military Academy," Yugoslavia's equivalent to Westpoint.  A solemn promise by Izetbegovic "of free passage" meant nothing.  These boys, ages 17-21, who had yet to fire rifle, were cut to peaces while sitting in their buses.  General Ratko Mladic promised never to forget that atrocity.<P>

<strong>Haris Silajdzic</strong>: Prime Minister of Bosnia.  Educated in Bengazi Libya and received some training in PLO tactics in Beirut and Bekka valley.  He maintains extensive business interests in Libya where in the 1980s he was receiving preferential treatment in construction contracts.  Among the "business" projects that Silajdzic was in involved in Tripoli was Quaddafi's Chemical Weapons factory, for which [West] Germans provided the scientific know how.  The Bosnian Prime Minister is one of few Washington-decrees "Democrats" on a first name relationship with Muamar [Quaddafi].<P>

<strong>Safe Havens</strong>: Enclaves which were supposed to protect civilians from the war's harm.  Under U.N. auspices, they have been converted into staging grounds by Muslims who, like their counterparts in Lebanon, use civilians as shields to commence operations against the Serbs.  When the later respond, CNN is conveniently there to record the event and the U.S. Air Force (<em>with a NATO hat </em>) could be occasionally employed to even the scores.  Since 1993 all so-called safe havens have been converted into arms production centers.  Bihac, for example, was prior to the war a major conventional arms and munitions production center.  Under the "safe-haven designation," it was restored to full capacity with the help of Turkey and the Iranian Ayatollahs.  Gorazde, a city often in the news but never explained why, has a large and efficient munitions plant.  Loads of raw materials labeled "fertilizers" are routinely allowed into the city while the U.N. "peacekeepers" look the other way.  As far as I can tell, Gorazde is the only city with agricultural production.<P>

<strong>Ethnic Cleansing and Refugees</strong>: A policy of removing people from their homes by force.  The term was coined by former Yugoslav president and historian, Dobrica Cosic, in reference to the forced expulsion of Serbs from Kosovo by Albanians.  The Albanians had succeeded in reducing the Serb population of the province from 37% in 1965 to approximately 10% in 1981.  That is the year Slobodan Milosevic was born politically, by promising to the Kosovo Serbs "no body will beat you again." The term "ethnic cleansing" is now ascribed exclusively to Serbs.  Yet, 37% of all refugees in former Yugoslavia are Serbs, or a total of 575,000.  One wonders where they came from and where their homes are.  Moreover, 120,000 Bosnian Muslims have sought refuge in Serbia-Montenegro, the land of their "enemy".  These facts, too, are ignored by the press and the Washington officialdom.  Their revelation would probably undermine the simplistic notion "one victim, one enemy."<P>

<strong>American Foreign Policy</strong>: Since the Gulf War, American foreign policy has been privatized and tribalized.  Smart public relations operatives (<em> most of them recycled policy-makers</em>) laugh all the way to the bank with foreign or domestic ethnic money, pumped into their accounts.  The payback is "policy influence."  The "lap-top bombardiers" have no fear of their kids being killed in a foreign war.  They saw to it, long ago, that there will be no military draft.  Their tender offspring are safe in the Ivy League sanctuaries preparing for the inevitable "hardships" of Madison Avenue, Wall Street, think thanks or K street.  Other peoples sons and daughters, poor ghetto boys and girls, will do the fighting.  it is <strong>their job</strong>, we are told; ours is a professional military.<P>

Bill Clinton told us "Bosnia is not about Bosnia"; and Robert D. Kaplan told us why.  The "Balkan region," Kaplan wrote, "except for the cold war era - is the Middle East."  Leverage with Arabs, he argued "is slipping due to the ... administration's failure in Bosnia."  In this topsy turvy world where peace in the Middle East and access to Arab pockets are facilitated by war in the Balkans, truth is the victim.  PR people and image-makers, with accounts to be concerned about, positioned themselves as the dominant sources of information on Bosnia.  Revisions will come later, when they will be searching the globe for new victims to defend on a fee for services basis.<P>

<TITLE> Water Shortages in Sarajevo - Why?</TITLE>

<h1>  An Atrocity the Serbs Didn't Commit</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> by John Pomfret<br>  Sacramento Bee, 8/21/94</i></h2><p>

Copyright 1994 McClatchy Newspapers, Inc.<p>

<i> John Pomfret is a reporter for the Washington Post</i><p>
<hr>

SARAJEVO:For more than 27 months, the Kapitanovic family had to walk a mile for water.  Braving sniper fire, shelling, ice, rain and broiling sun, the family's five members epitomized the international image of Sarajevo's wretched existence under siege -- people lugging plastic jugs up rubble-strewn streets while Serb gunners menaced the city from the surrounding hills.<p>

Two weeks ago, for the first time since the war begun, Almira Kapitanovic, 47-year-old mother of three, relaxed and filled her tub from the faucet.  Water now graces the Kapitanovic home at least four hours a day.<p>

The reason this family and thousands of others went waterless for so long is not simple.  Despite the claims of the mostly Muslim government, it has little to do with the Serb siege.  But it has everything to do with Bosnia's war and the corruption it has engendered on both sides.<p>

According to international aid officials, Western diplomats and U.N. specialists, most of Sarajevo could have had running water restored by last September.  Instead, these officials say, the Bosnian government, because of corruption, pride, bureaucratic bungling and an apparent desire to portray its people as innocent victims of Serb aggression, kept the taps dry.<p>

Only last week, after intense international pressure -- including hints from Washington that millions of dollars for rebuilding Sarajevo might be linked to a functioning water system -- did the government turn on an emergency water treatment plant 24 hours a day to many parts of the city.<p>

Although relative piece has settled on Sarajevo for the past six months -- following a NATO ultimatum -- and its water lines are a lot safer these days, a recent eruption of Serb sniper attacks on Muslim civilians and a Serb move to cut Sarajevo's sole road to the outside world illustrate the fragility of the Bosnian capital's peace.  that fragility, officials said, reinforces the necessity of moving such projects along.<p>

On a broader level, the long wait for water also has important ramifications for the international effort to rebuild Sarajevo.  Almost two months after the United Nations kicked off a high-profile campaign to raise $ 538 million for this crumbling capital, the Bosnian government has adopted a series of policies that U.N. and Western officials fear could derail the plan.<p>

Bosnia's government recently established a Directorate of Development and Reconstruction to set priorities and guide international money toward good projects.  Already, however, according to one high-ranking U.N. official, the directorate is acting like "a Balkan Tammany Hall," attempting to rig bids, set prices and steer contracts to government-favored firms.<p>

In a decision last week that was backed by the directorate, Sarajevo's Chamber of Commerce voted to fix the lowest pay on all reconstruction projects at $4 an hour, just a quarter below the U.S. minimum wage and about six times the average hourly wage in prewar Yugoslavia.  workers would get less than 25 percent of the total, however.  The rest would be split between the government and the companies that employ them, officials said.<p>

"What is this but a way for state-run companies and the state to steal large amounts of money from the West?" asked one U.N. official.<p>

When Fred Cuny, an American disaster relief specialist, begun his project to provide besieged Sarajevo with drinking water early last year, the affable Texan was constantly inviting reporters to "come up and see the site," a tunnel near the front lines on the city's eastern outskirts.<p>

Now Cuny, who has turned his energies toward rebuilding Sarajevo's schools, refuses to discuss the water project.  But documents he prepared and interviews with former associates, U.N. experts and Bosnian officials reveal a pattern of Bosnian government corruption, incompetence and iniquity.<p>

Cuny was one of the officials who came up with the idea of giving Sarajevo an emergency water treatment plant by filtering the Miljacka river, which runs through the city, into its water system.  backed by $ 2 million and technical support from the Washington-based International Rescue Committee and the Soros foundations of Hungarian-American financier George Soros, Cuny used his U.S. government contacts to load two emergency water treatment systems aboard 18 Defense Department C-130 transport planes and fly them from Texas to Croatia and on to Sarajevo by August 1993.  The system was set up to supply 60,000 people at a time with water 24 hours a day and the remaining 240,000 Sarajevans four hours a day.  but what took American engineers five days to assemble in a trial run in Texas has taken Bosnian workers almost a year.  One problem was that the contract signed by the Sarajevo city government guaranteed workers a day rate, giving them no incentive to finish the job.<p>

A second problem involved corruption.  Government agencies that trucked water to dry parts of the city received a fuel allocation, part of which they sold on the black market for $100 a gallon.  If water started flowing through the taps, the lucrative fuel allocation would dry up.<p>

On Jan. 3, the first of two water treatment plants was finished and Cuny requested government approval to turn it on.  When he didn't get it, he switched on the plant himself.  Immediately, the Bosnian government intervened and shut it off, claiming the water was unsafe.  First the government said the water contained fecal matter.  then it said there were pesticides.  Finally it claimed it had detected high quantities of mercury.<p>

Cuny ordered the water tested -- by a laboratory in Split, Croatia, by U.S. Army bioenvironmental engineers in Germany and by the World Health Organization.  All concluded the water was safe to drink.<p>

in one document, Cuny, who has worked in 23 war zones over three decades, complained of "the inability of the authorities to modify their procedures to meet war and emergency conditions."  In a meeting held "during the heaviest day of shelling in Sarajevo in six months, " with bullets literally pinging off the windowsill," he wrote, Bosnian government officials demanded water testing regulations that would outstrip anything in the United States.<p>

In a Feb. 11 letter to Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, Soros suggested another, more sinister, reason for the delay.  "I remind you that the sympathy of the world is with Bosnia," wrote the fund manager who has contributed more than $24 million to a variety projects here.  "Any hint that the government
 is forcing its people to carry water under fire when they could be getting it safely at home could seriously damage its image."  Silajdzic, in a recent interview, declined to discuss the subject.<p>

Almost six months after Soros wrote his letter, the first treatment plant was turned on 24 hours a day.  The second plant is scheduled to be finished in the next few days.<p>

Until the last minute, the Bosnian government officials insisted the water was unsafe.  Asked about the WHO study in an interview last week, Mehmed Drino, head of the Directorate for Development and Reconstruction, replied:" I would like to see these people drink that water.  What do you prefer: to be wounded by grenades or get an incurable disease?"<p>

For U.N. and Western aid officials, the larger worry is that water treatment experience is not unique.  Asked one U.N. veteran of Bosnia's water wars:"If they can't handle a little project like this one, how are they going to deal with $500 million in aid?"<p>

<title>GAs in Sarajevo </title>


<h2> Debt To Russians blocks utilities from being on in Sarajevo</h2>

(c) Copyright the News & Observer Publishing Co.<br>
<h4> Associated Press </h4><p>

   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina -- Bosnia is without natural gas not because of disputes between the warring parties, but because of a $100 million unpaid debt to the Russians, a U.N. official said Friday.<p>

   John Fawcett, adviser to the U.N. special coordinator for Sarajevo, said his office has secured the first agreement between the Muslim-led Bosnian government and Bosnian Serbs for monitoring valves along the country's main natural gas pipeline.<p>

   The pipeline runs from Russia through Hungary and Serbia before entering Serb-held eastern Bosnia.<p>

   Last week, the Bosnian government asked the U.N. Sanctions Committee in New York to tell the Hungarian government to open its gas valves into Serbia, restoring the flow to Bosnia. But the committee, which requires approval from the Security Council, has yet to act.<p>

   Fawcett said Russia, which has supplied gas to the region without payment since the war began 3 1/2 years ago, has yet to approve the request. It is owed $100 million in unpaid gas debts.<p>

   The biggest problem is determining who owes what to the Russians. The prewar gas contract was signed by a Moscow company and a state-owned company in Sarajevo, then part of Yugoslavia. Fawcett, however, says Serbia has used the bulk of the gas passing through from Hungary.<p>

   The Bosnian government asked the sanctions committee to close the pipeline last summer after the Bosnian Serbs, who frequently cut gas to Sarajevo by closing valves in their territory, refused to allow U.N. monitors along the pipeline.<p>

   Utility cutoffs have been an important weapon in the Bosnian war. Residents of besieged Sarajevo often have struggled, as they are now, to get by without electricity, running water or gas.<p>

   President Alija Izetbegovic has listed the restoration of utilities as one of several conditions for a cease-fire with the Serbs, which U.S. diplomat Richard Holbrooke is currently in the Bosnian capital trying to negotiate.<p>

   "I don't like linking utilities to cease-fire," Fawcett said. "But what we do see is when utilities come back, it significantly improves people's lives and just defuses the whole tension."<p>

   In a related development, Ambassador William Eagleton, the U.N. special coordinator for Sarajevo, said a $10.7 million fund for reconstruction projects around the capital is empty and appealed for more contributions.<p>

   The U.N. trust fund has financed 39 projects during the past 18 months, including gas, water and electric repairs.<p>

<h1>Muslim Offensive turns war against Serbs in Bosnia</h1>

<em>by Tim Judah</em>, The Times, 9/28/95, London, U.K.<P>

In eastern Bosnia the tide of war has turned.  Serb villages are burning, roads are unsafe and more Serb soldiers are dying than ever before.  Columns of smoke rise above the Drina river valley, the graveyard in Zvornik has overflowed and Bosnian Muslims are on the offensive.<P>

Black-clad families march to Zvornik's cemetery to bury their sons.  Fighters speed past in lorries mounter with anti-aircraft guns.  They call themselves the Legion of Death.<P>

In nearby Loznica hospital in Serbia, Dr. Djordje Vracevic says that fewer wounded have been brought in during the past month, "but there are more dead."  The tump of artillery can be heard around Zvornik.  Bosnian fighters are less than ten miles away.<P>

Ten miles to the south, smoke rises above Drinjaca.  Last Thursday Dr Vracevic stood on the Serbian bank of the Drina and watched the Bosnian Serb village of Novo Selo burn.  On the same day, Podravanje, close to Bratunac, also fell.  Yugoslav police say that Muslim guerillas are so close to the Drina, which separates Bosnia from Serbia, that the occasional mortar sometimes lands over on their side.<P>

Operating out of unconquered enclaves, and using weapons smuggled along partisan trails, Bosnian forces have put Serbs on the defensive in areas previously well under their control.  Bosnian Serbs, soldiers and civilians, are being ambushed in guerilla attacks, and dying, as never before.<P>

At the end of August, Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader told London conference that, as a magnanimous and unilateral gesture, his men were lifting the siege of Gorazde.  It was the only significant town along the Drina that his men had been unable to subdue.  In fact, Serb troops were already in retreat.  Mr. Karadzic was seeking to salvage international credit from a military disaster.<P>

The Bosnians were breaking out and from a besieged town.  Gorazde is now an expanding enclave.  Nearby Foca is under threat and Visegrad is in the grip of a creeping encirclement.<P>

Eight miles from Visegrad, smoke rises from the woods around the village of Dobrun.  The road into town is no longer safe.  Cars are regularly sniped at.  Soldiers coming from Visegrad say that the Muslims, "the Turks", as they scathingly call them have been shelling the town for the past six days.  "It's worse and worse every day," one soldier said.  the message is the same all the way up the valley to Zvornik.  "We were guarding a tunnel between Gorazde and Visegrad," said Sladjen Simic, aged 24, who lies wounded in Uzice hospital in Serbia.<P>

"They attacked us and surrounded us.  We were taken by surprise.  There were 11 of us, and four of us died.  We were in the tunnel for eight days.  They fired rockets in and threw in hand grenades.  They threw in tear gas and burned tires to try and smoke us out.  We had no water.  We had to drink our own urine."<P>

Before Sladjen Simic and his comrades made a break for safety, a wounded friend who could not run, " said good buy to us and killed himself."<P>

After eight days the Muslims besieging the tunnel had dropped their guard.  Many had gone on to fight elsewhere.  "The ones that were left went to have dinner and we ran for it."  Sladjen Simic's tale sounds like a story form a Second World War film.  And of course then, as now, it could've been set in eastern Bosnia.<P>

Other soldiers in Uzice hospital were ambushed on roads that had been safe.  often they never saw their attackers.  Their tarpaulin-covered army lorries were sprayed with machine gun fire from guerillas in the woods.<P>

Aleksandar Moljevic, a doctor, says that in the past two weeks his hospital has had an influx of injuries from tripwire activated anti-personnel mines.  This is new.  Holding up an X-ray of a soldier's shrapnel-peppered leg he says: "They are not very good, probably they are Arab or Iranian made.  Yugoslav ones take your leg off."<P>

Behind Skelani the trees lining a mountain forest road have been cleared for 15 meters on either side.  "We need the wood for winter," said a soldier named Bojan cheerfully.  Then, as a car careers through the twilight gloom he tells the truth.  "It's to stop ambushes."<P>

In the mountains above riverside Skelani, Serbian officers complain that the United nations delivers arms to Bosnian guerillas.  This is widely believed among Serbs.<P>

The Srebrenica front is three miles away.  Unconquered since the beginning of the war, Srebrenica is a large enclave.  It has held its own against Serb attacks.  Now it is on the offensive.<P>

Tracing an arc across the map from the Bosnian-held town of Tuzla, a Serb officer charts supply lines.  British UN troops are to be garrisoned in Tuzla, and these officers will be holding them responsible for every Serb that falls on this front.  "Hungarian, Croat, Iranian and Arab arms," says the officer.  "From Split on the Croatian coast they have a direct line to Tuzla.  From there at night through the mountain trails they smuggle them into Srebrenica.  Morale? Good... excellent."  The expression on his face betrays him.<P>

A new chapter of the war has begun in eastern Bosnia.  In early summer, well armed Bosnian Serbs led by ruthless militiamen from Serbia secured a swath of land and towns down the Drina, essential to make a compact Serb territory in Bosnia-Hercegovina.  The problem was that the population was overwhelmingly Muslim.<P>

As the Serbs seized the Drina valley, tens of thousands fled and were "ethnically cleansed". But many men also went to the hills, to two big enclaves and several smaller ones which have not been subdued.  Now, better armed and organized, these Muslims are using classic guerilla tactics and mounting hit-and-run raids, tactics that have been used over hundreds of years of periodic war in this mountainous terrain.<P>

Holding towns and roads, the regular army of the Bosnian Serbs is proving vulnerable.  There is no more support from the Yugoslav army to bolster the Serbs, but the Bosnian Muslims are still too weak to retake towns.  The Serbs of eastern Bosnia are reconciled to the inevitable.  They have taken heavy casualties, everyone lists brothers, mothers and cousins killed in battle or alleged massacres.  Everyone is reconciled to years of war to the fact that the battle of the Drina is only just beginning.<P>

The focus of peace efforts shifts to Belgrade today, where Lord Owen and Cyrus Vance, the EC and UN envoys, are due to arrive.  Lord Owen said they would be taking up at the highest levels allegations of attacks on fleeing Bosnian refugees, and on targets such as roads used by aid convoys.<P></FONT>

<h1>Defeated by the Battle for Food</h1>

<em>By Haris Nezirovic</em>, The Guardian, 4/15/93, London, U.K.<P>

The year-old war in the east Bosnian Muslim enclave of Srebrenica has not been a conflict between organized military units, but a desperate struggle for food, waged with arms and motivated by an instinct for survival.<P>

As long as food could be found, the soldiers fought.  When it vanished, the army became another group of refugees scavenging for nourishment.  Food, one of the main weapons in the Serbian armoury in Bosnia decided who won and lost.<P>

From last august, when famine first appeared, the Bosnian army launched direct attacks on Serbian positions and scored considerable successes, despite being outgunned.<P>

The Bosnian troops had no uniforms and many fought barefoot, while some used home-made rifles, formed from two welded pipes, that fired shotgun ammunition.<P>

"They had artillery and tanks.  We were just cannon fodder," Hekija Meholjic, a Bosnian brigade commander, said of the Serbs.  Victories were at the cost of dozens of dead and scores wounded in every battle.  But the troops were undeterred.<P>

"The men kept going," a Bosnian army soldier said.  "They knew there wasn't any food at home."<P>

The victories lasted until January 27 when Bosnian units took the key village of Skelani on the Serbian border.  Then they stopped.  There were no more villages with food and the campaign collapsed.  For almost 11 months, the Bosnian army in Srebrenica chalked up one victory after another.  But within two months, the balance shifted.  The Bosnian army now faces total defeat.<P>

At the end of January, territory controlled by government forces stretched 70 miles, from the village of Zepa in the south to Kamenica in the north, and the Serbs were in trouble.  Ten weeks later, Bosnian units are surrounded in a pocket 10 miles by three.<P>

The transformation is largely due to the food crisis.  The Bosnian troops usually received one tin of rations a day, which was divided between three men, while the off-duty soldiers got nothing.  The soldiers' families were also hungry, so the men deserted to forage for food for them.<P>

"It's hard to motivate a man if you can't give him food, or at least shoes when he is barefoot," Naser Oric, the area commander said.<P>

The United States airdrops that started in March lured thousands more men from their positions and sparked chaos.  Commanders lost track of where their soldiers were and how many they had on the front lines.  When the Serbs returned to the offensive, Bosnian positions previously held by 100 men were held by only 20 or 30.<P>

The food crisis was compounded by problems of morale and rampant criminality.  Commanders could make men fight only by beating them.  Dozens of Bosnian soldiers said the military number two in Srebrenica, a man who had spent 17 years in prison for double murder, used to beat any soldier who requested basic equipment.<P>

"He would put the men in ranks and tell them to go fight," a teenage fighter said.  "When a soldier asked if there was anything to eat, the vice-commander would take him out and beat him black and blue."<P>

The demoralisation also stemmed from the profiteering of the military commanders, who exploited the siege to organise robberies and make money.<P>

Rex Dudley, a United Nations officer in Srebrenica, said:  "The town will fall in two weeks if the Serb offensive is maintained."  It is being maintained and Srebrenica is full of government troops who stroll around while the front line draws nearer.<P>

The local command tries to organise the draft but few soldiers take up arms.  Why should they? Maybe they will face beatings while their families starve to death.<P>

<h1><a NAME="evacuation">To Starve </a>or be Shot by Serbs</h1>

<em>By Haris Nezirovic</em>, the Idependent, 4/11/93, London, U.K.<P>

Like most of Srebrenica's 60,000 inhabitants, Osmo Ferhat desperately wants to get out of the town.<P>

Mr Ferhat is 63.  He has been a refugee in eastern Bosnia for almost a year.  before that he was in a Serbian detention camp, where his captors regularly pummelled his kidneys: he still can't urinate without a catheter and sometimes passes blood.  He needs medical attention unavailable in besieged Srebrenica.  But he cannot leave and it is not just the armed Serbs surrounding the town who are stopping him; Mr Ferhat's fellow Muslims are trying to stop a United Nations evacuation.<P>

The UN hopes to evacuate 15,000 people over the next few days.  The Muslim command defending Srebrenica claims the UN operations amount to complicity in Serbian "ethnic cleansing".  Privately, the commanders add, they believe that the Serbs will not launch an all-out attack as long as refugees are there.  More importantly, they say that without the civilians the defense of the town would crumble.  They believe that Muslim fighters are better motivated when their families are there behind them.<P>

"I saw it in Cerska," said a battalion commander who fought there until the Muslim enclave fell to Serbs last month.  "When the women and children were evacuated, the soldiers packed their rucksacks and hardly waited for a stronger attack to find a reason to withdraw.  It should not have been allowed to happen."<P>

What this means in practice is thousands of civilians will have to remain in full range of Serbian guns: children with scabies who cannot be treated because of a lack of medicine; the elderly who are so weak from hunger that they cannot fight for air-dropped scraps of food; and mothers who feed their babies with warm water because nothing else is available.<P>

Those trapped include Meliha Gerovic, who is 15.  Her home was destroyed a year ago, and she lives in a school filled by 700 people.  She goes from house to house, begging for food, but people drive her from their doors.  She wants to leave.  So, probably, does Bevludin Mujcic, though he is mentally retarded and cannot express his wishes.  His hair is covered with lice and his face is pale.<P>

In a room with 30 people, Mirsada Kostirovic has labour pains.  She sleeps on the floor and will have nowhere else to give birth.  Her four-year-old son has a hernia, but doctors cannot trat him or her other children, who have scabies.  They all want to leave.<P>

The Bosnian command opposed the UN evacuation but, not realizing how many people might leave, did little to stop it.  When the first UN trucks came last month, they were supposed to evacuate only a few wounded, but hundreds rushed on board.  When the next convoy came on 28 March, thousands stampeded towards the vehicles.<P>

"We'll screw up those convoys," said Naser Oric, the local Muslim commander.  In another life, before the war, he was a bodyguard to Serbia's President, Slobodan Milosevic.  "It cannot go on like this any more.  The fighters are leaving front lines to put their families on the trucks."<P>

When another convoy came on 30 March, masses of civilians surrounded the trucks but were kept back by the commanders' personal guard - a group of 30 foul-mouthed soldiers suspected of robberies and other crimes.  During the night, the guards accepted bribes in German marks to let people on board.  Many refugees on the UN list for evacuation were beaten up.  Witnesses said the deputy commander slapped and kicked women and pushed children from the trucks.<P>

On 4 April the local police used fire hoses to keep people away from the UN vehicles.  Jets of water knocked down anyone who approached.  Soldiers climbed on trucks and fired into the air.  "You're keeping the guns to save these trucks, while the front lines are empty.  You dirty bastards.  Shame on you," shouted an old man in the crowd.<P>

Ever more frequently, you hear civilians say, "Our soldiers are worse than Chetniks, the Serbs".  They want to surrender.  Why?  "Because to starve to death or to be slaughtered by the Serbs aoesn't make any difference."<P>

<h1>Weapons, Cash and Chaos Lend Clout to Srebrenica's Tough Guy</h1>

<em>By: John Pomfret, Washington Post Foreign Service</em>,The Washington Post,
February 16, 1994<P>


SREBRENICA, Bosnia: Nasir Oric's  war trophies don't line the wall of his comfortable apartment-- one of the few with electricity in this besieged Muslim enclave stuck in theforbidding mountains of eastern Bosnia. They're on a videocassette tape: burned Serb houses and headless Serb men, their bodies crumpled in a pathetic heap.<P>

  "We had to use cold weapons that night," Oric explains as scenes of dead
men sliced by knives roll over his 21-inch Sony. "This is the house of a Serb
named Ratso," he offers as the camera cuts to a burned-out ruin. "He killed two
of my men, so we torched it. Tough luck."<P>

  Reclining on an overstuffed couch, clothed head to toe in camouflage
fatigues, a U.S. Army patch proudly displayed over his heart, Oric gives the
impression of a lion in his den. For sure, the Muslim commander is the toughest
guy in this town, which the U.N. Security Council has declared a protected 
"safe area."<P>

  Perhaps the time for toughness in Bosnia is nearing an end. The problem,
though, is that hundreds of men like Oric who still want to fight dominate 
all three sides in this 22-month-old war. Nobody controls them; they have 
access to plenty of weapons and lead many young men. And, if anything, Balkan 
tradition is on their side.<P>

  As the United Nations seeks to make a cease-fire work in Sarajevo under the
threat of NATO airstrikes, officials face the issue of how to neutralize men
like  Oric.<P>

  "I won't let these people destroy the peace," British army Lt. Gen. Michael
Rose, commander of U.N. forces in Bosnia, told people in Sarajevo last weekend,
referring to fighters who kept firing after the cease-fire began. "If we find
out who they are, we will put their pictures on television and tell the world
they are not serving your interests."<P>

  But  Oric  and others like him have other plans -- in Sarajevo and elsewhere.
For him and his counterparts within Bosnian Serb and Croat paramilitary units,
the war has been a godsend. While the vast majority of the 44,000 people 
crammed into this enclave about 50 miles east of Sarajevo have no fuel,  Oric
rents out his car -- a shiny black Volkswagen Golf. While most people spend 
their days and nights without electricity, Oric has power 24 hours a day. His
generator runs on black-market diesel oil. It's only natural, because he's the
biggest dealer in town.<P>

  These days  Oric's  men aren't fighting much -- although occasionally they
sneak up behind the observation posts established by the Canadian U.N. troops 
on the borders of the "safe area" and take potshots at the 3,500 well-armed 
Serbs besieging Srebrenica.<P>

  His troops' main task is making a nine-hour trudge, across Serb lines, to the
next U.N. "safe area" to the south: Zepa, where the Ukrainian U.N. troops are
more amenable to deals than the 150-odd Canadian infantrymen here.<P>

  A formidably muscled 27-year-old with a patchy black beard, Oric, a native
of Srebrenica, kicked around for several years after graduating from trade
school, where he learned metalworking. In 1987, out of work in Belgrade, he
joined the Serbian capital's police department and within several months was
transferred to the republic's police force, participating in a crackdown on
Muslim ethnic Albanians.<P>

  "I'm a man of action," he said in a recent interview. "I like adventure."<P>

  The highlight of Oric's career came when he served for two years as a
personal bodyguard to Serbia's nationalist president, Slobodan Milosevic, the
man credited in the West with igniting Yugoslavia's conflagration.<P>

  "I was a professional," Oric said. "It was a good, secure job."<P>

   Oric left the Serbian police early in 1992, when Serb nationalist fervor
reached its peak. He was back in eastern Bosnia when the war broke out that
April.<P>

  Last winter, a Serb attack on the Muslim villages of Cerska and Koljevic
Polje pushed  Oric  and his men into Srebrenica. If not for the intercession of
U.N. troops, Oric would either be dead, in a prisoner of war camp or living in
the hills.<P>

  But Oric, who was wounded three times, sees it differently: "The U.N. saved
the Serbs from our counterattack. We were ready to take it all back."<P>

  Part of Oric's appeal to this refugee-packed town is that he tells
displaced Muslims what they want to hear. He will win them back their homes; he
will avenge their dead mothers and fathers, raped sisters and cousins.<P>

  "As long as I am in Srebrenica," he said, "it will never be Serb. We will
protect the hearths of our people. We will never be Palestinians."<P></FONT>

<TITLE> Gorazde Crisis 1994</TITLE>

<h1> The Truth About Gorazde</h1><p>

 
<h2><i> Task Force on Terrorism & Unconventional Warfare<br>  House Republican Research Committee, 5/4/1994</i></h2><p>

by Yossef Bodansky and Vaughn S. Forrest<p>

<hr>

In recent weeks, the small industrial town of Gorazde in Bosnia-Herzegovina has come to symbolize in the eyes of the Western media the brutality of the latest Balkan war.  The siege of Gorazde has been portrayed as a ruthless act of aggression against Bosnia's Muslim population and has become the focal point of Western efforts to to put an end to the bloodshed.  However, while Bosnian Serb aggressiveness has undoubtedly payed a large part in the Gorazde tragedy, what is less known is the role played by by the bosnian government and military in instigating the conflict and in efforts to draw the West, particularly the United States, into the war generally.<p>

The roots of this situation derive from the events of the Fall of 1992 at a relatively early stage of the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  At that time, the Gorazde area was one of the first places where Islamist guerillas -- a combined force of 'Afghan' volunteers (mainly Arab 'Afghans') and Bosnian Islamists -- had embarked on a systematic campaign against the local Christian population in order to secure a predominant military position.<p>

The Islamists operated in detachments of some 15-20 highly trained and well equipped men and conducted repeated attacks along various roads, including the road to Gorazde, between Sarajevo and Muslim strongholds near Serbian border.  The growing frequency of this ambushes, many committed against Serb civilians, made them a dominant feature of the civil war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. (It is noteworthy that these Bosnian detachments were following exactly the principles of "the war of the weak" as outlined by the <strong>HizbAllah's</strong> Ayatollah Fadallah.)<p>

As a direct outcome of this campaign, the Bosnian Muslims were able to expand and consolidate their hold over Gorazde enclave, allowing them to use it as a staging point for future military actions.  It was at this point, in early 1993, that the Bosnian Muslims began rebuilding Gorazde as a military center.<p>

Thus, beginning in March 1993, and more so in the first half of April, Sarajevo succeeded in completing the deployment of large Muslim reinforcements into Gorazde.  Indeed, many of the Bosnian Muslim forces traveled into the pocket in the wake of UN relief  and humanitarian assistance convoys.  This was possible because UNHCR demanded that the Bosnian Serb forces withdraw from the immediate road between Sarajevo and Gorazde in order to assure that there would be no interference with its humanitarian work.  Consequently, the flow of Bosnian Muslim military supplies increased to the point that, by the end of April 1993, the Muslim forces had effectively relieved the siege of Gorazde.<p>

As it turned out, the Bosnian Muslims' success was shortlived.  For later in the summer, Bosnian Serb pressure on Sarajevo, as well as on the Gorazde corridor itself, resulted in the resumption of the siege.  Nonetheless, for the high command in Sarajevo, the critical lesson of Gorazde was that it was possible to rely on the UN to "facilitate" active support to its military operations against the Bosnian Serbs.<p>

Indeed during 1993, the Bosnian Muslims continued to smuggle items of military importance into Gorazde through UN-related channels.  Most important was the delivery of tools, spare parts and even expert personnel to repair the Pobjeda Ammunition Factory and Gorazde's chemical factory. (The latter was reportedly in the process of being converted into a chemical weapons factory.)  The assistance
for the ammunition factory was "justified" on the grounds that its water storage system was being used as a resource for the city, and that for the chemical factory was "justified" on the basis of the fact that it was capable of producing fertilizers needed for the locally grown crops.<p>

In light of these developments, by the fall of 1993, the Bosnian Serb High Command in Pale had concluded that it was only a matter of time before the Bosnian Muslims would attempt a military offensive from Gorazde.  Since the main military build-up was in the city itself, especially in the eastern part of the enclave, it was assumed that the main trust of such an offensive would be eastward, in the direction of Serbia.<p>

The Winter of 1993-1994 was harsh in eastern Bosnia, and the shipment of goods into the besieged Muslim pockets, including Gorazde remained difficult until mid-March.  Nevertheless, there were reports of Bosnian Muslim military activity in the Gorazde area as early as the first couple of weeks of February 1994.  These reports were given sufficient credence to warrant a decision by Pale to begin moving Bosnian Serb reinforcements into eastern Bosnia.  However, even as late as mid-March 1994 most Bosnian Serb forces were still concentrated in central Bosnia - away from the Gorazde pocket.<p>

In the meantime, in March 1994, there was significant reorganization of the Bosnian Muslim armed forces in anticipation of the last phase of Sarajevo's preparations for the 1994 Spring/Summer against the Bosnian Serbs.  Sarajevo considered the offensive to be the key to its efforts to draw the West into the Balkan War on the side of the Muslims, and in this connection the battle in Gorazde was to be the opening salvo for the offensive.<p>

Indeed, the chain of command of the Bosnian Muslim forces in Gorazde clearly demonstrates the significance that Sarajevo attached to the city.  The main Bosnian Muslim unit  in Gorazde was the 2nd Brigade (over 2,000 troops), answering directly to the 1st Corps, also known as the East Bosnian Operations Group, in Sarajevo.  Sarajevo also deployed to Gorazde a number of <B>Mujahideen</b> and Islamist Commandos operating under the 1st tactical Group.  In addition, deployed to Gorazde were several Special forces teams comprised of the best formations of the 'Delta" and "Laste" units.  This entire force was rounded out by units drawn from the local population and organized by the Interior ministry and was, in turn, augmented by Troops of the Interior Ministry who were highly trained and politically dedicated.<p>

Further, in early April 1994, as the fighting around Gorazde developed into a Bosnian Serb attack on two main axes (south and east) with an additional thrust from the north, the main muslim forces were reorganized into the 2nd Brigade (eastern approaches) and the 31st Brigade (southern approaches), as well as the Special Forces under the centralized command.  later still, a third "Brigade" was established on an <em>ad hoc</em> basis to meet the northern thrust.  Altogether, the Bosnian Muslims had in Gorazde at the beginning of the siege around 5,000 regular troops and over 5,000 militia and Interior ministry troops.  In addition there was an undetermined number of armed volunteers for the defense of various buildings.  Taken together, the Bosnian Muslim command had a total of 12,000 to 15,000 armed men in Gorazde, with 8,000 troops in three organized Brigade-type units.<p>

Against this backdrop, in the first two weeks of March, the Gorazde front was unusually quiet, with Bosnian Muslim forces remaining uncharacteristically passive even as fighting erupted elsewhere in Bosnia-Herzegovina.  yet, even still, there were indications that preparations were being made for major actions in the Gorazde pocket.  as before, such preparations would not have been possible without acquiescence of the UN.<p>

Indeed, there is evidence that humanitarian aid convoys, sanctioned by the UN, assisted in the transfer of equipment and goods to Gorazde.  For example, on 14 march, Bosnian Serb inspection teams in the Sokolac heliport discovered an attempt to smuggle electronic equipment, hard currency and Bosnian Government documents into Gorazde. (Since Gorazde is surrounded, the money may have been intended for use in cross-front line special operations and smuggling.)<p>

In any case, as of mid-march 1994 there was a significant increase in forward reconnaissance patrols by Bosnian Muslim Special Forces.  Many of these patrols were armed reconnaissance missions prodding the Bosnian Serb defenses through localized attacks.  As it turned out, these attacks on the Bosnian Serb positions were the prelude for a full fledged assault.  Thus, on 20 march 1994, the Bosnian Muslims opened artillery fire from the Gorazde pocket on Bosnian Serb positions between Foca and Cajnice, shattering a previously negotiated ceasefire.<p> 

Over the next few days, there was an escalation in the Bosnian Muslim attacks, including major attacks by infantry assault groupings with fire support from mortars and small calibre automatic guns.  By the 25th, the Bosnian Muslim activities had become a major region-wide offensive.  as already noted, the main thrust of this offensive was aimed at a gap between Foca and Cajnice, merely 17-18 kms from the center of Gorazde which, if secured, would serve as an ideal invasion route into Montenegro.  (Both Belgrade and Pale insist that the strategic aim of the Muslim offensive was to cross the Serb border in order to involve Serbia in the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina, thus creating a justification for Western military action against Belgrade.)<p>

In any case, the Bosnian Serbs were caught unprepared and it was not until 28 and 29 March that their reinforcements reached the Foce and Cajnice area.  By that point, the Bosnian Muslim forces had penetrated 5-7 kms into the Serb lines, a thin Special Forces spearhead reaching as deep as 10 kms.  Subsequently, the Bosnian Serbs deployed their artillery and begun shelling the rear area of the Muslim forces, mainly in the southern outskirts of Gorazde along the Drina river.  Initially short of ground forces, the Bosnian Serbs were able to block the Muslims' advance with heavy artillery fire.  Furthermore, the Bosnian Serb High Command decided to conserve its arriving infantry forces for a counteroffensive, and instead concentrated on inflicting attrition on the Bosnian Muslim units.<p>

Meanwhile, on March 28, sensing that a Bosnian Serb counter-offensive was imminent, Sarajevo began a propaganda campaign focussed on Bosnian Serb artillery attacks against civilians in Gorazde.  It was the first time the Bosnian Muslims had raised the issue of the humanitarian situation in Gorazde, and it would, in time, come to represent a pattern.<p>

Subsequently, on 29 March, the Bosnian Serb forces launched a major counter-offensive on the right bank of the Drina river, between Osanica and Ustipraca in the general direction of Cajnice.  The Bosnian Serbs used artillery, tanks, and infantry and soon breached the Muslim lines.  Muslim sources claimed that Serb reinforcements were arriving from across the Serb border, but this could not be independently confirmed and both pale and Belgrade vehemently denied the allegation.<p>

In point of fact, there were troop movements in Montenegro because Belgrade had ordered the reinforcement of its forces in the Montenegro-Bosnia border area.  However, there is no independent evidence that any of these forces actually crossed the border into Bosnia, or that they had participated in the fighting in any other form up to that date.<p>

On 30 March, the Bosnian Serbs begun their counter-offensive with infantry and tank attacks supported by massive artillery fire from both small calibre automatic guns and hovitzers.  the main accomplishment of this operation was the containment of the Bosnian Muslim advance.  However, soon afterwards, the Bosnian Serb forces begun themselves moving toward Gorazde along the Praca valley, slowly pushing back the Bosnian Muslim bulge.<p>

Meanwhile, Bosnian Serb reinforcements deployed all around the Gorazde pocket, especially from the north and south-east, and began preparations for a major assault in the hopes of seizing at least one of the main roads leading from east of the Drina river to the Adriatic.  For its part, Sarajevo propaganda alleged that sizeable reinforcements from Serbia proper were being deployed for the conduct of this offensive.<p>

In any case, at about the time when it was clear to Sarajevo that its forces would not be able to maintain their offensive, a propaganda blitz about the fate of the civilians in Gorazde began.  This campaign was not without effect, for the plight of the civilians in Gorazde, especially the children, rapidly became a major issue in the international media.<p>

Indeed, on 30 March, the US Ambassador to the United Nations Organization, Ms. Madeleine Albright, and Gen. John Shalikashvili, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, arrived in Sarajevo for an unprecedented visit aimed at demonstrating US support for the plight of the Bosnian Muslims.  In the aftermath of this visit, President Izetbegovic and his closest aides became convinced that the US Government was determined to ensure a Muslim victory in the war even if that meant American participation in the fighting.<p>

Indeed, it has been reliably reported that the leaders in Sarajevo concluded that what was needed to get America in the war on its side was a major traumatic event that would galvanize American public opinion and drive Washington to intervene militarily in the Balkans.  Thus, over the next few weeks, Sarajevo would use the fighting in Gorazde in an attempt to instigate such a US intervention.<p>

In the meantime, on the morning of 31 march, in order to reduce the Bosnian Serb pressure, the Bosnian Muslims attempted a counter-offensive of their own in the direction of Cajnica.  Special reinforcements of Bosnian Muslim infantry were rushed overnight to the front to support this action which it was hoped, if successful, would put the Bosnian Muslim forces once more on the short road into Serbia proper.<p>

Sarajevo assumed, correctly as it turned out, that under such circumstances the Bosnian Serbs would divert forces to block the Muslims before they reached the border and crossed into Serbia.  For its part, Sarajevo hoped that it wold be sufficient for its forces merely to reach, without actually crossing, the border to provoke the Serbian Army to enter the fighting.  In the event, the Bosnian Muslim forces failed to breach the Bosnian Serb lines and began to retreat.  Subsequently, the Bosnian Serbs shelled the Bosnian Muslim reinforcement throughout their withdrawal into Gorazde.<P>

Meanwhile, the main Bosnian Serb counter-offensive began on 31st march.  Newly arrived forces, still haphazardly organized, began advancing toward the Gorazde pocket from several directions.  The Bosnian Serbs used artillery fire both to cover the advance of their infantry and to shell the Muslim rear, including the town itself.  Because of the small size of Gorazde, the Bosnian Muslim Army began using the tallest buildings in the town, especially the roof of the hospital, as observation posts and command centers for directing their artillery against the advancing Bosnian Serbs.  The Bosnian Serb artillery sought to silence these facilities and therefore fired upon the hospital despite the propaganda ramifications that such action entailed.  In any case, by the end of 31 March, the arriving Bosnian Serb forces, although still unorganized, had completed the encirclement of the Gorazde pocket.<p>

On April 1, the better organized Bosnian Serb forces began rolling back the Bosnian Muslim bulge, capturing most of the territory gained in the Muslim offensive.  The containment of this offensive convinced Sarajevo that its strategic gambit in the Gorazde area was already doomed from the military point of view.  Therefore, Sarajevo shifted its emphasis in this crisis from a mission to secure a strategic-military objective (getting Serbia involved in the Bosnian war) to the more explicitly political-military objective of getting the U.S. involved.  Indeed, on 1 April, the Bosnian Prime Minister, Harris Silajdzic, began urging Western/US/UN active intervention against the Bosnian Serbs in order to prevent a "humanitarian tragedy" in Gorazde.<p>

In the meantime, on 2 April, the Bosnian Serb forces continued to push back the Bosnian Muslim bulge.  With a growing number senior officers in the area, the Bosnian Serb forces were becoming better organized and therefore more effective.  Consequently, the Bosnian Serbs began gravitating toward two main axes of advance on Gorazde, from the east and from the south.<p>

On 3 and 4 April, the Bosnian Muslims decided to exploit this concentration of the Bosnian Serb forces by trying to disrupt their balance through attacks from other directions.  Therefore, a series of hastily organized offensives was launched from inside the Gorazde pocket.  The first offensive was westward in the direction of the road to Sarajevo.  This maneuver was launched in the slim hope of breaking the siege, but mainly in order to draw Bosnian Serb forces away from their advance on Gorazde. (It was assumed in Sarajevo that the UN would soon break the siege even though the Bosnian Serbs would not permit humanitarian aid convoys to reach Gorazde.)<p>

The other Muslim offensive moved northward, toward Zepa, in tandem with the Bosnian Serb southward offensive.  Here the idea was for the Muslim force to encircle the Bosnian Serb spearhead that has just begun advancing toward the Pobjeda ammunition factory.  If successful, the Bosnian Muslim Special Forces would be in an position to hit the Bosnian Serb forces from the flanks and rear. As it was, the Bosnian Muslims committed a force that was too small to accomplish its intended objectives and its success was therefore negligible.  meanwhile, the Bosnian Serbs continued to rush reinforcements of infantry and trucks into what was rapidly escalating into a major battle.<p>

Meanwhile, in late March, on the order of Sarajevo High Command, Special Forces (reconnaissance-intelligence units) of the East Bosnian Operations Group -- components of the Delta and Laste Special Forces units -- were deployed to Gorazde by infiltrating them through Serb-held territory.  Subsequently, the Bosnian Muslim Special Forces in Gorazde were regrouped into detachments, including a mix of both Bosnian Muslims and 'Afghan' <b>Mujahideen</b>.<p>

By the last days of April these forces began operating against the Bosnian Serb columns advancing from the Foca area.  in one of their first operations they attacked a convoy of 30 trucks carrying -- according to Sarajevo -- Russian and Romanian mercenaries arriving from Serbia.  Meanwhile, the Bosnians continued to blame the Bosnian Serbs for indiscriminately bombing Gorazde.<p>

On April 4 emboldened by early success of their special operations, Sarajevo decided to use irregular warfare in a strategic attempt to reverse the collapse of the Bosnian Muslim offensive.  Detachments of Bosnian Muslim Special Forces (both Bosnian Muslims and 'Afghan' <b>Mujahideen</b>) advanced from Podkozare, Paljike and Oglecevo in the direction of the Foca-Cajnice salient.  their mission was to attack Bosnian Serb forces in the rear in order to slow their pressure on the remnants of the original bulge.  When clashes erupted, the Bosnian Muslim units provided their Special Forces with fire cover from light artillery and mortars.  Fierce but localized infantry and artillery clashes ensued and the Special Forces were compelled to withdraw to their start line.<p>

It was only on the night of 4 April that the Muslims finally abandoned their original plan to advance toward Cajnice.  That evening they began pulling their forces back from the bulge and into the confines of Gorazde.  The Bosnian Serbs were slow to exploit this success, as well as reluctant to change the main axis of their own advance which was from the east.<p>

Meanwhile, also on 4 April, the Bosnian Serb forces began advancing westward toward the east bank of the Drina, capturing several villages and turning them into fortified areas.  For their part, the Bosnian Muslims evacuated all civilians except for those capable of rendering service to the military and interior ministry forces. In the meantime, the Bosnian Serb forces -- infantry escorted by a few tanks -- continued their slow but steady advance under intense fire support (artillery and MBRL) barrages.  At this point the Bosnian Muslim defense lines began to crumble.  (The Bosnian Serb assault forces, according to Sarajevo, was composed of 50 tanks.  This suggests a reinforcement of under 15 tanks, taking the Serb losses into consideration.)<p>

Despite the active resistance of the Bosnian Muslims all around Gorazde. the Bosnian Serbs continued their own renewed offensive on the night of 4 and 5 April.  On the road to Sarajevo, the local Bosnian Serb forces were able to contain and then defeat the Bosnian Muslim assault after a brief yet fierce clash.  the Bosnian Muslim detachments then withdrew back behind their lines, but the Bosnian Serb forces were too small to give chase and the action was broken off.<p>

In the meantime, in the northern corridor, Bosnian Serb Special forces began moving against their Muslim counterparts.  the Serbs ambushed the Muslims, neutralizing them to some degree, thereby allowing the main Bosnian Serb advance toward the ammunition factory to proceed.  Additional reinforcements of tanks, artillery and trucks were rushed by the Bosnian Srbs to support this advance as soon as the Serb heavy guns began destroying the Pobjeda factory.<p>

The 5th of April saw fierce infantry clashes on the eastern approaches to Gorazde as the Bosnian Serbs continued breaking through the Bosnian Muslim defense lines.  In due course, the High Command in Sarajevo conceded that the Bosnian Serbs had succeeded in breaching the Bosnian Muslim defense lines to such extent that the whole front was in danger of collapse.  (Most important was the collapse of the Muslim defenses in the villages of Vitkovci and Mravici.)<p>

It was at this point, on 5 of April, that Pale began considering exploiting its counteroffensive in order to severely hit the Gorazde pocket, if not destroy it.  Bosnian Serb forces could reach at least one of the major strategic highways along the Drina river, and Pale was now convinced that the Muslim offensive was finally crushed.  Thus, some of the Bosnian Serb truck-mounted infantry was now diverted from facing the Muslim offensive and was sent to complete a deep encirclement of the Bosnian Muslim front lines.  This maneuver brought The Bosnian Serb infantry to the banks of the Drina river and signaled the beginning of yet another advance on Gorazde.  By the end of the day the Bosnian Serb forces had reached between 3 and 10 kilometers from the center of Gorazde, arriving from the east and south.<p>

the strategic decisions of Pale were reflected in the final organization of the Bosnian Serb armed forces.  pale now nominated the Chief of Staff, General Manojlo Milovanovic, as the supreme commander of the Gorazde front and immediately ordered rushing of additional reinforcements to the eastern approaches of Gorazde in order to support and sustain the advance.  by now, the Bosnian Serbs had amassed a powerful force in the area with Gen. Radovan Grubac, Commander of the Herzegovina Corps, as the senior field commander.<p> 

The Bosnian Serb forces included most of the Hercegovina Corps ( which carried the main brunt of the first phase of the fighting), components of the Uzice Corps (that would arrive in early April) and the Sarajevo-Mt. Romanija Corps (impacting on the Gorazde pocket from the west but not involved in the main action), as well as Special Forces from the Nis area.  At the beginning of the counter-offensive the  Bosnian Serbs had around 5,000 high quality troops, and by mid-April this number had reached some 7,000.  The  Bosnian  Serb forces also had a few thousand paramilitary and militia troops, organized in small units, for auxiliary tasks.<p>

Meanwhile, the  Bosnian  Muslim Special Forces and other elite units began attempting to infiltrate the  Bosnian  Serb lines from Sarajevo in order to link up with Gorazde.  these attempts developed into a hot pursuit operation and involved clashes with  Bosnian Serb forces in the mountains surrounding Sarajevo.  Subsequently, Sarajevo complained to the UN that the  Bosnian  Serbs were violating the ceasefire and the NATO ultimatum.<p>

On 6 April, large units of  Bosnian Serb forces began their advance from the Cajnice and Foca salient toward the Drina river.  Ultimately, the Serbs came within a half kilometer of Vitkovici.  Meanwhile as the  Bosnian  Serbs were consolidating their advance through the breaches of the Muslim lines, they brought more artillery pieces -- heavy and automatic small caliber -- to forward positions and began hitting greater parts of Gorazde.<p>

All this time,  Bosnian Serb infantry continued to mop up pockets of resistance in the fortified areas captured from the  Bosnian  Muslim forces.  there was extremely bad weather that day, including 10 hours of snowfall, which slowed down activity in the northern approaches to Gorazde.  Still, the shelling of Gorazde persisted.<p>

During the night of 6 April and early morning of 7 April, Bosnian Serb forces continued their advance northward.  By morning the Serbs had consolidated positions on the banks of the Drina river near Vitkovici, some 4 kilometers from Gorazde itself.  meanwhile, the  Bosnian  Muslim defense lines in the Oglecevo zone collapsed and the Gorazde command ordered the evacuation of its positions in that area.<p>

Also on 6 April the double character of Sarajevo's depiction of events in Gorazde became clear.  On the one hand, Sarajevo was presenting an impression to the Western media that a near defenseless Gorazde, full of civilians and innocents, was on the brink of collapse.  On the other hand, the government propaganda depicted for domestic consumption a case of heroic and successful offensive.  While admitting the collapse of certain defense lines, Sarajevo nevertheless stressed that the Muslim defenders were inflicting "heavy losses" on the Serbs.<p>

Significantly, the Sarajevo propaganda also introduced, for the first time, explicit demands that the West intervene militarily to save the city.  in fact, Sarajevo introduced the theme of Western intervention because it already knew that the US, UNPROFOR, and NATO, had decided to create in Gorazde circumstances permitting NATO airstrikes within the confines of the existing UN resolutions and guidelines.<p>

Thus on 7 April, the UN deployed 8 soldiers to Gorazde in order to give itself a legal pretext for its planned airstrikes. (Under the existing UN resolutions, military action could only be undertaken to defend UN personnel.)  Furthermore, the troops deployed by the UN belonged to the British elite SAS who were qualified and specially equipped to call in and direct airstrikes.  In other words, UNPROFOR deployed at one stroke both the excuse and the means to deliver airstrikes against the  Bosnian Serbs.  In addition, 7 UN liaison officers were also deployed to the  Bosnian  Muslim forces in Gorazde.  No attempt was made to deploy a comparable force of UN liaison officers with the  Bosnian Serbs.<p>

Meanwhile, after hectic negotiations between UNPROFOR, Sarajevo and Pale, the  Bosnian Serbs agreed to a ceasefire.  On the evening of 6 April, the  Bosnian  Serbs ceased the shelling.  "Gorazde is no longer under attack since 1800 local time," UN spokesman Joe Sills announced.  However, the  Bosnian  Muslims complained that the  Bosnian Serb forces were continuing to advance, consolidate and improve their positions virtually until the last moment of the fighting.<p>

Nonetheless, the next day even radio Sarajevo admitted that the Bosnian Serb shelling had "abated somewhat" even though, the Muslims insisted, the Bosnian Serbs continued to violate the ceasefire.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, by nightfall the ceasefire had all but collapsed with both Bosnian Serb and Bosnian Muslim forces provoking each other into exchanges of gunfire.  At that same time, Sarajevo resumed its propaganda accounts of intense Bosnian Serb shelling and mounting civilian casualties.  It was at this point that the saga of the Gorazde hospital began.<p>

The night of 7-8 April saw the first large scale use of Bosnian Serb Special Forces.  They crossed the Muslim defense lines from south to east of Gorazde and began attacking the Muslims from the rear.  The Serbs created havoc and hastened the collapse of Muslim defense positions in some areas.  Later, on 8 April, the Bosnian Serb infantry forces overwhelmed the defenders of Oglecevo after a fierce battle and then proceeded to clear Vitkovici.<p>

On 9 April, the Bosnian Serb forces advancing from the east were finally able to reach and seize a strategic plateau overlooking Gorazde, called Mount Gradina.  Although there are easy approach routes from there into Gorazde, the Bosnian Serbs did not show any inclination to continue into the city itself.  Instead, they began to consolidate their position, organize fire observation posts and prepare the area for the arrival of their artillery.  Indeed, UNPROFOR concluded that the Bosnian Serbs did not want to take Gorazde and estimated that, in any case, the Serbs were already holding 7.5% of the territory of the original Gorazde pocket.<p>

Meanwhile, Bosnian Muslim Special Forces raided Bosnian Serb positions, instigating a Bosnian Serb shelling of Gorazde.  This incident was depicted by the Western media in Sarejevo as an example of Bosnian Serb aggression against innocent civilians in Gorazde.  Indeed, special attention was paid to the frequent fire aimed at the hospital -- which was also the main Muslim observation and battle management post -- to drum up support for Western action against the Serbs.  Subsequently, the UN and NATO were asked to launch airstrikes in order to protect the UN troops that had been inserted into Gorazde.<p>

It is also  noteworthy that on 9 April the Bosnian Serbs agreed to a UNPROFOR initiative to begin ceasefire negotiations in the Sarajevo airport.  The Bosnian Muslims refused to attend this meeting.<p>

On 10 April, Bosnian Serb forces continued to advance slowly, mainly consolidating positions and accomplishing tactical improvements.  These forces were also able to complete the capture of a few Bosnian Serb villages on the approaches to Gorazde.  The Bosnian Serb forces were now only some 6 km from Gorazde and were increasing their effort to advance in the direction of Metvici and the ammunition factory.<p>

At this point, the road was opened for the Bosnian Serbs to capture a major Muslim stronghold in Uhotici Brdo, some 700m from the Drina, a key to the defense of the southern approaches to Gorazde.  Subsequently, the Bosnian Serbs destroyed the bridge over the Drina at Sadba, complicating any effort to resupply Gorazde.  Another bridge, at Bacci, was damaged by Bosnian Serb artillery and Bosnian Serb Special Forces crossed the Drina to the west bank of the river for the first time on 10 April.  All this time the shelling of Gorazde itself continued.<p>

The NATO bombing raids, carried out by US fighters, were conducted on 10 and 11 April against Bosnian Serb positions in the Gorazde area.  The UK SAS FACs guiding the strike aircraft were within visual range of the intended objectives and the bombing were clearly aimed at stopping the Bosnian Serb advance on Gorazde.  Nevertheless, undaunted, the Bosnian Serbs continued their shelling of Gorazde.  Sarajevo used the Bosnian Serb defiance to justify the second raid.<p>

Significantly, even though the airstrikes were officially launched in order to protect the lives of UNPROFOR personnel in Gorazde, there is some evidence of coordination with, or at the least advance knowledge among the Bosnian Muslim forces that theses strikes were coming.  For example, Bosnian Serb military intelligence claims that the Muslim forces in Gorazde and Sarajevo were discussing both air raids by radio about four hours before the raids were actually launched.  Indeed, Bosnian Muslim Special Forces deployed to advanced positions in the areas to be bombed in order to be ready to exploit the confusion caused to the Serbs by the NATO attacks.<p>

It was at this point that UNPROFOR arranged ceasefire on 11 April.  At first, the Bosnian Serb artillery honored the ceasefire and UNPROFOR acknowledged that the Bosnian Serbs were holding their fire.  However, soon afterwards, several Muslim raids were finally answered by the Bosnian Serbs.  A clash ensued and quickly escalated into a firefight that included the use of artillery and mortars on both sides.  Frustrated and defiant, Pale announced that it was no longer recognizing Gorazde as a safe area and proceeded to order the resumption of fighting and shelling.<p>

thus on 12 April, the Bosnian Serbs resumed their pressure on Gorazde.  At the same time 
, the Serb infantry was expediting preparations for a major offensive.  Indeed, the movement of fresh forces toward, and the regrouping of, the locally deployed forces suggested preparations for a major thrust into the Gorazde pocket.  In response, the Bosnian Muslim forces attempted a localized counterattack southward along the Drina river but were contained by the Bosnian Serbs.  The Bosnian Muslims also opened artillery and mortar fire from inside Gorazde.  Exchange of fire ensued and reports of civilian casualties inside Gorazde increased.<p>

Meanwhile, deep raids by Bosnian Serb Special Forces continued to increase both in number and in the depth of their penetration.  A major byproduct of these Serb efforts was that Gorazde had to divert several of its own Special Forces to hunt their Bosnian Serb counterparts inside the Muslim held area rather than raid behind the Bosnian Serb lines.  The aggregate impact of the continued Bosnian Serb shelling and special operations brought Gorazde near to collapse.<p>

Thus, by 13 April, the fighting near Gorazde had become completely politicized with a fundamental difference between the objectives of UNPROFOR and those of the Bosnian Government becoming manifest.  The UN was determined to arrange a ceasefire so that the killing of civilians inside Gorazde would be stopped.  By contrast, Sarajevo, with massive support from the US, was adamant on reversing its military defeat -- itself a result of the failure of the Bosnian Muslims' own offensive -- through "diplomatic processes," namely, international pressure on the Bosnian Serbs.  Therefore, it was in Sarajevo's own interest to ensure that the ceasefires collapsed as that would increase the pressure on the Serbs to withdraw and on the West to launch military action against the Serbs.<p>

Indeed, a cyclic routine aimed at instigating a major Western intervention on behalf of the Bosnian Muslims now developed in Gorazde.  It went as follows: At first, the Bosnian Serbs declared a unilateral ceasefire, negotiating details with UNPROFOR.  The Serb forces would then cease fire - more or less, given their endemic problems with command control over the various militias.  Then the Bosnian Muslims would provoke the Bosnian Serbs with mortar attacks, special raids, etc.  Within a short time the Bosnian Serb forces would respond, sending a massive barrage into Gorazde.  In due course, the Western media would then report unprovoked Bosnian Serb shelling of the civilian population, which would then prompt the US/UN/NATO to threaten military action.  The Bosnian Serbs would then agree to declare a new unilateral ceasefire and the whole cycle would begin again.<p>

At least initially, UNPROFOR seemed to recognize this pattern.  Fro example, Gen. Rose, the UN ground commander, asked the Muslims "to stop their provocations in Gorazde."  Indeed, in an interview with French TV (TF-1) on April 12, Gen. Rose acknowledged that the Muslims "shoot on the Serbs to step up the pressure and to obtain a fresh intervention from NATO."<P>

Nevertheless, faced with repeated threats of airstrikes, as well as intense NATO air activities around Gorazde, the Bosnian Serb High Command in Pale ordered that NATO aircraft involved in such activities be considered as legitimate targets.  By now, the NATO aircraft, mainly US strike aircraft, were repeatedly conducting "dry runs," that is simulated strikes, aimed at deterring and stopping Bosnian Serb troop movements.  Since no ordinance was actually dropped, such "maneuvers" were permitted by the "letter" of the UN/NATO mandate, although their clear objective to harass the Bosnian Serbs was stretching it a bit.<p>

Against this backdrop, on 13 April, fighting around Gorazde was limited to localized infantry clashes, mainly attempts by both sides to make tactical adjustments and prevent the other side from doing the same.  In this context, the Bosnian Serb shelling of Gorazde was limited to brief but intense responses to Muslim provocations.  However, on 14 April, there was a major escalation of the Bosnian Muslim provocation effort, as well as in the Bosnian Serb response to it, that was both militarily futile and politically disastrous.<p>

What transpired went as follows:  The Bosnian Muslim forces, including a majority of their mortars and artillery, were concentrated next to the facilities of the red Cross - a clearly marked building in the center of Gorazde.  When the Muslim infantry launched a series of localized attacks on the Bosnian Serb forces advancing northward on both banks of the Drina river, infantry fighting and clashes soon expanded along the entire front line east of Gorazde.  All this time, the attacking Bosnian Muslim infantry were provided with intense fire support from the mortars and small calibre automatic guns deployed in the immediate vicinity of the Red Cross building.<p>

Needless to say, it did not take long for the Bosnian Serbs to react to this action.  In due course, the Bosnian Serb infantry, with direct support from tanks and small caliber guns, after hours of intense fighting, were able to block and reverse the Bosnian Muslim attacks.  Indeed, in some sectors, the local Bosnian Serb commanders exploited the collapse of the Bosnian Muslim attacks to make local advances with their own forces, tightening the siege of Gorazde.  An outgrowth of this was the link-up of all Bosnian Serb forces advancing from the south and southeast so that a unified thrust was formed.<p>

Once that was done, the Bosnian Serbs directed their attention to the source of the long-range fire being aimed at them from the area of the Red Cross building.  Thus, Bosnian Serb artillery began intense counter-battery fire into the concentration of Bosnian Muslim fire, hitting the Red Cross building in the process.  Other Bosnian Serb guns shelled Gorazde itself.<p>
 
The moment Bosnian Serb shells began falling in the vicinity of the Red Cross building, the Muslim propaganda machine went into action.  "Ham radio" reports out of Gorazde began giving accounts of intentional Bosnian Serb shelling of the hospital and the red Cross building.  These reports came in addition to the regular reports of heavy casualties among the civilian population.  Needless to say, Sarajevo capitalized on these reports to coax the UN/NATO into taking further military action against the Bosnian Serb forces.<p>

On 15 April, realizing that the fighting in the Gorazde area was inly going to escalate, Pale ordered the Bosnian Serb forces to resume their advance on the city.  The primary objective was to establish Bosnian Serb control over the eastern bank of the Drina so that at least one of the highways to the Adriatic would remain under Bosnian Serb control.  Consequently, the Bosnian Serb forces advancing from the east resumed their attack.<p>

By the end of the next day (16 April) the Serbs had completed the capture of two strategic peaks -- Gradina and Jartiste -- located some 5 km east from Gorazde.  this area was the launching place for the main Bosnian Muslim offensive in the direction of Cajnice and also benefited from the fact that it was an ideal site for launching long range artillery fire.<p>

In mid April, with Gorazde seemingly on the verge of collapse, NATO air operations and related military activities intensified.  The British SAS teams significantly expanded the zone of their infiltration activities in order to identify, locate and mark Bosnian Serb targets for subsequent air attacks.  On 15 April, one team operating in the Jabuka Sedlo mountain pass deep inside Bosnian Serb territory clashed with a local Bosnian Serb unit.  One of the SAS troops was killed and another wounded in the ensuing firefight.<p>

Meanwhile, NATO aircraft also expanded their reconnaissance and simulated strikes against Bosnian Serb forces in the Gorazde area as the Bosnian Serbs, in turn, continued firing on NATO aircraft.  On 15 April, the Bosnian Serbs hit a French Super Etendard IV-P on a reconnaissance mission.  On 16 April, a Sea Harrier from the British aircraft carrier HMS Ark Royal was shot down as it was attempting, along with several US A-10s, to strike (still conducting preparatory dry runs) Serb positions.  The Sea Harrier was shot down with an SA-7, and pilot bailed out safely and landed inside Gorazde.<p>

Subsequently, the Bosnian Serbs denied shooting down the British warplane.  Indeed, the Bosnian Serb High Command insists that Muslim forces shot down the Sea Harrier.  They point out that the aircraft was hit over Gorazde itself and that the pilot landed in the middle of the Muslim area.  Furthermore, Bosnian Serb military intelligence claims to have intercepted a message from the High Command in Gorazde to the General Staff in Sarajevo informing them of the successful comletion of the order to shoot down the plane.<p>

Whatever the truth of the matter was, soon afterward several US and UK planes launched simulated bombing and strafing runs over the Bosnian Serb forces around Gorazde that were so realistic that even the UNPROFOR spokesman in Sarajevo first described them as actual bombing raids in retaliation for the downing of the Sea Harrier.  It was only a few hours later that UNPROFOR rushed to deny its own announcement, stressing that no ordnance was actually dropped in the course of these airstrikes.<p>

Meanwhile, UN observers were randomly deployed in the forward Bosnian Muslim positions, at times only 500 meters from the front line, without any advance warning to the Bosnian Serb side.  Consequently, UNPROFOR personnel would suddenly appear in a Bosnian Muslim position in the middle of a firefight demanding that the Bosnian Serbs hold their fire or else risk NATO airstrikes.  In other cases, the Muslims simulated a bogus UNPROFOR presence, trying to affect a unilateral Bosnian Serb cessation of fire the moment things went bad for themselves.<p>

Against this backdrop, around 15 April, Sarajevo's propaganda campaign began to significantly intensify.  The leaders of Sarajevo began complaining to the world media that the UN was not protecting the innocent in Gorazde -- overlooking the fact that such action was never contemplated in the UN mandate -- and began urging resolute armed intervention against the Bosnian Serbs.  At the same time, reports of atrocities in Gorazde continued to flow in along with calls for help from the city.<p>

In the meantime, the Bosnian Serbs were firmly holding all the strategic points surrounding Gorazde and their forces were ready to launch an advance into the city proper if instructed to do so.  However, at this point, the Bosnian Serb leadership was still against such a move.  Instead, the local Serb forces were instructed to send in patrols to map and test the defenses of Gorazde.<p>

Some of these Bosnian Serb patrols, usually comprising an infantry platoon with 1 or 2 tanks, were able to enter the city itself, though normally withdrew after a short time.  In addition, Bosnian Serb Special Forces deployed in the immediate vicinity of the town, directing sniperfire at Bosnian Muslim military personnel in order to prevent the Muslims from directing their forces.  Even though the highest levels at Pale repeatedly assured th UN that they had no intention of seizing Gorazde, the Sarajevo propaganda machine continued to warn of the imminent fall of the city.<p>

In this context, on 17 April, in a passionate speech on Radio Sarajevo, Izetbegovic called on the defenders of Gorazde to hold out despite the intense casualties they were suffering.  At the same time the Bosnian government continued to urge the West/US/UN/NATO to launch airstrikes on the Bosnian Serbs near Gorazde.<p>

Meanwhile, by about this time, the Bosnian Serbs had developed a routine for dealing with the Gorazde situation militarily.  The Bosnian Serb forces would conduct a combination of sporadic shellings and prodding patrols in and out of Gorazde, at times getting close to the center of the city in order to demonstrate their ability to take it at will.  These operations were augmented in raids by the Bosnian Serb Special Forces that would be undertaken during the night.  The aggregate impact of such tactics proved highly effective at increasing the level of tension among the Muslim forces in Gorazde while requiring only minimal effort by the Bosnian Serbs themselves.  The Bosnian Serbs also concentrated on better dispersing and camouflaging their equipment in view of the intensifying NATO air reconnaissance and simulated strikes.<p>

Then, on 17 April, pursuant to their own unilateral ceasefire, the Bosnian Serbs withdrew their main tanks and guns to a distance of 3 kms from the hospital area.  The Bosnian Muslim forces exploited the absence of the heavy guns and opened fire on the Bosnian Serb positions, and in two strategic sectors --the approaches to Ustipraca and Kopaci -- tried to launch infantry attacks to seize the Bosnian Serb positions.  The Bosnian Serbs responded by shelling and deploying tanks back to their positions, effectively negating their promise of a ceasefire and unilateral disengagement.<p>

However, in the aftermath of one Bosnian Muslim infantry attack, the Bosnian Serbs counterattacked and seized strategically located Biserna Hill, thus assuring their control over the entire east bank of the Drina all the way to the approaches to Gorazde itself.  The forward Bosnian Serb units established positions virtually inside Gorazde, while in the north the withdrawal of Bosnina Serb forces toward Kopaci was reversed and the tanks and infantry stormed the Bosnian Muslim positions, penetrating deeply through their defense lines.<p>

With the Bosnian Muslims complaining of ammunition shortages, the Bosnian Serbs insisted on thorough inspection of humanitarian convoys before they were allowed to go to Gorazde through the Bosnian Serb lines.  Considering that the UN had been instrumental in building the Bosnian Muslim forces in Gorazde, it was not an illogical demand.  However, Sarajevo would hear nothing of it, stressing it would not permit convoys "to be tampered with" by the Bosnian Serbs to enter Gorazde.  An impasse developed and the Bosnian propaganda machine intensified its outcries of a humanitarian disaster in Gorazde, citing huge numbers of wounded and fatalities.<p>

Meanwhile, on 18 April, Karadzic promised to implement yet another ceasefire and withdraw some of his heavy weapons 3 km away from the outskirts of Gorazde as the first phase of a regional ceasefire.  Once again, soon after the Bosnian Serb withdrawal began, the Bosnian Muslim forces opened fire on the Bosnian Serb positions, and again the Bosnian Serbs turned around and resumed shelling.<p>

Also on 18 April, the Bosnian Muslims established a new long-range fire position in a five story building that had been used previously by UNPROFOR observers.  Indeed, the UN was still using the 5th floor facility while the Bosnian Muslims fortified the 3rd and 4th floors. (The Bosnian Muslims established fire positions for heavy machine guns on the 4th floor, and for automatic small caliber guns on the 3rd.  Ultimately, the Bosnian Muslims would even go so far as to establish a fire control and command post on the 5th floor.) Firing from this building enabled the Bosnian Muslims to extend the range of their weapons.  Not surprisingly, it was not long before the Bosnian Serbs were accused of deliberately attacking a UN facility.<p>

Beginning on 19 April, the overall situation was further complicated when the Bosnian Serbs yet again tried to implement a unilateral ceasefire and withdraw 3 kms from the center of Gorazde.  Under extreme pressure from Pale, the local Bosnian Serb commanders finally restrained their forces, gradually reducing the level and intensity of their operations.<p>

In this connection, a problem developed regarding the locally recruited Bosnin Serb militias.  Many of the troops in these militias had been recruited from Gorazde and nearby villages that had been overrun by Muslim forces in 1992.  Now returning to their destroyed villages, these troops were supposed to serve as a home guard and police force for the Bosnian Serb rear.  However, with the main Bosnian Serb forces being withdrawn, these militiamen suddenly found themselves at the front where, needless to say, they could not resist firing (mainly small arms) at their Muslim adversaries.<p>

These Serb militia were the source of numerous ceasefire violations from the Bosnian Serb side as the Serb commanders had difficulty controlling and restraining them.  Thus, these militiamen turned into a serious political problem for the Bosnian Serbs.  Indeed, the Pale command should have known better than to deploying such units to the front, but senior officials in Pale insisted that they had no choice.<P>

In the meantime, on 20 April, Pale reiterated the Bosnian Serb commitment to the conditions of the unilateral ceasefire and partial withdrawal, and agreed to deployment of 100 UNPROFOR personnel to observe the ceasefire.  Nonetheless, reacting to reports of widespread civilian casualties and damage, NATO "considered in a favourable light" the request by Boutros Ghali, the UN Secretary-General, for wider airstrikes to protect not just Sarajevo and Gorazde, but all six "safe areas" declared by the UN.<P>

In the meantime, on 20 April, the Bosnian Serbs continued to have difficulties implementing their ceasefire due to Bosnian Muslim provocations and their own uncontrollable militiamen.  The Bosnian Muslim forces fired intense but brief barrages from their positions in the Un building, near the Red Cross building, and similar sites, instigating the inevitable Bosnian Serb reaction.  At this time Sarajevo propaganda described the Bosnian Serb withdrawals as the massing of Serb forces for a final assault on Gorazde.<p>

The reports of an all out Bosnian Serb offensive continued on 21 April, with the Bosnian Muslims reporting an avalanche of tanks closing in on Gorazde.  Sarajevo even insisted that surface to surfece missiles had been fired from inside Serbia into Gorazde.  nevertheless, on the basis of political discussions with the US and the West, Sarajevo was confident that NATO was about to bomb the Bosnian Serbs yet once more.<p>

Indeed, at the point when they expected further NATO action, Muslim infantry assembled near the bridges in Gorazde and other protected forward positions, ready to launch an attack that would exploit the NATO bombimgs.  When the Bosnian Muslims opened fire on the northern front, the Bosnian Serbs capitalized on this and launched an attack in the diraction of the Pobjeda ammunition factory - concentrating their artillery fire at the facility in order to cause maximum damage before their forces were compelled to withdraw beyond firing range.<p>

By 22 April, the Bosnian Muslim military and propaganda strategy seemed to have worked, especially since the Bosnian Serbs could not hold their fire long enough for their efforts at self-restraint to be verified.  Consequently, NATO issued an ultimatum to the Bosnian Serbs, warning them that they would be subjected to intense bombing if they did not implement their unilateral plan for a ceasefire.<p>

Thus, NATO demanded that all hostilities against Gorazde were to cease immediately.  The Bosnian Serb forces were to pull back 3 kms from the center of Gorazde, while pulling their heavy weapons back 20 kms.  In addition, the Bosnian Serbs were to permit UN and other humanitarian convoys to travel into and out of Gorazde as well as allow the evacuation of the wounded.<p>

at the same time, Muslim propaganda intensified as the Bosnian Serbs geared up to comply with the NATO ultimatum.  Furthermore, Washington was encouraged to expand NATO military intervention on the side of the Bosnian Muslims, promting Defense Secretary William Perry to say that US wanted NATO warplanes to launch :vigorous raids" against Bosnian Serb targets if the Bosnian Serbs did not stop shelling the Muslim safe havens.  Ultimately, by late evening of the next day, April 23, with the first UN convoy about to arrive, Sarajevo acknowledged that Bosnian Serb fire had "diminished" though it was not yet completely stopped.<p>

Thus, on 24 April, UNPROFOR units began deploying along the demarcation line between the Bosnian Muslim and Bosnian Serb forces.  The UN confirmed that the Bosnian Serb forces had completed their withdrawal beyond the 3km line, and a UNPROFOR team began assessing the damage and preparing for the evacuation of thousands of wounded civilians.  For their part, the Bosnian Muslims deployed Special Forces into the hills and began anbushing the withdrawing Bosnian Serb forces.  In response, the Bosnian Serbs began blowing up those facilities that they considered possible launching sites for such ambushes.<p>

However, befire withdrawing, the Bosnian Serbs also blew up segments of the Pobjeda ammunition factory as well as the water pumping and cooling system for the high explosives production line.  As long as the ammunition factory was not working, the besieged pocket had used water from this system for drinking, cooking and bathing.  Thus, the western media, inaccurately described the Bosnian Serb action as the intantional plowing up of the water system of Gorazde.<p>

In the meantime, due to the mountainous terrain and Muslim attacks, the Bosnian Serb withdrawal was progressing slowly, promting NATO to request permission to launch airstrikes on the withdrawing Bosnian Serb forces.  UN representative Akashi vetoed the request, stressing that the Bosnian Serbs were doing their best to comply with the UN conditions.<p>

Indeed, on 26 April, UNPROFOR expressed its satisfaction with the Bosnian Serb compliance of the withdrawal from the Gorazde area.  Still Sarajevo continued to insist that the Bosnian Serbs were violating the agreement and to demand NATO aerial bombing.  Meanwhile, ambushes by Bosnian Muslim Special Forces, as well as sporadic artillery and  mortar fire, continued -- all in an effort to provoke a Bosnian Serb response.<P>

On the evening of 26 April, UNPROFOR confirmed the successful completion of the pull back of the Bosnian Serb forces.  The next day, UNPROFOR teams began searching the exclusion zone for concealed Bosnian Serb forces and weapons, but none were found.  Nevertheless, Harris Silajdzic continued to insist that Bosnian Serb infantry forces were in Gorazde and to demand that NATO bomb them.<p>

That said, it was now possible to objectively asses the actual situation in Gorazde.  it soon became clear that the Bosnian Muslims had overstated the plight of the city.  The casualty levels were far below initial reports, wiht UNHCR, the most responsible among these reporting sources, having initially alleged there were 715 killed and 1970 wounded, over 600 of them serious and requiring evacuation by air.  Most of these casualties, the UNHCR stressed, were innocent civilians.  However, post action inspection revealed that there were some 200 fatalities and some 200 seriously wounded, 70% of them Muslim soldiers.<p>

The extent of the damage to the hospital and other buildings, not to speak of Gorazde overall, was far below what had been anticipated on the basis of radio reports.  Indeed, on 28 April, General Rose went on an inspection tour of the Gorazde enclave.  He returned full of criticism of the Bosnian Muslims, adding that they had exaggarated the number of wounded and the damage done to the town in the Bosnian Serb offensive in order to instigate NATO's military intervention.  General Rose stated:"The situation was a lot better than I had been led to believe.  One can only be pleased at that.  There was obviously damage to the town and you can't fight a battle around a town without there being damage to the town.  But the town had not been destroyed to the level which I had expected."<p>

In Sarajevo, a senior UN officer who visited Gorazde was more explicit:" reports of Gorazde were deliberately exaggerated in order to shame the world into doing something," he told <em> The NEw York Times</em>.  "The attacks were not of the dimension suggested.  A false impresion was given to the international community to help stir the vision of the Bosnian Serbs as the enemy and unfortunately, all this very nearly went out of control."<p>

The UN officer went on to warn that Gorazde would not be the last case of Sarajevo's exploitation of a militayr engagement to involve the West in the fighting.  "The big problem is that the Muslims believe they can bring the Americans into the war," the officer said.  "A dangerous overreaction was stirred up in international capitals.  The talk of wider use of NATO airpower, hitting ammunition dumps and infrastructure went well across the line that would have turned the UN forces here into combatants."<p>

Unfortunately, the warnings of this senior UN officer appear to have been all too accurate.  Immediately after the publication of his remarks, UN Ambassador Madeleine Albright lodged a strong complaint with the UN Secretary General in which the United States Government accused "in the strongest possible terms" top UN officials in the Balkans of, inthe words of <em> The New York Times</em>, "failing to support a more aggresive policy toward the Serbs" in Bosnia.  Washington, it seems, has not yet learned the lessons of the battle of Gorazde.<p>
