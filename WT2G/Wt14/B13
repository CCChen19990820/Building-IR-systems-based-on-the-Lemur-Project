						BOOTING UP YOUR PERSONAL LAWYER <p>Need a quickie sublease agreement or a simple freelance contract? <p>A virtual lawyer can help you get the legalese right for a lot less than a flesh-and-bone attorney.  <p> By Mike France  <p> If you're injured in a train crash, it isn't hard in America to find an attorney. (Trust us: One will find you.) But what if you have a less dramatic legal problem--if you need to sublease the apartment above the garage, or make a contract with some college kids to paint your fence, or decide who will get your property when you die?  <p> Odds are that you muddle ahead without the help of a lawyer or any legal documentation. The majority of adults don't have a will, and most of them enter into legal relationships all the time--loaning others money, joining lottery pools, hiring people--without creating contracts detailing the terms of the deals. All this leaves them vulnerable: They could suddenly die, or, even worse, the holder of the winning lottery ticket could conveniently forget about the other members of the pool.  <p> Now there is an automated solution to this problem. A new generation of inexpensive software packages with names such as Do-It-Yourself Lawyer (Expert Software, $14.95) is giving lay people the power to act as their own attorney. The programs are safe to use and perfectly suited for those times when people generally do without legal documents.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Here's a trade secret: Many lawyers use the same type of programs.</font></b><p> <p> Although the idea of retaining a virtual attorney may be anxiety-inducing, it's certainly better than using no attorney at all. And for those traditionalists who just don't think good legal advice can come out of a computer screen, here's a little trade secret: Many lawyers now use this same type of technology themselves.  <p> Priced between $9.95 and $69.95, these programs are easy to install and require no special computer expertise (but be sure your system has the modest amount of power and memory they require). All the programs can produce certain core documents: wills, powersof attorney, leases, promissory notes, and employment agreements. Beyond that, there's some variation. Among the 61 documents that can be churned out by Quicken Family Lawyer (Parsons Technology,$49) are a premarital agreement, a letter to challenge a credit rating, and a complaint letter to the Better Business Bureau. PC Attorney (Cosmi Software, $14.95) can produce a consignment-sale contract, a child-travel permission form, and, yes, a lottery-pooling agreement.  <p> Almost all the software uses a question-and-answer format (much like the popular Turbotax and TaxCut programs). Users first select the type of document from a menu, and then a series of querie sappears on the screen. To create a will, for example, the software will ask 20 to 40 questions: What bequests will be made? Who will serve as executor? Should money given to children be held in trust?  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>The best programs enable you to custom-tailor your documents. Some even offer advice.</font></b><p>  <p> If the user gets confused or wants some practical advice, help can be summoned with the click of an icon. Online legal "textbooks" have been built into each of the programs, although their quality varies. Most of the software also contains detailed instructions on how to make a document legally valid, which usually requires some combination of signatures, notary stamps, or witnesses. <p> The best of the new breed of legal software programs can produce sophisticated documents custom-tailored to the needs of the user. For example, Quicken Family Lawyer's residential lease is capable of creating specialized clauses dealing with storage, parking, penalties for late payments, and a pet-damage security deposit. In contrast, the lease offered in Legal Documents (DSR Software,$14.95) offers little more than the preprinted form you could buy in a stationery store.  <p> Of the programs currently available, Family Lawyer is the bes tall-around choice. The program offers well-drafted documents, and the online legal advice is comprehensive. Managing Your Money's Personal Attorney (Meca Software, $9.95) is a pretty good second choice, but it offers only 18 documents. For drafting a will, the best choice by far is WillMaker 5 (Nolo Press, $69.95). The most sophisticated legal software on the market, it makes only wills and powers of attorney, but it permits far more customization than do any of its competitors. WillMaker 5 also comes with a detailed handbook explaining the intricacies of estate planning.(Warning: No one who has an estate greater than $500,000 should use any of these programs to make a will. See a real lawyer.)  <p> Among the software packages below $20, the only recommended choice is Do-It-Yourself Lawyer. PC Attorney and Legal Documents are extremely limited in the range of documents they can generate, and the database of practical advice is scant. And for those who can wait a little while, the Microsoft Network MicrosoftCorp.'s new on-line service will soon allow subscribers to download many of the same documents available from the programs mentioned here.    <p>  <hr>   <p> This article appeared in the October 1995 issue of Worth magazine.  <p> Copyright 1995 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						RISE OF THE SILICON PATRIOTS (Part 1) <p>You could say these venture capitalists are building a new economy, funding the high-tech dreams that will transform our society. They'd say you were underestimating them.  <p> By Donald Katz  <p> Embedded in a carefully bricked roadway in the center of the 16-acre arsenal for Silicon Valley money called 3000 Sand Hill Road, there sits a burnished brass disk engraved with an image of the sun. The Copernican implications are entirely appropriate to the moment and place, for in the northern California corridor of innovation that stretches from San Jose to Marin, Sand Hill Road is recognized as the haunt of a special class of capital, a supercharged pool of money, and an elite fraternity of individuals who direct its creative powers.  <p> A huge redwood sign near the sun disk lists the names of money firms--Bessemer Venture Partners, Institutional Venture Partners, New Enterprise Associates, Oak Investment Partners, Sequoia Capital--that mean nothing at all to any number of ace stock pickers and Wall Street bankers. The Sand Hill Road financiers are venture capitalists who live in something of an underground, an invisible economy of entrepreneurial risk that has spawned many of the most dynamic, innovative, and wealth-producing corporations of the post-World War II era. The VCs occupy a realm of extreme risks and extravagant rewards. It is a tribal world predicated on the aggressive ethos of the hunt--a hunt, as the godfather figure of American venture capital, Arthur Rock, once said, for entrepreneurial dreamers possessed of "the potential to change the world."  <p> In a good year, a talented partnership of venture capitalists can create 40 or 60 percent profits for investors in their venture-capital fund. A "home run" in venture-capital parlance might mean that a million-dollar investment in the infancy of a commercial endeavor grows into a stake worth tens or hundreds of millions withina couple of years.   <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Total failure is as much part of the venture-capital experienceas mythic levels of success.</font></b><p>  <p> The powerhouse VC firm Sequoia Capital, manned by only eightfull-time partners, invested from a few hundred thousand dollarsto no more than $7 million in some 32 different young companies that went public over the past ten years. When Sequoia, located on the second floor of building four at 3000 Sand Hill in the small, affluent town of Menlo Park, placed its original bets on the companies, the enterprises were little more than the fervid aspirations of young entrepreneurs. Only a few of the companies Sequoia helped fund had anything like revenues when the money was dispensed. Few of them had fleshed-out management teams or fully developed products. Some of them didn't even have offices or completed business plans.  <p> But by the late fall of 1995, the combined market value of the public companies Sequoia helped calve--names such as Apple Computer, Avid Technology, Cisco Systems, Electronic Arts, Oracle Systems,and 3Com--had ballooned to more than $75 billion, and that figure doesn't include the wealth spun off as the fast-growing companies ascended. The number doesn't tell of the many dozens of other Sequoia-bred companies now operating as divisions of large corporations, of the tens of thousands of jobs created by the many start-ups, or of the innumerable inventions offered up in the process that have helped create new markets for other companies seeded by other VC firms. Nor does it reflect the significant number ofSequoia technology companies that went belly-up since the pioneering venture-capital firm was founded in 1972--total failure being as much part of the venture-capital experience as mythic levels of success.  <p> Professional venture capitalists invest $4 billion annually in some 3,000 nascent enterprises. That pales before the more than $400 billion in annual capital expenditures by American corporations, and before the fact that a million new businesseshave been launched annually into the American entrepreneurial carnival in recent years. Yet of the more than 600 new companies added to the Nasdaq public market lists over the past five years, more than 400 were in some part spawned through the auspices of professional venture capitalists.  <p> A few thousand venture-capital pros, most of them concentrated in a few hundred tiny VC firms, have quietly ridden herd on anessential macroeconomic process: Wealth generated by the mass-production-and natural-resource-based empires of the industrial age has been transferred to enterprises, entrepreneurs, and investors creating an era of information sciences, of electronic machinesand the garage-based child-entrepreneurs who are already American legends. The best VCs and their companies become extraordinarily wealthy. But their labor, the VCs will say, is less about the simple pursuit of profit than it is about helping the very civilization transform from the old to the new.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Sequoia money and advice helped support the founders of Apple,Atari, and a networking company called 3Com.</font></b><p>  <p> A dense veil of mystique and folklore surrounds the seasoned venturers who helped create the entrepreneurial petri dish of Silicon Valley. Donald Valentine, the 63-year-old founder of Sequoia Capital, is particularly decorated by mythos. There are rich tales of his volcanic boardroom proclamations and of young entrepreneurs (sometimes the stories have a salesman or a journalist) becoming so intimidated by Valentine's exacting personal style that they pass out on the table (or throw up or burst into tears). This apocrypha is more than matched by the verifiable stories of Valentine making himself, his stable of young genius-entrepreneurs, and many investors in his VC funds extremely rich.  <p> It was Valentine who rolled $1.8 million worth of venturers' dice before the young techies looking to expand a company called Cisco Systems in 1987. As every technology entrepreneur in northern California or along the silicon corridor of Route 128 in Massachusetts can tell you in some detail, Cisco went public only three years later. If Sequoia had held its ownership in Cisco Systems--instead of dispersing shares from the initial public offering, per VC tradition, to investors who fed the Sequoia fund from which Cisco was seeded--Valentine would control Cisco assets worth $4 billion. <p> Back in 1977, Valentine wrote a check in support of the entrepreneurial aspirations of an aggressive local kid named Steven Jobs, who "looked for all the world like Ho Chi Minh," as Valentine recalls it. Jobs would build Apple Computer with the aid of Sequoia money and advice. Valentine also helped guide the founders of Atari, the first company to make computer-based games. He supported a networking company called 3Com, which has become so large and successful that the corporation recently purchased the right to put its name on the former Candlestick Park. The San Francisco Giants and 49ers now play in 3Com Park.  <p> The superstar IPO of 1993, Microchip Technology, was another Sequoia-fed corporation, and in this case Valentine and most of his seven partners have held on to the roughly 20 percentof the IPO shares they claimed as payment for their money and services. Microchip was recently valued at 45-X, as the VCs say, 45 times Sequoia's original cost. A mere 4-X return, the quadrupling of an investment over three or four years, is a ho-hum performance along Sand Hill Road.  <p> A study conducted by Venture Economics, one of the leading quantitative market trackers of the introverted VC trade, indicates that only 7 percent of VC investment accounts for 60 percent of profits. Another study reveals that six of ten companies financed by venture firms go bankrupt. That's a startling strikeout average, offset by the amazing size of the home runs a successful venture portfolio can produce.  <p> "There are four buildings here at 3000 Sand Hill," Don Valentine once noted. "In these four buildings there's a billion dollars cash. Now, I'm not sure how many good ideas exist in Silicon Valley, or on the planet. But a billion can finance them all. The problem isn't money; it's the scarcity of good ideas.  <p> "This place," Valentine declared one recent afternoon, waving one hand toward the sunshine outside his office window, "is the center of the universe. The entire venture industry puts but $3 billion or $4 billion to work in a good year. It's nothing compared to the value of trades made in the public markets inside a morning, but money is not the essential point. That we happen to start companies that have come to dominate the Nasdaq is not the point either. It's a footnote," Valentine declared, leaning into each word across the table, staring hard. "It's but an amusing anecdotal footnote to the important history being made. People come and ask what I do, and I say I'm in the business of building companies. I build companies. That's what I do."  <p> Valentine has short, iron-gray hair swept up and back in a wayreminiscent of union officials of the bygone industrial age, or of precapitalist Russian physicists. His corner office is decorated with LeRoy Neiman originals and all sorts of framed stock certificates and other venturing mementos displayed like trophies won in over 23 years of big-game pursuits.  <p> Valentine actually hails from New York City, but friends and colleagues know that the ultimate Silicon patriot prefers not to talk about life before he was delivered unto "the cauldron of creation," as he puts it, that was northern California in 1955. Valentine learned about hypertrophic technology businesses as one of the tough-guy, whiskey-after-work scientists and executive swho jockeyed the postwar electronics industry from vacuum-tube systems to transistors to the brilliant application of tiny circuits on one side of a thin wafer of silicon. Valentine was present when the integrated-circuit guys started calling the power-packed silicon slices "chips."  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Valentine set up Sequoia as a kind of boot camp for a varietyof young geniuses forming a new California subculture of technologist-entrepreneurs.</font></b><p> <p> Valentine rose to prominence as a marketing strategist at Fairchild Semiconductor and then worked at National Semiconductor. He began investing small amounts of his own money in the aspirations of some of the customers who bought chips, local techies for the most part, young wizards fresh out of engineering departments. <p> "I watched how those young businesses ran or were unable to run, and I thought about why some of them succeeded," Valentine says. "To this day, my education as a venture capitalist comes from close observation of what happens to the management teams we fund, from these highly disciplined yet disobedient visionaries." <p> As young scientists began pouring out of Stanford and Berkeley (and the universities clustered in Boston, the other capital of technology venture capitalism), Valentine set up Sequoia as a kind of boot camp for a variety of young geniuses forming a new California subculture of technologist-entrepreneurs. A young ex-Apple Computer whiz named Trip Hawkins was given an office inside Sequoia for months while he wrote a business plan tha tdescribed the pioneering computer-game company Electronic Arts. Hawkins--who recently founded the high-profile video game-machine venture called 3DO--went on to make tens of millions of dollars when Electronic Arts went public in 1989, and Valentine reaped 20-fold returns for his investors' early $1 million stake.  <p> "Don Valentine is one of the most influential people in my life, "Hawkins says now. "He helped me grow up as a businessman. If you can't survive the hazing Don puts you through, then you certainly can't survive the crap that comes your way as a company CEO. Even now, I wear Don Valentine in my brain. Sometimes I sense that a new idea must be crushed and people must be sent away to get their shit together--so I simply turn into Don.  <p> "At the beginning it isn't easy," Hawkins says. "When I waswriting the Electronic Arts business plan at 3000 Sand Hill, Don took me to his golf club for lunch. 'If I wanted to run your company,' he said to me, 'why in the world would I need you?' He basically announced, We are about to start a relationship in which I will savagely beat you. If you roll over, Don teaches, you won't be successful. He's kind of like the professor in the movie The Paper Chase. But it's hard. Entrepreneurs come from optimism. Don does not come from optimism. He's the yang to the entrepreneur's yin."  <p> Valentine is known for listening quietly to highly produced sound and light shows illustrating the glorious future of a new start-up. At the end of the presentations, he will often look at the young entrepreneur and impassively say, "Who cares?" <p> "I happen to thrive on the precision of Don's language," says David O'Brien, speaking in early October on the day after Élantec, the chip company of which he serves as CEO, went public on the Nasdaq market. "Don is the chairman of our board, and while I know his style intimidates some people, there is never any fuzzy thinking. He has a model in his head for a good company in each of a dozen technology markets, and his goal is to get his companies to fit the model. If he's tough on entrepreneurs, don't forge tthis is Silicon Valley and there are a lot of techies out here with brilliant ideas that don't include a clue about running a company."  <p>  <p><wam-subhead>Many of the pros within the venture pack have been entrepreneurs and company operators themselves, and all of them have extensive contacts and access to resources.<wam-subhead>  <p> Sequoia Partners considers commercial propositions from 2,000 entrepreneurs each year, and from that group perhaps a dozen dreamers are invited inside to be funded and connected to experts and advised. In the process Don Valentine and his partners seek to discern or create the toughness required to build an enterprise. The partners will help a young company develop basic strategy, find key managers, and help forge strategic alliances. Many of the pros within the venture pack have been entrepreneurs and company operators themselves, and all of them have extensivecontacts and access to resources. So much legwork is involved in the launching of a young technology business that each of Sequoia's eight partners handles no more than four or five companies at a time. In exchange for the connections, cash, counsel, and instant credibility, Sequoia and the other firms will often attain 10 to 25 percent of the company (in privately held shares), along with a seat on the board of directors. Valentine sits on five different boards, is the vice-chairman of Cisco Systems, and is the honorific, nonoperating chairman of the boards of C-Cube Microsystems, Network Appliance, and Élantec.  <p> VCs assess a business plan in terms of risk: market risk, technology-development risk, and management risk. "But in truth, the evaluation isn't particularly scientific," Valentine says. "There's nothing scientific about investing in science. It's intuitive. We make a judgmentabout when we think the science is going to really happen, and we intuitively make a judgment about what we're willing to pay." <p> For the two or three days after a business plan is judged worthy of investment, Valentine and his people bicker with an entrepreneur about the current value of future dreams. "That's the only time we want to be adversaries," Valentine says. The entrepreneur is usually presented with a "term sheet" and illustrations that show the radically enhanced value of the founder's hundreds and thousands of freshly minted shares as the company moves through subsequent fundings toward the public marketplace. If some company-creators do turn their heads to the right side of the spreadsheet and the millions of dollars' worth of equity that might come with success--this, despite the fact that capitalists, who have participated in the subsequent rounds of financing a fast-growing business requires, might by then own 60 to 90 percent of the company--then most of them focus on the cash needed to make their business grow. Certainly the ones worth betting on do.  <p> Once the money is in hand, many entrepreneurs find that the involvement of a seasoned VC pro can be intimidating as well as helpful. Valentine's corporate children talk of the monthly specter of their own financial reports coming back with telltale markings from Valentine's famous green pen.   <p> Trip Hawkins once looked at an early Electronic Arts financial statement on which the operating loss for the month and the borrowing power and cash left on hand were all circled in green. "TWO MONTHS LEFT" was scrawled across the bottom of the document. "But by then, Don had instilled a toughness and a sense of resolve that helped us solve our operating problems and succeed," Hawkins says.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>VCs--or "vulture capitalists" as spurned entrepreneurs like to call them--sometimes rush IPOs and sales of companies as a result of their greed, say critics of the industry.</font></b><p>  <p> When venture capitalists lose faith in an entrepreneur's ability to solve his or her own problems, they will often move in t ochange a management team or even force the sale of a company. Venture firms draw their capital from sources that must reap rewards within seven to ten years, the preordained life span of the typical venture fund. The timetable leads critics of the industry and disaffected entrepreneurs to contend that some rushed IPOs and sales of companies--and tossed-out managements--are often the result of VC greed or inappropriate expediencies. To spurned entrepreneurs, VCs can be "vulture capitalists," financial predators who hide behind a rhetorical wall of altruism and camaraderie. Even amid wealth and success, entrepreneurs will characterize their VCs as necessary evils. "They are so glamorous and beautiful at first and deadly like Catherine Deneuve in The Hunger," says one software entrepreneur.  <p> In 1976, only a year after Don Valentine funded the young computer scientists behind Atari, arguably the first high-technology company to connect the American obsession with new modes of entertainment to the computer--and certainly a pioneer of what has become a $6 billion computer and video-game industry--he pushed the Atari founders into selling out to Warner Communications. The sale of Atari brought $28 million, $15 million of which went to founder Nolan Bushnell. Valentine quadrupled his grub stake in the process. Atari was able to gallop from $50 million in sales to $2 billionin just five years. But the company quickly followed an Icarianpath to extreme success and failure; Atari has virtually disappeared. "And that's all people remember," Valentine growls. "Atari was one of the great Silicon Valley companies. They only remember that after the sale it fell apart."  <p> A typical Sand Hill Road venture fund might include $100 million or $300 million that the partners apportion to a portfolio of young companies. The venture funds are usually designed to be liquefied after seven or ten years, though most partnerships distribute realized profits as takeovers and IPOs occur.   <p> One of the interesting ironies of the venture-capital world is that despite the intimacy and hands-on involvement of the VCs, the pros are almost never playing with a lot of their own money. The investment funds hail almost exclusively from the coffers of pension funds and other tax-exempt entities, which invest via a legal provision that allows nonprofits to apportion 5 percent of their portfolios to "alternative" investments. <p> "These are extremely illiquid assets," Valentine says. "Rich people would love to invest with us, but rich people die and get divorced. Then liquidity becomes an issue. And with a divorce, I might have some nightmare wife's lawyer on my back trying to force something to happen. Forget it. It's not worth it. Tax-exempt money is a simple solution to a potential problem."  <p> Which is not to say that a tremendous level of personal reward doesn't ride on the long-range bets of individual VCs. The way a venture partnership splits up the take is a subject of much secrecy and conjecture, but most partners admit that the "carry," or carried interest, that the partnership gleans from profits, comes in at around 20 to 25 percent of returns. The payouts of companies that go public are usually in stock, and in many cases the shares continue to soar. The partnership also collects management fees of 2 to 3 percent of a fund's total equity. In the case of some of the recently accrued VC "megafunds," such as the $600 million VC fund run by Summit Partners in Boston, a small number of partners are splitting many millions of dollars just for coming to work.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>The down market for the VCs continued until 1992. But by 1994 the boom was on again, and new funds were turning away money.</font></b><p> <p> The wealth, paternal power, and glamour accruing to high-profile VCs have created a discernible new category of economic superstar. In Menlo Park and San Jose, citizens speak easily of founder's stock and carried interest and deal flow. If yet another gearhead is about to relocate from a dorm room at Stanford to one of thebiggest houses in Palo Alto, then local chat will carry the news. They talk easily about the comparative IRR (internal rate of return) reaped by various venture firms and trade tidbits about KP (the powerhouse Sand Hill firm of Kleiner Perkins Caufield& Byers). Local gossip also includes news of VCs who--though their levels of conspicuous consumption pale before that of the entrepreneurs they support--have been known to have their fine cars flown to places they want to visit. There is talk of $15 million yachts and of a $16 million VC house built in the image of a Loire chateau. "In many ways it's like a little Amish community," notes the young Sequoia partner Michael Moritz. "But the horse and buggy happens to be a Mercedes 500SL."   <p> A glance at the recent economic history of Silicon Valley reveal sa fascinating combination of capital, entrepreneurial impatience ,and cutting-edge science. Specialized technology law firms, research think tanks, prototype fabrication plants, and a public full of "early adopter" citizens fit to test new devices all grew up to join the technology VCs and entrepreneurs. The universities served up new human and technical feeder stock by the academic quarter, and young techies from other parts of the country surged into town. Silicon Valley quickly became a test tube for entrepreneurial "creative destruction" as young teams of techies constantly bailed out of established companies to start their own enterprises. At least ten new companies were formed by alumni of Hewlett-Packard alone between 1980 and 1982.  <p> By 1982, just before the cynosure of heroic capital switched back to Wall Street and the buyout kings, LBO lords, and other Masters of the Universe, young students of money everywhere wanted to grow up to be Valley-style VCs. From the viewpoint of the venture-pack pros, amateur money and talent then flooded the field and drove up the all-important cost of entering deals. Though individual technology entrepreneurs like Bill Gates achieved unprecedented wealth during the 1980s--and Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, Oracle, Adobe Systems, Autodesk, and Novell all went public in the same 12-month period in 1985 and 1986--the yearly returns of venture funds dipped embarrassingly close to single-digit levels.   <p> "The really inept people came in as 'late stage' or 'mezzanine' investors," Valentine says. "They bought into companies between the early-stage investments we do and the public markets, but they didn't recognize that late-stage venture investing means finding companies with revenues and profits. They weren't able to do the hands-on stuff we do, and after a while they went away." <p> The down market for the VCs continued until 1992, though the pack sent more than 150 new companies into the realm of public-market investors each year. By 1994 the boom was on again, and new fund swere turning away money.  <p>  <p>"Rise of the Silicon Patriots" is continued in the Part 2 file in this folder.  <p>  <hr>   <p> This article appeared in the December/January 1996 issue of Worth magazine.  <p> Copyright 1996 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						RISE OF THE SILICON PATRIOTS (Part 2) <p>You could say these venture capitalists are building a new economy, funding the high-tech dreams that will transform our society. They'd say you were underestimating them.  <p> By Donald Katz  <p> The soaring tech-company stock prices of early and mid-1995 are indications of fundamental economic shifts that have been going on for some time. One of the few academics who looks closely at the venture community, William Wetzel of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire's Whittemore School of Business, contends that there are currently some 80,000 American companies growing by a factor of 50 percent per annum and 300,000 companies growing at around 20 percent per year.  <p> "There is no way that these elevated growth levels can be sustained with a company's internal cash flow," Wetzel says. "The new dominance of this technology-based, entrepreneurial economy harks back to 1979--a moment that will someday be recalled in the way we speak of the dawn of the industrial revolution. That was the year the payrolls of the largest Fortune 500 industrial companies peaked. Since then those payrolls have dropped by over 25 percent to less than 25 million jobs. At the same time an ostensibly invisible and unmeasured realm of the economy occupied by the high-growth, knowledge-based or technology-based ventures of entrepreneurs has accounted for over 24 million new jobs."  <p> "The action," Don Valentine says, his low voice growing passionate, "is right here. Route 280. California! The gold vein of entrepreneurialism. People come right here from the Far East to ask how it's done. They come from Europe to try to study what's happened here. But they just don't have our visionary entrepreneurs. And they don't have people with the vision necessary to provide the money." <p> Donald Valentine will reside within the pantheon of Silicon Valley heroes whether or not he continues to finance and pummel young entrepreneurs. Valentine has accrued much more than $100 million from his years of venturing. He allows himself a rambling garage full of vintage cars and one of those astronomically expensive memberships at a Pebble Beach club down the coast in Carmel. But he works long hours in an office appointed with used furniture and a lot of college-dorm-wall art. His aggressive, no-bullshit style belies a charming social presence and active interests in the San Francisco Symphony and Italian art. Valentine once traveled on sabbatical to Florence, where he immersed himself in the world of the Renaissance.  <p> The younger partners at Sequoia say that when news of a hot young company in need of funds comes into the office, Valentine is the first to hear the fire bells and hit the north-south racetrack of a highway that is Interstate 280. He still loves to punch holes in slick presentations offered by "guys in power suits, referring to their mothers and pastors and showing slides." <p> Valentine stands out from many of the other statesmen of venture capitalism in that he doesn't analyze the potential of a nascent company by focusing on the entrepreneur. Much as they might study the minutiae of a business plan, most VCs ultimate rely on the mantra of Arthur Rock: "People, people, people," said Rock, a former New York banker who financed technology start-ups like Teledyne and Intel. In the classic Rock model, it all comes down to the entrepreneurs.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>You can always replace "the guy." But the idea's another story.</font></b><p> <p> Valentine focuses not on "the guy," as the genius under consideration is often called in VC circles, but on the potential marketplace for an idea. "These companies are non analyzable," he says. "So you try to spend a lot of time with them, and you do a lot of checking on them. But if they don't have a great market, I don't care who they are, they will fail. The dream team with a crummy market will eventually fail. So we go with a viable market. A market is analyzable. People are not.  <p> "And besides," Valentine adds matter-of-factly, "you can alway sreplace the guy."  <p> Kicking the original guys out of the companies they've dreamed up--separating parent from child--is a VC practice that disenfranchised entrepreneurs liken to the family-splitting slave auctions of yore. Management purges loom as a fear of every entrepreneur, though some surveys indicate that nine of ten founding managements of successful companies remain in place for the whole ride. <p> Don Valentine remains extremely loyal to the entrepreneurs he has helped. "Good luck," he wrote to the deposed Apple founder, Steve Jobs, when Jobs unveiled his NeXT Computer. Then in a reference to the Apple executive who deposed Jobs, he concluded: "Stick it in [John] Sculley's ear."  <p> But Valentine also seems to think that once a young entrepreneur has achieved success and fame, an element of the original fire is lost. "After Apple hit," he says, "Steve Jobs began wearing Armani and having lunch with Jerry Brown. He even got an apartmen ton Central Park. I don't finance guys who have lunch with Jerry Brown and have apartments 3,000 miles away. I want a guy who doesn't even know who the president is, someone driven to a single agenda, to 15-hour days and six-day weeks."  <p> When Jobs sought support for his NeXT project, Sequoia turned him down. And when Trip Hawkins came in to see Valentine about helping create 3DO, Valentine turned him down too. Hawkins came in to see his former mentor wearing an outfit that included an elaborate insignia over the breast pocket. "Why, Trip," Valentine said to his rich and famous former tutee. "I see you've acquired a family crest."   <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Michael Moritz--the 41-year-old rising VC star--brought $80 million back to Sequoia from three portfolio companies going public last year.</font></b><p>  <p> The generational distance between venture-pack kingpins like Valentine and the young entrepreneurs he likes to help in business is replicated up and down the Valley by a generational gap inside the VC firms. In some outfits, the transfer of the mantle has gone smoothly, but three first-line Valley firms--including the powerful Merrill, Pickard, Anderson & Eyre partnership--hav emoved to disband because of internal intergenerational conflict, some of it having to do with the splits on the all-essential carry.  <p> Michael Moritz works in the office next to Don Valentine's .Moritz is a 41-year-old Oxford-educated Welshman who worked at the San Francisco office of Time after business school. "This was 1981 and one of those periodic moments when East Coast publishers wanted a lot of news about Silicon Valley," Moritz says. "So I began cruising Interstate 280, and I met the Valley people. I met Tom Perkins of Kleiner Perkins, and I met Don. A few years later I came back to him when I knew it was time for me to make a change."  <p> Moritz had come to believe that it was the very small and aggressive companies that would inherit the future, not the traditional behemoths of media and publishing ("where the entrepreneurs have been dead for two generations") or even the huge technology corporations. "The moribund companies went into a blind panic over not understanding what they've got to do to be in their business in the world oftomorrow," Moritz says. "They stumbled all over themselves like drunken corporals."  <p> Moritz says he wanted to be a part of the technology-born grand transition instead of just covering it. Last year he brought $80 million back to Sequoia from three portfolio companies going public (Flextronics International, Global Village Communication,and Security Dynamics) and was listed ninth in a ranking of top VCs under 40.  <p> Valentine bristles at the suggestion that he has served as amentor to Moritz ("Nah," he says, "the mentors are the companies"), but Moritz seems to have internalized Valentine's axioms. "Compared to starting a company," Moritz says, "what I do is easy street. The heavy lifting in this industry is not done on Sand Hill Road. It's done in Sunnyvale and Santa Clara and all sorts of other gorgeous spots within area code 408."  <p> Among the eight Sequoia partners, there is a Welshman, an Englishman, a Frenchman, and an Italian. All of them have come to be Silicon patriots. All of them believe the viability of markets supersedes the vision of "the guy."  <p> "Don happens to be very thoughtful about the generational issues inside venture firms," Moritz says. "He's watched guys in the business who are 15 years older than he over stay their time and become ponderous and repetitive--telling stories about the '70s and all. Perhaps Don is staving off mortality and staying young by continuing as he does, but like other powerful and vital peopl earound the Valley, he still thrives on the intellectual energy you find. There is just such a rush you can get from being involved with young people who have got great plans and ambitions and are prepared to break down walls by force of energy and ideas." <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Few of the VCs in the crowd seem excited by the stock market's technology issues "exhilarations" of late, preferring instead to focus on the tiny glimmers of companies to come that might deliver 10-, 15-, and 100-fold appreciations within the biblical seven-year, or ten-year, time horizons.</font></b><p>  <p> On a late autumn Monday, 40 miles north of the sunny placidity of Sand Hill Road and just a bit south of 3Com Park and the San Francisco airport, various leaders of the local and non localventure pack gather at a hotel to listen to presentations by entrepreneurs and compare notes. The name tags at the Technologic Partners Digital Media Outlook gathering bear gigantic Californiate first names--CHAD, GAYLE--with minuscule last names printed underneath, but there are far fewer overt techies in the crowd than can usually be observed at industry conclaves. The belting-leather attaché cases outnumber the canvas bags with laptops by 50 to 1.  <p> Jim Clark, the former Silicon Graphics entrepreneur and instan tpaper half-billionaire by virtue of his 9,720,000 founder's shares in Netscape Communications, the highest-profile IPO of 1995, mingles with partners from Kleiner Perkins, whose early, seven-figure contribution to Netscape was now worth some $225 million. Also present is Scott Cook, the former Procter & Gamble brand manager who became another rich Valley entrepreneur through the early-'80s start-up of Intuit, maker of the ubiquitous Quicken line of personal-finance software.  <p> Few of the VCs in the crowd seem excited by the stock market's technology issues "exhilarations" of late, a run that, as they talk, has taken the general technology-sector issues up 46 percent and the semiconductor stocks up 75 percent for the year. The VCs prefer to focus on the tiny glimmers of companies to come that might deliver 10-, 15-, and 100-fold appreciations within the biblical seven-year, or ten-year, time horizons venturers prefer.   <p> The kids from Yahoo!, an Internet indexing service capitalized entirely from Michael Moritz's Sequoia portfolio, are on the conference agenda. So are Yahoo!'s competitors from Lycos (funded by CMG@Ventures). Another company, founded by six Stanford kid-entrepreneurs, developers of yet another system of indexing and navigating the digital tower of babble that the Internet has become--Architext is the name of their company--have chosen to rent a room where selected invitees can play with a software demo. According to the estimates of Venture One, a VC-pack tracking firm in San Francisco, VCs invested $42 million in Internet companies in 1994--this, it should be said, is a world in which hardly any company has figured out how to reap substantive revenue. In just the first half of 1995, the figure reached $68 million.   <p> Between 20-minute presentation sessions, the gifted new-wavetechnology investor Roger McNamee stands near a gigantic bowl of potato chips reading messages from his alphanumeric page rwith one hand and holding a cellular phone to his ear with the other. McNamee receives a hundred messages on his pager during a busy day, the missives ranging from flash reports of large moves in some of his considerable stock holdings to family news from his brother. McNamee's PowerBook contains close to 140 megabytes of E-mail messages that include queries from journalists, messages from bankers in Hong Kong, queries from Kleiner Perkins, and a steady influx of data related to his Rotisserie baseball team. <p> McNamee, who resembles a preppy investment banker gone digital and running hard on speed, attends more than 25 technology conferences  and 20 industry trade shows inside a year. Wired, the digital-scene feature magazine also born of Silicon Valley start-up funds, has referred to McNamee as "his holiness," and another business magazine described him as "tech's top investor" and a venture capitalist--the latter of which, by all conventional definitions, McNamee is not.  <p> From 1988 to 1991, McNamee ran the T. Rowe Price Science & Technologymutual fund well enough to offer a 100 percent return to investors who stuck by the fund. Four years ago he raised $104 million through a Wall Street bank and moved to Sand Hill Road to disperse his Integral Capital Partners investment fund as a sort of hybrid of a technology mutual fund and a venture-capital fund. Though he's pulled a loser or two into his two portfolios since movin gwest (a second fund of $126 million was launched in 1994), the huge winners he bought into before they went public--Intel, MapInfo, Spectrum HoloByte, Alantec, Flextronics ... his list goes on for quite a while--have contributed to stunning gains for his investors. The total value of the two Integral funds stands a t$450 million.  <p> "We are venture-like, but the venture guys are different because they help create businesses from raw clay," McNamee says. "We evaluate business plans, but we don't help create them. What I might do every so often is go to a private company that's doing well and try to get the founders to sell me stock. I offer to help educate them about the process of going public. That's wha tI did with Intuit. The venture guys take tremendous risks early on. We try to cherry-pick the best companies later in their lifecycle.  <p> "But what we're doing is also a lot different from what they do back on Wall Street," McNamee continues. "Wall Street has a really hard time understanding technology. Economic cycles and interest-rate cycles might be well-related to automobiles and banks--but if you look at the thousands of tech companies in the public markets, there are technical issues, tremendous rates of change, and all sorts of other things that call for a micro-focus."  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>By some estimates there are a quarter-million "angels" now investing in more than 30,000 start-ups every year. </font></b><p> <p> The success of the Integral Capital Partners funds is indicative of the latest wave of financial concentration in the later stages of the high-growth-company life cycle. Later investments tend to be larger, and if they work, the returns come back much faster. Though venture funds have raised more money this year than ever, the early-stage outlays and seedings have not kept pace with later-stage investment.  <p> The lower end of the venture food chain, like wise, has seen the emergence of a new breed--a crop of venturing "angels," often baby-boom-aged entrepreneurs with $10 million or $20 million or $50 million to their names. The army of "Microsoft millionaires" alone, former senior employees of the Bellevue, Washington, company whose vested Microsoft stock option shares have made many of them extremely rich, has fueled an ongoing explosion of Seattle-area software start-ups.  <p> By some estimates there are a quarter-million angels now investing in more than 30,000 start-ups every year. They tend to inves tmuch less than a million dollars at a crack, but according to Jeffrey Sohl, director of the Center for Venture Research, angels put out $10 billion in venture capital a year--more than double the capital invested by professional VCs.  <p> At the Digital Media conference, several angels move in and out of the circles of entrepreneurs and Sand Hill stars. "I built a computer-reselling business called Morris Decision Systems to $40 million in sales before I sold it to Businessland in 1986," says a Boston-based angel named Anthony Morris. "I thought about becoming a VC, but I thought it would be more exciting to do private seeding deals. I do two a year. I've funded nine companies, and four were acquired in 1993 and 1994. One more should be taken over within the next few weeks. The truth is, I've earned a higher rate of return as an angel than I did selling my company."  <p> Many of the more skilled and successful angels are drafted as new partners of VC firms. Observers of the early-stage investment scene often note an irony in the fact that many of the wealthy young angels are one-time entrepreneurs who were themselves nurtured by professional VCs. "What I love about this recent surging ofangels," notes one Boston-based VC pro at the conference, "is that it turns entrepreneurs into venture guys, the very thing they all love to say they hate."  <p> The love-hate relationship between the entrepreneurs and their VCs defines one of the more emotionally charged junctures within the business culture. After completing his presentation to aroom full of venturers at the Digital Media conference and being assured anonymity, one entrepreneur backed by several leading firms said, "Sometimes I sit with them and I think, 'Who the hell are they to judge me!' A lot of them are a bunch of God-damned M.B.A.s who think they're rock stars. If you don't act greedy enough, they don't want you. All they want you to do is optimize their values and sell out as quickly as you can."  <p> A harsh critique of VCs is easy to come by in the world of company-builders, and even more so among the would-be company builders VCs refuse to fund. Though "mutual non disparagement" agreements are invariably signed when VCs and other members of a board of directors remove managers, the venomous stories emerge quickly.  <p> "As soon as an enterprise falters," says one veteran Bay Area entrepreneur, "the human side can disappear in an instant and you are left to see that in the end, capital rules."  <p> Don Valentine took his board chairman's seat with Elantec, the company that went public in October, after Sequoia moved to replace the founder in charge. At the launch of the company, the technologist had focused on the military market for Élantec's analog chips. Sequoia wanted him to move into the commercial realm. When he couldn't or didn't do that, a new manager was brought in to pursue the business plan.  <p> "The only thing worse than having to work to replace the original entrepreneurs, when that is required," Michael Moritz says, "is the specter of letting them stay on."  <p> "What often happens is that the true visionary gets bogged down in the comparatively boring day-to-day work of an ongoing concern," Valentine says. "But let's face it. Creating companies is not an act of altruism. This is a world where people believe in AynRand's 'virtue of selfishness.' This is all about creative destruction. That's the stuff that makes it work. And when it stops working that way, then this business will stop working, too."  <p> There are VCs who indeed resemble bankers motivated by expediency or greed or ego. But there are also many underground capitalists who labor at their venturing as a calling instead of a job. The economic and cultural transformations born of technological innovationhave profoundly changed the course of contemporary life. And though they may be as famous as film stars only within certain elite circles of entrepreneurial finance, the best of the VCs can say they were there at the creation.  <p> "The amazing thing is that people ask why I want to continue doing this," Don Valentine said before heading off to Scotland to golf and visit some companies he'd heard about. "I can be a student forever. Imagine the chance to discover and work with the most creative minds on the planet. Imagine the possibility of discovering a new Steven Spielberg six or seven times each year.  <p> "I honestly believe the people I work with know the future. I sit with them and I can see the world in the next century.Of all the things someone can do in the world, I cannot thin kof anything more important and exciting than that. All the best dreams in the world are right here. This is the modern world in the making. This is the true frontier."  <p>  <hr>   <p> This article appeared in the December/January 1996 issue of Worth magazine.  <p> Copyright 1996 Capital Publishing Limited Partnership.

						KEEPING IT IN THE FAMILY <p>Follow these nine tips for passing on a family business.  <p> By Jim Melloan  <p> What's the number one problem facing successful family businesses today? For many, it's keeping the business in the family. Current statistics show that about 40 percent of family businesses survive into the second generation, and only 12 percent survive to the third. Says John Messervey, director of the National Family Business Council in Lake Forest, Illinois, "Passing on a business is like getting a set of golf clubs and having just one game to break 80. You only get one shot at it."  <p> The foundation for a smooth transition from one generation to the next needs to be laid early, through clear communication and clear structure. To help beat the odds, the pros suggest business owners consider the following:  <p> <p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Keep roles clear.</font></b><p>Mike Henning, an Effingham, Illinois, family-business consultant, has  advised the patriarch of a business to buy severa lhats and label them dad, boss, grandfather, etc., so that his relatives/employees will be clear on which role he is playin gwhen addressing them. Several of his clients have taken his advice literally--he's seen the hats.   <p> <p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Recognize that the dynamics of a family business and the solutions to the problems it encounters may not seem rational to outsiders.</font></b><p>"Profit is not always a motive in a family business," says Schwerzler. "Often the objective is to reach ever-higher levels of break-even. "That is, a growing business may be able to increase salaries and benefits while still not carrying anything to the bottom line.  <p> <p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Appoint an independent board of directors that doesn't simply consist of Dad's old cronies.</font></b><p> All of the principal employees, family and not, should be subject to the board's periodic review. And the appointed successor, should, of course, be approved by the board.   <p> <p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Send children to work outside the family business early in their careers.</font></b><p> It will build a sense of self-worth that they don't get by going straight to work for Mom or Dad. In a survey of family businesses, second-generation owners cited this as the number-one factor in successful transitions. And it was the number-one regret of those who hadn't done it.  <p> <p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Pay children according to their position, experience, and competence, just like other employees.</font></b><p> Parents often think they should pay their children equally, but equal pay for unequal work and commitment can be perceived as unfair.   <p> <p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>Form a family council, and hold regular meetings</font></b><p>...where members can be clear about what they want, what they expect, and how the business has affected the family and vice versa. It will form the groundwork for the future power structure of the company once the current generation has passed it on. The more honest people are at these meetings, the better the prospects for a smooth transition.   <p> <p><a name="SUB7"><b><font size=+1>Set up an estate plan now.</font></b><p>The top estate-tax rate is 55 percent, which means that without planning, the heirs could have to come up with tax payment equal to over half the value of the business to avoid liquidating it. There are many strategies for passing on a business with a maximum amount of assets intact, but they require time to evaluate and, in many cases, years to implement.  <p> <p><a name="SUB8"><b><font size=+1>Appoint a successor as soon as possible.</font></b><p> It's best to achieve a family consensus on who the new head of the company will be. And not just the top position but the entire pecking order will have to be negotiated. Agree on a date when the new regime will take effect--often bosses will promise the business to their children but can't let go, and the kids will spend most of their adult lives just hanging on and waiting.   <p> <p><a name="SUB9"><b><font size=+1>Draw up a strategic plan with the intended successors for sustaining and growing the business.</font></b><p> "You can't take it for granted," says Messervey. "You don't want to become the last wagon-wheel manufacturer in the state."  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the March 1994 issue of Worth magazine. <p>

						TAX BREAK? YOU'LL HAVE TO WORK FOR IT <p>It's getting harder to please the IRS on home-office deductions. One accountant's typical home-office client saves about $1,300--if he or she doesn't get audited and wind up paying the accountant to represent him.  <p> By Carol Marie Cooper  <p> Dallas accountant James Hopson tells of the local house painter who always counted on a hefty tax deduction for the office space he had set aside in his home. After all, the painter arranged jobs and billed clients there and stored paint and ladders elsewhere on his property. That was before 1994, when the IRS audited him, ordered him to pay back taxes, and went so far as to contact his clients during the dispute.  <p> Like a lot of other Americans, the painter will resist taking that juicy write-off again. While increasing numbers of Americans are working in their homes, the IRS has gotten downright stingy in granting the deduction.  <p> A 1993 U.S. Supreme Court decision, Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Soliman, made the business of writing off home-office expenses even trickier. In that case, an anesthesiologist had to cough up back taxes and interest after the court decided his home office--his only office--was not his principal place of business because his patients were all in hospitals.  <p> Some accountants advise clients to forgo the deduction--even if it's deserved. It just isn't worth the risk of an audit, says Hopson.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>A traveling salesman or plumber would be hard put to write off a home base under new IRS rules.</font></b><p>  <p> Home-office deductions once ranked in the IRS's top ten most frequent audit issues, says IRS spokesman Don Roberts. But that was before the 1991 tax year, for which the IRS introduced Form 8829, which allowed the agency to see how self-employed filers calculated the write-off.   <p> Until then, "there was no clear way to delineate the expenses," Roberts says. "The only way we could question whether or not a taxpayer had correctly completed the deductions was to conduct an examination [IRS-speak for audit]." Now, Roberts says, home-office audits rank 34th.   <p> The IRS has long insisted that home-office space be used exclusively for business and that the office meet one of three criteria: that the taxpayer sees clients there, that the office is in aseparate building, or that it is where the principal work effort takes place. The Soliman decision narrowed the definition of principal work effort so that a traveling salesman or plumber, say, would be hard put to write off a home base under this rule. <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>The good news: your deduction counts toward otherwise nondeductible items. The bad news, it can get complicated.</font></b><p>  <p> If you have a home office, you are allowed to deduct a percentage of household expenses equal to the fraction of space the office occupies. In a 2,000-square-foot home, a 300-square-foot office would allow deductions of 15 percent. That 15 percent is applied to mortgage interest, property taxes, or rent. But remember, mortgage interest and property taxes are already deductible for people who itemize. Only a renter gets an unadulterated gain. <p> The office deduction does count toward otherwise nondeductible items like utilities, homeowners' insurance, security systems, and maintenance. If you're paying $3,000 a year for home insurance, the 15 percent can be written off. The same is true for utilities, although the IRS says that since you won't be showering in your office, you should reduce the water deduction accordingly. And you'd have one phone line anyway, so only additional lines count. <p> You can also depreciate 15 percent of the value of your home and home improvements over 39 years. But this write-off gets complicated. You can't depreciate the ground below. A $300,000 house sitting on a $100,000 lot is worth only $200,000. Depreciating 15 percent, or $30,000, gives a deduction of about $770 a year. <p> Be careful, though. If you depreciate part of your house as a business expense, you lower the amount you have invested in it, increasing the chance of capital gains later. Worse, the business portion of your home won't fall under the usual rules that allow you to defer or avoid capital-gains taxes.  <p> If you sell at a loss, the rules could work in your favor. Suddenly, part of your loss from home ownership becomes a business deduction. <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The typical home-office client saves about $1,300--that is if he doesn't get audited.</font></b><p>  <p> Whether it makes sense to risk the hassles depends on your situation. Richard Joyner, a CPA in Price Waterhouse's Dallas office, saysclients with large homes and big mortgages and utility billsmore often take the deduction. The self-employed have more to gain than the guy whose boss insists he telecommute, becausean employee can deduct only expenses left after subtracting 2 percent of his or her adjusted gross income. But if you're self-employed, the deduction doesn't just pare income on which you would pay 15 to 39.6 percent in federal income taxes; it also reduces the amount subject to 15.3 percent in Social Security and Medicare taxes for the self-employed.  <p> Hopson says his typical home-office client saves about $1,300--if he or she doesn't get audited and wind up paying Hopson to represent him, as the painter did.  <p> Even without claiming a home office, you can deduct or depreciate computers and other office equipment from self-employment income.If you're an employee and need the equipment for your job, you can write it off on Schedule A, subject to the 2 percent income rule. Here again, the amount to be deducted is based on the percentage of its use for business. Only $17,500 can be deducted in a single year. And some items--like computers and printers--must be depreciated over several years unless they're used more than 50 percent of the time for business.  <p> Hopson knows firsthand the perils of home-office deductions. He worked from home while starting his practice. The first two years, fearing IRS scrutiny, he didn't claim the deduction. Then, for 1988, he did. "Guess what happened? I got audited."  <p> Hopson was able to convince the IRS he was entitled to the deduction. But the $700 or so he saved in taxes cost about $1,500 in billable time.  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the July/August 1995 issue of Worth magazine.

						THE DIS-ORGANIZATION MAN <p>All around you people are saying goodbye to the office and setting up at home. You might be thinking of going solo yourself. But beware: The solitary work life is a complicated one--financially, emotionally, and electronically.   <p> By Richard Todd  <p> I work at home. Of my old house, exactly 11 percent of the floorspace (as recently calculated for the IRS) devotes itself to business, though that might not be the impression if you walked in through the back door. I charge my fellow taxpayers nothing for my use of my dining room table as a storage area, nor do I take off anything for cordwood on days when the office is too cold to occupy and I move to the kitchen table, nearer to the wood stove. The office in question, though its floor slants and its walls admit the west wind, holds (besides me and my desk) two phones, a fax, a word processor, a computer and modem, and a photocopying machine.  <p> I am sort of a Luddite, as it happens, but one has to concede that this stuff (ridiculously cheap, considering its powers) makes my domesticated enterprise possible--or at least plausible to others, which may be the same thing. I can store data. I can generate documents. I can be reached.  <p> And while we're blessing technology, how about a word for the invention that really sustains things around here--the hub concept of delivery, used by Federal Express and its brethren?  <p> So thanks to all modern geniuses for this life, which seems in some lights a kind of idyll. Certainly it seemed so when I was office-bound at a magazine and yearning to be free, in an era of Friday night drives to the country, with the children half asleep and Happy Meal boxes on the floor and a cat on one's shoulder. Wouldn't it be better just to live here? Now I do. Field and wood begin outside the door, and though I am not much of a wing shot myself, I can generally flush a grouse on an autumn afternoon and, if accompanied by a better shot, bring it home for dinner.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>More and more people, it seems, are putting in a hard day at the home office. The question is: Are they pioneers or refugees?</font></b><p> <p> Fewer people worked at home in the early 1980s when I chose this way of life but wait... Did I choose it? In one of the more interesting confessions in his recent book, Robert McNamara admits that he isn't sure whether he resigned from the Johnson administration to join the World Bank or whether the World Bank hired him so Johnson didn't have to fire him. This should give one pause. I don't mean that any such thoughtful conspiracy was at work in my case, only that it's usually wise to be suspicious of freewill, especially when you find yourself participating in what turns out to be a trend.  <p> Around here, everyone I now see in the evening has just put in a hard day at the home office. I live in one of those places that was ripe for this, a long territory in western New England stretching from Litchfield County, Connecticut, to Burlington, Vermont, a region where until recently (no more, alas) deLaval milking equipment outsold Compaq computers. Plenty of such places all across the country are filling up with lone entrepreneurs and telecommuters.  <p> Whether we are pioneers or refugees makes a nice question. Yet the sun shines today on my little community. I have just come back from seeing my friends on the hill, newsletter publishers. They have the coveted Hewlett-Packard combination printer-copier-fax. Also a scanner that somehow receives documents and sets them directly into type, so that the next thing they see after the phone rings is a page proof. Outside, a well-tilled garden awaits its seeds.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Time, the great promise of the work-at-home life. The favoritetime is 7 to 9 a.m.--the exact hours previously wasted getting to work.</font></b><p>  <p> So all's well here, and more of you are coming to join us, aren't you? I can't stop you, don't want to stop you--surely you're doing the right thing. But I have stared out the same window for some time now, and I have some darkish thoughts about this life. The first concerns <p>Time. Time remains the great promise of the work-at-home life, time that expands in every direction. There is something to this. <p> I have a time guru, my friend and sometime colleague Robert Grudin. He's a Shakespearean scholar by trade, but he has also written a truly wonderful book in what might be called the higher self-help genre, Time and the Art of Living. At a conferenceearlier this year, Grudin suggested that a cash value could be assigned to time not spent doing some of the noxious business involved in organizational life, notably commuting. Even a lower income might justify itself on the balance sheet: "These dollar losses are in fact capital investments in the long-term prosperity we call quality of life," he said. We're dealing here with that kind of interesting and not unappealing money that economists like to write about; its only deficiency is that you can't spend it. In any case, Grudin is surely on to something.  <p> The favorite time for home-office workers immediately becomes 7 to 9 a.m., or whatever hours were once wasted getting to work. To tumble downstairs and go directly to your desk is to have a leg up on the whole of the conventional world. Norman Mailer speaks of the special access to your unconscious that you enjoy on first awakening, and though this may matter more to Mailer than to you, you know your creative powers are little enhanced by putting on a starched shirt and heading for a train station in the first light. A time of similar value appears at the other end of the day (particularly if you have napped), but it maybe complicated by Little League practice or some other thing you're now able to do because you have "more time for your family."

						MIXING COMMERCE AND COCOONING  <p>These days home-office communications centers are more nimble and sophisticated than most found downtown. They have to be: The new wave of commerce commuters won't stand for anything less. <p> By Gary Hector  <p> Home may be where the heart is, but it increasingly shares office space with business. This year as many as 4.5 million new people will join the 43 million Americans who work at home, according to LINK Resources, a New York research firm.  <p> The phenomenon of telecommuting is no longer new, but the new wave of commerce cocooners has higher expectations than did the pioneers of a decade ago. With the electronic gear now available, they expect, rightly, that their home office will be less an outpost on the business frontier than a node on a global network.  <p> Today, the ideal home office is a place where an executive or professional can conduct electronic correspondence and tap into an array of information resources. The technology needed to do this is readily available, easy to use, and reasonably affordable. <p> A few thousand dollars will buy a home-office communications center that will be more nimble and sophisticated than most found downtown. A PC or Mac, printer, fax, modem, cordless phone, some software, and a few technical manuals are all you need.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>When it comes to computers, follow the pack. And schedule an upgrade every few years.</font></b><p>  <p> Resist the urge to buy the most powerful computer you can afford. Its capabilities will probably exceed your needs, and no personal computer retains its leading-edge glamour for long. Instead, plan to upgrade every few years as your computing needs grow. <p> Compatibility matters; buy whatever system is favored by your colleagues or clients. IBM or IBM clones, running DOS or Windows, control about 88 percent of the personal computer maket. If you want a Mac, new conversion boards are available that will allow you to run PC software. A new PowerMac with such a board already installed costs about $2,600 and includes a built-in Intel microprocessor.  <p> One thing you shouldn't skimp on is phone lines. Sharing a phone with the rest of the family may seem a prudent economy, but the first time your child answers, you may lose an account. Plan on three lines: one for the family, one for your business, and one to handle faxes and computer links. The new digital cordless phones from Uniden and other makers let you roam around without those Martian sounds you hear on older cordless models, and the digital transmission scrambles the signal, foiling eaves droppers. <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Go online to cut long-distance costs, do research, and read court filings, among other things.</font></b><p>  <p> Unless you're a bona fide hacker ready to tackle the Internet, sign up with at least one online service: CompuServe, Prodigy, or America Online. Connecting to the electronic world through these relatively user-friendly on-ramps has become a major resource for at-home workers. Among other things, these services allow you to send E-mail to any other wired soul. E-mail is instantaneous and can cut your long-distance bills.  <p> CompuServe, the granddaddy of online services, lets you to do patent searches, read recent court filings, search through hundreds of industry newsletters, and, for qualified users, access special tools like J.P. Morgan's system for assessing global investment risk. The major services offer free test periods of three to ten hours.   <p> They also offer ways to access the Internet, though to varying degrees. Prodigy has the best link-up at the moment, and direct links are offered by companies like the Pipeline in New York City or Netcom On-Line Communications, among many providers. Costs run $20 a month for 20 to 40 hours online.   <p> When it comes to modems, buy the fastest available. Although not all online services run at the highest speeds and those that do sometimes charge a premium, few things will save you more time for less money than a modem that can quickly download data. Speed is particularly important on the part of the Internet called the World Wide Web, which is replete with colorful graphics that chew up online time.  <p>  <p><p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Once you're hooked up at home, the major problem may be information overload, not isolation.</font></b><p>  <p> Another option is an Integrated Services Digital Network (ISDN) line, a high-speed telephone connection that carries data at 64 kilobytes per second. These lines have had some technical problems and are just becoming widely available for the home. Pacific Bell is offering free installation in California, with monthly fees starting at $20.  <p> Although most new computers have built-in fax modems, get a standalone machine as well. Faxes are still easier to send by hand especially when it's something you've torn out of a magazine and their arrival is more noticeable in physical form. Hewlett-Packard offers a laser printer (for about $800) that doubles as a fax, saving desktop space. Color ink-jet printers prices also have been falling; you can get a good one for around $450.  <p> As home-office workers plug in and log on, their major problem may in fact be information overload, not isolation. And while the cyber-world can save time and make you money, it is a poor substitute for human contact. Julie Dodd-Thomas, Pacific Bell's resident expert on telecommuting, says, "We don't recommend working at home five days a week."  <p>  <hr>  <p>This article appeared in the April 1995 issue of Worth magazine.

<strong><a name="FUND:ACRNX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/ACRNX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>ACORN</b></a></strong><p>
We like Acorn because we like senior manager Ralph Wanger and the way he picks stocks. He's a classic small-cap investor who uses a disciplined, beat-the-bushes approach to uncover small companies that stand a chance of one day becoming large companies. His objective is to find small companies that he can hold over the long term. (The annual turnover rate of the 350-odd stocks in Acorn's portfolio is a skimpy 29 percent.) <p>
Wanger has a couple of firm rules about stock picking. First, stay away from short-term investing because it costs shareholders money when a fund realizes capital gains and because trading costs on small-company stocks can push up expenses.<p>
The second Wanger rule: Pay for growth, but don't overpay. The average price-to-earnings ratio of stocks in Acorn's portfolio is 25.6 -- not low but well within reason for a fund focusing on small growth stocks.<p>
Wanger does fundamental research on each company he owns and also insists that he or one of his researchers personally interview the company's executives, suppliers, and competitors. "That's very basic," he says. "We always check on a company ourselves." Harley-Davidson, the motorcycle manufacturer, has become a Wanger favorite. So has Carnival Cruise Lines. "The company has to have some sort of theme or a niche that allows you to think they will have a special franchise," says Wanger. <p>
Investors who own Acorn can expect consistency -- in the types of companies in the fund's portfolio and in the manager's style, for Wanger has run Acorn essentially the same way for 26 years. "We've traditionally been a small-cap fund," he says. "We try to stay in more secondary companies, where we think there is more value." <p>

<p>
Since mid-1995, Wanger and his longtime partner, Chuck McQuaid, have been sharing their favorite investment ideas in this magazine's regular "What They're Buying Now" column. Worth readers who own this fund can follow along as the pair seeks out new prospects. Wanger also plans to share his long experience next year in a book he's titled A Zebra in Lion Country. "Zebras are good-looking and agile," Wanger says, explaining the title, "but they have to be careful not to get eaten by the lions." <p>

<strong><a name="FUND:TAVFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/TAVFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>THIRD AVENUE VALUE</b></a></strong><p>
Third Avenue Value may well be the best of the so-called vulture funds. Manager Marty Whitman's mission is about as clear as it gets: to identify assets he can buy for 50 cents on the dollar -- with little or no risk. "We want 'em safe and cheap," says Whitman.<p>
The emphasis on safety is critical because, as Whitman explains in his latest report to shareholders, "every security in which TAVF invests has something wrong [with it]." So, once he and his team of researchers identify an opportunity, they generally spend far more time analyzing the ways it might turn sour than the ways it might soar.<p>
Cautious and yet aggressive at the same time, Whitman's approach has produced an average annual return of 15.97 percent since 1991. Throughout this five-year period, the fund's risk level -- as measured by its standard deviation -- has stayed in the bottom quarter of the industry.<p>

<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
A recent Whitman coup: At the end of last year, Third Avenue began investing in Kmart debentures. They were available at 74 cents on the dollar, partly because rumors were circulating that the big retailer might soon be forced to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Whitman's analysis, however, showed that the credits would not only yield 18 percent annually to maturity but hold their full dollar value even in the event of a bankruptcy.<p>
Third Avenue's most recent plays involve companies that supply equipment to semiconductor manufacturers. "All these companies -- the Silicon Valley Group, for example -- have cash flow far in excess of total liabilities," he says. "All are selling at 6 or 7 times their latest 12-month earnings, while the overall market's at about 19 times earnings."<p>
Of course, as with all technology stocks, these companies carry the added risk that their products could suddenly become outmoded. Whitman hedges by "buying across the entire manufacturing process," he explains. "We figured that out of the eight stocks we picked two might go sour, but six will be big winners."<p>
Whitman wouldn't deign to refer to this strategy as diversification. "Diversification is a poor surrogate for knowledge," he declares. In this case, he's banking on semiconductor chips' continuing to be in heavy demand over the next two to five years, as applications increasingly move from computers to more mainstream uses, such as credit cards, telephones, and automobiles.<p>
Whitman's objective is to earn an annual return of 20 percent, and by mid-September he was only halfway there. Patience, however, is critical when it comes to owning Third Avenue. Whitman's plays can take time to develop, but there's no one with a better reputation for turning 50 cents into a dollar.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Best Large-Cap Growth Fund</font></b><p><p>
<strong><a name="FUND:OAKMX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/OAKMX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>OAKMARK</b></a></strong><p>
Robert Sanborn isn't what you would call his own best salesman. He scoffs at the importance of past performance in picking a fund -- though Oakmark, which he co-founded in 1991 and manages, has returned a remarkable 27.1 percent annually over the past five years. <p>
Sanborn buys a stock only when he'd like to own the whole company -- the Warren Buffett approach to investing. He also puts the bulk of his fund's portfolio (over 70 percent) into a short list of 20 big-company stocks. <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Sanborn makes a point of not having an opinion on the short-term prospects for the market.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Oakmark takes a position in a company when it's selling at 60 percent or less of what Sanborn calculates as the price a rational buyer would pay for it as a whole, i.e., its takeover value. That strategy has spread Oakmark's portfolio across the economy, with some concentration in financial and consumer stocks. Current favorites include Philip Morris, Black & Decker, Anheuser-Busch, Mellon Bank, and First USA. These companies are "all very high-quality, high-return, high-barrier-to-entry businesses with dominant market positions, very loyal end-users, and tremendous international opportunities," Sanborn wrote in a recent shareholder report.<p>
Sanborn makes a point of not having an opinion on the short-term prospects for the market. "I really don't," he says. "At today's valuations levels, I think people should be buying the fund for five years at least and should be able to tolerate a 20 percent decline in their investment value without affecting their lifestyle."<p>
Sanborn and his staff pick stocks one by one. It's a bottom-up process that involves seven analysts, each of whom comes up with ideas that then must compete against those of the other analysts. For a stock to make it into the portfolio, it has to oust one of Oakmark's current top 20 stocks. Turnover this year is below the fund's historically low 18 percent rate.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Best Large-Cap Value Fund</font></b><p><p>
<strng><a name="FUND:DODGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/DODGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>DODGE & COX STOCK</b></a></strong><p>
Dodge & Cox Stock is kept on the straight and narrow in two ways: It adheres to a strict investment philosophy, and it's run by an eight-person committee whose newest member joined 12 years ago. The fund itself dates back to 1965. "We all started at Dodge & Cox in a research capacity," says Ken Olivier, a committee member and senior vice president of the San Franciscobased fund.<p>
Team members say that an emphasis on research, combined with the group dynamic, helps maintain the fund's focus. "It really gives us the persistence to stick with companies," says Olivier. "Too often you buy a stock and it doesn't immediately perform. If a stock's not working, but we're still convinced on the fundamentals, we'll even add to our position in small increments." That's reflected in the fund's turnover rate -- a minuscule 13 percent. Says John Gunn, the fund's president and chief operating officer, "We're enormously persistent. We try to distinguish that from stubborn."<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
At first glance, this fund looks a lot like a S& P fund in disguise.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
An example: Back in 1989, Dodge & Cox took a hefty position in Citicorp at about $30 a share. Then, says Gunn, "we got caught by the real-estate debacle." The stock dropped to $10 a share. "We looked at it and compared the assets and holdings. We looked at past bank debacles and knew we were looking at a lot of quarters without earnings." Still, Dodge & Cox stuck with its pick. Today, Citicorp is trading at around $87 a share.<p>
At first glance, this fund looks a lot like a Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index fund in disguise. More than 95 percent of its 85 stock holdings, in fact, are included in the index. But there are differences. For one, the average price-to-book ratio of the Dodge & Cox portfolio is close to half that of the S&P 500. For another, the fund has consistently outperformed the S&P 500, returning an average 15.33 percent annually for the past five years, compared with 13.58 for the index.<p>
Dodge & Cox's success also stems from serious cost-consciousness. The fund doesn't advertise, and it often achieves a portfolio turnover rate as low as 10 percent. "In running our firm, one of the goals is to keep expenses as low as possible," says Olivier. "Go back to 19861990. Our ratio of expenses to average net assets was in the range of 65 to 69 cents per $100 of assets. Last year we were at 60 cents."<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Best Global Fund</font></b><p><p>
<strong><a name="FUND:USIFX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/USIFX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>USAA INTERNATIONAL</b></a></strong><p>
You don't get where David Peebles has gotten by shying away from the unfamiliar. "The thing I like most about the fund is we're not dealing in efficient markets," says Peebles, manager of USAA International. "I don't find it as interesting to make a decision on buying or selling two or three stocks in an industry where everything is known about the company and everybody has the same information, like choosing between General Motors versus Ford. The global market isn't efficient yet, because the information is not well-known. So you have greater odds of making a lot more money by selecting the right stock."<p>
What does that say about risk? "I think that being diversified in 40 countries, with over 150 stocks in the fund, the fund has relatively low risk," he says. "Because we have so many stocks, we have no real big bets in any one stock, so we've spread the risk out. Because it's low risk we tend to have good performance in down markets."<p>

"You have greater odds of making a lot more money in the global market."<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Peebles and his two portfolio managers, Travis Selmier and Al Sebastian, begin their company analysis with country analysis: They give great consideration to a country's macroeconomic factors and government policies. Then they get down to some very basic stuff. "If you're working in one market, like the U.S., you can develop one style and be pretty successful," Peebles says. "But when you're working in 40 countries, all of which are in various stages of development, you can't rely on a single style. So you not only have to look at things like standard ratios -- p/e, cash flow, book value -- but you have to look at them in relation to, say, accounting principles of various countries." <p>
Twice a year Peebles, Selmier, Sebastian, and the fund's three analysts each make a two-week overseas trip, stopping in as many as five countries apiece. They visit targeted companies and talk to management and also drop in on central-bank officials and meet with analysts and researchers at local brokerages. All this work has produced average annual returns of 13.01 percent for the past five years, which puts USAA International among the top 10 percent of funds in our global category.<p>

						Acorn, Fidelity, Gabelli, IAI, Janus, Kemper, Neuberger & Berman, Robertson Stephens, Scudder, Seligman, Stein Roe, Strong, Templeton, Twentieth Century, Vanguard -- sometimes it seems every mutual-fund family has launched its own site on the Internet. Any investor who doesn't make a regular habit of buying magic beans and bridges to Brooklyn knows these are marketing vehicles. But some fund companies have realized that they need to do more than just promote their funds if they want anyone to read their pages. This means that many of these pages now offer a surprising array of free tools and information.<p>
The World Wide Web site of <a href="http://www.twentieth-century.com/">Twentieth Century Mutual Funds and the Benham Group</a href> is one of the best -- and a sign of things to come. As you might expect, you can sign on to order a prospectus for any one of the company's funds, review your account, or move money from one fund in the family to another. You can click on a menu of funds to get a brief profile of a specific fund -- with return numbers for the year to date and 1, 3, 5, 10, even 20 years, as well as similar numbers for a benchmark index. You can also get data on the fund's top ten holdings and five most heavily weighted industries and receive rankings of the fund against its peers.<p>
All that is a pretty straightforward, but informative and accurate, marketing pitch. The site offers more. There's a free portfolio tracker that can update the prices, volume, and market value of up to ten portfolios of 30 stocks, mutual funds, and options each. The tracker will even let an investor set alerts to "ring" when a stock or fund crosses a price threshold. (Unfortunately, the tracker won't calculate returns on an investment.)<p>
The site also has sections on setting goals and calculating how much you'll need to invest to reach them. It's standard financial-planning advice, and there aren't any spreadsheets that do the calculations for you after you've filled in the data. But this is a solid reference.<p>
Other fund companies have equally strong offerings, with the specific strengths and weaknesses of each reflecting the personality of the family. For example, <a href="http://www.fid-inv.com/">Fidelity Investments</a href> piles information on top of information -- planners, prospectuses, even news with market commentary. <a href="http://www.janusfunds.com">Janus</a href> opens with a photo of a skier and asks an investor to navigate the slopes to find information in "Buzz" sections. For a thorough list of the fund families on the Net, search "Mutual Funds" with the search engine <a href="http://www.Yahoo.com/">Yahoo!</a href>.

						The ideal mutual-fund selection system would do four important things. It would offer a rational, defensible system for identifying which among the best-performing equity funds are likely to maintain a stellar record. It would enable investors to build a portfolio of such funds based on an effective asset-allocation model -- one that would improve returns and reduce risk. It would allow investors to customize their portfolios to suit their specific needs and objectives. And it would provide a framework that would easily accommodate people who own other investments, such as a portfolio of individual stocks or employee stock options.<p>
Such a system is exactly what we set out to construct this year as part of our annual review of mutual-fund performance. We've used our usual dollar-sign ratings for more than 700 funds -- from $$$$$ for the best to a single $ for the worst. Along the way, we'll also reveal our top fund in each of five categories. <p>
We'll also explain how readers can take advantage of our methods to make the best choices in assembling a truly personal investment portfolio.<p>
As a guide, we've developed a basic portfolio model to meet the needs of the typical long-term investor -- plus five additional portfolios modified to fit life as Americans really live it. Investors need to send children to college, they own small businesses, they receive compensation in the form of company stock. Some of us can stand to be aggressive with our investments; others need steady current income or just don't have the stomach for a wild ride. All these factors change the way an investor should allocate investments in their portfolios. We've also included advice on how to assemble the best portfolio within the limitations of the typical 401(k) plan.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>The model portfolios are based on five types of mutual funds.</font></b><p><p>
Our models use the five fundamental asset classes we introduced two years ago: large-capitalization growth, large-cap value, small-cap growth, small-cap value, and global. Together, these groups not only cover the widest possible range of proven investing strategies but also offer the best-known combination for enhancing return while limiting risk. These categories also allow investors who own individual stocks to calculate their exposure in each group -- and to adjust their overall holdings of funds and stocks accordingly.<p>
This general approach, derived from modern portfolio theory and most commonly referred to as asset allocation, has recently become the hot trend in the financial-services industry. One by one, the biggest mutual-fund families -- those that have garnered the lion's share of the 401(k) business -- have begun shifting their marketing campaigns away from the cult of the superstar fund manager. The new emphasis, promoted in the educational programs that are offered through employers to 401(k) participants, is on providing investors with a selection of funds that can be clearly distinguished from one another, that offer clear and consistent styles, and that can be easily combined in a portfolio that is relatively stable.<p>

<p>
Brokerage companies, along with the rapidly growing financial-adviser industry, are preaching the gospel, too. What are they offering to justify their fees? Basically, it boils down to asset allocation. <p>
<strong>WHY ASSET ALLOCATION WORKS</strong><p>

Index funds work best in efficient sectors of the market like large-cap growth.<br>

<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Asset allocation actually seems a strange tool to seize upon as a marketing edge because it isn't all that complicated to execute once you understand the basic principles. It's based on research, begun in the 1950s, that shows how an investor who combines assets with different characteristics in a portfolio can achieve optimal results over the long term.<p>
Asset allocation, for example, lies behind the oft repeated recommendation to blend international equities with domestic stocks to increase performance and lower risk. At first blush, that might seem a mistake. By themselves, foreign stocks are historically riskier than U.S. equities. Yet when an investor adds a mix of international equities to a domestic-stock portfolio, overall risk does decline. According to calculations by Bankers Trust Global Investment Management, for example, from 1971 through 1995, a portfolio of 60 percent U.S. stocks and 40 percent non-U.S. stocks returned about one percentage point more annually and had a standard deviation about 2.5 percentage points lower than a portfolio of 100 percent U.S. stocks. (Standard deviation is a commonly accepted way to measure risk.)<p>
It's actually not the risk level of each asset class that's important; it's how the asset classes work together. Asset allocation reduces risk because some investment classes zig when others zag. Markets that move in the same direction most of the time are said to be highly correlated. There's not much point in building a portfolio around two highly correlated assets. But putting together two assets with a low correlation can give a portfolio quite a pop.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Large-company and small-company stocks also balance each other out.</font></b><p><p>
Nor do investors have to go overseas to find assets with low correlations. Inside the U.S. market, different segments move out of step at times. For example, in 1977, the large-company stocks of the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index lost about 7 percent. Small-company stocks, on the other hand, climbed 25 percent. Value and growth stocks also move out of step as they respond differently to the cycles of economic growth.<p>
The needs and goals of an investor dictate which combination of asset classes is most appropriate. The goal of good asset allocation is to get the most return for the acceptable risk in each situation.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The "Optimist" and "Cautious" portfolios each work along the efficient frontier theory.</font></b><p><p>
To see how this works, look at the model portfolios "The Optimist" and "The Cautious Investor." Each lies along what is called the efficient frontier, a theoretical line that shows the amount of return an investor should aim for at any given level of risk (and vice versa). Badly designed portfolios diverge from this line either by taking on more risk than they need to or by returning less than they should for the risk they take. Well-designed portfolios are those that show the best trade-off between risk and reward.<p>
For example, our Optimist portfolio is projected to return a compounded 13.4 percent a year, according to historical returns for equities as calculated by Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago investment-research firm. (This, like all financial calculations, assumes that the future will resemble the past.) But this portfolio's standard deviation is 17.9 percent -- which means that about two-thirds of the time its return will fall between 31.3 percent and negative 4.5 percent. Quite a ride.<p>
Our Cautious portfolio, on the other hand, is projected to return an average annual 12.1 percent with a standard deviation of 7.3 percent. Two-thirds of the time, this portfolio's return will fall between 4.8 percent and 19.4 percent. That's certainly a lot less risk -- but look at the difference in return. Over 20 years, $10,000 in the Optimist portfolio would grow to $123,669. In the Cautious portfolio it would reach just $98,200. Is one of these models better than the other? Not at all. But one is certainly more appropriate for a given investor.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>It's important to find a fund that meets your goals effectively and stick with it.</font></b><p><p>
Asset allocation can get pretty arcane at this point, as investors try to determine whether to carry, say, 23 percent or 24 percent of their portfolio in small-cap value stocks. This kind of precise optimization -- along with constant updates -- is what the institutions and advisers are peddling. We believe, though, that this degree of accuracy is best suited to institutional investors who can afford to fine-tune a portfolio daily. Most individual investors can do very well with the kind of basic allocation shown in the Worth Portfolio and the modifications shown in the article "Personal Portfolios" (which will appear on Worth OnLine October 30).<p>
Having made the fundamental decisions about asset allocation, the investor should then identify an investment vehicle or vehicles for each asset class. In the case of a fund portfolio, an investor needs to be able to select a mutual fund that invests effectively in each category. Buying a fund that wanders all over the block, investing in small caps one minute and in Dow Jones Industrials the next, would subvert an investor's model. Fidelity's popular Magellan Fund, for instance, altered its investing strategy so drastically in the past year that we had to move it from our large-cap-growth category into large-cap value. Funds that do this force asset-allocation investors to keep readjusting their portfolios to bring them back into balance.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Some people favor index funds to protect themselves in the market.</font></b><p><p>
This is one reason many people favor funds tied to certain stock-market indexes. By definition, these funds must remain consistent in the way they invest. Index funds make a lot of sense for another reason, too: They outperform most active fund managers. By buying an index fund, an investor gets stylistic consistency and returns that are likely to beat as many as three-quarters of all managers.<p>
But index funds also have drawbacks. They work best in efficient sectors of the market like large-cap growth, where the Vanguard Index 500 fund earns $$$$ in our ratings. The fund's five-year average annual return of 13.44 percent ranks it above the 75th percentile in the range of returns of all funds in this category.<p>
In the less efficient category of small-cap growth, the Vanguard Index Small Cap Stock fund doesn't do quite as well. It still earns a $$$$ rating, but its 15.53 percent average annual five-year return puts it in only the 61st percentile in its category. What's more, there are no index funds at all in the small-cap- and large-cap-value categories. Nor does any broad-based index fund appear on our global list. <p>
We use actively managed funds in our system because we believe we can identify managers who have demonstrated substantial expertise in choosing stocks in specific segments of the market -- enough to give them an edge over an index, where one exists -- and who are willing to stick to their guns even when their particular style may be out of favor with the broader market. <p>
<strong>HOW WE PICK THE BEST FUNDS</strong><p>
Each year, we search for such mutual-funds managers by dividing the universe of funds into our five asset classes. We start with recent data provided by Morningstar in Chicago but rely on our own research to fill holes in the numbers and to verify the accuracy of the information. We look only at equity mutual funds with track records of at least five years and assets of at least $50 million. Sector funds -- those that invest only in a specific industry -- don't fit our definition of an asset class, so we do not include them. This year, 719 equity funds meet our minimum requirements.<p>
Next, we split out the global and international funds (this year there were 116), giving us one of our five asset categories. Domestic funds are then divided into four groups through a two-step process.<p>
First, we divide the funds on the basis of whether they invest primarily in small- or large-cap stocks. ("Cap" here refers to the median market capitalization of the stocks in the fund's portfolio.) We designate a fund as large cap if its median market capitalization is more than $1.8 billion. Small-cap funds fall below that level.<p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>The five categories give us the building blocks of an effective, diversified portfolio.</font></b><p><p>
Second, with the help of index analyst Kevin Maloney at Frank Russell Co. in Tacoma, Washington, we classify domestic funds based on whether they are more apt to buy stocks for their growth potential or for their instrinsic value. To do this, we look at the median price-to-book ratio (the relationship between the price of a stock and its underlying asset value) for the stocks in each fund's portfolio. Among large-cap funds, a median price-to-book ratio above 2.96 puts a fund into our growth category; anything below that goes into value. For small-cap funds, we use a median price-to-book ratio of 2.23 as the dividing line.<p>
These two steps do most of our work for us. To double-check our choices, we go back through the funds, looking at such things as the average price-to-earnings ratio and the average growth rate of the stocks they hold. In many cases, we also look at a fund's top stock holdings -- all this to make sure we place each fund in the appropriate investing category. <p>
The five categories give us the building blocks of an effective, diversified portfolio that balances large-cap funds against small-cap, value against growth, and domestic funds against those that invest around the world.<p>
<p><a name="SUB7"><b><font size=+1>Each fund is also rated for return, risk, and predictability.</font></b><p><p>
But we also want to know which funds in each asset category do a good job and which are no better than mediocre. So we rate each for return, risk, and predictability.<p>
We score for return (total investment return minus the effect of sales charges) by comparing each fund's performance against that of its peers during the past five years. Our tables list this score for each fund as well as its raw one-, three-, and five-year results. (We treat global funds a little differently, dividing the category into two peer groups for the purpose of scoring -- one for funds with more than 75 percent of their assets outside the U.S. and one for funds with at least 40 percent overseas.)<p>
To calculate risk, we focus on three measures: standard deviation (which shows the degree of variance in a fund's performance over time); beta (a measure of a fund's volatility in relation to the entire stock market); and turnover (the percentage of stocks in a fund's portfolio that are bought and sold over the course of a year). We give each fund a high-, medium-, or low-risk rating based on how it stacks up against its peers for each of the three measures.<p>
Our predictor rating, a feature found in no other fund-ranking system, assesses how likely a fund is to repeat its past performance. To arrive at this score, we check the tenure of a fund's manager during the five-year study period, look at the rate of growth in a fund's assets since 1993, and compare current ratios such as beta and price-to-book with the same measures three years ago. In each case, we check for big changes that could signal shifts in a fund's style.<p>
<p><a name="SUB8"><b><font size=+1>Each of the best funds has a distinct investing style, one that has served it exceedingly well.</font></b><p><p>
Our final overall rating, expressed by dollar signs, rates each fund based on its level of return, risk, and predictability. Only funds with scores in the top 5 percent of their peer group earn our highest $$$$$ rating. <p>
An investor wouldn't go wrong using any of our $$$$$ funds to construct a portfolio. Some suggestions on how to do this can be found in the box on pages 102 and 103.<p>
To identify our favorite in each category, Worth editors take a close look at each of the top scorers. At this point, the process does become somewhat subjective. What do we know about the manager? What do we think of his or her overall strategy? Do we agree with his or her top stock picks? Do we have reason to believe that this fund will continue to perform in the future as it has in the past? <p>
We selected the five funds that appear in the profiles below. As you read about these funds, you'll note that each has a clear, distinct investing style, one that its manager has stuck with over the years and one that has served it exceedingly well. Each fund has been on top of its game for some time, and we see no reason why it shouldn't stay there in the years ahead. <p>

						Diversifying a portfolio by investing in different asset classes not only can reduce risk but also has been shown to enhance performance. <p>
What's an asset class? Actually, it's just a useful abstraction -- a way of describing a group of investments with similar performance characteristics. To build an effective portfolio, we divided the universe of qualified equity funds (those with five years of history and assets of $50 million) into the five asset classes shown below. Our system features minimal overlap but broad reach. Each category also offers a different level of risk, as measured by standard deviation over the past three years. (Standard deviation is a measure of the variation of a fund's performance over time.) Risk decreases as you go from the top of the list (global funds) to the bottom (large-cap value). <p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Global funds show the greatest standard deviation and therefore the highest risk.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
In addition, the classes have different performance characteristics in relation to one another and to the market as a whole.<p>

<img src="/imgs/WP1028A.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
Global Funds. These 116 funds all have at least 40 percent of their assets overseas. Of our five categories, this one shows the greatest standard deviation and therefore the highest risk. The funds in this category are the least likely to track the U.S. market -- making them a key element in a diversified portfolio. This class is most likely to be overlooked or underweighted.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Small-cap Growth Funds</font></b><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1028B.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
Small-cap Growth Funds. These 114 funds try to buy the stock of small companies soon to become big companies. Earnings of the companies in these portfolios are growing at 28.8 percent annually. These risky funds show the highest beta, the highest price-to-earnings ratio, and the highest standard deviation among our four domestic categories.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Large-cap Growth Funds</font></b><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1028C.gif" width=352 height=240>
Large-cap Growth Funds. These 396 funds seek big companies that are still growing rapidly. The companies in these funds average an annual earnings growth rate of 20.8 percent. Big companies tend to grow more slowly than small ones, but they're also less risky: The price-to-earnings ratio averages 23.2 and the standard deviation 10.3.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Small-cap Value Funds</font></b><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1028D.gif" width=352 height=240>
Small-cap Value Funds. The managers of the 19 funds in this group try to limit their risk and maximize their gains by purchasing the stocks of smaller companies at bargain prices. On average, they pay less than twice book value for a company's shares. The category's beta is just 0.63, far below the beta of 1.0 for the market as a whole. <p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>Large-cap Value Funds</font></b><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1028E.gif" width=352 height=240><p>
Large-cap Value Funds. The managers of the 74 funds in this group try to spot the stocks of big companies that, for one reason or another, may be sharply undervalued by the market. The average price-to-book ratio of a stock in these portfolios is 2.5. With a standard deviation of just 8.9 and a beta of 0.79, these funds are extremely low risk. <p>

<br>
This may be the one time it makes sense for you to read a whole story devoted to the subject of mutual funds. Why? Because the asset-allocation strategy and model portfolios we describe here can work just as effectively for investors who make their own stock selections as for those who buy funds. Investors can easily classify stocks by employing the same criteria we use to place mutual funds into five asset groups. By doing so, investors who own stocks (or a combination of stocks and funds) can ascertain whether their overall portfolio is strategically balanced to meet their needs.<p>

				<font size=6><b>MUTUAL FUNDS: Picks from the Past</b></font><br>
				<font size=4><br>By Jim Jubak</font><p>
				</center>
				
				<blockquote>
					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>If you've taken our advice, you've prospered.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						We developed our system for picking mutual funds two years ago, choosing the first set of five recommended funds in our November 1994 issue and our second set of five in November 1995. We've continued to refine and improve the system since then, but the underlying methodology is essentially unchanged.<p>
So how have our earlier picks fared? And should readers who followed our advice in 1994 or 1995 jettison any of the funds they bought then in favor of the latest crop?<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>What's the update on Worth's earlier mutual fund picks?</font></b><p><p>
The short answer to both questions: We're reasonably content with our earlier selections. Seven of the ten look as solid to us today as when we picked them. We're somewhat concerned about two of our other past choices. And in a third case, we have definitely concluded that investors should abandon ship in an orderly fashion.<p>
So far, we haven't picked the same fund twice to appear in our top five, but that generally has little to do with the performance of any of our picks. For example, two of our top five funds from last year, T. Rowe Price New Horizons and T. Rowe Price Small Cap Value, are now closed to new investors. Their 12-month returns as of August 31, 1996, were 22.04 percent and 17.09 percent, respectively -- both well above the performance of their benchmarks (the Russell 2000 Growth and Russell 2000 Value indexes). Heartland Value Fund, a 1994 top pick, also remains closed. Heartland matched its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Value index, during our most recent 12-month measurement period, earning a 12.12 percent return.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>

</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
It doesn't surprise us a bit that Mutual Beacon and Mutual Qualified, our top picks in the large-cap-value category in 1994 and 1995, respectively, earn $$$$$ ratings again this year. Neither, however, was selected for one of our top five spots this time around. Portfolio manager Michael Price recently sold the fund's parent company to the Franklin Templeton Group, which, in turn, will impose a 4.5 percent sales charge on new investors beginning October 25. That was all we needed to hear -- even considering Beacon's 12-month return of 14.86 percent and Qualified's 13.87 percent. Respectable, yes, but not enough to justify an exorbitant sales charge.<p>
Last November, we were worried about the performance of Warburg Pincus International Equity Fund Common Shares, our 1994 choice for best global fund. This year, we're pleased to say that Warburg has proved the danger of putting too much weight on one-year returns. Although the fund trailed its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley EAFE index, in our 1995 ratings, it bounced back smartly in our most recent rating period, returning 9.87 percent. That handily beat the EAFE. Meanwhile, our 1995 global pick, Founders Worldwide Growth, did even better, returning 11.44 percent. Our top global choice this year, though, outflanked these two because it is better suited to our new asset-allocation model.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Two funds haven't had stellar returns, but they are worth holding onto for the long haul.</font></b><p><p>
We do think that the performances of two funds from the 1994 and 1995 group bear continued close scrutiny. Spiros Segalas's Harbor Capital Appreciation, a 1995 pick, returned just 7.77 percent during the latest 12-month period -- the result of last summer's rout in technology stocks. Segalas has shown an ability to ride out such short-term volatility before, so we think investors should hang on. <p>
We also aren't jumping for joy over the fact that Wasatch Aggressive Equity, a 1994 pick, returned just 3.21 percent for the recent 12-month period, about six percentage points below its benchmark, the Russell 2000 Growth Index. It looks to us as though portfolio manager Samuel S. Stewart Jr. took just enough risk to get clobbered last summer but wasn't aggressive enough to have built up a cushion in the momentum-driven market of 1995 and early 1996. We think this fund is worth sticking with, however, especially since it's now closed to new investors.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>Fidelity's Disciplined Equity has dropped to a $$$ rating this year.</font></b><p><p>
The one fund pick we'd definitely like to have back is Fidelity Disciplined Equity, our 1994 choice for best large-cap growth fund. This year, it dropped to a $$$ rating and returned just 6.46 percent during the most recent 12 months. That's well below its five-year average annual performance of 13.89 percent.<p>
What frightens us now is that manager Brad Lewis seems to have revised the elaborate software model he uses to pick stocks. Our worry is that Lewis may be giving too much weight to the kinds of stocks that have been winners lately, rather than sticking with the style that earned him his early success. That on top of a big drop in the fund's predictor rating in 1995 means the fund just doesn't have the consistency we require for inclusion in our model portfolio.<p>

						<font size=4><b><i>How to shape a portfolio that suits you and your life</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						The Worth Portfolio (see below) provides a good starting point. But investors also can create portfolios of their own design to better address a specific objective, to balance another investment, or even to suit their own temperament.<p>
To illustrate how to do this, we asked Harold Evensky, a financial planner in Coral Gables, Florida, to build four asset-allocation models to our specifications: one for an investor who intends to withdraw funds within a few years; one for the owner of a small business; one for an individual who owns a substantial number of his or her employer's shares; and one for someone willing to take on added risk. Ibbotson Associates, the Chicago investment-research firm, provided us with a fifth model, one including bonds and cash, for investors, such as retirees, who want or need a much greater measure of safety. (These models, by the way, can work equally well for investors who buy individual stocks.)<p>
Note that, even accounting for such differences, none of the five models gives less than 15 percent of the pie to international equities -- an asset class still neglected by U.S. investors and probably the simplest way anyone can improve returns and reduce risk. Also note that increasing the slice of a portfolio devoted to small-cap stocks can boost performance. Ibbotson's research shows that small-cap stocks have returned an average of about 12.5 percent annually from 1926 to 1995, two percentage points above the return of large-cap issues.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
Global investing is probably the simplest way anyone can improve returns and reduce risk.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Recent academic research has shown that investors who buy value stocks -- those downtrodden issues no one seems to want -- will earn better returns than those who chase stocks in the more glamorous growth category. Our custom portfolios therefore place more emphasis on the value style of investing. <p>
Evensky's single biggest allocation adjustment comes in the portfolio designed for a small-business owner. This suggests how important it can be to take a holistic view of your investments, including all the assets you own, not just your stock or mutual-fund portfolio.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>The Worth Portfolio</font></b><p><p>
30%     Large-Cap Value<br>
22%     Global<br>
20%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
15%     Small-Cap Value<br>
13%     Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
This basic yet effective model is a good starting point for any investor. It's specifically designed for a 45-year-old who plans to remain invested for at least 20 years. It offers moderate risk and can be built with mutual funds, stocks, or a combination of both.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>The Parent</font></b><p><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029B.gif" width=352 height=240>
30%     Large-Cap Value<br>
29%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
18%     Global<br>
12%     Small-Cap Value<br>
11%     Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
Won't be long before the kids head off to college? Even determined long-term investors often have short-term goals. The asset-allocation model above takes this into account by reducing the portfolio's overall risk exposure. It moves funds out of more-volatile international equities and also reduces the total investment in small-cap stocks. It increases safety by upping the percentage devoted to the more stable large-cap growth arena.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The Value Employee</font></b><p><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029D.gif" width=352 height=240>
30%     Large-Cap Value<br>
25%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
21%     Global<br>
15%     Small-Cap Value<br>
9%      Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
Grants of stock have become a popular way for companies to reward their most valued employees. But don't forget to include this asset when figuring your overall investment strategy. Consider where your employer's stock might fall in our asset-allocation scheme and reduce your exposure in that area. A worker at a high-tech company, for example, might want to cut back holdings in small-cap growth stocks, as shown above.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>The Entrepreneur</font></b><p><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029E.gif" width=352 height=240>
28%     Global<br>
27%     Large-Cap Growth<br>
45%     Large-Cap Value<br><p>
We're living in a time when layoffs and early retirement are turning more and more of us into middle-aged entrepreneurs. If a substantial portion of your net worth is now tied up in a small business, allocating your investments along the lines shown above may represent an effective strategy. This portfolio is designed for an investor whose business-related equity and investment portfolio are roughly equal in size.<p>
<p><a name="SUB5"><b><font size=+1>The Cautious Investor</font></b><p><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029C.gif" width=352 height=240>
40%     Short-Term Bonds<br>
15%     Large-Cap Value<br>
15%     Global<br>
10%     Cash<br>
8%      Large-Cap Growth<br>
5%      Intermediate-Term Bonds<br>
5%      Small-Cap Value<br>
2%      Small-Cap Growth<br><p>
There is a strong argument to be made for an all-equity portfolio. History says it is the best way to reap the biggest long-run gains. Still, many investors prefer a safer, if less lucrative, route. This model, designed by Ibbotson Associates, adds cash and short-term and intermediate -- but not long-term -- bonds to the mix for an investor who desires current income, liquidity, or just a better night's sleep.<p>
<p><a name="SUB6"><b><font size=+1>The Optimist</font></b><p><p>
<img src="/imgs/WP1029A.gif" width=352 height=240>
28%     Global<br>
27%     Small-Cap Value<br>
20%     Large-Cap Value<br>
14%     Small-Cap Growth<br>
11%     Large-Cap Growth<br><p>
Willing to accept more pain for more gain? For the aggressive investor intent on maximizing return -- and ready to ride out near-term dips, potholes, and craters -- the above model de-emphasizes humdrum blue chips and sharply increases the percentage of assets invested in both foreign issues and small stocks. This approach may make the most sense for investors with extremely long time horizons, such as people in their 20s or early 30s.<p>

Well, pretty close, though it may take some juggling. The 401(k) plans are offering more fund choices in their menus, and the biggest names now almost routinely offer lots of options. But none of the families below offers funds that are open to new investors in all five categories. For example, none offers an open small-cap value fund. It will also take creativity to add the right global mix to several of these menus. Here are our recommendations for four single-family portfolios. The asset classes are indicated in parentheses; all returns are average annual figures.<p>

				<font size=5><b>MUTUAL FUNDS:</b></font><br>
				<font size=6><b>Fees? What Fees?</b></font><br>

						If the mutual-fund companies applied as much effort to the investing process as they do to the creation of new ways to charge fees, investors would be a lot better off. That has been especially true in recent years. Fund marketers have displayed unusual creativity in developing schemes for lining their pockets in new and more complicated ways.<p>
Take Legg Mason as just one example. The <a name="FUND:LMVTX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/LMVTX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Legg Mason Value Trust</b></a>, a large-cap growth fund, looks like a no-load fund. There's no sales charge for buying shares and none for selling. An investor might be forgiven for thinking that all he or she pays is the 1 percent annual management fee -- not unreasonable for a large-cap growth fund.<p>
But that 1 percent isn't all a shareholder in this fund has to cough up. Legg Mason also collects an additional annual fee of .95 percent. That not-so-tiny charge, dubbed a 12b-1 fee, is deducted from fund assets to pay for distribution and marketing costs and can add up fast. For example, an investor who holds the Legg Mason fund for five years would wind up paying a total of 4.75 percent of assets in 12b-1 costs, making the fund nearly as expensive over time as many of the funds sold with old-fashioned front-end loads by Merrill Lynch, Paine Webber, or AIM. This is why we have begun factoring 12b-1 fees into our rating system.<p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>Fund investors looking for a true no-load are finding an increasingly narrow range of choices.</font></b><p><p>
Sadly, fund investors looking for a true no-load fund are combing through an increasingly narrow range of choices. This group -- composed of those funds that don't impose any sales charge or 12b-1 fee -- has fallen to 251 funds, or 35 percent of the 719 funds on our list. And while traditionally investor-oriented fund families, such as T. Rowe Price, Scudder, Strong, Vanguard, Janus, and Twentieth Century, are all still holding the line, one more no-load family will bite the dust on October 25. That's when the sale of Michael Price's Mutual Series funds to the Franklin Templeton Group will close; the funds will then add a 4.5 percent sales charge for new investors.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The not-so-tiny 12b-1 fee is deducted from fund assets for other costs and can add up fast.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Nor is the fund industry cutting fees in other areas to make up the difference. The average maximum sales charge -- 2.82 percent -- was virtually the same for this year's group of funds as for last year's. The expense ratio dropped slightly, from $1.33 per $100 in 1995 to $1.24 in 1996, but that had more to do with our decision to remove the very smallest funds and sector funds from our list this year than with any industry trend.<p>

				<font size=5><b>INVESTING:</b></font><br>
				<font size=6><b>Losers Out of the Gate</b></font><br>
				<font size=4><br>By Scott Burns</font><p>

				<blockquote>
					<center>
						<font size=4><b><i>Simply put, government-bond-fund managers can't beat a five-year treasury.</i></b></font><p>
					</center>
					<font size=4>
						Let's be blunt: government-securities mutual funds don't deserve to exist. <p>
Of the 634 funds (with nearly $130 billion in assets) dedicated to investing in the various types of United States government securities, all but a handful have been a disappointment -- sometimes a bitter disappointment -- to their shareholders. Thousands of investors, many of them retirees, fled the meager yields of bank CDs only to discover that government-bond funds themselves produced low yields and often took a bite out of an investor's capital as well. These investors would have done better if they had simply bought Treasury bills, notes, and bonds and held them to maturity. In this part of the fixed-income market, coughing up fees for active management almost never pays off. <p>
Except for the fund managers, that is. These same funds have provided very nice revenues to their management companies and generated millions in marketing fees for their sales forces. <p>
<p><a name="SUB1"><b><font size=+1>As a whole, government-bond funds have done poorly.</font></b><p><p>
To see just how miserably the government funds have performed as a group, compare them with passive indexes for the same pool of securities. In the five-year period ended July 31, for instance, the average government mortgage fund provided an annualized return of 6.16 percent, according to data from Morningstar, while the Lehman Brothers mortgage-backed-securities index returned 7.46 percent. That's quite a gap.<p>
<p><hr noshade size=1>
<center><font size=+1><i><b>
The real point is that this entire mutual-fund category can't cut the mustard.<br>
</font></i></b></center>
<hr noshade size=1><p>
<p>
Similarly, funds categorized as Government General by Morningstar returned 6.52 percent annually during the period while the Lehman Brothers Government Index returned 8.01 percent. The figures in the table on page 136 show that a performance gap existed for every major time period from 1 to 15 years. <p>
What we are talking about here is a massive failure to deliver the goods.<p>
<p><a name="SUB2"><b><font size=+1>Treasury bonds worked out to be the better bet for many investors.</font></b><p><p>
Let's turn these bloodless figures into the actual results investors experienced. Suppose, for example, that you had invested $10,000 in <a name="FUND:PGSIX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/PGSIX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Putnam U.S. Government Income A</b></a> shares five years ago in August. This fund, sold through many brokerage houses, has $2.6 billion in assets and is one of the ten largest government funds. <p>
If you were retired and instructed the fund to send you all interest income but to reinvest any capital gains, your $9,525 investment (after the commission) would have declined in value to $8,979, and you would have received some $3,372 in interest income.<p>
An investment in a simple five-year Treasury at the same time would have produced a 7.43 percent yield, creating $3,715 in interest income. It also would have returned your original $10,000 at maturity. You could, in other words, have had more income, less risk, a real guarantee that your original principal would be returned, and no sales charge. Somehow, during a period when interest rates declined -- which sent the prices of bonds up -- the actively managed fund lost more than a tenth of this investor's principal and paid less in interest, too.<p>
The point here is not to pillory Putnam U.S. Government Income (among large funds, <a name="FUND:FUSBX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/FUSBX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Federated Fund for U.S. Government Securities A</b></a> shares and <a name="FUND:CUSGX"></a><a href="http://www.investools.com/cgi-bin/Library/t_page.pl/worth/CUSGX"><img src="/imgs/graph.gif" border=0><b>Colonial U.S. Government A</b></a> shares did worse). While one or two of the funds beat the five-year Treasury, they are the exceptions that prove the rule. The real point is that this entire mutual-fund category can't cut the mustard. As they say in Texas: They ain't worth shooting.<p>
<center><strong>EVEN THE BEST BARELY CUT IT</strong></center>
<img src="/imgs/9611I02-chart1.gif" width=475 height=210>
<center><i>Among the largest government-bond funds, only two of the ten best performers beat a humble five-year treasury note.  A version of this table listing the 20 biggest funds is updated monthly on the World Wide Web at <a href="http://www.scottburns.com/">http://www.scottburns.com</a href> -S.B.</i></center><p>
Kind of a broad-brush statement, you say? Let's see.<p>
<p><a name="SUB3"><b><font size=+1>The address the idea that government-bond funds aren't good investments, take a look at the 20 largest funds.</font></b><p><p>
To test the idea, I assembled a list of the 20 largest government-securities funds as a portfolio -- since the 25 largest government funds account for half the assets in the category, the sample is representative of what most fund shareholders experienced. Then I examined their performance in every five-year span since January 1988 -- a total of 44 60-month time periods. Treating the group as a portfolio and counting anything that exceeded the original $10,000 investment as a return on investment -- just like investing in a CD -- I calculated the average performance in each of those time periods and compared it with that of a simple five-year Treasury obligation purchased at the same time.<p>
<p><a name="SUB4"><b><font size=+1>Treasuries beat the government-bond funds the majority of the time.</font></b><p><p>
Guess what?<p>
The five-year Treasury beat the average in 34 of the 44 time periods. Averaging all 44 time periods, I found that a $10,000 investment in a five-year Treasury would have produced $442 more in income, even though interest rates, when averaged, fell a whopping 2.23 percentage points during the study. <p>
At best, the $10,000 Treasury investment outperformed the average fund by $1,142 (between January 1990 and December 1994). At worst, the Treasury bond lagged the index of funds by $337 (between September 1988 and August 1993). <p>
Although the past three years have sent interest rates on a roller-coaster ride, surprisingly there wasn't a single five-year period during which interest rates hadn't declined. If bond-fund managers can't beat a simple Treasury purchase in periods of declining interest rates, how will they do if interest rates actually climb? In that environment, buying a five-year Treasury and holding it to maturity -- which produces slightly less income but guarantees a return of principal -- will look just that much better.<p>
How difficult is it to buy a U.S. Treasury with a five-year maturity? Not very. The Treasury auctions five-year notes each month, and you can participate -- at no cost -- through the Treasury Direct program (202-874-4000) or through a broker-dealer for  about $50. The minimum purchase amount is $1,000 -- which is less than for many mutual funds. So what are you waiting for?<p>

<center><i>Over all time periods, actively managed funds--whether they specialize in mortgage-backed securities or invest in the full range of government issues--fail to beat the passive indexes.  An investor is better off buying and holding a Treasury. -S.B.</i></center><p>

In addition JODC has been carrying out international services as the National Oceanographic Data Center of Japan under the framework of <A HREF="inf/int-inf.html#iode">International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange(IODE)</A>  promoted by IOC, and also in charge of <A HREF="inf/int-inf.html#rnodc">the Responsible National Oceanographic Data Center (RNODC)</A>, which manages the data from international projects such as the IOC Regional Committee for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) programme and Joint IOC-WMO Working Committee for Integrated Global Ocean System (IGOSS) programme and so on.<P>

<H1>Welcome to the Joint JODC and US NODC Home Page for GOIN Demonstration!!</H1>

The Japan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC) and NOAA's National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) are now working on a joint program to demonstrate advances in computer network technology for the Global Online Information Network (GOIN).  
This will establish an on-line service system for providing oceanographic data and information.  A Mosaic Home Page will be developed using the World Wide Web on INTERNET.<P>

The two data centers have served as an integral part of the World Data Center System and have been a focal point in international oceanographic data management.  UNESCO's Intergovernmental Oceanographic Data Exchange(IODE).  Activities and information for IODE will be demonstrated.<P>

Recent joint efforts in locating and rescuing global historical data for the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission's Global Oceanographic Data Archaelolgy and Rescue Project (GODAR) have resulted in the publication of the World Ocean Atlas 1994 and CD-ROM set.  Data collected by the JODC for this ongoing project will be exchanged and demonstrated.<P>

The JODC and NODC both cooperate in another IOC international project called the Global Temperature- Salinity Pilot Project (GTSPP).  Global measurements of ocean temperature and salinity (T-S) are quickly and easily accessible to users. Data collected by the NODC for this ongoing project will be exchanged and demonstrated.<P>

<H1>JODC International Activities</H1>

JODC supports a number of international data exchange activities that help it fulfill its mission. Participation in these activities promotes data exchange and enables JODC to increase its data holding with valuable foreign data taken worldwide. JODC serves as Japan focal point for data exchange activities conducted under the framework of International Oceanographic Data and Informaton Exchange (IODE) of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC).<BR>
JODC has been organized the training course on oceanographic data management every year since 1982 in support of the activities of IOC Regional Committee for the Western Pacific (WESTPAC) to allow personnel currently involved in oceanographic data and information management from Member States of the WESTPAC region to become acquainted with basic concepts of the IODE system and its function, and acquisition, procession, and compilation of oceanographic data as Data Center.<P>

<HR>
<H2><A NAME="iode">International Oceanographic Data and Informaton Exchange (IODE)</A></H2>
The IOC was established in UNESCO to increase the knowledge on marine science and marine resources with the aim of promotion of scientific researches through Member States activities. The following recommendations were made at the 1st General Assembly in 1961 to encourage the system of International Oceanographic Data Exchange (IODE):
<UL>
<LI>to promote data exchange in the framework of World Data Center (WDC) system under the guidance of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).<P>
<LI>to promulgate the concept of Declared National Programmes (DNP) and National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) as national activities being carried out with the intention to exchange the data.<P>
<LI>to standard the format for international exchange of marine scientific data<P>
<LI>to assist the development of NODC<P>
</UL>
There are 3 WDCs for oceanography, WDC-A in Silver Spring, Maryland, US, WDC-B1 in Obninsk Russia, WDC-D in Tianjin China, and 52 NODCs in the world.<P>

<H2><A NAME="rnodc">Responsible National Oceanographic Data Center (RNODC)</A></H2>
Considering the recent needs for oceanographic data and the necessity for promoting international data exchange have been on the increase on a global scale, the IOC has established RNODC in the IODE system. The RNODC provides special data processing and compilation support for specific programs and certain areas. The next is a list of RNODCs operated by each NODC.<P>

<H2>RNODCs operated by JODC</H2>
<UL>
<LI><H3>Integrated Global Ocean Services System (IGOSS)</H3><P>
The IGOSS is a joint IOC-WMO operational service project implemented in 1972 for the provision of information on the water temperature, salinity, ocean current, etc. of the oceans in the world to facilitate marine activities, to ensure navigational safety, to develop living resources and to improve weather forecasts. JODC together with the NODC of U.S.A. and Russia manages the data for specific geographical areas as RNODC with the responsibility. The state of data management is reported to the IOC and the WMO regularly.<P>
<LI><H3>IOC Regional Committee for the Western Pacific Programme (WESTPAC)</H3><P>
Following the termination of the Co-operative Study of the Kuroshio and Adjacent Region (CSK) conducted as one of IOC projects, the WESTPAC programme started in 1979 with 19 Member States as a semi-permanent project for comprehensive marine research in the western pacific area with more expanded area and more research items than those of the CSK. As the RNODC for WESTPAC JODC assists the development of the programme by publishing "WESTPAC Data Management Guide" and "WESTPAC Newsletter". In addition JODC holds a training course on oceanographic data management for the staff of the oceanographic data center in the developing countries in the WESTPAC region.<P>
<LI><H3>IOC Marine Pollution Monitoring Programme (MARPOLMON)</H3><P>
The MAROPOLMON is to monitor marine pollution spreading in parts of oceans on a global scale and to evaluate pollution problems in marine environment. Twenty seven countries take part in the project, making investigations on oil, heavy metals and PCB since 1980. Three RNODCs for MARPOLMON have been established in Japan for the western pacific region, in the USA for the Caribbean region and in Russia for the Atlantic, Mediterranean and Baltic Seas.<P>
<LI><H3>Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler (ADCP)</H3><P>
JODC has been designated as RNODC for ADCP in July 1991 to develop the methodology of ADCP data management.<P>

<H1>Serial Station Data</H2>

<HR>
This file contains physical-chemical oceanographic data at various depth levels by using muliti-bottle Nansen casts or other types of water samplers. The principal measured parameters are temperature and salinity, but some stations may include other parameters shown in follwing Table,

Meteorological conditions at the time of the cast may also be reported. Values of density, sound velocity, and dynamic depth anomaly, are computed from measured parameters. In addition to the observed data at the depth levels each station includes values interpolated to a set of standard depth.<P>
Each station is identified by JODC's reference number, which consists of 10 digits (CCIISSCCCC) for data before 1965, 12 digits (CCYYIISSCCCC) for afterward. The meanings of the characters are :
<UL><PRE>
CC: country code              YY: last two digits of observation year
II: institute code            SS: cruise No.
CCCC: sequential No.of station

<H1>Bathythermograph(BT) Data</H1>

<HR>

The bathythermograph (BT) data contains temperature profile data (temperature at standard depth and depth of significant temperature) from the mechanical bathythermograph (MBT), the expendable bathythermograph (XBT), the digital bathythermograph (DBT) and the airborne expendable bathythermograph (AXBT). Because they vary in quality, the way in which they are reported to JODC, and the depths at which they are recorded, the BT data are maintained in separate files. The data, however, are all recorded in the same format and may be merged if desired. <P>

<H1>Ocean Surface Current (GEK, DRIFT, ADCP) Data</H1>

<HR>
The following group of three related files contains ocean surface current data from GEK (Geomagnetic Electrokinetograph Instrument), ship drift and ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler). For each observation, data source, position, and current direction and speed are recorded. For ship drift data, the individual observations are not highly accurate because other factors such as wind that affect the ship's course are ignored in this approximation. The data measured by ADCP have current data at various depth in the observation, however, the only surface currents are filed. <P>

<H1>Statistics of Ocean Current in 1 degree Mesh</H2>

<HR>
This product is a summary of statistical analyses (by month in 1 degree ) of surface ocean current data from GEK (Geomagnetic Electrkinetograph) and ADCP (Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) data in the Japan adjacent seas.  The data used are for 1953 to 1994.  A screen shows statistics of a month at a level in 11 degrees by 11 degrees in latitude and longitude around the selected point.  It includes mean speed (upper),  mean current direction (arrow) and number of samples (lower) in the grid.  Maximum and minimum current and stability for the grid indicated by red square are also displayed below the map.<P>

<H1>Sea Depth in Mesh</H1>

<HR>
This file is a summary of statistical analyses of sea depth in a mesh (lat. 30" by lon. 45", nearly 1 Km square, so-called 3rd mesh).  The file contains mean depth, shallowest depth, standard deviation, number of samples and 3rd mesh code in a record (50 bytes).  The data used are from hydrographic survey data by Hydrographic Department, General Bathymetric Chart of the Oceans (GEBCO) data and JODC Bathymetry Integrated Random Data Set (J-BIRD).  The data volume is about 80 Mbytes.  The area from 0 N to 48 N in latitude and from 120 E to 180 E in longitude is covered in the file.<P>

<HR>
The IOC was established in UNESCO to increase the knowledge on marine science and marine resources with the aim of promotion of scientific researches through Member States activities. The following recommendations were made at the 1st General Assembly in 1961 to encourage the system of International Oceanographic Data Exchange (IODE):<BR>
<UL>
<LI>to promote data exchange in the framework of World Data Center (WDC) system under the guidance of the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU).<P>
<LI>to promulgate the concept of Declared National Programmes (DNP) and National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) as national activities being carried out with the intention to exchange the data.<P>
<LI>to standard the format for international exchange of marine scientific data<P>
<LI>to assist the development of NODC<P>

<H1>WORLD OCEAN ATLAS CD-ROM SERIES 1994</H1>

<HR>
The Ocean Climate Laboratory (OCL) at NODC is supported by the NOAA Climate and Global Change program to produce scientifically quality controlled databases of the world ocean.  Work to date includes quality control of historical in situ temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate data and the preparation of one-degree latitude-longitude mean fields for each of these parameters.  Specifically, this project has produced four ocean atlases  escribing the global distributions of these parameters and two technical reports (TR-79 and TR-81) in the NOAA Technical Reports section in NODC Publications, describing the quality control and processing procedures.<P> 
Observed and standard level profile data (along with quality control flags) used in the production of these atlases are being made available in a World Ocean Atlas 1994 CD-ROM series (referred to herein as WOA94).  In addition, the series contains the objectively analyzed one-degree latitude-longitude mean fields for each of the measured parameters, and two derived parameters (Apparent Oxygen Utilization and oxygen saturation), and five-degree square statistics of standard level values.<P>
Profile data on the WOA94 series are recorded in ASCII format and sorted geographically, so they are easy to access and manipulate.  The CD-ROMs are formatted in the ISO 9660 standard.  (9 discs)<P>

ROM are viewed using a software application named "Worldview". Worldview is a
product offered by Interleaf, a company that develops and markets high end
desktop and Internet publishing software. Worldview documents are built with
hyperlinks that allow the user to navigate the information and data on the CD-
ROM and launch external applications which in this case includes Ocean PC.

In addition to documents, the CD-ROM contains data, data retrieval and
conversion applications, some GTSPP software, and the Ocean PC application to
process and display the data. These data retrieval and processing applications
are launched from within the document collection using Worldview hyperlinks.
The hyperlinks are within documents that instruct the user on how to extract
data and install and start up Ocean PC for processing and viewing it. Thus it
is only necessary to start up Worldview to have access to all the data and
information on the CD-ROM.

2. PC REQUIREMENTS

To view the information on the GTSPP CD-ROM a PC is required with a CD-ROM
drive. The PC should be a 386 or higher. A single speed CD-ROM will work but
will be found to be slow. A higher speed CD-ROM is preferable. The operating
system must be Windows 95, Windows 3.1 or greater. Worldview runs off the CD-ROM
itself and only minimal disk and memory resources are used unless the user unpacks
data from the CD-ROM or uses Ocean PC. In that case the user needs to have
enough disk space available to hold the retrieved data and to install Ocean
PC.

Whatever the use it will be necessary for the application launch program to
install one small ASCII file in the C:\WINDOWS directory, and for a temporary
directory C:\TEMP to be provided for use by Worldview.

3. STARTING UP WORLDVIEW AND VIEWING THE INFORMATION ON THE GTSPP CD-ROM

If you are using this CD-ROM set for the first time some changes must be made
to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file and a directory may have to be added in the C:  root
directory as follows in section 3.1.

If Worldview has already been used from this or a similar CD-ROM, then proceed
to section 3.2

3.1 The First Time you use Worldview and this CD-ROM:
*****************************************************

Step 1: Use the DOS editor launched from DOS to edit your AUTOEXEC.BAT file.

Add the following statements

SET FULTEMP=C:\TEMP
SET GTSPP_ROMDRIVE = letter (where "letter" is the letter for your CD-ROM
reader)
SET GTSPP_OUTDIVE = letter (where "letter" is the letter for any output files
when data or software are retrieved)

Save the changes, exit the editor, and restart your computer.

Step 2: Add a directory named C:\TEMP

Use the file manager to inspect the C:\WINDOWS directory to see whether a
directory TEMP already exists. If not, use the create directory menu option
under the file manager file menu to create a directory named TEMP in the
C: root directory.

(Note that this TEMP directory is used by the full text search utility in
Worldview. If your C drive has very little space available it may be necessary
to put this TEMP directory somewhere else. In that case the TEMP directory can
be put elsewhere as long as the statement SET FULTEMP= ... is amended to
provide the complete path name in the AUTOEXEC.BAT file.)

Step 3: Proceed to launch Worldview as directed below.

3.2 Launch the Worldview Application from the CD-ROM
****************************************************

Step 1: Delete or rename the Existing IVIEW.INI File (if necessary).

If you have used Worldview with a different CD-ROM since last using this CD-
ROM then delete the file IVIEW.INI from the directory C:\WINDOWS, or rename
it.

(The application which launched Worldview looks in the C:\WINDOWS directory.
If IVIEW.INI exists it launches Worldview and uses that INI file to view the
information on the CD-ROM. If it doesn't find a file IVIEW.INI then it copies
the one that has been installed on the CD-ROM. Since the INI file on each CD-
ROM is specific to that CD, it must be copied and used.)

Step 2: Launch the Worldview Application

Start up the File Manager Application from Windows. In the root directory
there is a file named WV_START.EXE. Double click this file to start the launch
application.

The launch application may ask permission to install the IVIEW.INI file in the
C:\WINDOWS directory. This is a small ASCII file of the order of 100 lines.
Click YES.

The launch application may also ask permission to install a file named
VBRUN300.DLL on the C drive. This file is required to run visual basic from
the CD-ROM. The launch application is written in visual basic. Click OK or YES
to allow the installation.

The launch application may also present a screen that states the need to
install the Microsoft 32 bits extensions on the PC. The 32 bit extensions are
included on the CD-ROM and are required to run Worldview. Therefore if the CD-
ROM is to viewed, it is necessary to allow the installation to proceed. Click
OK or YES to proceed with the installation and follow the instructions on the
screen. This install proceeds like most other installations on a PC. At the
end of the install, a screen should indicate a successful installation and the
user will see a box which must be clicked to restart the PC. After the PC has
restarted the user must again start up Windows, select the file manager, and
double click the WV_START.EXE file to launch Worldview. This time  and for all
future launches the launch will discover that the 32 bit extensions have been 
installed and will skip that step.

Once all the necessary files and software from the CD-ROM have been installed,
the launch program will display the Worldview screen for part of a minute. A
screen will then show with a document window obscured behind it. The front
window will have the title bar "Global Temperature & Salinity Pilot Project".
Click the cancel button on this front window to get to the first screen of the
information collection on the CD-ROM.

To view the information use the hyperlinks to navigate the CD and the page up,
page down keys to browse within a document. 

Although the collection can be navigated using the Hyperlinks, users are
advised to learn and use the Worldview menus, tool bar, and set the
preferences.  For this purpose a hard copy quick reference guide has been
included with the CD. In future additions such a guide will be included on the
CD-ROM in electronic form.

1. INTRODUCTION
===============

The Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS) is an international
system, co-ordinated by the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission
(IOC) of UNESCO, to provide high-quality sea level data from a global
network of sea level stations. It has been designed to observe large
scale variations in sea level, and to monitor changes which could be
indicative of global warming, ocean circulation patterns, climate
variability, etc. The network contributes data to international
research programmes and complements satellite altimetry measurements.

The GLOSS network was initiated in 1985 and consists of more than 300
sea level stations which are operated and maintained by some 80
countries worldwide. Data from the network are collected and archived
at the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) in the form of
monthly mean values.

In April 1996, the IOC invited the British Oceanographic Data Centre
(BODC) to compile and publish a CD-ROM for GLOSS to mark the occasion
of the 'Second Conference of Parties of the UN Framework Convention on
Climatic Change', Geneva, July 1996. It was intended initially that
the CD-ROM should simply include the 'GLOSS Station Handbook' (hence
the title of the CD-ROM) containing detailed information on the tide
gauge stations in the GLOSS network. In the event, it was decided to
expand the contents to include a wide range of other material relevant
to the measurement of mean sea level, including for example the
complete data holdings of the PSMSL.

The PSMSL and BODC are both hosted by the Proudman Oceanographic
Laboratory at Bidston Observatory. The laboratory is part of the
Centre for Coastal and Marine Sciences, a component body of the UK's
Natural Environment Research Council. In addition to its many other
activities, the BODC serves as one of the Sea Level Data Assembly
Centres for the World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) and is part
of the IOC's international network of national oceanographic data
centres. The PSMSL is a member of the Federation of Astronomical and
Geophysical Data Analysis Services (FAGS) established by the
International Council of Scientific Unions.


2.  CONTENTS OF THE CD-ROM
==========================

2.1 Introduction
================

The CD-ROM contains six basic products:

      I Overview of the GLOSS System

     II The GLOSS Station Handbook

    III The PSMSL Data Sets

     IV IOC Manuals & Guides No. 14, Volume I

      V IOC Manuals & Guides No. 14, Volume II

     VI PSMSL Public Access Files

Products I, III, IV and V are hypertext documents in Adobe Acrobat
format - they may be viewed on the user's screen or directed to the
user's printer. The executable code for Acrobat Reader (which has its
own on-line help) is included on the CD-ROM.

Product II is a BODC developed system with its own inbuilt software
interface.

Products I to V were designed for use within a Windows environment.

Product VI is a set of simple flat ASCII files.


2.2 Overview of the GLOSS System
================================

The Overview document provides an introduction to the GLOSS system,
together with information on its current status and links to other
international and regional sea level programmes. It contains
information on training activities within GLOSS and includes a
recently updated list of publications relevant to GLOSS and PSMSL. The
document also gives a detailed description of the 'GLOSS Station
Handbook' and instructions on how to use the handbook.


2.3 The GLOSS Station Handbook
==============================

The Handbook is a comprehensive database of information about the 308
tide gauge stations that currently make up the GLOSS network. A full
description of each station is provided, including tide gauge details,
benchmark information, data delivery systems, and the GLOSS national
contact point. The accompanying software allows the selection and
display of: a) station information, b) monthly and annual mean sea
level plots for each station, if the data are held by PSMSL, and c)
map images of the tide gauge sites and their benchmarks (available for
about 100 stations).


2.4 The PSMSL Data Sets
=======================

The PSMSL Data Sets document contains a complete listing of the 42,360
station years of sea level data held by PSMSL as of June 1996 and
covering 1754 stations worldwide. The monthly and annual mean values
for each station are displayed in a computer printout format together
with relevant supporting documentation. A full catalogue of the data
is provided with the stations arranged in geographic order - hypertext
links from the catalogue allow the user to display data for the
station(s) of interest.


2.5 IOC Manuals & Guides No. 14
===============================

These two volumes comprise the IOC Manual on Sea Level Measurement and
Interpretation. Volume I (Basic Principles) was published in 1985 and
is based on training courses held at Bidston Observatory on behalf of
PSMSL and IOC. It contains information on the scientific aspects of
sea level change and on the practical aspects of sea level measurement
and data reduction. Volume II (Emerging Technologies) was published in
1994 and is complementary to the earlier volume, extending and
updating the material on measurements.


2.6 PSMSL Public Access Files
=============================

The PSMSL maintains an on-line public access information system,
accessible by anonymous FTP, containing not only full copies of its
data holdings but also a wide range of other ancillary data and
information. The system includes help/information files and Fortran
programs, and is updated several times a year. The CD-ROM contains a
full set of the information system files (as of June 1996), each
stored in a simple flat ASCII format. User notes and information on
the contents of these files may be found in the 'readme' file that
accompanies them. Contents include the following:

a) a short description of PSMSL and its data sets;

b) a catalogue printout of the PSMSL data holdings;

c) copies of PSMSL's main data sets in a form suitable for further
   analysis, e.g. through the user's own Fortran programs;

d) copies of PSMSL's main data sets in a computer printout format;

e) a copy of the contents of the 'GLOSS Station Handbook', excluding
   graphics images such as data plots and site maps;

f) a list of publications relevant to PSMSL and GLOSS;

g) text and tables (but not figures) of the PSMSL 'Ancillary Time
   Series' report of 1988. This includes a wide range of mean sea
   level data held by PSMSL which, for various reasons, have not been
   considered suitable, or to the standard necessary, for inclusion in
   PSMSL's main databases;

h) a copy of the IAPSO Pelagic Tidal Constants data set;

i) information on the availability of air pressure data;

j) information on the POL/PSMSL TASK tidal analysis package.


2.7 Other Material
==================

It will be noted that some of the items contained in the PSMSL Public
Access Files (e.g. items b), d), e) and f) above) duplicate
information contained within the other products stored on the CD-ROM.
This is because the other products have been designed primarily for
use within a Windows environment. The duplicated information contained
in the PSMSL Public Access Files has been included for the benefit of
DOS and Unix users without access to Windows.

The CD-ROM also includes a DOS version of the 'GLOSS Station Handbook'
containing the same information as the Windows version but without the
site location maps - these map images are accessible separately in a
set of TIFF formatted files.

Finally, the CD-ROM also includes the executable code for Adobe
Acrobat Reader for use in reading the hypertext documents which form
the main body of the CD-ROM.


3. CD-ROM DIRECTORIES
=====================

The CD-ROM is formatted according to the ISO 9660 Standard and
contains files organised into nine directories, viz:

**Root Directory - contains two files:

    'readme.txt' - a simple flat ASCII version of this document

    'setup.exe' - this program is used to set up the Windows user
                  interface to the CD-ROM (see section 4)

**Directory INSTALL - contains the files used by the 'setup' program

**Directory DATA - contains the data files used by the Windows version
    of the 'GLOSS Station Handbook' software

**Directory MAP - contains bit-maps of the tide gauge site location
    maps used by the Windows version of the 'GLOSS Station Handbook'
    software

**Directory MANUAL - contains Adobe Acrobat formatted versions of:

      'The Overview of the GLOSS System'
      'The PSMSL Data Sets'
      'IOC Manuals & Guides No. 14, Volumes I & II'
       This 'readme' document

**Directory MAPTIFF - contains user-accessible TIFF formatted versions
    of the tide gauge site location maps from the 'GLOSS Station
    Handbook'. Each file contains a single image and the following
    file naming convention is used:

         'GLNOnnnx.tif'

    where 'nnn' is the GLOSS station no. of the site and may be up to
    3 digits. If the site has more than one map, then the maps are
    identified with entries of 'a', 'b' or 'c' in 'x'.

**Directory PSMSLFTP - contains a full set of simple flat ASCII files
    from the PSMSL on-line public access information system (as of 14
    June 1996). These are a direct copy of the files normally made
    available to users via anonymous FTP. Detailed information on the
    contents of these files may be found in the 'readme' file within
    the directory (PSMSLFTP).

**Directory GLOSSDOS - contains Version 2.1 of the 'GLOSS Station
    Handbook' complete with a DOS based software interface. The
    content is the same as Version 3.0 accessible through the Windows
    interface to this CD-ROM except that it does not contain the site
    location maps (these are available separately as TIFF files from
    Directory MAPTIFF). Detailed instructions are supplied in the
    'read.me' file within the directory (GLOSSDOS).

**Directory ADOBE - contains executable code for the Adobe Acrobat
    Reader version 2.1. In addition to a Windows version, a DOS
    version is also included. The help system for the Windows version
    is available in 7 languages.


4. HOW TO USE THE CD-ROM
========================

The CD-ROM has been designed primarily for use within Windows 3.1 or
above, although a considerably reduced facility is also available for
DOS and Unix users.


4.1 Use within Windows
======================

To install the CD-ROM support system on your PC, simply load the
CD-ROM in its drive and follow one or other of the following
procedures:

Windows 3.1: Select 'Run' from the File menu of Program Manager; enter
     'd:\SETUP.EXE' (where 'd' is the drive letter of your CD-ROM
     drive) in the box and then click on 'OK'.

Windows 95: Select 'Run' from the Start Menu; enter 'd:\SETUP.EXE'
     (where 'd' is the drive letter of your CD-ROM drive) in the box
     and then click on 'OK'.

You will then be taken through a simple 3-stage dialogue:

Stage 1 enables you to set a directory name for the installation - by
default it is set to 'c:\GLOSS'

Stage 2 enables you to set a name for the Windows Program Group - by
default it is set to 'GLOSS'

Stage 3 enables you to choose between a 'default' or 'custom'
installation

* 'Default' Installation - with this option the setup program
   automatically installs the CD-ROM support system on your computer.
   It also installs the Adobe Acrobat Reader software if a PDF reader
   for Adobe does not already exist - if already present it does not
   reinstall. By default, the Adobe Acrobat Reader help system is made
   available in the English language.

* 'Custom' Installation - this option provides 4 additional features
   compared with the 'default' installation, the first 3 of which
   enable you optionally to install the DATA, MAP and MANUAL
   Directories (see section 3) respectively from the CD-ROM onto hard
   disk - alternatively they can be left on the CD-ROM, in which case
   they will be accessed from the CD-ROM as and when required. The
   fourth feature enables you to select the language in which you
   would like the Adobe Acrobat Reader help system to be presented -
   the following options are available: English, German, French,
   Spanish, Italian, Dutch or Swedish. This feature should also be
   used if you wish to force the loading of the Adobe Acrobat Reader
   in case there are problems concerning a pre-existing installation
   of the reader, or you wish to upgrade an earlier copy to version
   2.1.

Once you have completed the above dialogue and clicked the 'OK' box,
the system is ready to run and you will be offered the following six
icons:

   a) 'README'                      (for this document)

   b) 'GLOSS STATION HANDBOOK'

   c) 'GLOSS OVERVIEW'              (for document described in 2.2)

   d) 'IOC M & G No. 14 VOL. I'     (for manual described in 2.5)

   e) 'IOC M & G No. 14 VOL. II'    (for manual described in 2.5)

   f) 'PSMSL DATA SETS'             (for document described in 2.4)

Double clicking on the relevant icon activates the appropriate
product. For all icons except 'GLOSS STATION HANDBOOK' you will be
placed on the cover page of the relevant hypertext document - the
facilities of the Acrobat Reader are then available for you to browse
through the document selectively, printing out pages as and when
required. If you are not familiar with the Acrobat Reader you should
consult its integral help system.

To start running the 'GLOSS Station Handbook' software, double click
on the Handbook icon. This brings you to the main index of GLOSS
Stations. This index can be browsed; individual stations can be marked
in order to view detailed information about the station on the screen
or sent to a printer. In addition, where monthly and annual sea level
data are held by PSMSL, these may be plotted on screen and the plots
sent to a printer. For approximately 100 stations, maps are also
available showing the location of the gauge and benchmarks. These can
be displayed and sent to a printer. The 'GLOSS Station Handbook' has
its own integral help system - a full copy of this text can be found
in section 2 of the 'Overview of the GLOSS System' document, i.e. by
double clicking on the 'GLOSS OVERVIEW' icon.


4.2 Use within DOS
==================

As mentioned previously, the CD-ROM was not designed for use within
DOS but some facilities have been included in case you are only able
to work through DOS.

4.2.1
=====

A DOS version of the 'GLOSS Station Handbook' is available on the
CD-ROM but without the site location maps - instructions for
installing and running this DOS version can be found in the ASCII text
file 'read.me' in directory 'GLOSSDOS'. TIFF formatted versions of the
site location maps can be found in directory 'MAPTIFF' - see section
3.

4.2.2
=====

The CD-ROM contains a DOS version of the Adobe Acrobat Reader software
to enable you to access the five hypertext products. It can be
installed as follows:

a) change current drive to your CD-ROM drive, e.g. if your CD-ROM is
   drive 'd', type 'd:' and press return;

b) use CD command to change current directory to
   '\adobe\acro_v1\acrodos';

c) type 'install', press return and follow the on-screen instructions
   to install the Acrobat Reader on your hard disk.

To run Acrobat at any time, type 'acrobat' and press return. From the
'open file' window, select your CD-ROM drive in the 'drive'
sub-window, then select 'MANUAL' from the directory list. Finally,
select the PDF file for your chosen hypertext product from the
following file list:

   'PSMSLDAT.PDF' = PSMSL Data Sets;
   'GLOSS.PDF'    = Overview of the GLOSS System;
   'README.PDF'   = this document;
   'IOC_14I.PDF'  = IOC Manuals & Guides No. 14, Vol. I;
   'IOC_14II.PDF' = IOC Manuals & Guides No. 14, Vol. II

and press 'open'.

You will then be placed at the cover page of the selected hypertext
document and the facilities of the Acrobat Reader will be available to
enable you to browse through the document, selectively printing out
pages as and when required. If you are not familiar with the Acrobat
Reader you should consult its integral help system (available in
English only in the DOS version).

It is highly desirable to use a mouse when running this system.


4.3 General Use
===============

The CD-ROM contains a wide range of simple flat ASCII files that you
can access directly whether through Windows, DOS or Unix. In
particular, the PSMSL Public Access Files are stored in this form.

<HR>
<B>Introduction</B><BR>
 This is the second product of the Aeromagnetic Map Compilation Programme of CCOP (Coordinating Committee for Coastal and Offshore Geoscience Programmes in East and Southeast Asia), following the &quot;Magnetic Anomaly Map of East Asia&quot;, which was published in l994 by Geological Survey of Japan and CCOP. The objective of this CD-ROM publication is to provide users with gridded digital magnetic anomaly data obtained from the programme and also to give you chances of displaying the map on computers and using it in a digital form.<BR>
 This CD-ROM publication consists of one CD-ROM and one booklet. Brief instructions to the CD-ROM are given in this booklet. Please also refer to the description of the &quot;Magnetic Anomaly Map of East Asia&quot;.<P>

 Many people and organizations in the member countries as well as the cooperating countries of the CCOP contributed in the compilation of &quot;Magnetic Anomaly Map of East Asia&quot;.<BR>
 Most of the data sets of CCOP member countries were brought by their national coordinators and contributers listed below.<BR>
 Most of the data sets of Indonesian region were obtained through the CCOP's Programme on Gravity and Magnetics, which H. Hasegawa coordinated from 1981 to 1983.<BR>
 Project Magnet data sets were made available by the assistance of Otis Avery and F. Slade Barker of the U.S. Naval Oceanographic Office. Karl Hinz and Hans A. Roeser of the Federal Institute of Geosciences and Natural Resources, Germany provided this compilation with survey data of the South China Sea and the Sulu Sea collected by R/V Valdivia and Sonne. Sunvey data of the Japan Sea and offshore Vietnam collected by Russian research vessels were provided by R. Kulinich of the Pacific Oceanologlcal Institute, Russia.<BR>

<B>Contents</B><BR>
 The following files are included in this CD-ROM:<BR>
1. Gridded data files which were used to make &quot;Magnetic Anomaly Map of East Asia&quot;,<BR>
2. Track line data files corresponding to the data sets that were used in the compilation of the above map,<BR>
3. Image data files to show magnetic anomaly data on a computer monitor, including necessary display software.<BR>
 As mentioned in the &quot;Magnetic Anomaly Map of East Asia&quot;, gridded data of the Philippine Islands and related information have been deleted from this publication.<P>

<B>Projection, sheet areas and areas for gridded data and image data</B><BR>
 X, Y values of geographic co-ordinates are calculated using Lambert azimuthal equal-area projection with the central point at 15 Deg. N, 120 Deg. E. A spherical earth with the radius of 6377 km is assumed.<BR>
 The printed map consists of two sheets. &quot;U&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are used to denote sheet 1 (upper half) and sheet 2 (lower half), respectively, throughout this publication.<BR>
 Sheet 1 has an area of 4000km x 2870km. Co-ordinates (X, Y)(in km) of its southwestern and northeastern corners are (-1850, 686) and (2150, 3556), respectively.<BR>
 Sheet 2 has an area of 3500km x 3280km. Co-ordinates (X, Y)(in km) of its southwestern and northeastern corners are (-2740, -2594) and (760, 686), respectively.<BR>
 Smaller data sets were prepared for data retrieval application by dividing sheet 1 and sheet 2 into 16 x 14 and 14 x 16 subareas, respectively (<A HREF="dgm2-p1-table.html#table1">Tables 1 and 2</A>). The resultant area size is 250km x 205km for the both sheets. Gridded data files of this size as well as those of the whole areas of both sheets are included in this CD-ROM.<BR>
 As described later, image data files of three different sizes are included for use in sortware MAGVIEW: 250km x 205km, 500km x 410km and 1000km x 820km. Image data files in GIF and Macintosh PICT format of 1000km x 820km areas and for the whole areas of both sheets are also lncluded. Names of 500km x 410km areas and those of 1000km x 820km areas are listed in <A HREF="dgm2-p1-table.html#table3">Tables 3 to 6</A>.<P>

<B>Directories and files</B><BR>
 The directories and files in this CD-ROM are shown in <A HREF="dgm2-p1-fig.html">Figure 1</A>.<P>

<B>GRID</B><BR>
 All the gridded data files are included in directory GRID. There are two types of gridded data files: XY and LL files.<BR>
 An XY file is for (X, Y) co-ordinates. The file has three lines of header records followed by many lines of data records. The first header record shows the origin of the map projection (15 Deg. N, 120 Deg. E) and the total number of data records in the file. The second header record indicates the minimum X and Y values of grid points (in unit of 2 km) and the minimum magnetic anomaly value in unit of 0.1nT, and the third one indicates the maximum X, Y and magnetic anomaly values. One record is written in ASCII code with (2I6, I8) format. The three integers are X and Y co-ordinates of a grid point in unit of 2km and the magnetic anomaly value at that point in unit of 0.1nT.<BR>
 An LL files is for geographical co-ordinates of the same grid points. The file also has three header records followed by many line of data records. Each line is written in ASCII code with (I6, 2I8) format. Location of a grid point is expressed in latitude and longitude in unit of 1/10000 degree inversely projected from X and Y co-ordinates. A negative latitude indicates that the point is in the southern hemisphere.<BR>
 Files UEA.XY and UEA.LL are XY and LL gridded data files for the whole area of sheet 1 (upper half), while files DEA.XY and DEA.LL are those for the whole area of sheet 2 (lower half). Each file has a volume of about 36 to 44MB.<BR>
 Gridded data files for smaller areas of 250km x 205km are included in the following four subdirectories:<BR>
 UXY (XY files for sheet 1), ULL (LL files for sheet 1),<BR>
 DXY (XY files for sheet 2), DLL (LL files for sheet 2).<BR>
 They are named as shown in <A HREF="dgm2-p1-table.html#table1">Table 1</A> and <A HREF="dgm2-p1-table.html#table2">Table 2</A>.<P>

<B>TRACK</B><BR>
 All the track line data files are included in directory TRACK. Two types of files also exist for the track line data: XY and LL files. There are no header records in these files.<BR>
 Data in the XY track line data files are written in ASCII code with 2I6 format. The two values of each record are X and Y co-ordinates along a track line in unit of 0.4km. A record (&quot;99999 99999&quot;) is added at the end of each track line.<BR>
 Data in the LL track line data files are written in ASCII code with (I5, I7) format. The two values of each record are latitude and longitude along a track line in unit of 1/1000 degree. A record (&quot;99999 -99999&quot;) is added to delimit at the end of each track line.<BR>
 Four subdirectories also exist in directory TRACK:<BR>
 UXY (XY files for sheet 1), ULL (LL files for sheet 1),<BR>
 DXY (XY files for sheet 2), DLL (LL files for sheet 2).<BR>
 The file names are the same as those used for area codes cum data sources in &quot;Magnetic Anomaly Map of East Asia&quot; except that &quot;C0&quot; is used as the total of &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;C2&quot; in sheet 1 and as the total of &quot;C1&quot; and &quot;C3&quot; in sheet 2.<P>

<B>GIF and PICT</B><BR>
 Image data files in GIF and Macintosh PICT formats are included in directories GIF and PICT, respectively. They are image data files of 1000km x 820km area, image data files of total areas of both sheets and <A HREF="dgm2-p1-indx.html">indexed image data files</A>. One sheet is divided into 4 x 4 areas, and named &quot;UA&quot; to &quot;UP&quot; for sheet 1 (upper half, <A HREF="dgm2-p1-table.html#table5">Table 5</A>) and &quot;DA&quot; to &quot;DP&quot; sheet 2 (lower half, <A HREF="dgm2-p1-table.html#table6">Table 6</A>). You can see these images on a IBM PC or its compatible using GIF files and also on a Macintosh computer using GIF and PICT files, if you have a suitable software and a 256 color monitor.<P>

<B>DOSUTIL</B><BR>
 There are two MS-DOS software GIFDESK.EXE and MAGVIEW.EXE in directory DOSUTIL. They do not run under Windows environment. The software MAGVIEW assumes a minimum hardware configuration of an IBM PC/AT compatible computer with an EGA color monitor and a CD-ROM drive. A 256-color monitor is necessary to run GIFDESK. It is recommended to use them after copying to your computer hard disk.<P>

<B>[ GIFDESK ]</B><BR>
Freeware GIFDESK can be used to display GIF image files. To see all the files in directory GIF by GIFDESK, type <B>GIFDESK E:\GIF\*.GIF</B> (E: is assumed for the CD-ROM drive). Key functions in the software can be seen, if you type <B>GIFDESK</B> only.<P>
<B>[ MAGVIEW ]</B><BR>
 To run the software, type <B>MAGVIEW</B> and follow the questions in the software. Five different types of images for areas of three different sizes (500km x 410km, 1000km x 820km and 2000km x 1640km) can be viewed by MAGVIEW. MAGVIEW also has a capability to create a new gridded data file by combining gridded files for small areas of 250km x 205km in the directory GRID\UXY, GRID\ULL, GRID\DXY or GRID\DLL. More detailed description of the software is written below.<P>

<B>MV*</B><BR>
 All of the rest directories, with the names beginning with MV, include files (most of them are image data files) used in software MAGVIEW. In the software, each image is displayed using 2 x 2 image files of half size in both of X and Y directions. Directories MVU1 and MVD1 are for image files of the smallest size (250km x 205km) in sheet 1 and 2, respectively, MVU2 and MVD2 are for those of middle size (500km x 410km) and MVU4 and MVD4 are for those of the largest size (1000km x 820km). Five different types of image files are contained in each of subdirectories IM1, IM2, MT1, MT2 and ITR in these directories. Directory MVMENU includes image files for the sheet maps 1 and 2 with coastlines.<P>

<B>How to use MAGVIEW</B><BR>
 Software MAGVIEW first asks CD-ROM drive name and which sheet you want to display: sheet 1 or sheet 2.<BR>
 If you finish answering these questions, you can see list of organizations having contributed to the compilation of the selected sheet and their abbreviations. Press any key and wait for a while, and a map of the selected sheet with coastlines and area names is displayed and the selected area names and the rectangular boundary of the selected area are shown in red. At the first show of the sheet map, an area of the largest size (2000km x 1640km) in the centre of the sheet (UF+UG+UJ+UK or DF+DC+DJ+DK) is selected.<BR>
 Keys which you can select are shown in yellow on the right side of the monitor display. You can move the selected area by half upward, downward, rightward or leftward by pressing the corresponding arrow keys. You can choose an area of the half size in the NW, NE, SW, SE or in the central part of the present area by pressing &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot; or &quot;H&quot; key, respectively. On the contrary, you can choose an area of the double size by pressing &quot;G&quot; key.<BR>
 Seven selections corresponding to numeric keys are shown in the right above:<BR>
<PRE>
 1: 25 nT interval
 2: 50 nT interval
 3: 25 nT + trk
 4: 50 nT + trk
 5: Tracks only
 6: Data Source
 8: Other sheet
</PRE>
 Press key &quot;8&quot; when you want to change the sheets, and press Enter key when you want to stop the software.<BR>
 Selections 1 to 5 are to read five types of image files and to display them.<BR>
 If you press key &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot;, &quot;3&quot; or&quot;4&quot;, the corresponding image of selected area is displayed in the left side of the monitor display, and the latitudes and longitudes of the four corners are shown. High and low magnetic anomaries are shown in the image in warmer and colder colors, respectively. Latitudinal and longitudinal lines are shown at 2 Deg. interval, and coastlines are also included in the image. Also shown in the right below are color scale and X values of the western and eastern ends and Y values of the southern and northern ends of the image.<BR>
 In selection 1, 12 colors are assigned to magnetic anomalies from -150nT to +150nT at 25nT interval and two colors are for magnetic anomalies below -150nT and above +150nT, while the same colors are used for those from -300nT to +300nT at 50nT interval and those below -300nT and above +300nT in selection 2. Selections 3 and 4 correspond images 1 and 2 with addition of track lines in black, respectively.<BR>
 If you press key &quot;5&quot;, track lines of the selected area are shown in different colors for different data sources. Color assignment of data sources is shown instead of color scale in this case.<BR>
 If you press key &quot;6&quot;, all the data sources are listed with survey altitudes, years and abbreviations of contributing organizations. If you type an abbreviation of an organization, you can see its full name at the bottom of the monitor display. Press Enter key to return to the sheet map menu.<BR>
 After image display by pressing one of keys &quot;1&quot to &quot;5&quot;, the following nine selections are shown in the right above of the monitor display:<BR>
<PRE>
 1: 25nT  3: + trks
 2: 50nT  4: + trks
 5: Trks  6: Source
 7: Sheet 8: Other
 9: Copy grid data
</PRE>
 Selections 1 to 6 are the same as those for the sheet map display. Different images or a list of data sources for the same area can be shown by pressing these keys. Arrow keys, keys &quot;T&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;N&quot;, &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot; can be used just as is used in the sheet map menu. The same type of image for the newly selected area is shown in this case.<BR>
 The same sheet map or the other sheet map can be displayed by pressing key &quot;7&quot; or &quot;8&quot;. You can stop the software any time by pressing Enter key.<BR>
 If you press key &quot;9&quot;, you can make a gridded data file of a rectangular area in your hard disk or any other appropriate device. First, move the southwestern end of the rectangle by pressing arrow keys, and press Enter key at the desired point. Similarly, determine the northeastern end of the rectangle. If the rectangle is defined by this process, the following data are displayed on the monitor: (X, Y) coordinates, latitudes and longitudes of the southwestern and northeastern ends (these become those for actual ends of the data area when there are data vacancies), total number of the gridded data and sizes of the XY and LL files. Your choice here is to create an XY file (key &quot;1&quot;), an LL file (key &quot;2&quot;) to redo determination of the rectangle (key &quot;3&quot;) or to return to the previous menu (key &quot;4&quot;). If you press key &quot;1&quot; or &quot;2&quot;, the file creation begins by typing the output file name.<P>

<H3>Introduction</H3><P>

 The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) World Data Centre for Greenhouse Gases (WDCGG) was established in the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) in October 1990 in the framework of the Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) programme of WMO.  The Centre is responsible for the collection, analysis, and distribution of data on the concentrations of greenhouse gases and others pertinent to global climate change except ozone handled in a separate World Ozone and Ultraviolet Data Centre (WOUDC) in Toronto, Canada.<P>

 The WDCGG receives hourly, daily, monthly, and event observation data from National Meteorological Services, universities, and environmental research institutes in all parts of the world, in the formats set out in the Data Reporting Manual published by the WDCGG in January 1991.  The received data are firstly quality-checked and then stored in the WDCGG database for analysis.  The data herein have been provided to the observation stations which contributed the data, the WMO Members and interested researchers, free of charge, in the form of printed and computer available media.  This WMO WDCGG CD-ROM is a result of the efforts of the WDCGG to provide easier access to the data for the users.<P>

 The WMO WDCGG CD-ROM contains hourly, daily, monthly, and event observation data for the period from May 1967 through March 1994 which were reported to the WDCGG by September 1994.<P>

<H3>Contents of the CD-ROM</H3><P>

 There are three main directories on this disk: DATA, DOCUMENT and SOFTWARE.<P>

<B>DATA</B><P>

 This main directory holds an observation information file, STATION.DAT, and 13 directories, each of which contains data for one of the gases.  The names of the gases and directories are listed in the Table below.  Each of the directories holds four subdirectories for hourly data (HOURLY), daily data (DAILY), monthly data (MONTHLY) and event data (EVENT).  HOURLY holds further subordinate directories for each year (ex. Y1994).  Data files are named after the WDCGG database station codes, which are found in STATION.DAT  (see the chart below).<P>

In 1974 the Canadian Hydrographic Service (CHS) and the Marine Environmental Data Service of the Canadian Department of Fisheries and Oceans (MEDS) undertook to establish and operate a computer bank of tidal constituents for the world's oceans on behalf of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO). This IHO Tidal Constituent Bank came into full operation in January 1978, and replace the function of the now defunct Special Publication 26 (SP26). The World Tidal Constituent file at JODC is the second released in 1983.<P>

<H1>Types of Data to be Routinely Exchanged within the IODE system</H1>
(source : IODE Handbook, UNESCO/IOC, 1991)

<HR>

In general. these data should have been processed for all instrumental corrections and calibrations, and should have received a generally acceptable level of quality control. National standards of quality control exist for some data types and the C-IODE is working on an international set of standards. The data should then be exchanged through the World Data Centre system or to other permanent centres according to the principles specified in the "Manual on International Oceanographic Data Exchange, Manual and Guides 9, UNESCO".<P>

The following list covers many of the major kinds of standard oceanographic and marine meteorological data recorded in connection with oceanographic observations:<P>
<OL>
<LI>Values of air temperature, ocean surface temperature, atmospheric pressure, humidity, speed and direction of wind, precipitation, visual observations of cloud cover and weather, visibility, other atmospheric phenomena and sea ice.
<P>

<LI>Visual and instrumented in-situ observations of waves, sea and swell, including calculated parameters and spectra.
<P>

<LI>Colour and transparency using standard Secchi discs, and standard colour scales. The methods used in obtaining these data should be described in detail.
<P>

<LI>Values of temperature, salinity (or conductivity) and chemical properties from water bottle samples at surface and at depth, and data from continuous records of physical properties from instruments such as bathy-thermographs (BT and XBT) and salinity-conductivity-temperature depth (STD & CTD) records, also values of other physical-chemical observations from research vessels, shore and fixed stations, drifting or moored buoys.
<P>

<LI>Surface and sub-surface current velocities from moored instruments, and surface and sub-surface Lagrangian drifters.
<P>

<LI>Sea-levels from recording gauges or tide-staffs. Reduced data from offshore oceanic tide gauges.
<P>

<LI>Values of primary production, plant pigments, zooplankton biomass and micro nekton biomass. The methods used in obtaining these biological data exchanged should be described in detail. (Phytoplankton and benthos biomass are temporarily omitted from the list of standard data pending the development of better standardized methods.)
<P>

<LI>Description of geological bottom samples: Data from cores, grab and dredge samples of sediment and bedrock; geological period and rock type. For cores, length and short qualitative description. Where possible, estimates of the probable age of top and bottom parts are especially desirable. For other samples; short qualitative description and method of collection.
<P>

<LI>Undenway records of gravity, magnetics, and bathymetry, provided in recognized formats.
<P>

<LI>Oil pollution observations reported in the MARPOLMON standard as presented in IOC Manual No. 13 for Monitoring Oil and Dissolved/Dispersed Petroleum Hydrocarbons in Marine Waters and on Beaches.

Hello Data Recipient,<P>

   Thanks to the abundant contributions from agencies such as yours, the sea level archive at the University of Hawaii continues to grow.  As a follow-up to your generosity, we would like to share our new data holdings with you.<P>

   This diskette contains daily and monthly sea level for new and updated sites as of August 1995 relative to August 1994 in the University of Hawaii Sea Level Center data archive.<P>

  Lists of sites and time spans are seen in files:<P>

LIST.NEW<BR>
LIST.UPD<P>

  Format descriptions are given in files:<P>

DAY.DOC<BR>
MONTH.DOC<P>

   The data are stored in a self-extracting ZIP file:<P>

HOLD_ALL.EXE<P>

To download the data, copy the file above from the diskette to your hard disk.  Place in a subdirectory, such as \SL95 (you can make your own name for this).  The uncompression routine will automatically create two subdirectories:<P>

\NEW<BR>
\UPDATED<P>

Thus, be sure that you execute the self-extracting file in a subdirectory that does not already have the subdirectories as listed above.<P>

The new series expands to roughly 1.1 Megabytes and the updated series to 1.5 Megabytes (including station documentation files)<P>

Finally, to uncompress, enter:<P>

HOLD_ALL.EXE -d<P>

Note, the updated daily data series contain only the time spans that have been added since August 1994.  The updated monthly series, and the new daily and monthly series contain the entire span for the given site.  The updated daily data series was reduced due to space limitations.  The hourly data and the entire daily series of all sites in the archive are available to you upon request.<P>

Good luck.  Thanks again for your contributions to the growing archive of sea level.<P>

Best Regards, Patrick<P>

PREFACE<P>

  Following the temperature profile data set CD-ROM published by the JODC in March 1995, the JODC produced the second CD-ROM for " Surface Ocean Current Data Set". This CD-ROM contains ocean current data(3,489,497stations) observed by GEK(Geomagnetic Electro Kine to graph), ADCP(Acoustic Doppler Current Profiler) and Ship Drift(provided by US NODC) from 1900 to 1993. Also the CD-ROM contains data distribution plots in the world and monthly mean velocity plots in 1 degree box in the northeast Pacific.<P>

  The data are recorded in ASCII format and sorted by cruise, each data includes geographical code, so they are easy to be sorted geographically.<BR>
Data distribution plots to easily find out where the data available are recorded in Bit-Map format which is available in Windows, and in GIF format which is available in free software. Monthly mean velocity plots likewise are recorded in Bit-Map and GIF format as one of the products from the data set on this CD-ROM.<P>

  The JODC expresses its thanks to all those who provided us with their ocean current data, and furthermore would like to invite your comments to develop an improved product.<P>

DATA QUALITY CONTROL<P>

<DT>All data were checked by the following procedures and eliminated
<DD>-Checks date/time
<DD>-Checks latitude and longitude
<DD>-Limitation check velocity


JODC Ref. No.<P>

  Data (GEK and ADCP) identified by Japanese country code "49" (column 1-2) are uniquely identified by JODC Reference number (column 71-80) which is composed of YYIISScccc.<BR>
<DT>The meaning of the characters is
<DD>YY:last two digits of observation year
<DD>II:institute code
<DD>SS:cruise consecutive No. at an institute in a year
<DD>cccc:consecutive station number in a cruise

  The country code is referred in "COUNTRY" file under CODE_TBL sub-directory.<BR>
 The institute code is referred in "INSTITUT" file under CODE_TBL sub-directory.<P>

  As for ship drift data, the column 71-80 is replaced with YYcccccccc, where YY is last two digits of observation year and cccccccc is consecutive number of data in a year.<P>


MONTHLY MEAN VELOCITY PLOT<P>

  This is a product of summary of statistical analyses ( by month in 1 degree) for 94 years from 1900 to 1993 in the adjacent seas of Japan. It is presented by the image plot with map and is stored in 24 files for 12 monthes in the form of GIF and Bit-Map formats under STAT_PLT sub-directory.<BR>
  The image plot could be drown on the screen by "GV" software that users might have, or by "Paint Brush" in Windows,or the attendant software.<P>


DATA STATION PLOTS<P>

  Data station plots were prepared to help users find out the location of the observation stations easily in the world. There are two types of station plots, one is for all data on the CD-ROM, and the other for every 5 years.  A Data station plots are stored in the files in the form of GIF and Bit-Map formats under STN_PLT sub-directory. The file name is xxxxyyyy.GIF (BMP), xxxx is starting year and yyyy is ending year.<BR>
  The plots could be drown on the screen by "GV" software that users would have, or by "Paint Brush" in the Windows, or the attendant software.<P>


ATTENDANT SOFTWARE<P>

  Software to display the monthly mean velocity plots and data station plots on the screen is included. The program name is "VIEWER.EXE", written by visual basic. The program can run on Windows only.<P>

<H1>Collected Data of High Temporal-Spatial Resolution Marine Biogeochemical Monitoring by Japan-Korea Ferry (June 1991 - February 1993)</H1>

<B>Abstract:</B> A system for marine biogeochemical monitoring using sea water pumped up continuously for the engine cooling system was developed based on a critical review of the existing ocean observation platforms. The parameters selected were water temperature, salinity, pH, fluorescence, dissolved nutrients, chlorophyll-a, and pheopigments. The prototype system was deployed on a ferry boat that used to sail regularly between Kobe, Japan and Pusan, Korea. The system and 1991 results are described in a previous report and the 1992-93 results will be available in the next report with the remarks on the points to be improved. This CD-ROM contains the numerical data and image files. <BR>
This ferry line was stopped in February, 1993 and we shifted the monitoring program to two other ferry lines. The feasibility of ferry monitoring has been demonstrated in that ferrys can obtain the temporally and spatially detailed records directly measured, which neither satellite nor the other platforms can access. Furthermore, any sensing technology is applicable to the ferry platform along with the regular monitoring missions.<P>

Welcome to the ETI World Biodiversity Database CD-ROM series. This program was made with ETI's Linnaeus II(TM) software, a multimedia package developed by ETI specifically for for biodiversity documentation and species identification. This CD-ROM volume is dedicated to "North Australian Sea Cucumbers" and is based upon work by Dr L. Cannon of the Queensland Museum, Australia and Dr K. Estap of ETI. It comprises a complete guide to the 90 most important cucumber species in Australia. Please keep in mind that "North Australian Sea Cucumbers" is, like all science,a "work in progress". We activity solicit comments, corrections and suggestions from our users for incorporation in version 2.0 of this software.<BR>

<H1>WORLD OCEAN ATLAS CD-ROM SERIES 1994</H1>

<HR>
The Ocean Climate Laboratory (OCL) at NODC is supported by the NOAA Climate and Global Change program to produce scientifically quality controlled databases of the world ocean.  Work to date includes quality control of historical in situ temperature, salinity, oxygen, phosphate, nitrate, and silicate data and the preparation of one-degree latitude-longitude mean fields for each of these parameters.  Specifically, this project has produced four ocean atlases describing the global distributions of these parameters and two technical reports (TR-79 and TR-81) in the NOAA Technical Reports section in NODC Publications, describing the quality control and processing procedures.<P> 
Observed and standard level profile data (along with quality control flags) used in the production of these atlases are being made available in a World Ocean Atlas 1994 CD-ROM series (referred to herein as WOA94).  In addition, the series contains the objectively analyzed one-degree latitude-longitude mean fields for each of the measured parameters, and two derived parameters (Apparent Oxygen Utilization and oxygen saturation), and five-degree square statistics of standard level values.<P>
Profile data on the WOA94 series are recorded in ASCII format and sorted geographically, so they are easy to access and manipulate.  The CD-ROMS are formatted in the ISO 9660 standard.  (9 discs)<P>

<H1>NOAA Marine Environmental Buoy Database (CD-ROM)</H1>

<HR>

<H2>METEOROLOGICAL, WAVE SPECTRA, AND OCEANOGRAPHIC MEASUREMENTS FROM NATIONAL DATA BUOY CENTER STATIONS</H2>

<B>INTRODUCTION</B><P>

The National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) has produced from its Marine Environmental Buoy Database (File Type F291) a set of CD-ROMs containing marine meteorological, oceanographic, and wave spectra data.  The data files on these CD-ROMs contain meteorological and oceanographic data collected by moored buoys and C-MAN (Coastal-Marine Automated Network) stations operated by the NOAA National Data Buoy Center (NDBC).  C-MAN stations are located on piers, offshore towers, lighthouses, and beaches with excellent exposure to the marine environment.<BR>
The observations are transmitted, typically once each hour, through GOES (Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite) to the National Weather Service Telecommunications Gateway, where the data are placed in meteorological codes for real-time transmission.  However, these CD-ROM data are more complete and have undergone more quality control than those transmitted in real-time.  NDBC submits these data each month to NODC for permanent storage after post-processing and quality control of the GOES messages.<P>

The first NDBC stations began reporting in the early 1970s.  The earliest buoy data archived at NODC is from October 1972.  While the first C-MAN stations became operational in March 1983, the NODC archive of C-MAN data begins in 1985.<P>

<B>CD-ROM CONTENTS</B><P>

This CD-ROM contains NDBC moored buoy and C-MAN station data through July 1992, from the western and central Pacific, including the Hawaiian Islands region.  Additional CD-ROMs in this series cover other Pacific Ocean areas, as well as the Gulf of Mexico, Great Lakes, and the Atlantic Ocean.<P>

The data files for each moored buoy or C-MAN station are arranged in a main directory by ocean region and then in sub-directories by their station identifier (i.e., all data for a particular buoy is contained in one sub-directory).  The data files are arranged chronologically under their respective sub-directory, and each file contains one month of data for that particular station.  The naming convention used for the data files is as follows:<P>

<PRE>
                     #####_YY.MM 

where: ##### is the 5-character station identifier 
       YY    is the year, and  
       MM    is the month 
</PRE>

The buoy data format contains ten 120-character fixed length records.  They are as follows:  (A) Descriptive Header Record, (B) Environmental Data Record, (C) Non-Directional Wave Spectra Data Record, (D) Subsurface Temperature/Salinity Data Record, (E) Subsurface Current Record, (F) Subsurface Data Profile Record, (G) Wave Spectra Data Record 2, (H) Wave Fourier Data Record, (I) Directional Wave Parameter Record, and (J) Continuous Wind Measurement Record.  All record types may not be present in each data file, and no data has ever been archived in Record H. Times in all records are in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC).<P>

The data file format and NODC code tables used with this format are listed as ASCII text on this CD-ROM in the file named BUOYFORM.TXT.<P>

Station identifier, position, date, time, sampling duration, and sampling rate are reported for each series of measurements.  Principal parameters reported by both moored buoys and C-MAN stations include air temperature and pressure, wind speed and direction, wind gust, and sea surface temperature.  The buoys (and a few C-MAN stations located on offshore platforms) also report wave data which usually include wave height, wave period, and wave spectra.  Some moored buoys have reported directional wave data since the late 1980's.<P>

Details about the methodology used for calculations of directional wave spectra are included on this CD-ROM in an ASCII file named DIRSPECT.TXT.  This file contains the NDBC Real-Time Directional Wave Information User's Guide, and is intended to show researchers how information from wave spectra can be used.<P>

The file named PAYLOAD.TXT contains a description of the hull types and operational payloads of the moored buoys and C-MAN stations.<P>

The file PAC.HST is a history file that contains station identifiers, locations, and the beginning and ending dates of operation for the buoys included on this CD-ROM.  Data in the NODC archive, however, may begin at a later date than the beginning date of operation of the buoy.  The format of PAC.HST is as follows:<P>

<PRE>
Positions 1-5  : Station ID 
Positions 11-15: Latitude (DDMMH) 
Positions 18-23: Longitude (DDDMMH) 
Positions 25-32: Beginning Date (YYYYMMDD) 
Positions 37-44: Ending Date (YYYYMMDD) 
                 (NOTE: X's in the Ending Date denote that the 
                        station was still operating at that 
                        location at the time of publication). 
Positions 48-80: Comment Field 
</PRE>

NODC has also provided a program (INVENT.EXE) that will create an inventory for any buoy data file on the CD-ROM.  To execute the program, type INVENT at the DOS prompt and enter the fully qualified name of the station data file.  The program then asks you to create an output filename, which must be 8 characters or less.  The inventory will list the percentage or number of occurrences of each parameter measured by the station during that month, and it will also list the day of the first and last observations.  An explanation of the format precedes the output in the created inventory file.<P>

A data availability summary from NDBC is also included on the CD-ROM in a file named DAS.TXT.  This summary is updated annually by NDBC and is intended to be a quick reference to determine the types of data available, and when the data acquisition systems were operating.<P>

In summary, the files included on this CD-ROM are as follows:<P>

<PRE>
- READ.ME      (Information and general explanation). 
- BUOYFORM.TXT (Data file format and NODC code tables). 
- PAC.HST      (History file of buoy IDs, locations, and dates). 
- INVENT.EXE   (Inventory program). 
- DIRSPECT.TXT (Directional Wave Spectra User's Guide). 
- PAYLOAD.TXT  (Description of payloads and hull types). 
- DAS.TXT      (NDBC Data Availability Summary).

<H1>Sea Level CD-ROM</H1>

(Contents of &quot;readme.1st&quot; file in CD-ROM)
<HR>

<B>OVERVIEW</B><P>

This CD-ROM, created by the NOAA National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC), is divided into two main directories.  One directory of the disc contains Tropical Ocean Global Atmosphere (TOGA) sea level data, the file formats, and associated documentation. The other main directory contains the Permanent Service for Mean Sea Level (PSMSL) data, documentation, and a few related data sets.<P>

The TOGA sea level data is managed by the TOGA Sea Level Center at the University of Hawaii in cooperation with the NODC through the Joint Archive for Sea Level.  It is a well documented archive of hourly, daily, and monthly sea level values in standardized formats from 289 sea level stations in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans.  These data are collected in support of the TOGA project and are primarily in the tropical ocean areas of TOGA interest (30 deg. N - 30 deg. S latitude).  This CD-ROM contains the TOGA sea level holdings as of July 1994.<P>

The PSMSL is based at the Proudman Oceanographic Laboratory, Bidston Observatory, United Kingdom and contains monthly and annual mean values of sea level from approximately 1500 tide gauge stations around the world.  Other related data sets are also included.  This CD-ROM contains the PSMSL data holdings as of August 1994.<P>

Each main directory on this CD-ROM has its own README file that should be read before using the data.  It should be noted that the PSMSL directory is a copy of the PSMSL FTP server as of August 1994 (with the exception of some file name changes, to comply with DOS naming conventions).  Therefore, when reading some of the PSMSL documentation it may refer to their FTP server.<P>

It should also be noted that this CD-ROM was made using an IBM compatible PC and therefore, the files are in DOS format.  Any platform should be able to read the ASCII files.  The Fortran source codes, however, may have to be converted from DOS to UNIX before compiling them on a UNIX workstation.  These program source codes can also be used as just a reference as to how the data can be read.<P>

INTRODUCTION<P>

     Since its establishment of Japan Oceanographic Data Center (JODC) has been fulfilling the role of the synthetic marine data bank of Japan in acquisition of marine data obtained by various marine research institutes.<P>

     With the support of domestic agencies as well as international data exchange system, JODC has steadily increased amount of data as National Oceanographic Data Center (NODC) in Japan. In 1995 it is the 30th anniversary of JODC, and further computer recording media such as CD-ROM and Magnetic Optical Disk are developed in common use, therefore JODC plus to produce CD-ROM contained JODC archived data in a series which should be temperature profiles CD-ROM, serial station data CD-ROM, ocean current data CD-ROM, Western Pacific Program (WESTPAC) CD-ROM and so on.<BR>
     This CD-ROM contains temperature profiles observed from 1940 to 1993 which have been archived at JODC in separate files due to the variation of quality and submission. Also the CD-ROM contains data inventory files, data distribution plots, mean temperature plots at 0 meter level and 100 meter level and software to browse and extract data on the CD-ROM.<P>

     Profile data are recorded in ASCII format and sorted by cruise, each profile data include geographical code, so they are easy to sort geographically. The data inventory files, recorded in ASCII format are provided to help users identify profile data in the files. Data distribution plots are recorded in Bit-Map format which is available in Windows in PC, and in GIF format which is available in free software so they are shown by "Paint Brush" in Windows or by free software to easily find out where data available. Mean temperature plots likewise are recorded in Bit-Map format and GIF format as one of the products from temperature profile data on this CD-ROM.<P>

     The JODC expresses its thanks to all those who provided us with their profile data, and furthermore would like to invite your comments to develop an improved product.<P>

DATA QUALITY CONTROL<P>

     All profile data were checked by the following procedures and flagged or eliminated.<BR>
<PRE>
        -Duplicate profiles check ; eliminated
        -Checks - date/time ; eliminated
        -Checks - latitude and longitude ; eliminated
        -Large temperature inversion ; flagged
        -Spike check ; flagged
        -Standard deviation check ; flagged
</PRE>

JODC Ref. No.<P>

     Data identified by Japanese country code "49" on CD-ROM are uniquely identified by JODC Reference number (column 1-8 in the format) which is composed of CCYYIISS.<BR>
     The meaning of the characters is <BR>
<UL>
     <LI>CC:country code
     <LI>YY:last two digits of observation year
     <LI>II:institute code
     <LI>SS:cruise consecutive No. at the institute in a year
</UL>
     The country code is referred in "COUNTRY" file under CODE_TBL sub- directory.<BR> 
     The institute code is referred in "INSTITUT" file under CODE_TBL sub- directory.<BR>
     The instrument code is shown in the paragraph DATA SOURCE.<P>

     For the data except Japan, of which the country code is not "49", JODC's reference number were replaced with the originator' number.<P>


MONTHLY MEAN TEMPERATURE PLOT<P>

     This is a product of summary of statistical analyses ( by month in 1 degree) at 0 meter level and 100 meter level of data for 30 years from 1964 to 1993 on the CD-ROM in the North West Pacific area. It is presented by the image plot with map and is stored in 24 files in the form of GIF and Bit-Map formats under STAT_PLT sub-directory.<BR> 
     The image plot could be drown on the screen by general "GV" software that users might have, or "Paint Brush" in the Windows.<P>


DATA STATION PLOTS<P>

     Data station plots were prepared to help users find out easily the location of the observation stations in the world. There are two types of station plots, one is for all data on the CD-ROM and the other for each year.  A data station plot is stored in a file in the form of GIF and Bit-Map formats under STN_PLT sub-directory.<BR>
     The plot figures could be drown on the screen by general "GV" software that users would have, or "Paint Brush" in the Windows.<P>


CRUISE INVENTORY<P>

     For all the profile data files with extension ".DAT", there are accompanying cruise inventory files with ".INV". The cruise inventory files contain JODC Ref. Number, ship code, observation starting and ending date, observation area, number of stations and instrument code. These files are used in identifying the contents of profile data files to extract specific cruise data. The inventories are stored in order of JODC Ref Number on the CD-ROM in ASCII format, so they are easy to be manipulated by a TEXT EDITOR.<P>

ATTENDANT SOFTWARE<P>

     Software to extract the temperature profile data from CD-ROM and to create the extracted data file or to display the data on the screen are included. The program name "EXTRACT.SRC" and "EXTRACT.EXT" are source and executive program for PC and UNIX Workstation. The program name "EXTRACT.MAC" is for Macintosh.<P>

Appendix 3.  Record format of one data line of Level-2 Data <P>

One file (per cruise, averagely 22 hours) consists of averagely 8000 data lines (800kbyte).  Each line is shown by the following sample: <P>
<PRE>
        92/ 6/ 5!12:30:14!        8.3982!  8.3429! 31.9881! 19.3804! 38.66
        19!157.5209954!135.1687366! 34.6273110! 14.571#
</PRE>
Symbols ! and # denote [Tab] and [CR], respectively.  The variables denote the date, time,  pH1 (0.1), pH2 (0.1), S (0.1per mill), T (0.1C), Fluorescence (0.1 equivalent fluoresceine solution in g/l), Day of year (0.000012day), Longitude, Latitude, Cumulative distance from the departure port, respectively. <BR>
Their accuracies are shown in the parenthesis, although all the single- or double-precisioned numerals are recorded as the result of Level-1 to Level-2 conversion.  The nominal accuracies of the latitude and longitude are 0.1minute (0.0017deg) and hence 0.18km of cumulative distance.  However, it takes 20 to 40 seconds for the sea water to pass the pipe from the ship's bottom to the measurement system.  This time lag causes the shift ahead from the actual location of the sea water, which is estimated as 200 to 400m.  The values of precision are thought to be better than those of accuracy, although they are not clearly defined between the dispersion in the tangential direction during the trip in the pipe.<P>

<p>Development of Earth sciences, including those concerning the problem
of global changes, requires further comprehension of observation and data
processing instruments. Due to the global character of the data required
spaceborne equipment of Earth research is of special significance.</p>

<p>Nowadays in a number of countries in addition to special spaceborne
equipment of Earth observation (meteorological systems NOAA and METEOR,
terrestrial surface investigation systems Landsat, Spot, etc.) scientific
programs are being designed and created aimed at Earth processes investigations
(EOS, TOPEX/POSEIDON, TRMM, etc.) or at the development of observation
equipment (ERS-1, JERS-1, POEM-1, RADARSAT). </p>

<p>International Earth remote sensing complex project &quot;PRIRODA&quot;
program is developed on the base of the special module, which is to be
jointed to the &quot;MIR&quot; orbital station. &quot;PRIRODA&quot; module
is supposed to be launched to the orbit near to circular with its height
nearly 360 km over the Earth surface and inclination of 51.7o. The &quot;PRIRODA&quot;
project, having research character, is aimed at the development of observation
and interpretation means of space monitoring data. It is one of the important
Earth remote sensing projects being developed at the moment in various
countries. </p>

<p>The &quot;PRIRODA&quot; module is planned to be launched and jointed
to the &quot;MIR&quot; station in April 1996, and scientific experiments
are to be carried out in 1996-1998. </p>

<p>One of the main features of the &quot;PRIRODA&quot; project is the possibility
to observe one and the same element of the Earth surface using different
equipment of both active and passive sounding in microwave and optical
bands. This allows the multisensor data analysis as well as the correction
(atmospheric, surface, etc.) required be fulfilled and the independent
evaluations of geophysical parameters be obtained, so that the improvement
of space measurements accuracy and the reliability of data interpretation
are expected. </p>

<p>The composition of scientific equipment and the tactical parameters
of separate devices were chosen basing on the geophysical parameters measurement
accuracy demands accounting for the existing technological facilities.
It is worth mentioning that at that time a definite experience of joint
usage of various remote sensing devices was gained. Experiments at American
&quot;Skylab&quot; and &quot;Seasat&quot; satellites showed that conjunction
of active and passive radiophysical devices and of microwave and optical
devices, gives the opportunity to increase the measurements accuracy and
to acquire new important information about the natural objects geophysical
parameters and status. </p>

<p><b>Radiophysical complex</b> consists of: </p>

<ul>
<li>Microwave radiometric system <a HREF="ikar.htm">&quot;Ikar&quot;</a>,</li>

<li>Two-frequency side-looking synthetic aperture radar <a HREF="travers.htm">&quot;Travers&quot;</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>&quot;Ikar&quot; microwave radiometric system includes :</p>

<ul>
<li>nadir looking polarimetric radiometers at 0.3-6.0 cm wavelengths (&quot;Ikar-N&quot;);</li>

<li>two panoramic observation subsystems, consisting of three polarimetric
radiometers RP-225 and five polarimetric radiometers RP-600 (2.25 cm and
6 cm wavelengths accordingly);</li>

<li>scanning polarimetric radiometers &quot;Delta&quot; at 0.3-6.0 cm wavelengths.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Spectrometric systems in visible and infrared range</b> consist of:</p>

<ul>
<li>Infrared spectroradiometric system <a HREF="istok.htm">&quot;Istok-1&quot;</a>.</li>

<li>Scanning spectroradiometric system <a HREF="obzor.htm">&quot;MOS-Obzor&quot;</a>.</li>

<li>Spectrometer of eclipse type <a HREF="ozon.htm">&quot;Ozone-M&quot;</a>.</li>

<li>Scanners of high and middle resolution <a HREF="msu_e.htm">MSU-E</a>
and <a HREF="msu_sk.htm">MSU-SK</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Infrared spectroradiometric system &quot;Istok-1&quot; is 64-channel
spectrometer-polychromator working at 3.6 - 16 mm. The &quot;Istok-1&quot;
system contains a TV-camera, which can operate in autonomic mode.</p>

<p>Scanning spectroradiometric system &quot;MOS-Obzor&quot; has 17 channels
at 0.4-1.03 *.</p>

<p>Spectrometer &quot;Ozone-M&quot; has 4-channel at ultra-violet, visible
and near infrared wavelengths.</p>

<p>The composition of scientific equipment existing on the PRIRODA module
allows to carry out the observation of the Earth surface with the spatial
resolution to 25 m (MSU-E).</p>

<p>At present the decision was decided to include the German device MOMS-2P
in the composition of the PRIRODA module scientific equipment. The inclusion
in the PRIRODA module equipment of the German device MOMS-2P will permit
to carry out the observation of the Earth surface with the spatial resolution
to 5 m. Moreover the experimental data informativity will be extremely
enlarged owing to the stereochannel existing in MOMS-2P. The using of this
unique device in the land surface investigations tasks will give the possibility
to obtain the new important experimental data which will permit to improve
the data interpretation, to increase the quality of the thematic experimental
information processing.</p>

<p>Due to great number of different types of remote sensing equipment used,
covering practically whole EM radiation spectrum (from UF wavelengths to
decimeter of microwave band ), various types of practically all nature
objects investigations are possible. So &quot;PRIRODA&quot; complex in
some cases is capable of solving two problems: comprehension of remote
sensing methods and investigation of nature processes as well.</p>

<p>The investigations which will be carried out in the frame of the PRIRODA
Project scientific program have fundamental, applied and systematic character.</p>

<p>Of fundamental essence are experiments concerning investigations of
cloudiness field, oceanic surface temperature field, large-scale atmosphere
circulation, interaction between atmosphere and ocean, etc. They are in
agreement with existing great International programs for climate studying:
Global Changes (IGBP), TOGA, Global Energy and Water Experiment (GEWEX)
and others.</p>

<p>Experiments having applied character are those connected with ecological
research, including atmospheric, oceanic and land pollution investigations,
with developing methods of monitoring of separate regions in favor of agriculture,
hydrology, engineering geology, etc.</p>

<p>Systematic investigations are directed on the development of remote
sensing technique. As a rule they will be carried out in the frame of the
general investigation programs. However the special programs are existed
which have only systematic essence.</p>

<p>The planned directions of the PRIRODA Project investigations can be
outlined on investigation objects - land surface, ocean, atmosphere. Ecological
investigations which have particular importance are distinguished in the
special part.</p>

<p>The scientific and applied goals of the remote experiments to a great
extent depend on the spatial and temporal scales of the changeability of
investigated fields, objects, processes. In this connection the separate
programs on methods of survey areas and on used measurements equipment
can be connected for carrying out of the measurements. For the most complete
decision of the putted scientific problems it is supposed the coordination
of the carried out within the PRIRODA Project experiments with the Russian
&quot;Ocean&quot;, &quot;Resurs&quot;, &quot;Meteor&quot; programs, American-Japan
TRMM program, GEWEX Continental-Scale International Project (GCIP), etc.</p>

<P><B>1. Experiment objectives</B>
<P>The main goal of the experiments is development of new radiophysical methods

for investigation of near-surface wind fields and characteristics of sea roughness

due to wind on synoptic scales and mezoscales. The physical base of these 
researches is the dependence of radiophysical characteristics (brightness 
temperature, ackscattering coefficient etc.) on water surface roughness, they

being connected with the wind field parameters. These dependencies are yet

studied insufficiently, so they demand special researches.
<P>Another goal is investigation of oceanic processes by radiophysical methods

basing on effects of influence of streams inhomogeneities on oceanic waves.
<P>&nbsp;
<P><B>2. Problems to be solved</B>
<UL>
<LI>Specification of the dependence between wind and radiation accounting wind
dire
ction and near-surface atmospheric layer stratification.

Sea (warm ices) differ from ices structure of Arctic basin, therefore one should

expect that emissive and scattering characteristics of ices belonging to various

ices.

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>The first meeting of the Scientific Council of
the International PRIRODA 
Project was held January 30-31, 1996 at the IRE RAS in Moscow. The List of

the participants and the Agenda of the Meeting are enclosed in the 
<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendixes 1 and 2</A>.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>1. The representatives of the RKK Energia have
informed the par- ticipants 
about the technical state of the PRIRODA module and the updated schedule 
of the preparations for launch. (<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendix 3
</A>).</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>2. The instrument designers presented to the Meeting
participants the 
technical characteristics of their instruments after being installed on the

&quot;Priroda&quot; module. (<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendix 4</A>).To
decrease the time consumption for 
scientific equipment testing after the module launch, the designers have been

asked kindly towork out carefully and supply to RKK Energia and to IRE RAS

by March 1st the specific tests necessary for the express-analysis of the 
functional capability of the instruments and for estimation of the principle

characteristics of the instruments.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>3a. The representatives of RKK Energia have presented
an updated schedule 
for the scientific program experiments within the International PRIRODA 
Program, the MOMS Program and the MIR-NASA Program in 1996. 
According to this information, in 1996 there will two windows for PRIRODA 
Mission operation:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>May - Aug. 1996, an average of one orbit a day
for all three programs- for test
ing of the instruments and conducting calibration experiments. There may 
even be further restrictions during the period of July 7th to August 8th as
o
utlined in
(<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendix 3.</A>)
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Sept.-Dec. 1996, an average of one orbit per
day for all three programs for cond
ucting actual experiments. </FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>The Scientific Council stated that the duration
of the time windows offered 
now by the RKK Energia for the PRIRODA Mission operations is not sufficient

for fulfillment of the Scientific Program and asks RKKEnergia to increase this

time. IRE RAS will present to RKK Energia by the 25th of February, 1996 the

technical requirements for the experiments. RKK Energia and IRE RAS will 
determine by the 1st of March, 1996 the mechanism for on-board and ground 
management operations related to the PRIRODA mission.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>3b.The International Scientific Council is very
concerned about:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>the lack of specific and detailed mission schedule
information with only two mont
hs until launch.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>the tendency of ever shrinking resources for
the payload, especially in light of t
he fact that these resources began at a very low level.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>The Council therefore requires that a small, efficient
group shall be formed, 
comprised of one representative from each of the following 
organizations/programs:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Mir-NASA (R.Murphy, NASA)</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Int. PRIRODA Users (N.Armand, IRE RAS)

<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>RKK (I.Sorokin)</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>ALISSA (M.Chanin)</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>The task of this group is two-fold:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Agree on a reliable mechanism for making optimum
use of the resources allo
cated, in nominal and contingency conditions, in an efficient, quick and flex
ible manner by the end of February 1996</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Agree on a long-term mission timeline and flight
rules for contingency cases by t
he end of March 1996. </FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>4. The Meeting has discussed and approved the
corrections in the 
&quot;International Scientific Remote Sensing Project PRIRODA Science Plan&quot;

presented by the participants of the PRIRODA Project: Russia, Bulgaria, 
Germany, Poland, France and the USA. The correctioned Science Plan is 
available on magnetic media (files on 3.5' diskettes in the ASCII codes or

WinWord formats) for the participants.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>5. The general technical requirements (passports)
of the experiments and a 
few examples of requirements for some specific experiments were discussed.

These requirements are presented on 3.5' diskettes in the ASCII codes or 
WinWord formats for the participants. The requirements for the remaining 
experiments will be communicated by email from IRE RAS to the participants

by the 5th of February. These technical requirements should be reviewed, 
modified, if necessary and agreed upon by the principle investigator of every

experiment. Thefinalapproved reqvirementshoud be submitted to IRE RAS 
and RKK Energia by 15th of April, 1996. Experiments, wich are not confirm by

the above date may be excluded. </FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>6. RKK Energia presented its management approach
for the planning and 
implementation of the International PRIRODA Programme
(<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendix 5</A>)
The 
Main Operational Control Group (GOGU), under the direction of Dr. Beljaev,

will:</FONT>
<UL>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Perform mathematical simulations of the Mir PRIRODA
orbit and spacecraft orie
ntation.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Receive requirements from the International PRIRODA
Programme.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Develop &quot;strawman&quot; implementation scenarios
and coordinate with the Inte
rnational PRIRODA Programme.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Optimize the timeline in cooperation with the
International PRIRODA Prog
ramme.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Implement the mutually agreed upon observation
plan.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Process and pre-process appropriate data and
forward it to the appropriate alem
ents of the International PRORODA Programme.</FONT>
<LI><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>Collect ancilliary space craft data and distribute
it to the users.</FONT>
</UL>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>7. Updated schemes of the Russian capabilities
for data exchange and 
transfer of information for the PRIRODA scientific experiments were 
presented.
<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendices 6 (a,b,c,d)</A>
      contain the updated scheme for the data 
exchanges between the main data processing centers operating in the 
framework of the PRIRODA project in Russia. Users access to the data set 
catalogues of the PRIRODA project in IRE RAS is described in
<A HREF="../priroda/app1.htm">Appendix 6d</A>.
</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>8. A lot of attention was paid to the ground truth
supply of the PRIRODA 
scientific program. The Meeting noted that validation through ground truth
is a 
necessary element of the PRIRODA experiments. That is why ground truth 
measurements must be described in detail in the scientific requirements for
every experiment. The procedure of transferring of all ground truth data from
the PRIRODA Project participants to IRE RAS, the scientific archive 
organization, needs to be worked out depending on the experiment type and 
communicated to IRE RAS along with the specific technical requirements 
(passports) of the experiments.</FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>9. By the 1st of March 1996 the instrument designers
must deliver the 
description of their data processing for each instrument up to the level 1B.
This must include the description of the data formats used as well as all 
required calibration data and data correction algorithms. </FONT>
<P><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=3>10. The Meeting has approved the corrections of
the Scientific Council,the 
National coordinators and the leaders of Working groups

<H5><A NAME="current"></A>Current Incomes of Lawyers and Judges </H5>

<P>The Bureau of the Census publishes an annual report which lists by occupation,
the mean and median net money earnings of year round, full-time workers
(see Bureau of the Census, Current Population Reports, Series p60.) . Reports
which contain information about the earnings of lawyers and judges are
available for the years 1982-1992. The 1993 report has not yet been published.
</P>

<P>The term &quot;money earnings&quot; is defined by the Bureau of the
Census as a worker's wages or salary income plus net self-employment income
(gross receipts <U>minus</U> expenses). In other words, money earnings
equal net cash income.</P>

<P>The &quot;mean&quot; of a set of numbers is the average of the numbers
in the set.</P>

<P>A &quot;median&quot; number is the middle number in a numerically ordered
list of numbers. Thus, the median earnings of workers in a given occupation
are equal to the earnings of a worker whose net income falls at the 50th
percentile of incomes earned by all workers in the occupation.</P>

<P>In 1992, the most recent year for which data is available, the <U>mean</U>
annual net income of males employed full-time as lawyers or judges was
$94,757 while <U>median</U> income was $78,052. The <U>mean</U> annual
income of females employed full-time as lawyers or judges was $62,531.
The <U>median</U> was $57,855. The separate means, or averages, for males
and females can be weighted based on the numbers of persons reporting incomes
and combined to get an average for all lawyers. Calculated in this way
the average net income of American lawyers and judges in 1992 was $88,755.
</P>

<P>The average annual <U>rate of increase</U> of the <U>median</U> income of full-time
male lawyers and judges during the 1980's and early 1990's was about 6.4
% per year. The average annual rate of increase of the median income of
female lawyers was about 7.2%.  It is likely that the rate of increase has declined since 1992.  The legal services industry experienced extraordinary growth during the decade of the 1980's.  If one assumes
that rate of  increase for both men and women has declined by as much as one half since 1992, 
then the median net income of full-time male lawyers and judges during 1995 was over 
$88,500  and the median net
income of full-time female lawyers and judges was over $73,500.</P>

<A NAME="disparity">

<H5>THE DISPARITY IN THE INCOMES OF MALE AND FEMALE LAWYERS </H5></A>

<P>In 1992, the most recent year for which data is available, the <U>mean</U>
annual income of males employed full-time as lawyers or judges was $94,757
while the <U>median</U> income was $78,052. The <U>mean</U> annual income
of females employed full-time as lawyers or judges was $62,531. The <U>median</U>
was $57,855. </P>

<P>A disparity in the incomes of male and female lawyers and judges has
existed since the Bureau of the Census began reporting data in 1982. The
disparity may be the result of age-related demographic differences between
the two groups, difference in choice of jobs, discrimination, or some combination
of these factors. </P>

<P>The average female lawyer is younger than the average male lawyer. This
is because of the relatively recent, and explosive growth of the population
of women in law schools and the profession. In 1971, women comprised 2.8%
of the total lawyer population. In 1991, they comprised 22%. (Women currently
constitute about 44% of total law school enrollment in the U.S.) Thus the
average woman has been in the profession fewer years than the average man.
</P>

<P>Survey data gathered from members of the Texas Bar make it clear that
the number of years previously in the profession can make a substantial
difference in a practitioner's income. In 1991, the median incomes of Texas
attorneys in full-time practice  1 year or less, 2-5 years, 6-10 years,
11-15 years, 16-20 years and more than 20 years respectively were, $38,970,
$60,463, $88,299, $113,839, $123,051, and $149,323. The median for <U>all</U>
Texas practitioners was $84,600. It should also be noted that men and women
enter different legal sub-specialties at different rates and that women
secure public sector jobs at a higher rate then men. Thus, both number
of years in the profession and job choice may account for a substantial
part of the difference in income levels. Discrimination obviously may also
be a factor.</P>

The information contained herein is essentially the equivalent of <I>The Red Book</I>, put out by the Registrar's office each semester.
These pages contain the Fall and Summer, 1996  registration materials for the New England School of Law.    A tentative spring, 1997 course listing is also included to assist you in planning your registration for fall 1996.  Several new courses have been added to the schedule for the spring semester.  Updated and new course descriptions are included in front of the course listing. All classes listed in the 4-5:55 p.m. slot are available to both the day and evening division.  Before scheduling your courses for this upcoming semester, please be sure to review the exam listing for conflicts.
<P>
Every student is put on notice that all provisions of the Student Handbook of Rules and Regulations and the New England School of Law Catalog are incorporated by reference in these registration materials.  Copies of these publications may be obtained from the Registrar's Office.
<P>

Students are reminded to check their student mailboxes frequently during the registration and add/drop periods for notices regarding their registration.  Students should also insure that a current address and telephone number are on file with the Registrar's Office.

<P>
Massachusetts voter registration forms are available at the Office of the Registrar.  Students from other states who desire to register to vote should contact the appropriate state's election official to receive the state form or call the Massachusetts Election Division (Telephone: 617-727-2828 or 1-800-727-2828) to receive the federal form.

<p>A valuable resource-sharing partnership has recently been forged between <A HREF="lawlib.htm">New England School
of Law's library</A> and the library associated with <A HREF="http://www.tufts.edu/htmls/schoolcol.html">Tufts</A> medical, dental  and veterinary schools.  Current students, faculty and staff of each institution have on-site access to each other's collections,
which in the case of Tufts means an extensive medical journal collection and a reference collection
of basic works, including such things as medical dictionaries, general textbooks, and narrowly
subject-specific monographs. The <A HREF="http://library.tufts.edu/~webhsl/hsl_homepage.html">Tufts Health Sciences Library</A> is located in the Arthur M. Sackler Center for Health
Communications at 145 Harrison Street, approximately two blocks from NESL. </P> 

<H4>Before you go to Tufts:</H4>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG>Search the major periodical indexes for cites to Journal articles and Law Reviews</STRONG>:<P>
	<UL>
	<LI>Search <I>Current Law Index</I> and <I>Index to Legal Periodicals</I>.  Use LEXIS/NEXIS (Lawrev library; ILP or LGLIND files), WESTLAW (ILP, LRI, CILP databases), or the NESL CDROM Collection (LegalTrac and Wilsondisc).  <P>
	
	<LI>Search<I> MEDLINE</I>.  Use LEXIS (Medlne library; numerous files), WESTLAW (Medline**), or the Internet, at <A HREF="http://www.healthgate.com">www.healthgate.com</A>(limited).  NESL community  will not have access to MEDLINE at Tufts; do preliminary searching at New England.
	</UL><P>

<LI><STRONG>Search online, full-text sources</STRONG>, in  WESTLAW (e.g. AMA-jnls) and LEXIS (News library; ASAPII)<P>
<LI><STRONG>Search library catalogs to verify holdings</STRONG>.<P>
	<UL>
	<LI><A HREF="TELNET://portial.nesl.edu">Check New England's holdings on Portia</A>.  Login as "library."  Search using keywords, to see if we have bibliographies or monographs which will hep you.  If you attempt a subject search, notice the format of the library of congress subjects.  Some examples:
		<UL>
		<LI>medical laws and legislation -- United States
		<LI>Bioethics -- United States
		<LI>Human experimentation in medicine -- law and legislation-- United States
		<LI>Public Health Administration -- United States
		<LI>Informed consent (Medical law) -- United States
		</UL>
<P>
	
	
<LI><A HREF="http://library.tufts.edu:8020/">Search the Tufts library catalog before you go</A> , bring your NESL identification , and bring money to xerox the materials you need.  A tufts copy card is available for faculty members.  Please call Hilary Clark, ext. 282.   Access is limited to onsite use.  Access to any of Tufts' circulating treatises may, as always, be obtained by filling out an
interlibrary loan request at the NESL circulation desk. </UL>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME= Gen'l>

Admission qualifications and procedures are substantially the same for all
applicants to the full-time day division and the part-time evening division. <BR>The
Special Part-time Program, intended for parents with primary or sole
child rearing responsibilities, requires an additional statement explaining the
applicant's child-care obligations. <P>
The admissions committee, which includes faculty, the director of admissions,
and student representatives, accepts applications between September 15 and June
1 from candidates for admission the following fall. Applications received before
March 15 are generally given priority. Decisions on applications received
between March 15 and June 1 will be made on a space-available basis. Although
the law school does not interview candidates for admission, applicants are
invited to visit the school, tour the facilities, attend classes, and talk with
students and staff. A representative of the admissions office or a current
student is available to take prospective candidates around the school by
appointment.<P>

Admission to New England School of Law is competitive, and the school turns down
many more applicants than it accepts. The acceptance or rejection of an
application for admission is made after careful consideration of several
factors. The committee balances the applicant's undergraduate record and Law
School Admissions Test score with recommendations, proven achievements, and
apparent motivation to study law. Applicants who have not achieved at least a C
(2.0) average in undergraduate work should not apply. Because the committee
examines all facets of an applicant's qualifications, it is impossible to give
tentative appraisals of an applicant's status during the evaluation process.
Policies cover various aspects of the admissions process, as follows: 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="MINORITY">Minority Admissions</A></H3>

The admissions committee attempts to ensure that each
entering class includes students from a wide variety of backgrounds. In recent
years, the representation of racial minority groups within the student body has
increased. It is the policy of New England School of Law to provide equality of
opportunity in legal education for all persons regardless of race, color,
religion, national or ethnic origin, gender, age, handicap or disability, or
sexual orientation. New England School of Law also participates in programs
administered by the Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO), an
organization that offers economically, socially, and educationally disadvantaged
individuals educational and financial support to help them attend law school.

<H3><A NAME="DISABLED">Applicants with Disabilities</H3></a>

 It is the policy and practice of New England
School of Law to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, and all Massachusetts requirements regarding
students and applicants with disabilities. No qualified individual with a
disability will, because of that disability, be denied access to or
participation in services, programs, or activities at New England School of Law.
Any accepted candidate who may require special accommodations should contact the
Assistant Dean for Students as early as possible.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="FOREIGN">Applicants with Foreign Degrees</A></H3> 

<H4>Applicants with foreign undergraduate degrees. </H4>If an applicant's degree is from

<H3><A NAME="PROCEDURES">Application Procedures</A></H3>
<H4>Application process</H4>
Each applicant must complete and file an application form by the March 15
priority deadline, or the June 1 extended deadline, indicating the program to
which he or she seeks admission. Except in rare cases of economic hardship, a
nonrefundable application fee of $50 must accompany each application. This fee
is for processing only and is not credited toward the tuition of an accepted
student. An applicant who believes he or she may qualify for a fee waiver should
contact the Office of Admissions for details. Application may be made to more
than one program; a $50 application fee must be submitted for each program.
To secure a place in the entering class, an accepted applicant must make a
nonrefundable seat deposit of $150 by the date specified in the acceptance
letter. An additional payment of $350 is required and is usually due about 30
days after the $150 seat deposit. To be eligible for a refund of this second
payment, the student must notify the law school in writing by July 15 of his or
her intention not to enroll. If the student does enroll, both the nonrefundable
$150 seat deposit and the second payment of $350 are credited toward the first
semester's tuition.
Requirements
Before matriculating at New England School of Law, an applicant must have earned
a baccalaureate degree from an accredited U.S. institution or the equivalent
degree from a foreign institution.
Each applicant is required to submit two letters of recommendation, at least one
of which should come, if possible, from a faculty member who taught the
applicant as an undergraduate. An applicant who is not a recent college graduate
may obtain letters of recommendation from employers.
Each applicant also is invited to submit a personal statement. This
supplementary statement should emphasize a particular aspect of the applicant's
background, the applicant's suitability for admission, or the basis of his or
her interest in legal studies.



  <H3><A NAME="TRANSFER">Transfer Admissions</A></H3>

A student who has completed one year of law school may
apply for admission with advanced standing. The student must submit a completed
New England School of Law admissions application and the appropriate application

school, New England School of Law may accept applicants for nonmatriculating
visiting status, based on space availability. The procedure is the same as for
transfer students; in addition, a letter is required from the dean of the
current law school stating any conditions regarding grades, courses, and
minimum/maximum credits that will be transferable.

<H3>Application Procedures</H3>

<H4>Requirements</H4>
Before matriculating at New England School of Law, an applicant must have earned
a baccalaureate degree from an accredited U.S. institution or the equivalent
degree from a foreign institution.
Each applicant is required to submit two letters of recommendation, at least one

administered by the Law School Admissions Service (LSAS), no later than February
of the year in which he or she wishes to enroll. The applicant must have taken
the LSAT within the three years before applying for admission. Applicants who
repeat the LSAT tend to receive higher scores on subsequent tests; therefore,
the admissions committee gives more weight to repeat test scores only if they
reflect marked improvement.

<H3><A NAME="TUITION">Tuition and Fees:</A></H3>

Tuition is set each spring for the academic year commencing in the fall. The tuition for the 1996-97 academic year is $13,350 for the day division and $10,010 for the evening division. Students in the Special Part-time Program who are receiving evening residency credit will be charged at the day tuition rate and those receiving evening residency credit will be charged at the evening tuition rate; however, Special Part-time students taking seven credit hours or fewer will be charged the per credit rate of $545.<P>

Each student is charged a $50 incidentals fee, a $50 library fee, and a $50 Student Bar Association (SBA) each year. The SBA fee is used to sponsor student activities and events through the year.<P>

Massachusetts Mandated Student Health Insurance is relatively low-cost insurance required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all students carrying at least 75 percent of the course load for full-time students. The cost of this insurance in 1996-97 is $620 for 12 months of coverage. Details are provided with registration materials. Students with comparable coverage under other qualified plans may be exempt, but must submit a waiver form.<P>

The above fees are payable annually with fall registration and are not refundable.<P>

<H4>Payment of tuition and fees</H4>
Tuition and fees are payable in full in advance of each semester (for example, in August for the fall semester and in December for the spring semester). For those students or parents who wish to pay on a deferred payment basis, the law school offers an interest-free installment plan. For further information, contact:<P>

Academic Management Services<BR>
50 Vision Blvd.<BR>
E. Providence, RI 02914<BR>

<P>

Telephone: (800) 531-4300<P>

<P>Installment plan payments usually begin in June or July.</P>

<P>Students who are delinquent in their financial obligations to the school are subject to exclusion from classes or dismissal from school. Matriculation is conditioned on full payment of law school obligations and is subject to cancellation at any time for nonpayment of those obligations. A student may not be permitted to take a final examination if he or she is financially delinquent in the day the examination is scheduled. Transcripts or other certification of a student's status will not be issued for a student whose law school account is in arrears. The law school will assess interest on delinquent balances.</P>

<H3><A NAME="TRANSCRIPT">Transcript Fee</A></H3>

The $3 transcript fee is charged for official copies of a student's transcript.



<H3><A NAME="GRADUATION">Graduation Fee</A></H3>

This $100 fee is assessed each student in his or her final semester.



<H3><A NAME="CAPGOWN">Cap and Gown Fee</A></H3>

The fee for cap and gown rental is announced each spring before graduation.<P>



<H3><A NAME="VISITINGFEE">Fee for Visiting at Another Law School</A></H3> New
England

School of Law students are expected to complete substantially all credit and degree requirements
at this law school. In certain extremely rare circumstances, the Dean may grant approval for a
New England student to complete a semester or an academic year at another ABA-accredited law
school, as a visiting student. Such approval will be granted only if extreme hardship is shown. If
such approval is granted, the student will be relieved of one-half the tuition and fee obligation
owed to New England School of Law for the applicable period away from the law school. The
law school will accept, without the payment of any fee, the transfer of up to six credits earned by
New England students at other law schools accredited by the American Bar Association. Such
credits may be accepted only with the prior written approval of the Associate Dean and may not
be for courses that are required at New England School of Law.<P>  Students who are delinquent
in their financial obligations to the school are subject to exclusion from classes or dismissal from
school. Matriculation is conditioned on full payment of law school obligations and is subject to
cancellation at any time for nonpayment of those obligations. A student will not be permitted to
take a final examination if he or she is financially delinquent on the day the examination is
scheduled. Transcripts or other certification of a student's status will not be issued on behalf of a
student who is indebted to the law school. The law school will assess interest on delinquent
balances.<P>



<H3><A NAME="WITHDRAWAL">Voluntary Withdrawal</A></H3>

A student who chooses to withdraw from law school but wishes to retain the option of
readmission must submit a written request to the Dean for withdrawal without prejudice. A
student's academic standing and the status of his or her account with the Office of the Controller
are the factors that determine whether withdrawal without prejudice will be granted. Refer to the
current Student Handbook of Rules and Regulations for academic requirements relating to
withdrawal and for information on readmission procedures. A request for withdrawal without
prejudice, if approved, will be considered effective as of the date of its receipt in the Office of the
Dean. The Office of the Controller will use that date as the effective date of withdrawal when
determining the status of the student's tuition bill. If a withdrawing student has an unpaid balance
due on his or her tuition bill, the amount due must be paid before a withdrawal without prejudice
will be granted. However, if a withdrawing student has paid more than the required amount due
at the time of withdrawal, he or she may be eligible for a partial refund of tuition. Fees are not
refundable, and tuition refunds will not be granted after the fourth week of the semester. To
determine whether a withdrawing student owes a balance to the law school or is due a refund, the
student's account is accorded a tuition cancellation as per the chart below. Any amount left as
due the school must be paid before a withdrawal without prejudice will be granted. Any surplus
will be refunded to the student or lender in accordance with federal regulations.
<H4>Tuition cancellation is allowed according to the following chart:</H4>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="FINANCIAL_ASST">Financial
Assistance, 1996</A></H2></CENTER>


The law school offers financial assistance to eligible students in good
standing. While responsibility for funding educational and living costs lies
primarily with the student and his or her family, the law school can assist with
scholarships, grants, low-interest Perkins loans, and work-study programs for
students who demonstrate need. The law school also offers some academic-based
scholarships for students who meet certain criteria.
Financial need is defined as the difference between all of the student's
resources and all expenses. Tuition, fees, books and supplies, and standard
living expenses are all included in determining a student's expense budget.
Students should anticipate that loans will be a significant part of their
financial aid package. Any student who applies for financial assistance should
also apply for a Federal Stafford Loan. The Federal Stafford Loan is the first
level of funding for financial aid applicants. No assistance of any kind will be
offered to a student who is in default or owes a refund on Title IV funds.
Financial aid is awarded by the law school on an annual basis, and students must
apply annually. The deadline for applying for financial aid for an academic year
is usually April 15 of the previous academic year. This deadline applies to
incoming students as well. Do not wait to be accepted by the law school before
applying for financial aid. Aid application materials are available in January
at the Office of Financial Aid. Incoming students interested in financial aid
should submit the request form for financial aid with their admission
applications.
It is essential that any student applying for aid submit accurate required
materials on time. Failure to complete the application process by April 15 or
omissions and errors on materials could jeopardize an applicant's chance of
receiving financial aid. 
<P>
<H4>Application procedure</H4>
The following documents are required to complete an applicant's financial aid
application file:
<DL>
<DT><H4>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</H4>
<DD>The FAFSA form is available from the Office of Financial Aid and is required of
all students applying for financial aid. The FAFSA form should be submitted no
later than February 15 to ensure that it is received by the April 15 deadline.
The New England School of Law FAFSA code number is G08916. Students who
submitted a FAFSA in the previous year should receive a renewal application in
December/January. Submission of the renewal FAFSA is recommended for continuing
students.
<BR>
<DT><H4>New England School of Law Financial Aid Application</H4> 
 <DD>The law school's financial aid application, which is included in the financial
aid packet, provides the school with information that supplements the
information from the FAFSA form. 
<DT><H4>Student Income Verification Form</H4> 
<DD>This form is used to verify untaxed income received by the student as well as
the student's tax filing status. Signed federal tax returns, including all
schedules and W2 forms for the most recent year, must be returned with this
form.
<BR> 
<DT>  <H4>Parent Income Verification Form</H4>
<DD>This form is used to collect parent income and asset information. Signed federal
tax returns, including all schedules and W2 forms for the most recent year, must
be returned with this form. Parental information is required of all applicants
applying for institutional (not federal) grant and scholarship funds who are 25
years of age or younger.
<BR>
<DT><H4> Financial Aid Transcript(s)</H4>
<DD>Financial aid transcripts must be submitted from all post-secondary schools the
applicant has attended. These forms are required regardless of whether the
student received or applied for aid at another school.
</DL><P>
To be eligible for Title IV funds, a student who is subject to the Selective
Service Act must complete the Statement of Registration Compliance. In addition,
all financial aid applicants must complete certification of Statements of
Educational Purpose and Non-Default Status to receive funding. The SAR (Student
Aid Report) and New England School of _Law Financial Aid Application include
_the certifications for meeting these requirements.
Financial aid award notices are mailed beginning in March for incoming students
and in May for continuing students. An extension of the due date for the second
tuition deposit ($350) may be granted to new students who have not been notified
of a financial aid decision. Requests for extensions must be made to the
director of admissions

<H3><A NAME="STAFFORD">Federal Stafford Loan Program </A>(formerly Guaranteed
Student Loan Program)</H3>

Most students will be eligible for a subsidized and/or unsubsidized Stafford
loan. Students demonstrating financial need may qualify for up to $8,500 in
subsidized Stafford loan funds for an academic year. The interest for these
loans is subsidized by the federal government. The borrower is not charged
interest until repayment begins, which is usually six months after graduation.
Students who do not qualify for the full amount of a subsidized loan or who need
additional funding may apply for an unsubsidized Federal Stafford loan. The
maximum annual loan amount for an unsubsidized loan is $18,500, less any
subsidized loan amount. Students are responsible for interest payments while
enrolled. However, most lenders offer the option to have the interest accrue and
be capitalized.
These loans are made directly to the student, who is responsible for repayment.
The interest rate for the Federal Stafford Loan is variable. The rate is set in
July and is equal to the 91-day T-Bill rate plus 2.5 percent. The interest rate
for the 1995-96 academic year was 8.25 percent. An origination and guarantee fee
of up to 4 percent is deducted from the loan before disbursement.
To apply for the Federal Stafford Loan, a student must obtain an application
from a lender or bank that participates in the program or from the Office of
Financial Aid. Completed loan applications should be forwarded to the Office of
Financial Aid for processing. Students who plan to use the loan funds to help
pay for tuition should submit the loan application no later than June 1 to avoid
late fees. Approval can take up to six weeks after the loan has been processed
by the Office of Financial Aid. Loans are usually disbursed in two installments,
one for the fall semester and one for the spring semester.

capitalized and added to the principal at the time of repayment. The Access
Group also offers the Federal Stafford Loan program; both federal and private
loans are available in collaboration with Society National Bank (Cleveland, OH).

<H3>Outside scholarships</H3>
Students are encouraged to investigate outside sources; the reference section of
local libraries has resources on financial assistance. Students also can check
with employers or civic organizations about scholarships. The Office of
Financial Aid maintains a partial listing of outside scholarships from various
agencies.<P>

<H3><A NAME="WORK_STUDY">Work Programs</A></H3>

This federally funded program enables needy students to earn money by working
part time during the school year and full time during summer vacations. Students
are not eligible for work-study awards until the summer following their first
year of law school. Students who receive work-study awards may work at the law
school or in a law-related position for a public agency or nonprofit
organization. Students receive paychecks twice a month and are permitted to work
until the award has been used in full. The program is very much in demand and
funds are limited, so students are encouraged to apply promptly for financial
aid. Eligibility is determined by the FAFSA.<P>

<A NAME=appeal>
<P>Boston is a city that visitors and new residents quickly learn to love. Steeped in history, it is nonetheless a thoroughly modern and youthful city, a center of contemporary culture, and home to nearly three dozen colleges, universities, and professional schools. It has been called the most European of American cities, and it combines the elegant skyscrapers of the financial district with the charming brick row houses of Back Bay, the fashionable shopping along Newbury Street with the bustling ethnic neighborhoods of the Italian North End and Chinatown, broad boulevards like Commonwealth Avenue with the steep, narrow lanes of Beacon Hill.</P>

<P>Boston features one of the nation's first urban indoor shopping areas, Faneuil Hall Marketplace. Parks and squares are woven into its fabric, many designed or inspired by Frederick Law Olmsted, the landscape architect who created the city's Emerald Necklace, which links the Public Garden and Boston Common and stretches from the Esplanade along the Charles River through the Back Bay Fens to the Arnold Arboretum and Franklin Park..</P>

<P>A good public transportation system enables students to get around the city easily, and the region's highways provide access to New England's beautiful coast and lovely mountains.</P>

<P>Boston is well known for its historic sites, such as the Freedom Trail, the Paul Revere House, and the Old North Church. It also boasts an array of fine cultural institutions: the Museum of Fine Arts, the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, the John F. Kennedy Library, the Museum of Science, and the Aquarium. The city is home to the Boston Symphony Orchestra, the Boston Pops, and the Boston Ballet. Those in search of night life can visit clubs that feature disk jockeys and live performances of rhythm & blues, alternative, techno, and jazz.</P>
 
<P>Boston's diversity is reflected in its neighborhoods and in institutions and events that celebrate its varied population: the Black Heritage Trail, the Museum of Afro-American History, St. Anthony's Festival, Chinese New Year festivities, the Puerto Rican Festival, the Caribbean-American Carnival, and the Gay Pride March.</P>

<P>For sports fans, Boston offers professional teams in baseball, basketball, football, and hockey. The Red Sox play at Fenway Park, and the Celtics and Bruins compete in the city's new sports arena, the Fleet Center. The New England Patriots are based at nearby Foxboro Stadium. 
The Head of the Charles Regatta is an annual rowing festival, and tennis tournaments are featured at the Longwood Cricket Club.</P>

<P>New England School of Law is located in the heart of the city's theater district, an area that also boasts a variety of restaurants. The school is just one block from the Public Garden, with its formal flower gardens and charming Swan Boats.</P>

<P>But besides its multitude of entertainment offerings, Boston is also a center of professional activity in law and business. The state capital and the center of the New England region, Boston exposes law students to the operations of federal and state courts, the regional offices of federal agencies, departments of state government, and corporate headquarters of major companies.</P>
 
<P>Large law firms and public-interest organizations also make Boston 
their home, and opportunities are extensive for clinical placements, clerkships, part-time employment, and research.</P>

</CENTER>
<P>For most law students, finding satisfying employment after graduation is a major concern, beginning during the application process and continuing throughout law school. What practice area do I want to enter? Do I want to work for a large firm, a small firm, or in a business or public sector environment? Some students enter school with clear career goals; others develop or change their focus as they progress through the program.</P>

<P>The Office of Career Services at New England School of Law believes that students must begin thinking about their career goals early in law school and develop the ability to plan their own career paths. Job-hunting in the legal profession, as in most fields, no longer occurs just at the completion of a degree but rather is part of a life-long process of assessing one's goals and interests and pursuing positions that meet those personal needs.</P>

<P>To begin that process, the staff of the career services office reaches out to students during their first year. The three professional staff offer individual counseling, job-search advice, networking information, programs on job-hunting issues, and connections to alumni in various fields, in addition to a library of job-postings, reference directories, and publications. Staff members work with students to plan their law school experience as the first step in their legal careers and to include "resume-building" activities like scholarly publications, moot court activities, clinical experience, internships, or part-time legal jobs that can significantly expand future employment options.</P>

<P>The office includes a full-time director, who is a lawyer with several years of practice experience; an assistant director with a master's degree in counseling; and a recruiting coordinator. The office maintains both printed and computerized resources that range from directories of lawyers and legal organizations to binders with current job postings to a broad selection of legal periodicals, including daily and weekly lawyers newspapers in various parts of the country where students are interested in practicing. The Career Services Bulletin Board can be dialed from law school or home computers to access the most recent job postings and announcements of career services events or to leave messages for career services staff.</P>

<P>An alumni networking and mentoring program allows students to consult with alumni who are currently practicing in fields the students are considering. Seminars and workshops on resume-writing, interviewing, fall recruiting, summer jobs, and other topics that interest students are offered throughout the year. The career services office also sponsors a popular annual Alumni Career Forum in the spring, at which alumni in various practice areas speak with students about their fields and offer suggestions to assist with career decisions.</P>

<P>Recruitment activities are organized in cooperation with other area law schools to increase their effectiveness. New England is a member of the Massachusetts Law School Consortium, a joint effort of the state's seven ABA-accredited law schools, and participates in its fall recruitment program, off-campus recruitment and public interest recruitment programs, alternative career forum, and public interest forum. The Consortium also offers a series of weekly panels during the fall semester on issues such as starting a solo practice, negotiating compensation with a small firm, and networking.</P>

<P>Many New England students find jobs in small and medium-sized firms, public interest organizations, government, and the financial services industry. Judicial clerkships in state or federal courts offer excellent training and experience for new graduates. Students who come to law school after working in other fields may combine previous areas of expertise with their law degree.</P>

<P>Boston is a center of legal education and professional activity. It is home to law firms with hundreds of partners and to small boutique firms with specialized practices. As the state capital and regional center, it houses offices of local and state government, as well as federal agencies, providing a ready link to the public sector. A city with a strong financial services industry, it is an ideal location for students who are interested in working in regulatory, compliance, or contract-management positions, and New England graduates began entering business and quasi-legal positions long before this became a trend.</P>

<P>Because of the large number of law schools in Boston and the region, however, the local legal employment market is very competitive. Students must remain open to various job possibilities and are urged to consider opportunities outside the Boston area. Career planning and placement are the individual responsibility of each student and alumnus/alumna. The Office of Career Services supports this effort by providing guidance and assistance to both current students and graduates as they negotiate that process.</P>

<P>"Clinics... are a key component in the development and advancement of skills and values throughout the profession",  states the 1992 report of the American Bar Association's Task Force on Law School and the Profession, known as the MacCrate Report. "Their role in the curricular mix of courses is vital... Clinics provide students with the opportunity to integrate, in an actual practice setting, all of the fundamental lawyering skills... Clinical courses are an integral part of the educational process at New England School of Law. A pioneer in combining a classroom component with each clinic experience, the law school has strongly supported its clinics and maintains varied offerings that expose students to a range of practice settings and fields. When New England School of Law expanded its clinics during the 1980s, it funded these programs itself, rather than relying on public funds, so despite
recent cutbacks in the federal funding that supported legal services offices and many law school clinics, New England's clinics remain strong and active.</P>

<P>Clinic experience provides an opportunity to put classroom learning into practice in a real-world setting. By requiring students to apply the law to actual situations, clinics encourage rigorous legal and factual analysis and expose students to issues of policy and ethics that seldom arise in the classroom. Students who have taken a clinic early in their law school years often report that the clinical experience has enriched their understanding of upper-level classroom courses. Clinics also teach skills that are essential to the practice of law, such as legal writing, interviewing, counseling, investigation, negotiation, and litigation strategy.</P>

<P>Students often find that additional benefits to taking a clinic in law school come in the form of better preparation for the bar examination and a boost to both their resumes and their networking that helps with job searches. Each of New England's 16 clinics has a required classroom component. Most also require a course in a related subject area as a prerequisite or corequisite. The classroom component enhances the educational value of the practical experience found in the field work. It emphasizes the interaction of substance and process in the practice of law. As students learn legal theory, classroom knowledge informs their practice experience, and as they are exposed to real-world lawyering, their understanding of the course work is reinforced. They have the
chance to reflect with their professors about their experiences and to hear the similar or divergent impressions formed by students in other settings. Students choose their placements within a clinical course, based on their personal interests and the available settings. Placements allow students to explore areas of the law in which they are interested or may expose them to fields that they had not previously considered. Clinics such as The Lawyering Process and Criminal Procedure II are oriented to courtroom practice, but clinics are just as valuable for students who do not expect to pursue a career as a trial lawyer.</P>


<P>Clinics such as Health and Hospital Law, Environmental Law, or Land Use enable students to learn skills related to those areas of practice but may not include any courtroom work at all.</P>

<P>Additional information can be found in the course descriptions section of this book. Although the law school generally arranges clinical placements, students in some clinical courses may do so on their own. The student must be enrolled in a course for which clinical credit has been approved and must find a placement that offers work substantially similar to placements usually associated with the course. The work must be unpaid, and both the placement and supervision must be approved by the clinical director and the course instructor.</P>

<P>The school's clinical programs follow three models: in-house clinics, placement clinics, and clinical components. These are described below, and additional information can be found in the course descriptions section of this book.</P>

<H3><A NAME="inhouse">In-House Clinics</H3></A>

<P>The in-house clinics are courses offered through the school's Clinical Law Office, a fully equipped law office established in 1971 and located in the nearby law school building that also houses the administrative offices. Students in these courses are usually supervised by members of the school's full-time clinical faculty.</P>

<P>Established in 1971, the school's Clinical Law Office is supported entirely by the law school. It is located in the Church Street building; 
The Lawyering Process This is a civil litigation course taught by the clinical program's director, who is a member of the full-time faculty. Most students in the course work in the school's Clinical Law Office under the supervision of two other full-time faculty members; others work at Greater Boston Legal Services. Students may also be placed at the school's satellite clinic in the Suffolk County House of Correction, where they are supervised by a full-time faculty member. In each setting, students handle cases under the Massachusetts court rule permitting student practice. Instruction in The Lawyering Process course covers areas such
as trial skills, interviewing, and counseling. As part of the course, students also participate in simulations, based on actual cases, for which they prepare cross examinations, direct examinations, opening statements, and closing arguments, which may be videotaped and critiqued by the class. Students meet weekly for a supervision session to review cases they are handling and discuss the legal, practical, and ethical issues that arise.</P>

ethical issues that arise.</P>

<STRONG><I>Advanced Lawyering Process</I></STRONG>

<P>This course affords students a further opportunity to enhance lawyering skills and to explore some of the more difficult problems to which they were exposed in The Lawyering Process course. Students taking Advanced Lawyering Process focus on the more advanced stages of litigation, including discovery, negotiation, and trial, and they participate in a biweekly seminar.</P>

<H3><A NAME="placement">Placement Clinics</H3></A>

<P>Students in these courses are all placed in the same agency or closely related agencies, and the subject of the course is the law practiced in the agency and the policy considerations underlying the agency's work. Students attend weekly classes, which explore these matters and are taught by the faculty member in charge of the course.</P>

<STRONG><I>The Government Lawyer</I></STRONG>

<P>Students are placed in various divisions of the Office of the Attorney General of Massachusetts, where they work on cases under the supervision of assistant attorneys general.

Students explore issues such as defining the public interest and resolving conflicts between the attorney general's responsibility to represent the public and the duty to defend government agencies.</P>

<STRONG><I>The Tax Clinic</I></STRONG>

<P>Students are placed at the Appellate Tax Board and in several bureaus of the Massachusetts Department of Revenue, where they do legal work under the supervision of attorneys in those departments. Class meetings explore both substantive and institutional aspects of taxation, including the structure and enforcement of the state tax laws and a comparison with similar aspects of federal law.</P>

<H3><A NAME="clinical">Clinical Components</H3> </A>

<P>These are "courses within courses" in which some of the students enrolled in a classroom course also do clinical work in the area of law that is the subject of the classroom course. The students in a clinical component may be placed in a variety of settings, but all of them are engaged in the same area of substantive law. So, for example, all of the students in the Environmental Law Clinic work in the area of environmental law, although some are in public agencies and others are in private firms. In addition to performing their placement duties, students submit weekly journal entries, describing and reflecting on their experience. They also meet in a series of seminars with the course instructor and clinical director to discuss issues raised in their journals.</P>

<STRONG><I>Administrative Law Clinic (in conjunction with Administrative Law)</I></STRONG>

<P>Students are placed in a variety of settings, both within various agencies and in offices where attorneys practice before agencies.

<P>Students work at the Massachusetts Commission Against Discrimination or in other government agencies, private firms, or public interest organizations that offer exposure to matters involving employment law.</P>

<STRONG><I>Environmental Law Clinic (in conjunction with Environmental Law)</I></STRONG>

<P>Students are placed at agencies, such as the state Department of Environmental Protection, the federal Environmental Protection Agency, or the state attorney general's Environmental Division, and in law offices where the practice is largely environmental.</P>

<STRONG><I>Health and Hospital Law Clinic (in conjunction with Health and Hospital Law)</I></STRONG> 

<P>Students are placed in settings that expose them to health and hospital law issues. Placements include hospital general counsel's offices and law firms where the work primarily involves health and hospital issues.</P>

<h4><a name="General Information">General Information</a></h4>
<P>The <I>New England International and Comparative Law Annual </I>is proud to publish  its third volume at the New England School of Law.   The Journal was established in 1994 as an in-house publication.   After the publication of its second volume, in 1996, the law school faculty voted to make the <I>Annual </I>available on the Internet.  As a young, experimental enterprise, the Annual has a small staff and limited resources.  The articles tend to be short pieces, written by students, which focus on provocative and current issues in the fields of international and comparative law.  While the <I>Annual </I>is intended to be less formal than a conventional law journal, we think that you will find the information, thoughts, and analysis contained in its articles to be interesting and useful.  Furthermore,  the <I>Annual </I>plays a significant role in NESL's new Center for International Law and Policy.  Volume 4 of the <I>Annual,</I> which will be available on the Internet in May 1997, will feature  the text of a speech about the controversial Helms-Burton (Cuban Sanctions) Act, which was delivered at the Center's first function by Nicholas Rostow, formerly Chief Counsel of the National Security Council and  currently Executive Director of the Massachusetts Office of International Trade and Investment.</P>

<h4><a name="Forthcoming Issues">Forthcoming Issues</a></h4>
Volume 3 of the <i>New England International and Comparative Law Annual</i> will be published
April 15, 1997.  It will be available on the World Wide Web shortly thereafter.<p>

<p>

<h4><a name="Submission of Articles">Submission of Student Written Articles</a></h4>
Students wishing to submit an article which concerns International or Comparative Law should mail both a
hard copy (double spaced, 20-50 pages) and a copy on diskette (Word Perfect 5.1/5.2) to the
<i>Annual</i> at the address below.  Text and footnotes in the <i>Annual</i> conform to the latest editions of
<i>The Bluebook: A Uniform System of Citation</i>, except where common sense dictates otherwise. 
The editors of the Annual verify the accuracy of all footnotes that cite to sources accessible
through the National Inter-Library Loan System, as well as those sources unavailable in the
United States which can be obtained within a reasonable time.<p>

<P>The Law Library's mission is to support and enhance the research and educational endeavors of the NESL faculty, students, staff, and alumni. The Library is an essential and integral component in the educational life of the school; it supports the school's curriculum and fosters an atmosphere that is conductive to research and learning. The library's knowledgeable and service-oriented staff provides instruction and assistance in both on-line and traditional methods of research, and provides an excellent, accessible collection for patrons. The library's 270,000-volume collection contains all standard legal research and reference materials, most of which are on open shelving for easy access. Documents are available in printed form and microform. We also have an extensive collection of audio and video tapes, as well as access to the Internet, CD-ROMs, and other computer materials. The library occupies five levels on three floors, and seats over 400. Study rooms are available to NESL students for two hours per person per day, and to groups for four hours per day. Reservations for rooms and study carrels may be made at the Circulation Desk.</P>

<P><B>Reference:</B> Legal encyclopedias, Words and Phrases, ALR, and other major titles are located on the second floor and basement level.  Many other helpful reference materials are located through the networked CD-ROM collection.</P>

<P><B>Special Collections - The Archives:</B>  The historical archives contain materials from Portia Law School, founded in 1908 and re-chartered as New England School of Law in 1969. Also represented are catalogs from the affiliate Calvin Coolidge College of Liberal Arts (1936-1968), and a collection of some personal papers of the School's founder, Arthur W. MacLean.  A guide to the collection is available at the Circulation Desk; please contact the Associate Librarian for access to the collection.</P>

<H3><a name="circ">Circulating Books</a></H3>

<P>Most treatises, hornbooks, general reading materials
(items with Library of Congress call numbers) and some videotapes may be checked out of the library.  Currently enrolled NESL students, faculty and staff, and alumni with library cards may check out circulating books for approximately thirty days; materials may be renewed <I>once</I> if no other user has requested the book.  Circulating materials may be returned by dropping them into the silver book return bin at the end of the Circulation Desk; all are due by the last day of the Spring term each year. Graduating seniors must return all library books to be eligible for graduation.  You may view your record of materials you have checked out at any OPAC terminal.  Your circulation transactions will be expedited with a barcoded ID.  <I>You may be fined for overdue materials; please take note of the time or date due on materials.</I><P>

<H3><a name="reserve">Reserve Materials</a></H3>

<P>The following materials are on reserve behind the Circulation Desk: course materials; NESL exams for the past five years; study aids; practice materials; legal newspapers; audio and video tapes of classes; general videos; CD-ROMs; and standard legal references such as the Martindale-Hubbell Directory.  Frequently used Massachusetts sources, such as the Massachusetts Practice Series, the Massachusetts General Laws Annotated, and the Code of Massachusetts Regulations are also located at the Circulation Desk. Museum passes are available for checkout upon leaving a $10 deposit.</P>

<P>Most reserve materials may be used in the library for two hours. A valid law student identification card, library card, or state bar card must be left at the Circulation Desk.  Permission for overnight checkout of some reserve materials may occasionally be granted by a Reference Librarian provided that the following conditions are met:  multiple copies are available; the material is checked out before 9 p.m., Monday-Thursday and before 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays; the material is returned within the first hour the library is open the next day.  Only current students, faculty, and staff are eligible for this privilege.  Evening students may have the additional privilege of checking out eligible materials 6:00-9:00 p.m. on Wednesday and returning them by 6:00 on Thursday.</P>

<P>Most of the collection is on open shelving and is freely accessible for in-library use.  Please reshelve these materials promptly and properly as a courtesy to other library users.  Holdings may be easily identified and located as follows:</P>

<P><B>1. PORTIA</B>, the library's <b>on-line catalog</b>,  can be searched by author, title, and subject keywords and will provide call numbers and locations for all materials. The <b>card catalog</b> on the main floor was closed to updates in 1994.</P>

                            MEMORANDUM



TO:    Full-time Faculty and Deans

FROM:  Professors Fischer and Scharf

DATE:  May 15, 1996

RE:    Proposal for a "New England Center for International Law

and    Policy"



     Based on the guidance of the faculty at its May 7, 1996

meeting, we offer the following proposal for the establishment of

a New England Center for International Law and Policy to be voted

on at the May 21st faculty meeting:



     It is proposed that the New England School of Law establish

the "New England Center for International Law and Policy" to

serve as the temporary home for the Public International Law and

Policy Group (described in previous memo from the Faculty

Development Committee) and as the hub for other activities

related to international and comparative law at NESL.  To this

end, NESL will provide the Group certain accommodations as host

and work out a mutually-advantageous affiliation.  In addition,

NESL will identify some type of office space for the Center,

dedicate a phone extension with voice mail, create an e-mail

address, print stationery and a brochure, and appoint one or more

full-time faculty members to oversee and develop a plan for the

activities of the Center.  A report will be made to the faculty

in the fall concerning the program goals of the Center for the

next academic year.  Further major steps will be taken only after

consultation with the Faculty and/or Dean as appropriate.



     The kinds of things we would like to explore as future

activities of the Center would include:  the appointment of a

group of "associated Scholars," both from NESL and outside, to be

affiliated with the Center; hosting or co-hosting periodic

symposia to be held at NESL, and publishing the papers or

proceedings of such conferences; development of a newsletter

and/or occasional papers series, identified with the Center and

NESL; creation of an international and comparative law clinical

program for our students; establishment of a visiting scholar or

scholarly-exchange program; liaising with foreign lawyers and

businessmen, with an eye to obtaining foreign placements for our

students and graduates; and seeking outside funding to support

the activities of the Center.  There will be many other ideas, as

well.  The Center will give us an identity and an organizational

basis that will enable us to seek out and to take advantage of

opportunities, including foundation grants, as they may arise.

<H5>THE MEDIAN INCOME OF LAWYERS CONTRASTED WITH THE MEDIAN
INCOME OF AMERICAN WORKERS HOLDING A BACHELOR'S, MASTER'S, OR

<p>Most lawyers hold the degree of Juris Doctor or J.D. Some obtain advanced law degrees such as
the LL.M. or S.J.D.  <A HREF="#table2">Table "2"</A> below compares the median income of full-time male and female lawyers and judges with the median incomes of full-time workers holding bachelors, masters or
doctoral degrees.  The term "degree" as it is used here means the highest degree held by members
of the target population. The Table provides data for the year 1992, the most recent year for
which data is available. The table shows that in 1992, the median income of lawyers and judges
was substantially higher than that of other American workers holding bachelor's, or advanced
non-professional degrees.

<H5>STARTING SALARIES OF LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES BY GENDER AND MINORITY STATUS</H5>

<P>Across the past decade, the National Association for Law Placement (NALP)
has conducted an annual salary survey of recent law school graduates. The
starting salaries of graduates who have identified themselves in the NALP
Survey as members of a minority group (Asian American, African American,
American Indian, Mexican, Puerto Rican, and other Hispanic) have increased
at a higher rate than the salaries of law school graduates generally. The
starting salaries of males have increased at a higher rate than the starting
salaries of females. See <A HREF="#table5">Table 5</A>.</P>

<H5>THE EARNINGS OF IN-HOUSE CORPORATE COUNSEL</H5></A>

<P>Median compensation of corporate attorneys rose about 60% during the
ten year period 1984-1993 (see <A HREF="#table6">Table 6</A>). In 1993,
their median compensation was $103,000. The median compensation of non-supervisory
corporate attorneys equaled about 40% of that of chief legal officers throughout
the period. The median compensation of chief legal officers in 1993 was
over $220,000. </P>

<P>The figures reported in Table 6 are taken from national salary surveys
conducted by Alta Weil Pensa headquartered in Newtown Square, Pennsylvania
and Cantor &amp; Company headquartered in Downingtown, Pennsylvania. In
1993, Cantor &amp; Company reported that attorneys specializing in patent
law earned the highest median compensation among attorneys employed by
corporations. <A NAME="table6"></A></P>

<P>During the ten year period 1984-1993, compensation paid to third year
associates increased 53% according to the survey research firm Altman Weil
Pensa. In 1993, third year associates working in private law firms earned
a median compensation of $65,726 (see <A HREF="#table7">Table 7 </A>).
Compensation paid to partners or shareholders with 25-29 years of work
experience rose 43% during the period. In 1993, the median compensation
paid to partners or shareholders with 25-29 years of work experience was
$204,157. Across the period compensation earned by young associates thus
rose as a percentage of that earned by senior partners. </P>

with the specialties they pursue as well as by the state in which a lawyer
works. The data in <A HREF="#table8">Table 8</A> below suggest that intellectual
property law and plaintiff's personal injury work are among the highest
paid fields in all states while family law and collections work are among

<P>To accommodate students' varying interests, available time, and financial
situations, New England School of Law offers three programs leading to the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. The day division is geared to students who can study law full time. The evening division is for those who will be working while they attend law school. The third program, one of very few like it in the country, is the Special Part-time Program, specifically for students with primary childrearing responsibilities.</P>

<P>The approximately 600 day division students generally spend three academic years in law school, and the 450 in the evening division attend school for four years. First- and second-year evening division classes take place on Monday, Wednesday, and Thursday, beginning at 6 p.m. The Special Part-time Program admits a limited number of people, who must complete degree requirements within six academic years.</P>

<P>Students begin the academic year in late August and attend until late May. The school also offers a summer program that includes elective and clinical courses. A student also may obtain advance approval to receive credit for summer study at another school. To graduate from New England School of Law, however, a student must complete substantially all credit and degree requirements at the school. Credits earned during the summer, whether here or elsewhere, may be used to decrease a student's course load but will not reduce the student's tuition for the regular semester.</P>

<P>To be eligible to graduate, a student must complete at least six semesters of study and 84 hours of credit in the day division or at least eight semesters of study and 84 hours of credit in the evening division. Equivalent requirements are set by the associate dean, on an individual basis, for Special Part-time Program students, for students who transfer between the day and evening divisions, or for those who transfer from another law school. In addition, a student must fulfill certain course and residency requirements.</P>

<H3><A NAME="program">The Program of Study</H3></A>

<P>The program of study at New England School of Law is structured to prepare students for the practice of law in any American jurisdiction. Students begin with 10 required courses that form the foundation for more advanced legal studies:   Civil Procedure, Contracts, Torts, Legal Methods, Constitutional Law, Property, Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure I, Evidence, and The Law and Ethics of Lawyering. During the first year, both day and evening division students study required subjects; day division students carry 15 credit hours in the fall and 16 credit hours in the spring; evening division students carry 10 credit hours each term. The second-year course load for day division students is 12 to 15 credit hours per semester, which includes required courses and electives; evening division students continue to take required courses throughout their
second year.</P>

<P>After completing the required courses, students may select elective courses that enable them to explore areas of the law that interest them. Electives provide students with the opportunity to build on the knowledge they have gained early in law school. This is the chance for a student to develop more specific expertise in a particular practice area or decide whether that specialty is right for him or her. Elective courses offer the opportunity for in-depth intellectual investigation; they can supply theoretical perspectives and practical grounding in a wide range of areas. During the third year in the day division, students carry 12 to 15 credit hours each semester; evening division students take 9 to 12 credits in the third and fourth years.</P>

<P>New England School of Law offers a wide range of elective courses and a broad array of options for each student.  Students are encouraged to explore and experiment, as they familiarize themselves with different areas of the law.</P>

<P>Certain electives are recommended by the faculty as good basic preparation for practice: Administrative Law; Business Organizations; Wills, Estates, and Trusts; and Personal Income Taxation. Other choices grow out of the student's particular interests and career goals. Among the elective courses are numerous seminars on topics as varied as International Environmental Law, European Community Law, AIDS and the Law, Domestic Violence, Contemporary Civil Rights, Mass Media Law, and Law and Literature. Electives also may include clinical courses that allow students to gain practice experience in a chosen area. In the
last year of law school, some students choose to do independent legal research, which involves a tutorial arrangement with a professor in the field and a directed legal research and writing project.</P>

<P>There has been much discussion and debate in recent years, both within the profession and outside it, about issues of legal ethics and professional
responsibility. Instructing students in the ethical requirements of legal
practice and teaching them to consider these issues as they arise in the course of study and work are critical aspects of a New England School of Law
education. Ethical issues cannot be separated from the practice or the study of law. Not only is a professional responsibility course required during the second year, but the school's policy directs professors to raise these issues in all courses.</P>

<H3><A NAME="writing">Writing</H3></A>

<P>The ability to express oneself coherently and clearly in writing is one of the most critical skills a law student must develop. Written communication is a mainstay of most areas of legal practice, and legal writing, although it shares many elements with nonlegal communication, has its own rules and structures.</P>

<P>First-year students are required to take the Legal Methods course, taught by adjunct legal writing instructors under the direction and supervision of a full-time faculty member. The course includes a legal analysis and writing component for which students compose a variety of legal documents, instruction in legal research and legal ethics, and a moot court requirement. The emphasis on strengthening writing skills is also the rationale behind the school's upperclass writing requirement, which is a prerequisite for graduation. All students must research and write a paper that involves substantial legal analysis, under the supervision of a full-time faculty member.</P>

<P>The writing requirement is designed to give each student the opportunity to explore a specific legal topic in depth, to work in a close tutorial relationship with a full-time faculty member, and to ensure that the student leaves law school with a polished written work that reflects his or her communication skills.</P>


<P>Students can fulfill the requirement in a number of ways:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Write a paper in a course designated as one that can satisfy the requirement. The paper must receive a grade of "C  or higher, and the professor must certify that the paper qualifies as a "substantial writing project. 

<LI>Serve on the editorial board of the New England Law Review or the New England Journal on Criminal and Civil Confinement and produce a paper that the publication's faculty adviser certifies as a "substantial writing project.

<LI>Participate in a moot court program, such as Honors Moot Court, Philip C. Jessup International Law Moot Court Competition, National Tax Moot Court Competition, or Environmental Moot Court Competition, and expand and rewrite a brief prepared for the competition, under the supervision of a full-time faculty member.

<LI>Register for an independent legal research project and complete a written paper in conjunction with the project.


<LI>Produce a paper that is supervised by a full-time faculty member and
certified by that faculty member to satisfy the writing requirement.

</UL>


<P>Students have numerous other opportunities to refine their writing skills. Required and elective courses may require papers. In addition, students in their last year of school may register to do independent legal research on an area of the law that is not covered by a scheduled course or is only touched on in the curriculum. This project, conducted under the supervision of a faculty member with expertise in the area, must culminate in a written paper.</P>

<H3><A NAME="academic">Academic Opportunities</H3></A>

<P>A New England School of Law education emphasizes strong core courses and diverse electives. Students interested in particular areas of the law such as business law, regulatory law, or litigation   will find electives that provide a solid foundation in those fields. In addition, the school offers a tax law concentration and a broad range of introductory and advanced courses in international and environmental law; in each of those areas, publications and moot court competitions are available to reinforce classroom learning.</P>

<P>New England School of Law graduates are eligible to take the bar examination in any jurisdiction in the United States. Students must be sure, however, that they meet the individual state's requirements. Some jurisdictions require students to register with the state Board of Bar Examiners before or soon after they begin law school.</P>

<P>Many jurisdictions require those taking the bar exam to pass the Multi-state Professional Responsibility Examination. In addition, some states require completion of certain courses during law school, not all of which may be required by individual law schools.</P>


<P>It is the student's responsibility to investigate any requirements by contacting the bar examiners of the state or jurisdiction in which he or she expects to practice. New England School of Law's Office of Career Services and law library are able to provide information on bar admission requirements for different states.</P>

<P>From its beginnings, New England School of Law has produced alumni whose contributions have enhanced the legal communities of Boston and the region. Early alumnae broke barriers that had impeded the entry of women into the profession, and in doing so, they paved the way for future generations of women lawyers. In 1923, a Portia Law School alumna became the first woman assistant U.S. attorney in New England; other early ground breakers who were Portia alumnae were the first woman lawyer to appear before the full Massachusetts Supreme Court (1926), the first black woman lawyer in Rhode Island (1931), the first woman to serve as a presiding justice of any court in Massachusetts and the first woman to head a city department in Boston (1934), and following World War II, the only woman to head a department of the American legal staff at the Nuremberg trials.</P>

<P>That tradition has continued as more recent alumni have assumed positions of leadership in the public and private sectors. The school's nearly 7,000 alumni practice throughout the region; in states from New York to California and Alaska to Hawaii; and in countries that include Germany, England, Israel, and Japan. Graduates work in firms of all sizes and hold positions in the public sector and in business. The current heads of the public safety department and banking commission in Massachusetts are New England graduates; alumni sit on the bench of numerous Massachusetts courts as well as courts in other states, including New York and Pennsylvania, and on the federal military appeals court; and many alumni are prominent in private practice in New England and in other regions of the country.</P>

<P>Alumni also play a major role in supporting the school. The loyalty and commitment students develop to the school during their years here carry over into their legal careers. The school's charter dictates that only alumni may serve as members of the corporation that oversees the school.  Because of their active involvement in the school's operation, the contribution of graduates has been key to the school's vitality and growth.</P>

<P>If you ask students or graduates of New England School of Law what most impresses them about their New England education, nearly all of them will begin by talking about the faculty. They will describe their professors as knowledgeable, well qualified, and unusually devoted to teaching and accessible to students.</P>

<P>New England's 39 full-time faculty members are top graduates of fine law schools, most of whom have practiced in the fields of law in which they now teach. In addition to maintaining regular office hours, faculty members make efforts to be available at other times to meet with students. Their involvement extends to their active support of activities like moot court, student publications, and law-related student organizations.</P>

<P>The adjunct faculty consists of 48 professionals who teach individual courses in their areas of expertise. Practicing attorneys and judges, they bring to the classroom a knowledge of how the law is being applied in the working world.</P>

<P>Faculty at New England garner outstanding marks on evaluations completed by students at the end of each term. Students who enter diverse areas of practice and those who go on to other law schools as LL. M. candidates comment on the excellent preparation they have received at New England. Because the school places such a strong emphasis on teaching, student input is an important factor in decisions about faculty tenure and retention.</P>

<P>Faculty also draw on each other for ideas about teaching and research. At faculty development presentations held several times a year, faculty members discuss professional issues such as those that arise during sabbaticals or conferences, and they invite professors from other law schools to speak about the law or teaching. Periodic "Works in Progress" lunches provide a forum for faculty to hear about and discuss their colleagues' current research as it is prepared for publication. New England faculty publish articles frequently in journals nationwide. These opportunities to engage in intellectual exchange benefit both the faculty and the students they teach.</P>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P>In 1908, two Boston women decided to sit for the Massachusetts bar examination. A lawyer named Arthur Winfield MacLean agreed to tutor them, and other students followed over the next few years. From that beginning, a school was established; MacLean's wife dubbed it Portia Law School, after the heroine of Shakespeare's "The Merchant of Venice." Arthur MacLean became the school's 
first dean.</P>

<P>Enrollment grew, and the first commencement was held in 1911. Beginning in 1920, Portia graduates received the LL.B. degree. During the school's early years, most women who passed the Massachusetts bar examination were Portia alumnae. In 1922, when the school moved into its first permanent building in Boston's Beacon Hill neighborhood, enrollment had reached 228, and the results from the December 1921 bar exam showed that all the women who had passed were graduates of the school.</P>

<P>The first law school in the nation founded exclusively for the education of women, Portia Law School became coeducational in 1938. In 1969, the school's name was changed to New England School of Law, and in 1973, full accreditation was granted by the American Bar Association. The 1980s began with the school's move to its current location in Boston's Park Square area.</P>

<P>The school's philosophical roots are evident today as it continues to offer a high-quality legal education to qualified students from a broad range of backgrounds.</P>

<H2 ALIGN=center>Message from the Dean</H2>
<HR NOSHADE>

<IMG SRC="images/dean_obr.jpg" HEIGHT=242 WIDTH=181 ALIGN=left HSPACE=5>
	
<P>As we expand on the strong academic traditions of New England School of Law, we are constantly building on our unique heritage as the first law school in the nation founded exclusively for women. We continue to seek out and to welcome highly motivated students from a wide range of backgrounds. In the pages that follow, we describe the structure and the strengths of our academic program, the extensive opportunities we offer for extracurricular activities, and the information you need to apply for admission to our law school.</P>

<P>New England School of Law provides students with a learning environment that combines attentive teaching, a rigorous curriculum, and a broad range of clinical programs. As a result, our students enter the work force well equipped for practice. They are prepared to apply their legal training to a wide range of careers that rely on legal skills - the practice of law, business, teaching, and government service - or to pursue more advanced, specialized study. As legal and business markets change, students are best served by professional preparation that expands options rather than narrowing them. Our strong core curriculum is augmented by an extensive list of specialized seminars. In several areas - environmental law, international law, and tax law - we offer concentrated programs taught by experienced professionals in those fields. Our clinical courses offer hands-on experience that includes client interaction and develops practical lawyering skills. Our library contains extensive resources in both traditional and computerized formats, with a highly trained and responsive staff to assist students in research.</P>

<P>We are particularly proud of our full-time faculty, a progressive and relatively young group of dedicated professionals, which is complemented 
by adjunct faculty and lecturers who are leading practitioners and jurists. The full-time faculty maintains a high level of scholarly publication and has continued to provide excellent teaching.</P>
 
<P>Although the school has long been known in New England, students increasingly have come to us from throughout the country and, as many of them fan out to other regions, our reputation spreads. As an alumnus myself (Class of 1977) and the first dean to have graduated from the school, I am gratified to see others join us in recognizing the excellence of a New England education. As I visit alumni around the country, I see the outstanding contributions these attorneys and judges are making to the profession.</P>

<P>We are delighted that you are considering New England School of Law. Together, our school and our location in the heart of one of the country's most livable and intellectually active cities make us an excellent choice for your legal education. New England School of Law provides an environment where students can thrive professionally and personally. Our administrators and faculty are happy to answer your questions, and we hope you will find that New England School of Law is the right school for you.</P>

<H2>Student Housing</H2>
</CENTER>

<HR NOSHADE>

<P>Like most graduate schools in the Boston area, New England School of Law does not provide on-campus housing. Most students attending the law school live in privately owned apartment buildings near the school or in other neighborhoods in Boston or its suburbs.</P>

<P>The Law school coordinates a housing resource program through the admissions office. In the spring, accepted students receive a packet that includes information on the Boston housing market, a roommate referral questionnaire, and a schedule for Housing Information Days.</P>

<P>Housing Information Days are conducted in June, July, and August. On these days, law school representatives provide guidance on apartment hunting in Greater Boston, and students have an opportunity to meet potential roommates. Students also may look through binders that list available apartments, apartments with rooms available, and roommate requests.</P>

<P>Because of Boston's large student population, affordable housing is in demand. Students should set aside time during the summer to visit Boston, find a suitable apartment, and sign a lease. The housing resource program serves as an information clearinghouse to aid students in their apartment searches, but students must be prepared to find apartments and make living arrangements on their own.</P>

<BR><BR>
<A NAME= Gen'l>

Admission qualifications and procedures are substantially the same for all
applicants to the full-time day division and the part-time evening division. <BR>The
Special Part-time Program, intended for parents with primary or sole
child rearing responsibilities, requires an additional statement explaining the
applicant's child-care obligations. <P>
The admissions committee, which includes faculty, the director of admissions,
and student representatives, accepts applications between September 15 and June
1 from candidates for admission the following fall. Applications received before
March 15 are generally given priority. Decisions on applications received
between March 15 and June 1 will be made on a space-available basis. Although
the law school does not interview candidates for admission, applicants are
invited to visit the school, tour the facilities, attend classes, and talk with
students and staff. A representative of the admissions office or a current
student is available to take prospective candidates around the school by
appointment.<P>

Admission to New England School of Law is competitive, and the school turns down
many more applicants than it accepts. The acceptance or rejection of an
application for admission is made after careful consideration of several
factors. The committee balances the applicant's undergraduate record and Law
School Admissions Test score with recommendations, proven achievements, and
apparent motivation to study law. Applicants who have not achieved at least a C
(2.0) average in undergraduate work should not apply. Because the committee
examines all facets of an applicant's qualifications, it is impossible to give
tentative appraisals of an applicant's status during the evaluation process.
Policies cover various aspects of the admissions process, as follows: 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="MINORITY">Minority Admissions</A></H3>

The admissions committee attempts to ensure that each
entering class includes students from a wide variety of backgrounds. In recent
years, the representation of racial minority groups within the student body has
increased. It is the policy of New England School of Law to provide equality of
opportunity in legal education for all persons regardless of race, color,
religion, national or ethnic origin, gender, age, handicap or disability, or
sexual orientation. New England School of Law also participates in programs
administered by the Council on Legal Education Opportunity (CLEO), an
organization that offers economically, socially, and educationally disadvantaged
individuals educational and financial support to help them attend law school.

<H3><A NAME="DISABLED">Applicants with Disabilities</H3></a>

 It is the policy and practice of New England
School of Law to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, Section 504 of
the Rehabilitation Act of 1974, and all Massachusetts requirements regarding
students and applicants with disabilities. No qualified individual with a
disability will, because of that disability, be denied access to or
participation in services, programs, or activities at New England School of Law.
Any accepted candidate who may require special accommodations should contact the
Assistant Dean for Students as early as possible.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="FOREIGN">Applicants with Foreign Degrees</A></H3> 

<H4>Applicants with foreign undergraduate degrees. </H4>If an applicant's degree is from
an institution outside the United States (other than in Canada), that degree
must be certified as the equivalent of a baccalaureate degree. Academic analysis
may be obtained from one of the following agencies: World Education Services,
Inc., P.O. Box 745, Old Chelsea Station, New York, NY 10113, telephone: (212)
966-6311, or International Education Research Foundation, Inc., P.O. Box 66940,
Los Angeles, CA 90066, telephone: (310) 390-6276. The certified transcript must
be sent to this school. Foreign applicants must take the LSAT, and if English is
not the applicant's first language or if the undergraduate degree was not
received from an English-speaking institution, the Test of English as a Foreign
Language (TOEFL) must be taken through TOEFL, P.O. Box 6151, Princeton, NJ
08541, telephone: (609) 771-7100.

<H4>Applicants with foreign law degrees.</H4> If an applicant has a law degree from an
institution outside the United States, the applicant may be eligible for
advanced placement into a two-year full-time program or a three-year part-time
program. To qualify for advanced placement, a student with a foreign law degree
must first have all of his or her transcripts analyzed by one of the above
agencies. Requirements concerning the LSAT and TOEFL are the same as for
applicants with foreign undergraduate degrees.


<H3><A NAME="PROCEDURES">Application Procedures</A></H3>
<H4>Application process</H4>
Each applicant must complete and file an application form by the March 15
priority deadline, or the June 1 extended deadline, indicating the program to
which he or she seeks admission. Except in rare cases of economic hardship, a
nonrefundable application fee of $50 must accompany each application. This fee
is for processing only and is not credited toward the tuition of an accepted
student. An applicant who believes he or she may qualify for a fee waiver should
contact the Office of Admissions for details. Application may be made to more
than one program; a $50 application fee must be submitted for each program.
To secure a place in the entering class, an accepted applicant must make a
nonrefundable seat deposit of $150 by the date specified in the acceptance
letter. An additional payment of $350 is required and is usually due about 30
days after the $150 seat deposit. To be eligible for a refund of this second
payment, the student must notify the law school in writing by July 15 of his or
her intention not to enroll. If the student does enroll, both the nonrefundable
$150 seat deposit and the second payment of $350 are credited toward the first
semester's tuition.
Requirements
Before matriculating at New England School of Law, an applicant must have earned
a baccalaureate degree from an accredited U.S. institution or the equivalent
degree from a foreign institution.
Each applicant is required to submit two letters of recommendation, at least one
of which should come, if possible, from a faculty member who taught the
applicant as an undergraduate. An applicant who is not a recent college graduate
may obtain letters of recommendation from employers.
Each applicant also is invited to submit a personal statement. This
supplementary statement should emphasize a particular aspect of the applicant's
background, the applicant's suitability for admission, or the basis of his or
her interest in legal studies.



  <H3><A NAME="TRANSFER">Transfer Admissions</A></H3>

A student who has completed one year of law school may
apply for admission with advanced standing. The student must submit a completed
New England School of Law admissions application and the appropriate application
fee before July 1. A transfer applicant must also submit a copy of the LSDAS
report, a letter of good standing from the dean of his or her current _law
school, one recommendation from a law professor, and a final, complete
transcript from the current law school. More information is available from the
admissions office.<P>



<H3><A NAME="VISITING">Nonmatriculating Visiting Status</A></H3>
 With approval from a student's current law
school, New England School of Law may accept applicants for nonmatriculating
visiting status, based on space availability. The procedure is the same as for
transfer students; in addition, a letter is required from the dean of the
current law school stating any conditions regarding grades, courses, and
minimum/maximum credits that will be transferable.

<H3>Application Procedures</H3>

<H4>Application process</H4>
Each applicant must complete and file an application form by the March 15
priority deadline, or the June 1 extended deadline, indicating the program to
which he or she seeks admission. Except in rare cases of economic hardship, a
nonrefundable application fee of $50 must accompany each application. This fee
is for processing only and is not credited toward the tuition of an accepted
student. An applicant who believes he or she may qualify for a fee waiver should
contact the Office of Admissions for details. Application may be made to more
than one program; a $50 application fee must be submitted for each program.
To secure a place in the entering class, an accepted applicant must make a
nonrefundable seat deposit of $150 by the date specified in the acceptance
letter. An additional payment of $350 is required and is usually due about 30
days after the $150 seat deposit. To be eligible for a refund of this second
payment, the student must notify the law school in writing by July 15 of his or
her intention not to enroll. If the student does enroll, both the nonrefundable
$150 seat deposit and the second payment of $350 are credited toward the first
semester's tuition.<P>
<H4>Requirements</H4>
Before matriculating at New England School of Law, an applicant must have earned
a baccalaureate degree from an accredited U.S. institution or the equivalent
degree from a foreign institution.
Each applicant is required to submit two letters of recommendation, at least one
of which should come, if possible, from a faculty member who taught the
applicant as an undergraduate. An applicant who is not a recent college graduate
may obtain letters of recommendation from employers.
Each applicant also is invited to submit a personal statement. This
supplementary statement should emphasize a particular aspect of the applicant's
background, the applicant's suitability for admission, or the basis of his or
her interest in legal studies.

<P>
 
<H3><A NAME="LSAT">Law School Admissions Test (LSAT)
</A></H3>

Each applicant should take the Law School Admissions Test (LSAT), which is
administered by the Law School Admissions Service (LSAS), no later than February
of the year in which he or she wishes to enroll. The applicant must have taken
the LSAT within the three years before applying for admission. Applicants who
repeat the LSAT tend to receive higher scores on subsequent tests; therefore,
the admissions committee gives more weight to repeat test scores only if they
reflect marked improvement.  


<H3><A NAME="LSDAS">Law School Data Assembly Service</A></H3>The law school will only accept transcripts submitted through the Law School
Data Assembly Service (LSDAS), which analyzes each registrant's transcript(s),
compiles other relevant information on the applicant, and then sends its report
to the law schools indicated on the LSDAS registration. The applicant must
register with the LSDAS, a division of the LSAS. <P>
New England School of Law application forms are included in the back of the print
catalog. Additional information may be obtained by contacting:<BR>Office of
Admissions,<BR> New England School of Law,<BR> 154 Stuart Street, Boston,<BR> MA 02116<BR>
telephone: (617) 422-7210.<P>
Information about the dates and locations of testing sites for the LSAT and
further information about LSDAS may be obtained from: <BR> Law School Admissions
Service (LSAS),<BR> Box 2000,<BR> Newtown, PA 18940<BR> telephone: (215) 968-1001.

<H3><A NAME="TUITION">Tuition and Fees:</A></H3>

Tuition is set each spring for the academic year commencing in the fall. The tuition for the 1996-97 academic year is $13,350 for the day division and $10,010 for the evening division. Students in the Special Part-time Program who are receiving evening residency credit will be charged at the day tuition rate and those receiving evening residency credit will be charged at the evening tuition rate; however, Special Part-time students taking seven credit hours or fewer will be charged the per credit rate of $545.<P>

Each student is charged a $50 incidentals fee, a $50 library fee, and a $50 Student Bar Association (SBA) each year. The SBA fee is used to sponsor student activities and events through the year.<P>

Massachusetts Mandated Student Health Insurance is relatively low-cost insurance required by the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all students carrying at least 75 percent of the course load for full-time students. The cost of this insurance in 1996-97 is $620 for 12 months of coverage. Details are provided with registration materials. Students with comparable coverage under other qualified plans may be exempt, but must submit a waiver form.<P>

The above fees are payable annually with fall registration and are not refundable.<P>

<H4>Payment of tuition and fees</H4>
Tuition and fees are payable in full in advance of each semester (for example, in August for the fall semester and in December for the spring semester). For those students or parents who wish to pay on a deferred payment basis, the law school offers an interest-free installment plan. For further information, contact:<P>

Academic Management Services<BR>
50 Vision Blvd.<BR>
E. Providence, RI 02914<BR>

<P>

Telephone: (800) 531-4300<P>

<P>Installment plan payments usually begin in June or July.</P>

<P>Students who are delinquent in their financial obligations to the school are subject to exclusion from classes or dismissal from school. Matriculation is conditioned on full payment of law school obligations and is subject to cancellation at any time for nonpayment of those obligations. A student may not be permitted to take a final examination if he or she is financially delinquent in the day the examination is scheduled. Transcripts or other certification of a student's status will not be issued for a student whose law school account is in arrears. The law school will assess interest on delinquent balances.</P>

<H3><A NAME="TRANSCRIPT">Transcript Fee</A></H3>

The $3 transcript fee is charged for official copies of a student's transcript.



<H3><A NAME="GRADUATION">Graduation Fee</A></H3>

This $100 fee is assessed each student in his or her final semester.



<H3><A NAME="CAPGOWN">Cap and Gown Fee</A></H3>

The fee for cap and gown rental is announced each spring before graduation.<P>



<H3><A NAME="VISITINGFEE">Fee for Visiting at Another Law School</A></H3> New
England

School of Law students are expected to complete substantially all credit and degree requirements
at this law school. In certain extremely rare circumstances, the Dean may grant approval for a
New England student to complete a semester or an academic year at another ABA-accredited law
school, as a visiting student. Such approval will be granted only if extreme hardship is shown. If
such approval is granted, the student will be relieved of one-half the tuition and fee obligation
owed to New England School of Law for the applicable period away from the law school. The
law school will accept, without the payment of any fee, the transfer of up to six credits earned by
New England students at other law schools accredited by the American Bar Association. Such
credits may be accepted only with the prior written approval of the Associate Dean and may not
be for courses that are required at New England School of Law.<P>  Students who are delinquent
in their financial obligations to the school are subject to exclusion from classes or dismissal from
school. Matriculation is conditioned on full payment of law school obligations and is subject to
cancellation at any time for nonpayment of those obligations. A student will not be permitted to
take a final examination if he or she is financially delinquent on the day the examination is
scheduled. Transcripts or other certification of a student's status will not be issued on behalf of a
student who is indebted to the law school. The law school will assess interest on delinquent
balances.<P>



<H3><A NAME="WITHDRAWAL">Voluntary Withdrawal</A></H3>

A student who chooses to withdraw from law school but wishes to retain the option of
readmission must submit a written request to the Dean for withdrawal without prejudice. A
student's academic standing and the status of his or her account with the Office of the Controller
are the factors that determine whether withdrawal without prejudice will be granted. Refer to the
current Student Handbook of Rules and Regulations for academic requirements relating to
withdrawal and for information on readmission procedures. A request for withdrawal without
prejudice, if approved, will be considered effective as of the date of its receipt in the Office of the
Dean. The Office of the Controller will use that date as the effective date of withdrawal when
determining the status of the student's tuition bill. If a withdrawing student has an unpaid balance
due on his or her tuition bill, the amount due must be paid before a withdrawal without prejudice
will be granted. However, if a withdrawing student has paid more than the required amount due
at the time of withdrawal, he or she may be eligible for a partial refund of tuition. Fees are not
refundable, and tuition refunds will not be granted after the fourth week of the semester. To
determine whether a withdrawing student owes a balance to the law school or is due a refund, the
student's account is accorded a tuition cancellation as per the chart below. Any amount left as
due the school must be paid before a withdrawal without prejudice will be granted. Any surplus
will be refunded to the student or lender in accordance with federal regulations.
<H4>Tuition cancellation is allowed according to the following chart:</H4>

<CENTER><H2><A NAME="FINANCIAL_ASST">Financial
Assistance, 1996</A></H2></CENTER>


The law school offers financial assistance to eligible students in good
standing. While responsibility for funding educational and living costs lies
primarily with the student and his or her family, the law school can assist with
scholarships, grants, low-interest Perkins loans, and work-study programs for
students who demonstrate need. The law school also offers some academic-based
scholarships for students who meet certain criteria.
Financial need is defined as the difference between all of the student's
resources and all expenses. Tuition, fees, books and supplies, and standard
living expenses are all included in determining a student's expense budget.
Students should anticipate that loans will be a significant part of their
financial aid package. Any student who applies for financial assistance should
also apply for a Federal Stafford Loan. The Federal Stafford Loan is the first
level of funding for financial aid applicants. No assistance of any kind will be
offered to a student who is in default or owes a refund on Title IV funds.
Financial aid is awarded by the law school on an annual basis, and students must
apply annually. The deadline for applying for financial aid for an academic year
is usually April 15 of the previous academic year. This deadline applies to
incoming students as well. Do not wait to be accepted by the law school before
applying for financial aid. Aid application materials are available in January
at the Office of Financial Aid. Incoming students interested in financial aid
should submit the request form for financial aid with their admission
applications.
It is essential that any student applying for aid submit accurate required
materials on time. Failure to complete the application process by April 15 or
omissions and errors on materials could jeopardize an applicant's chance of
receiving financial aid. 
<P>
<H4>Application procedure</H4>
The following documents are required to complete an applicant's financial aid
application file:
<DL>
<DT><H4>Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)</H4>
<DD>The FAFSA form is available from the Office of Financial Aid and is required of
all students applying for financial aid. The FAFSA form should be submitted no
later than February 15 to ensure that it is received by the April 15 deadline.
The New England School of Law FAFSA code number is G08916. Students who
submitted a FAFSA in the previous year should receive a renewal application in
December/January. Submission of the renewal FAFSA is recommended for continuing
students.
<BR>
<DT><H4>New England School of Law Financial Aid Application</H4> 
 <DD>The law school's financial aid application, which is included in the financial
aid packet, provides the school with information that supplements the
information from the FAFSA form. 
<DT><H4>Student Income Verification Form</H4> 
<DD>This form is used to verify untaxed income received by the student as well as
the student's tax filing status. Signed federal tax returns, including all
schedules and W2 forms for the most recent year, must be returned with this
form.
<BR> 
<DT>  <H4>Parent Income Verification Form</H4>
<DD>This form is used to collect parent income and asset information. Signed federal
tax returns, including all schedules and W2 forms for the most recent year, must
be returned with this form. Parental information is required of all applicants
applying for institutional (not federal) grant and scholarship funds who are 25
years of age or younger.
<BR>
<DT><H4> Financial Aid Transcript(s)</H4>
<DD>Financial aid transcripts must be submitted from all post-secondary schools the
applicant has attended. These forms are required regardless of whether the
student received or applied for aid at another school.
</DL><P>
To be eligible for Title IV funds, a student who is subject to the Selective
Service Act must complete the Statement of Registration Compliance. In addition,
all financial aid applicants must complete certification of Statements of
Educational Purpose and Non-Default Status to receive funding. The SAR (Student
Aid Report) and New England School of _Law Financial Aid Application include
_the certifications for meeting these requirements.
Financial aid award notices are mailed beginning in March for incoming students
and in May for continuing students. An extension of the due date for the second
tuition deposit ($350) may be granted to new students who have not been notified
of a financial aid decision. Requests for extensions must be made to the
director of admissions

The importance of responsible borrowing cannot be stressed enough. Students who
borrow conservatively may find more flexibility in their future legal employment
options. Financial aid office representatives are available for counseling on

<H3><A NAME="STAFFORD">Federal Stafford Loan Program </A>(formerly Guaranteed
Student Loan Program)</H3>

Most students will be eligible for a subsidized and/or unsubsidized Stafford
loan. Students demonstrating financial need may qualify for up to $8,500 in
subsidized Stafford loan funds for an academic year. The interest for these
loans is subsidized by the federal government. The borrower is not charged
interest until repayment begins, which is usually six months after graduation.
Students who do not qualify for the full amount of a subsidized loan or who need
additional funding may apply for an unsubsidized Federal Stafford loan. The
maximum annual loan amount for an unsubsidized loan is $18,500, less any
subsidized loan amount. Students are responsible for interest payments while
enrolled. However, most lenders offer the option to have the interest accrue and
be capitalized.
These loans are made directly to the student, who is responsible for repayment.
The interest rate for the Federal Stafford Loan is variable. The rate is set in
July and is equal to the 91-day T-Bill rate plus 2.5 percent. The interest rate
for the 1995-96 academic year was 8.25 percent. An origination and guarantee fee
of up to 4 percent is deducted from the loan before disbursement.
To apply for the Federal Stafford Loan, a student must obtain an application
from a lender or bank that participates in the program or from the Office of
Financial Aid. Completed loan applications should be forwarded to the Office of
Financial Aid for processing. Students who plan to use the loan funds to help
pay for tuition should submit the loan application no later than June 1 to avoid
late fees. Approval can take up to six weeks after the loan has been processed
by the Office of Financial Aid. Loans are usually disbursed in two installments,
one for the fall semester and one for the spring semester.


<H3><A NAME="PERKINS">Perkins Loans (Formerly National Direct Student

<H3>Private Loan Programs</H3>

Students not applying for federal aid or those who wish to supplement their
borrowing may choose from the following private lenders. Eligibility is based on
a student's budget, and satisfactory credit is essential for approval.
<H3><A NAME="LAL">Law Access Loan (LAL)</A></H3>
A maximum of $15,000 per year can be borrowed through this program. Repayment
begins six months after graduation or when a student's status drops to less than
half time. Interest payments may be deferred while a student is in school and
capitalized and added to the principal at the time of repayment. The Access
Group also offers the Federal Stafford Loan program; both federal and private
loans are available in collaboration with Society National Bank (Cleveland, OH).
For further information, contact the Access Group at 1-800-282-1550.

<H4>Law Student Loan (LAWLOANS Program, HEMAR Insurance Corp.)</H4>
A maximum of $15,000 per year can be borrowed through this program. Repayment
begins nine months after graduation or when a student's status drops to less
than half time. Interest payments are capitalized at the start of repayment.
LAWLOANS also offers the Federal Stafford Loan program; both federal and private
loans are available in collaboration with Norwest Bank South Dakota, N.A. (Sioux
Falls, SD). For further information, contact LAWLOANS at 1-800-266-5626.


<H3><A NAME="PEP">Professional Education Plan (PEP) Loan</A></H3>


The PEP loan is a private loan sponsored by The Education Resource Institute
(TERI). Students may borrow up to $7,500 per year on their own signature.
Students who apply with a cosigner may apply for up to $20,000 annually. When a
student applies with a cosigner, credit standards require a two-year minimum
credit history as a demonstration of sufficient income to meet current
liabilities. Interest payments can be deferred and capitalized at the time of
repayment. For further information, contact TERI at 1-800-255-TERI.

<H3><A NAME="BEL">Bar Examination Loan (BEL)</A></H3>



Students who need to borrow for bar-related expenses following graduation can
apply for these credit-based loans. The Access Group offers a BEL (Bar Exam
Loan) for up to $5,000. LAWLOANS offers a BSL (Bar Study Loan) for up to $7,500.
Students need not have borrowed previously from either lender.

<H3><A NAME="GETCHELL">Arthur V. Getchell Memorial Grant</A></H3>

Arthur Vinton Getchell was a president of the law school corporation. In his memory, 28
one-quarter or one-half tuition grants are awarded to students who show extraordinary need. Four
of the grants are allotted for each class in both the Day Division and the Evening Division.<P>



<H3><A NAME="LLOYD">Jacqueline G. Lloyd Grant</A></H3>

This grant program is named for a graduate of the law school.

 It is specifically designed to assist students from minority backgrounds. Awards are considered

need.<P>



<H3><A NAME="MACLEAN">Maclean Grant</A></H3> This grant program is named for
the founder of the law school, Arthur W. MacLean. It is specifically designed to assist students
from disadvantaged backgrounds. Awards are considered gift aid that need not be repaid and will
vary in amounts depending on a student's financial need.<P>



<H3><A NAME="NESL_GRANT">New England School of Law Grant</A></H3>

This gift-aid program provides grants in varying amounts to financially needy
students to help offset educational expenses. Priority consideration is given to
students with exceptional financial need.<P>


<H3>Charles Hamilton Houston Scholarships</H3>
A limited number of these full-tuition scholarships have been set aside as part
of the school's Charles Hamilton Houston Enrichment Program. These scholarships
were established in recognition of the special needs often experienced by
students of African-American, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American backgrounds.
Awards are made on a one-time basis to incoming students only.<P>

<H3><A NAME="TRUSTEE">Trustee Academic Scholarships</A></H3>

Ten Trustee Scholarships are awarded each September to the two students in each
class of the day and evening divisions who earned the highest grade-point
average for the previous year at New England School of Law. These half-tuition
scholarships require no application. They are awarded automatically to the
highest ranking students in each class, to be determined at the beginning of
each fall semester.<P>



<H3><A NAME="PRESIDENT">Anna E. Hirsch Scholarships</A></H3>

Several Anna E. Hirsch Scholarships are available to incoming students who show
exceptional academic promise. All students applying for financial aid are
considered for the Anna E. Hirsch scholarships without further application.
Award amounts for the most recent year have been $2,000.<P>

<H3>Outside scholarships</H3>
Students are encouraged to investigate outside sources; the reference section of
local libraries has resources on financial assistance. Students also can check
with employers or civic organizations about scholarships. The Office of
Financial Aid maintains a partial listing of outside scholarships from various
agencies.<P>

<H3><A NAME="WORK_STUDY">Work Programs</A></H3>

This federally funded program enables needy students to earn money by working
part time during the school year and full time during summer vacations. Students
are not eligible for work-study awards until the summer following their first
year of law school. Students who receive work-study awards may work at the law
school or in a law-related position for a public agency or nonprofit
organization. Students receive paychecks twice a month and are permitted to work
until the award has been used in full. The program is very much in demand and
funds are limited, so students are encouraged to apply promptly for financial
aid. Eligibility is determined by the FAFSA.<P>
