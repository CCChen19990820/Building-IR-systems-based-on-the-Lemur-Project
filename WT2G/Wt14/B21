4.5         Thermonuclear Weapon Designs</h3><pre>
Since the various design elements of a thermonuclear weapon combine to form 
a complex integrated system, discussing the design space of these weapons 
involves complicated tradeoffs between design objectives and has many 
possible design variations. 

In an attempt to address this in some kind of orderly fashion I first sketch 
out several basic structures for the overall weapon, in rough order of 
increasing sophistication (Subsection 4.5.1 Principle Design Types). 
Following this, I address a series of possible tradeoffs and the issues 
connected wit each.

</pre><a name="nfaq4.5.1"></a><pre>
4.5.1       Principle Design Types
The descriptions of weapon designs, and the developmental sequence described 
is speculative, but it is consistent with all facts about weapons, weapon 
development programs, and physics of which I am currently aware.

4.5.1.1     Early Designs
The earliest radiation implosion designs seem to have used a single large 
cylindrical chamber encompassing both the primary and cylindrical secondary. 
The casing was hemispherical at one end, where the primary sphere was 
located. The thermonuclear weapon was integral to the bomb casing itself - 
i.e. the ballistic shell of the bomb was the support structure for the 
radiation case, and the physical structure that held the entire 
thermonuclear device together.

Both the US and UK initially used casings made of steel, which were lined 
with lead or lead bismuth alloy to form the radiation case (probably 1-3 cm 
thick). The secondary pusher, which made up the inner wall of the radiation 
channel, was made of either natural uranium or lead (possibly as a lead-
bismuth alloy). Operational bombs probably all used uranium tampers to 
maximize yield, but some test devices were equipped with lead tampers to 
hold down yield and fallout production. A massive radiation shield (uranium 
or lead) was located between the primary and secondary to prevent fuel 
preheating by the thermal radiation flux. A boron neutron shield was used in 
some designs to reduce neutron preheating.

The secondary stage consisted of the exterior pusher/tamper, a standoff gap, 
and a cylinder filled with fusion fuel. Lithium deuteride, highly enriched 
in Li-6, was the preferred fuel for maximum yield but early shortages in 
lithium enrichment capacity lead to the deployment of bombs containing 
partially enriched lithium (40% and 60% Li-6 in the U.S.), or natural 
lithium. Down the axis of the fusion fuel cylinder was a solid (or nearly 
solid) rod of plutonium or HEU for the spark plug.

The design approach of these early bombs followed that of Mike and the test 
devices exploded during Castle: the use of a standoff gap to create the 
necessary gradual compression required a large diameter (Mike was 80 inches 
wide, all of the Castle series devices had diameters from 54 to 61.5 
inches). The rapid energy release from the primary followed by a relatively 
lengthy implosion required a thick casing for radiation containment, making 
the entire bomb very heavy. Mike weighed an anomalous 164,000 pounds, but 
even the Castle devices all weighed in between 23,500 and 40,000 lb.

These early bombs were thus quite massive, and had high yields. The Mk 17 
and Mk 24 (the weaponized version of Castle Romeo, using unenriched lithium 
deuteride) had a diameter of 61.4 inches and a weight of 42,000 lb (yield: 
15-20 megatons). The relatively compact and light Mk 15, whose development 
was completed somewhat later (and used 95% Li-6 deuteride), still had a 
diameter of 34.6 inches and weighed over 7,000 lb (yield: 3.8 megatons). And 
all of these weapons *were* bombs, since no missile could carry them. In 
fact, only the very largest aircraft could carry them - one per plane.

Although the primaries used in these bombs were much improved over early 
fission designs, they were still relatively massive initially. The TX-5 
primary used in the Mike device still weighed in at well over 1000 kg, and 
the comparatively thick tamper and explosive layers delayed the escape of 
both photons and neutrons significantly, by up to 100 nanoseconds.

4.5.1.2     Modular Weapons
During the fifties the diameter of the bomb casing and the primary shrank as 
US and Soviet weapons became more compact, partly driven by improved primary 
designs. Lighter weight megaton-range weapons were desired for greater 
flexibility in the types of aircraft that could carry them, and for 
increased payload. Light weight high yield weapons were especially important 
for the early ICBMs, which had limited payloads, and low accuracy. Only a 
light weight, high yield weapon would give a reasonable chance of destroying 
a designated target when carried by an ICBM. It was also useful if the same 
basic weapon design could be used in different weapon systems (bombs, 
ballistic missiles, cruise missiles, etc.)

This led to a modular approach to the weapon system. Instead of the 
aerodynamic casing of the delivered munition, the electronics, and the 
"physics package" being a single integrated entity - these three things were 
separated. The nuclear warhead proper (the "physics package") was self-
contained, except for a cable connector to the electronics that detonated 
the explosives, and fired the neutron generator. The electronics package was 
separate, and could be different for each type of weapon (especially 
important for the varying fuzing requirements). These two components could 
then be fitted into different bomb or missile bodies to create multiple 
types of deployable systems.

Since the warhead casing no longer needed to withstand the environmental 
rigors of the completed weapon, it could be made out of lighter and less 
rugged materials. This led to the use of a light casing (aluminum alloy, or 
even plastic) that was lined with a high-Z material to form a radiation 
case.

4.5.1.3     Compact Light Weight Designs
More efficient implosion systems and the advent of boosting made primaries 
more compact and less massive without sacrificing yield of efficiency. At 
this point (which occurred in the U.S. around 1955-1956), there seem to have 
been different development paths available.

One path followed the existing design principles, harnessing the increased 
temperatures and pressures generated by boosted light weight primaries 
through greater radiation confinement by increasing the thickness of the 
radiation case at the primary end. This evolved into a separate radiation 
case for the primary, a spherical shell of uranium (for example) surrounding 
the high explosive shell of the implosion system, with an aperture for 
releasing the radiation into the secondary radiation chamber (the chamber 
made by lining the external casing). The energy absorbed by the primary case 
wall at a high temperature was reradiated as the temperature in the chamber 
dropped. This made confinement and channeling of the thermal radiation more 
effective. Baffles or other barriers could be added to modulate the energy 
transfer into the secondary radiation case.

It appears that an alternate path may have been followed by the US starting 
with the Hardtack I test series (although possibly first pioneered in 
Redwing). According to statements made by LLNL scientists Wood and Nuckolls, 
and LASL Director Bradbury, new design ideas were introduced at this time 
that extended the Teller-Ulam concept. This coincides with the development 
of the very light W-47 warhead for the Polaris missile (600 lb weight and 
600 Kt yield, later increased to 800 Kt). I speculate that the design 
approach introduced here was the use of modulated primary energy release.

4.5.1.4     Two Chamber Designs
At some point, the development trend toward a separate radiation case around 
the primary lead to a full two chamber design for the weapon, with some 
means of regulating radiation flow between the chambers (like a temporary 
radiation barrier). With better control over the radiation flux around the 
secondary, a reduced standoff with a reduced secondary diameter (and perhaps 
a lighter pusher/tamper) became possible.

This could also be conveniently combined with a spherical secondary design. 
This has been described as the "peanut design" - two spherical hollow 
chambers joined at the waist, with a primary sphere in one, and a spherical 
sphere in the other.  Alternatively, a two chamber - spherical secondary 
design can be used with a modulated primary.

This approach offers the inherent advantages of spherical implosion - a 
smaller radius change for compression in 3-dimensions to attain a given 
density compared to two. Smaller radius change translates directly into 
faster implosion, an important consideration in a smaller, lighter, higher 
pressure weapon design which would be prone to disassemble faster.

In a spherical secondary the radiation shield between the primary and 
secondary would evolve into a baffle between the two chamber to prevent the 
primary from directly (and thus unevenly) heating the side of the secondary 
facing it, forcing the radiation flux to diffuse into the channel around the 
secondary.

The primary in a two-chamber design may be effectively encased in a heavy, 
close fitting uranium shell that can act as an implosion tamper. By trapping 
the explosive gases, this shell can act as the wall of a spherical piston, 
forcing the expanding gases to transfer all of their energy to the inward 
moving beryllium/plutonium shell, and minimizing the amount of explosive 
required. Such a primary may use a thin uranium or tungsten tamper between 
the beryllium and plutonium shell layers to enhance inertial confinement of 
the fissile mass.

4.5.1.5     Hollow Shell Designs
It was pointed out earlier that it is difficult to efficiently compress more 
than the outermost layers of a solid cylindrical or spherical fuel mass. In 
any case, only the outermost layers actually *need* to be compressed, since 
they contain the lion's share of the fuel mass. It would be logical then to 
dispense with the idea of using a solid fuel mass in the center, and only 
use a hollow shell of fuel in the first place. A hollow spark plug shell 
could be nested directly inside the fuel shell, but a second tamper layer 
may be included between the two.

A hollow shell could be used with either a cylindrical secondary (making it 
"totally tubular"), or with a spherical design.

Several advantages are obtained with this approach.

The fuel near the center that would be inefficiently compressed is 
eliminated, improving overall fuel utilization.

The addition of the dense second tamper or spark plug on the inner side of 
the fuel layer can also directly enhance compression. Whenever a shock 
reaches the inner side of the fuel, it will be reflected back into the fuel 
at higher pressure, compressing the fuel further. If the compression 
gradient is continuous, it will tend to "pile up" at the inner interface, 
with the same effect of compression enhancement. The dense inertial tamper 
on the inner side of the fuel layer will also help keep it at a constant 
high density.

Finally, the hollow shell design allows the spark plug to accelerate to very 
high velocities before it goes critical. The implosion velocity at 
criticality could be even higher than the average maximum implosion velocity 
for the secondary, due to the effects of thick shell collapse and 
convergence. An implosion velocity exceeding 1000 km/sec is conceivable. 
This is so fast that densities much higher than those achieved by high 
explosive systems would be attained before energy production from fission 
becomes high enough to halt implosion. Even relatively small masses of 
fissile material (<1 kg) could be fissioned efficiently.

Hollow shell secondaries would be essential for use with primaries that rely 
on modulated energy release to create efficient compression.

4.5.1.4     High Yield and Multiple Staged Designs
The first thermonuclear devices were high yield by most any standard (10.4 
Mt for Ivy Mike, 15 Mt for Castle Bravo). But they were also very heavy, and 
difficult to push to even greater yields. High yield weapons with greater 
yield-to-weight ratios, providing even higher yields in deliverable packages 
were desired. 

As a rough approximation, we can say that the amount of energy required to 
implode a secondary is proportional to its mass, since the primary 
energy/secondary mass ratio defines the achievable implosion velocity. The 
yield of the secondary should also be roughly proportional to its mass. Thus 
there is a roughly proportional relationship between the primary and 
secondary yields, using similar design principles.

From available data (based on known trigger tests, and fizzles where only 
the primary fired), it appears that this range can be from 10-200, with 30-
50 being more typical ratios.

If a very large yield is desired, then we must obviously have a very large 
primary. Large fission primaries are expensive, heavy, and potentially 
dangerous (due to the large amount of fissile material present). Even in 
very heavy weapons, the yield of the primary is limited to no more than a 
few hundred kilotons, limiting total yield to a maximum of 10-20 megatons.

The high yield designs actually developed (mostly in the fifties and early 
sixties) seem to have used refined versions of the basic thermonuclear 
weapon design approach, as described above, with the addition of multiple 
staging to achieve even higher yields. The relatively light weight W-53 9 Mt 
warhead/bomb deployed by the US (still in service!), was one of the highest 
yield warheads the US ever deployed, and probably is a 3 stage weapon.

This is really large enough for almost any conceivable destructive use 
(except maybe blowing up asteroids). Nonetheless, military requirements for 
even larger weapons have been drafted, and in the case of the Soviet Union, 
actually built, tested, and deployed. At one point in the mid-fifties the US 
military requested a 60 megaton bomb! This military "requirement" was 
apparently driven by the fact that this was the highest yield device that 
could be delivered by existing aircraft. The Soviets eventually went on to 
develop a 100+ megaton design (tested in a 50 megaton configuration). To 
make such megaweapons, a bigger driving explosion is required to implode the 
main fusion stage. This has led to the design of three stage weapons, where 
a thermonuclear secondary is the main driving force to implode a gigantic 
tertiary stage.

Building gargantuan bombs is not the only motivation for adopting three 
stage weapons however. If the fusion neutrons are not harnessed to cause 
fission in the tamper (either because the bomb is intended to be very clean, 
or very dirty) then the ratio in yields between stages is correspondingly 
reduced - to a range of something like 10 to 15. This limits the practical 
maximum yield to 3 to 5 megatons. It may be doubted whether even this is 
much of a limitation since out of a current arsenal of over 10000 warheads, 
the US only has 50 bombs with yields over 3 megatons. In the fifties however 
this seemed unacceptably small, so "clean" weapons were deemed to require 
three stage design.

Three stage design can provide other advantages though. By offering the 
weapon designer additional freedom in design, it may be useful even if the 
bomb is not especially large, clean, or dirty. For example, in optimizing a 
weapon to minimize weight for a given yield, a designer can consider which 
type of driver for the main stage is the lightest - a large fission primary 
or a compact two stage device. If weapon-grade fissile material is very 
precious, then a two-stage driver might be chosen simply to minimize the 
over utilization of this material.

In a three stage weapon the radiation cases for the secondary and tertiary 
might be kept separate initially. The primary would implode the secondary 
but a barrier would prevent energy from reaching the tertiary. This barrier 
could be designed to ablate away during the secondary implosion, so that 
when the secondary energy release occurred, it would have become 
transparent.

Alternatively it may be useful to harness a portion of the primary's energy 
to create an initial weak compression shock in the tertiary to enhance 
compression efficiency.

4.5.2       "Dirty" and "Clean" Weapons
Whether to make a fission-fusion weapon into a fission-fusion-fission weapon 
is one of the most basic design issues. A fission-fusion weapon uses an 
inert (or non-fissionable) tamper and will obtain most of its yield from the 
fusion reaction directly. A fission-fusion-fission weapon will obtain at 
least half of its yield (and often far more) from the fusion neutron induced 
fission of a fissionable tamper.

The basic advantage of a fission-fusion-fission weapon is that energy is 
extracted from a tamper which is otherwise deadweight as far as energy 
production in concerned. The tamper has to be there, so a lighter weapon for 
a given yield (or a more powerful weapon for the same weight) can be 
obtained without varying any other design factors. Since it is possible to 
do this at virtually no added cost or other penalty, compared to an inert 
material like lead, by using natural or depleted uranium or thorium there is 
basically no reason not to do it if the designer is simply interested in 
making big explosions.

Fission of course produces radioactive debris - fallout. Fallout can be 
reduced by using a material that does not become highly radioactive when 
bombarded by neutrons (like lead or tungsten). This requires a heavier and 
more expensive weapon to produce a given yield, but is also considerably 
reduces the short and long term contamination associated with that yield. 

This is not to say that the weapon is "clean" in any commonsense meaning of 
the term. Neutrons escaping the weapon can still produce biohazardous 
carbon-14 through nitrogen capture in the air. The primary and spark plug 
may still contribute 10-20% fission, which for a multi-megaton weapon may 
still be a megaton or more of fission. Significant contamination may also 
occur from the "inert" tamper radioisotopes, and even from the unburned 
tritium produced in the fusion stage. Reducing these contributions to the 
lowest possible level is the realm of "minimum residual radiation" designs 
discussed further below. 

During the fifties interest in both the US and USSR was given to developing 
basic design that had both clean and dirty variants. The basic design tried 
to minimize the essential fission yield by using a small fission primary, 
and spark plug sizes carefully chosen to meet ignition requirements for each 
stage, without being excessive (note that although only part of the spark 
plug will fission to ignite the fusion stage, the essentially complete 
fission of the remainder by fusion neutrons is inevitable). These weapons 
appear to have all been three-stage weapons to allow multi-megaton yields 
(even in the clean version) with a relatively small primary. The dirty 
version might simply replace the inert tamper of the tertiary with a 
fissionable one to boost yield.

The three-stage Bassoon and Bassoon Prime devices tested in Redwing Zuni (27 
May 1956, 3.5 Mt, 15% fission) and Redwing Tewa (20 July 1956, 5 Mt, 87% 
fission) are US tests of this concept. Clearly though, the second test was 
not simply a copy of the first with a different tamper. The fusion yield 
dropped from 3 Mt to 0.65 Mt, and the device weight increased from 5500 kg 
to 7149 kg between the two tests. The inference can be made that the 
tertiary in the first used a large volume of relatively expensive (but 
light) Li-6D in a thin tamper, which was replaced by a heavier, cheaper 
tertiary using less fusion fuel, but a very thick fissionable tamper to 
capture as many neutrons as possible.

The 50 Mt three stage Tsar Bomba (King of Bombs) tested by the Soviet Union 
on 30 October 1961 was the largest and cleanest bomb ever tested, with 97% 
of its yield coming from fusion (fission yield approximately 1.5 Mt). 
Assuming a primary of 250 Kt (to keep the fissile content relatively low for 
safety reasons), we might postulate secondary and tertiary stages of 3.5 Mt 
and 46 Mt respectively. This fusion stages would require 1700 kg of Li6D (at 
50% fusion efficiency), and something like 250 Kt of fission for reliable 
ignition. If the initial spark plug firings were 25% efficient, later 
fission would release another 750 Kt - placing the total at 1.25 Mt (close 
enough to the claimed parameters to match within the limits of accuracy).

This was a design though for a 100-150 Mt weapon! A lead tamper was used in 
the tested device, which could have been replaced with U-238 for the dirty 
version (thankfully never tested!).

4.5.3       Maximum Yield/Weight Ratio
Except for safety, the weight of a weapon required to provide a given yield 
is the most important design criterion. In the years since the first nuclear 
weapon was exploded, far more money has been spent in building nuclear 
weapon delivery systems than in the weapons themselves. The high cost of 
delivery for what is basically a rather small package is due to the fact 
that nuclear delivery systems are generally intended to be used only once. 
Clearly this is true for missiles, but it is true for bombers as well since 
recovery and reuse is not part of their nuclear mission profile.

Since the cost of the delivery vehicle is much greater than the cost of the 
warhead, making the warhead as light as possible for the intended yield 
quickly came to dominate the weapon design process. this is normally 
expressed in terms of the yield-to-weight (YTW) ratio (Kt/kg). 

Naturally it is easier to get a high ratio for a larger bomb. The highest 
ratio for any warhead in the US arsenal is the 9 Mt Mk-53/B-53 bomb, which 
happens to be the oldest weapon in service (operational since 1962), but 
also the largest. At 4000 kg, it has a ratio of 2.25 Kt/kg. The Tsar Bomba, 
as tested, had a ratio of 1.7 Kt/kg (its weight was 30 tonnes). As 
*designed* it had a ratio of 3.4-5 Kt/kg!

Table 4.5.3-1. Yield-to-Weight Ratios of Current US Weapons
Weapon  YTW Ratio Yield(Kt)/Weight(kg) In Service Date
Mk-53      2.25        9000/4000         1962
W-88       1.5          475/330
W-80       1.31         170/130
B-83       1.10        1200/1090
W-87       1.0          300/300
W-78       0.96         335/350
W-76       0.61         100/165

The much earlier W-47 warhead seems to have achieved ratios of 2.2-2.7 
Kt/kg. However YTW ratio is no every thing. The W-87 and W-88 are said to 
use reduced amounts of expensive nuclear materials (deemed important when 
ambitious expansion of the US nuclear arsenal was planned in the early 
eighties) which, coupled with the much larger payloads of the MX and trident 
II missiles, may account for the reduced (but still quite respectable) YTW 
ratios of these warheads.

Part of optimizing the YTW ratio is careful weight management. Very light 
weight primaries, the use of light weight weapon cases, and multiple 
radiation cases are innovations to minimize weight. Since the tamper is one 
of the heaviest parts of the weapon, squeezing as much energy out of this is 
very important too.

The end of surface testing of nuclear weapons after the atmospheric test ban 
treaty effectively removed "cleanliness" as a significant concern for 
designers. Complaints about fall-out vanished, and so did the ability of the 
international community to monitor weapon design through fall-out analysis. 
The cost-effectiveness of lighter weapons put great pressure on designers to 
extract weight saving however they could, and it is likely idea about using 
non-fissile tampers disappeared very quickly. There is scant evidence that 
so-called "clean" designs were ever deployed.

The fission yield of the tamper can be increased even further by adding 
slow-neutron fissionable material to it. Basically this means using enriched 
uranium instead of natural or depleted uranium. 

Highly enriched uranium is definitely known to be used in U.S. weapons. 
About half of the U.S. inventory of weapons-associated HEU is less than 
"weapons grade" (<93.4% that is). The probable use of most or all of this 
uranium (generally with an enrichment of 20-80%) was in thermonuclear weapon 
tampers.

The W-87 Peacekeeper warhead (to be redeployed on the Minuteman-III) has a 
current yield of 300 Kt, that can be increased to 475 Kt by adding a HEU 
sleeve or rings to the secondary. Whether this represents an actual addition 
to the existing secondary, or whether it replaces an existing unenriched 
sleeve is not known. The W-88 Trident warhead is a closely related design, 
and has a current yield of 475 Kt indicating that it is already equipped 
with this addition. The 175 Kt yield difference amounts to the complete 
fission of 10 kg of U-235.

Now, once one considers using substantial amounts of HEU in the secondary, 
the question of why the fusion fuel is needed at all arises. The answer: it 
probably is not essential. The idea of imploding fissile material is what 
set Stanislaw Ulam on the path to that led eventually to thermonuclear 
weapons. But with the availability of large amounts of HEU, and the trend 
toward smaller weapon yields (compared to the multimegaton behemoths of the 
fifties), the Ulam's idea of using radiation implosion to create a light 
weight high-efficiency pure fission weapon returns as a viable possibility. 
It is an interesting question whether all modern strategic nuclear weapons 
*are* in fact thermonuclear devices!

4.5.4       Minimum Residual Radiation (MRR or "Clean") Designs
It has been pointed out elsewhere in this FAQ that ordinary fission-fusion-
fission bombs (nominally 50% fission yield) are so dirty that they merit 
consideration as radiological weapons. Simply using a non-fissile tamper to 
reduce the fission yield to 5% or so helps considerably, but certainly does 
not result in an especially clean weapon by itself. If minimization of 
fallout and other sources of residual radiation is desired then considerably 
more effort needs to be put into design. 

Minimum residual radiation designs are especially important for "peaceful 
nuclear explosions" (PNEs). If a nuclear explosive is to be useful for any 
civilian purpose, all sources of residual radiation must be reduced to the 
absolute lowest levels technologically possible. This means elimination 
neutron activation of bomb components, of materials outside the bomb, and 
reducing the fissile content to the smallest possible level. It may also be 
desirable to minimize the use of relatively hazardous materials like 
plutonium.

The problems of minimizing fissile yield and eliminating neutron activation 
are the most important. Clearly any MRR, even a small one, must be primarily 
a fusion device. The "clean" devices tested in the fifties and early sixties 
were primarily high yield strategic three-stage systems. For most uses (even 
military ones) these weapons are not suitable. Developing smaller yields 
with a low fissile content requires considerable design sophistication - 
small light primaries so that the low yields still produce useful radiation 
fluxes and high-burnup secondary designs to give a good fusion output. 

Minimizing neutron activation form the abundant fusion neutrons is a serious 
problem since many materials inside and outside the bomb can produce 
hazardous activation products. The best way of avoiding this is too prevent 
the neutrons from getting far from the secondary. This requires using an 
efficient clean neutron absorber, i.e. boron-10. Ideally this should be 
incorporated directly into the fuel or as a lining of the fuel capsule to 
prevent activation of the tamper. Boron shielding of the bomb case, and the 
primary may be useful also.

It may be feasible to eliminate the fissile spark plug of a MRR secondary by 
using a centrally located deuterium-tritium spark plug similar to the way 
ICF capsules are ignited. Fusion bombs unavoidably produce tritium as a by-
product, which can be a nuisance in PNEs.

Despite efforts to minimize radiation releases, PNEs have largely been 
discredited as a cost-saving civilian technology. Generally speaking, MRR 
devices still produce excessive radiation levels by civilian standards 
making their use impractical. 

MRRs may have military utility as a tactical weapon, since residual 
contamination is slight. Such weapons are more costly and have lower 
performance of course. 

This leads to another reason why PNEs have lost their attractiveness - there 
is no way to make a PNE device unsuitable for weapons use. "Peaceful" use of 
nuclear explosives inherently provides opportunity to develop weapons 
technology. As the saying goes, "the only difference between a PNE and a 
bomb is the tail fins".

4.5.5       Radiological Weapon Designs
This is the opposite extreme of an MRR. Earlier several tamper materials 
were described that could be used to tailor the radioactive contamination 
produced by a nuclear explosion - tantalum, cobalt, zinc, and gold. Uranium 
tampers produce contamination in abundance - but quite a lot of energy too. 
In some applications it may be desired that the ratio of contamination to 
explosive force be increased, or tailored to a narrower spectrum of decay 
times compared to fission by-products.

Practical radiological weapons must incorporate the precursor isotope 
directly into the secondary. This is because the high compression of the 
secondary allows the use of reasonable masses of precursor material. In an 
uncompressed state, the thickness of most materials required to capture a 
substantial percentage of neutrons is 10-20 cm, leading to a very massive 
bomb. A layer of 1 cm or less will do as well when compressed by radiation 
implosion.

Some radioisotopes that would be very attractive for certain applications 
are difficult to produce in a weapon. A case in point is sodium-24, an 
extremely prolific producer of energetic gammas with a half-life of 14.98 
hours. This isotope produces a remarkable 5.515 MeV of decay energy, with 
two hard gammas per decay (2.754 MeV and 1.369 MeV) and might be desired for 
very short-lived radiation barriers. The most obvious precursor, natural Na-
23, has a minuscule capture cross section for neutrons in the KeV range 
(although it is a significant hazard from induced radioactivity in soil 
after low altitude nuclear detonations). The best for  precursor candidate 
for Na-24 is probably magnesium-24 (78.70% of natural magnesium) through an 
n,p reaction.

4.6.1        Weapon Safety
Due to their enormous destructive power, it is extremely important to ensure 
that nuclear weapons cannot explode at either their full yield, or at 
reduced yield, unless stringent and carefully specified conditions are met.

Weapons must be protected from:
* malicious tampering,
* human error,
* component or systems failure (either inside or outside the weapon),
and
* accidental damage.

To meet these requirements elaborate provisions for weapon safety are 
required. This issue has been of major concern since the first nuclear 
weapons, and many of the major advances in weapon design are related to 
weapon safety.

Weapons are invariably designed with a series of disabling mechanisms, all 
of which must be successfully overridden before an explosion can occur. 
These include locking mechanisms requiring special keys or codes, redundant 
safeties that must be removed to arm the weapon, environmental sensing 
switches (disabling mechanisms that are overridden only when the weapon has 
experienced environmental conditions and stresses expected during 
operational employment), and sophisticated fuzing systems to detonate the 
device at the proper place and time. Often these multiple safety systems 
require cooperation by more than one person to complete weapon arming.

Scenarios that must be addressed include:
* inappropriate activation of the weapon's firing system,
and
* detonation of the high explosives by means other than the firing system 
(e.g. physical damage through fire or impact).

<h2>1.0     Types of Nuclear Weapons</h2><pre>
Nuclear weapons can be grouped into different classes based on the nuclear 
reactions that provide their destructive energy, and on the details of their 
design. The popular division of nuclear weapons into fission bombs and 
fusion bombs is not entirely satisfactory. The spectrum of weapon design is 
more complex than this simple classification implies. All nuclear weapons so 
far invented require fission to initiate the explosive release of energy. 
Weapons that incorporate fusion fuel can do so in various ways, with 
different intended effects. This section attempts to survey the basic types 
of bomb designs systematically. More detailed discussions of the physics and 
design principles of each type will be covered in more detail in later 
sections.

<HR><a name=nfaq1.1></a><h3>
1.1     Terminology</h3><pre>
A variety of names are used for weapons that release energy through nuclear 
reactions - atomic bombs (A-bombs), hydrogen bombs (H-bombs), nuclear 
weapons, fission bombs, fusion bombs, thermonuclear weapons (not to mention 
"physics package" and "device"). A few comments about terminology is 
probably in order. 

The earliest name for such a weapon appears to be "atomic bomb". This has 
been criticized as a misnomer since all chemical explosives generate energy 
from reactions between atoms - that is, between intact atoms consisting of 
both the atomic nucleus and electron shells. Further the fission weapon to 
which "atomic bomb" is applied is no more "atomic" than fusion weapons are. 
However the name is firmly attached to the pure fission weapon, and well 
accepted by historians, the public, and by the scientists who created the 
first nuclear weapons.

Since the distinguishing feature of both fission and fusion weapons is that 
they release energy from transformations of the atomic nucleus, the best 
general term for all types of these explosive devices is "nuclear weapon" 
(hence the name of this FAQ).  

Fusion weapons are called "hydrogen bombs" (H-bombs) because isotopes of 
hydrogen are principal components of the nuclear reactions involved. In 
fact, in the earliest fusion bomb designs deuterium (hydrogen-2) was the 
sole fusion fuel. Fusion weapons are called "thermonuclear weapons" because 
high temperatures are required for the fusion reactions to occur.

1.2       Nuclear Test Names</h3><pre>
Before discussing U.S. nuclear tests, the designation system used to 
identify the tests and each bomb that is tested should be clarified. Each 
test bomb has a code name that identifies it, the actual test has another 
code name. Thus the first atomic bomb was called Gadget, and it was tested 
in operation Trinity.

The early test operations were conducted as part of a test series, a large 
scale operation where many scientists, support technicians, military 
personnel, etc. assemble in order to set off and observe a number of devices 
over several weeks or months. This test series has another code name. For 
example the second and third test explosions of nuclear weapons (which were 
the fourth and fifth nuclear explosions of course) were part of the 
Crossroads test series. The two tests were designated Able and Baker. 
Sometimes the U.S. conducted two sequences of tests for different purposes 
jointly as a single series. When this occurred the name for each sequence 
was combined to form the name of the entire series (e.g. Tumbler-Snapper).

In the early test series, the same test names were reused several times. 
Thus there was an Able test in the Crossroads, Ranger, Buster-Jangle, and 
Tumbler-Snapper test series. To unambiguously identify each test the 
convention is to list the series code name, followed by the test name: 
Crossroads Able, Ranger Able, and so on. After mid-1952 unique test names 
began to be used, so that this convention was no longer strictly necessary. 
However it is useful to specify the series as well, so this FAQ makes the 
practice of identifying all tests by the series-test combination.

After 1961 the test series system was dropped as underground testing in 
Nevada became routine, all of which are usually considered part of the 
Nevada Series. Actually these tests are also designated as being part of 
specific test series, but now each "series" simply corresponds to a 
government fiscal year (Operation Niblick is FY64, Operation Whetstone is 
FY65, etc.) and loses any real meaning. There was a final series of open air 
testing in the Pacific (the Pacific Series: Dominic I and Dominic II)in 
1962, and a few special test programs (Plowshare, Vela Uniform Seismic 
Detonation). I have adopted the practice of identifying all Nevada Series 
tests after 1961, and all tests after 1963 simply by their test names. 

The code names of the actual devices are generally not well known. Many 
remained classified until recently (or still are). Since a bomb can only be 
tested once, identifying the device by the test in which it was detonated is 
unambiguous. In the open literature the test name has usually been used to 
designate the bomb that was tested, a convention followed here as well.

British tests follow a similar nomenclature but are not as systematic. 
Except for the first test (Hurricane), each test has both a series and test 
identifier. Sometimes the test identifier alone is unique, sometimes not. A 
variety of test series qualifiers may be attached to the series name 
(different from the actual test name), but the pattern for doing so is 
unclear. For example the Grapple series included the test Grapple 1/Short 
Granite (with Grapple 1 by itself uniquely identifying the test), but 
multiple tests all with the series designation Grapple Z. As with U.S. 
tests, both full series and test name designations will be given.
</pre>

<HR><a name=nfaq1.3></a><h3>
1.3    Units of Measurement</h3><pre>
A continuing source of confusion with nuclear weapons is the meaning of the 
word "ton". Normally this is used as a unit of mass or weight (a distinction 
I am going to ignore) in either the Metric, British Imperial, or U.S. 
Customary measurement systems (the last two both having two types of tons, 
short and long). In connection with nuclear weapons the term "ton" and its 
metric extensions (kiloton, megaton, etc.) are also used as units of 
explosive energy output or yield.

A non-standard convention sometimes employed to distinguish metric tons from 
short tons is to use the abbreviation MT (or Mt, or mt) for "metric ton". 
However MT (or Mt, or mt) is also used for "megaton". 

In this FAQ I use the metric system almost exclusively, and find it 
inconvenient to use metric ton every time I refer to mass. Instead I have 
borrowed a convention from the usage in Commonwealth countries, and call a 
metric ton a "tonne". Ordinarily I will use "ton" to refer to the U.S. or 
British short ton, but it may also be used for the yield of small 
explosions.

Now the units of explosive energy (megatons, kilotons, or even just tons, 
depending on yield) are derived from attempts to compare the explosive force 
of a bomb to conventional explosives, the original intention was to equate 
it with tons of trinitrotoluene (TNT) - a workhorse military explosive. This 
presented problems very quickly. To which tons does the comparison refer? 
And the explosive force of TNT is not exactly a universal constant. The 
energy release is affected by such things as charge density, degree of 
confinement, and temperature. Energy outputs ranging over 980-1100 
calories/g are reported.  

To clarify the situation kilotons (megatons, etc.) were redefined to be a 
metric unit equal to exactly 10^12 calories (4.186x10^12 joules). Thus 
treating kilotons as a metric mass measurement (kilotonnes) of TNT gives a 
value of 1000 c/g, well within the reported range, while treating it as 
"kilo short tons of TNT" gives 1102 c/g, at the extreme upper end of the 
reported range. Thus a kiloton can be called a "kilo metric ton of TNT" and 
a "kilo short ton of TNT" with about equal validity.

Note that the metric definition of kiloton refers to ALL of the energy  
immediately released by the device, regardless of form. Although chemical 
explosives release essentially all of their energy as kinetic or blast 
energy, only part of the energy in a nuclear explosion is released in this 
form (though under most conditions, it is the major part). Thus a kiloton 
nuclear explosion actually has significantly less blast effect than a 
kiloton chemical explosion.

The proper capitalization of the abbreviations for kiloton and megaton is 
also non-standard. Kt, kt, kT, and KT can all be found in the literature 
(the authoritative _Effects of Nuclear Weapons_ avoids the issue by never 
abbreviating these terms). For no particular reason I use the abbreviations 
Kt and Mt for kiloton and megaton.
</pre>

<HR><a name=nfaq1.4></a><h3>
1.4    Pure Fission Weapons</h3><pre>
These are weapons that only use fission reactions as a source of energy. 
Fission bombs operate by rapidly assembling a subcritical configuration of 
fissionable material into one that is highly supercritical. The original 
atomic bombs tested in 16 July 1945 (device name: Gadget, test name: 
Trinity) and dropped on Japan in 6 August (Little Boy, over Hiroshima) and 9 
August (Fat Man, over Nagasaki) 1945 were pure fission weapons. 

There are practical limits to the size of pure fission bombs. Larger bombs 
require more fissionable material, which 1) becomes increasingly difficult 
to maintain as a subcritical mass before detonation and 2) makes it harder 
to assemble into a high efficiency supercritical mass before stray neutrons 
cause predetonation. Due to secrecy, and the boosting issue described below, 
it is somewhat difficult to identify the largest pure fission bomb ever 
tested for certain. It appears to have been the 500 Kt Ivy King test by the 
US (15 November 1952). The device exploded in this test was the Mk 18 Super 
Oralloy Bomb (SOB) design by a team led by Ted Taylor.
</pre>

<HR><a name=nfaq1.5></a><h3>
1.5     Combined Fission/Fusion Weapons</h3><pre>
All nuclear weapons that are not pure fission weapons use fusion reactions 
to enhance their destructive effects. All weapons that use fusion require a 
fission bomb to provide the energy to initiate the fusion reactions. This 
does not necessarily mean that fusion generates a significant amount of the 
explosive energy, or that explosive force is even the desired effect.

1.5.1   Boosted Fission Weapons
The earliest application of fusion to useful weapons was the development of 
boosted fission weapons. In these weapons several grams of a 
deuterium/tritium gas mixture are included in the center of the fissionable 
core. When the bomb core undergoes enough fission, it becomes hot enough to 
ignite the D-T fusion reaction which proceeds swiftly. This reaction 
produces an intense burst of high-energy neutrons that causes a 
correspondingly intense burst of fissions in the core. This greatly 
accelerates the fission rate in the core, thus allowing a much higher 
percentage of the material in the core to fission before it blows apart. 
Typically no more than about 20% of the material in an average size pure 
fission bomb will split before the reaction ends (it can be much lower, the 
Hiroshima bomb was 1.4% efficient). By accelerating the fission process a 
boosted fission bomb can raise this to as much as 50% (an unboosted 20 Kt 
bomb can thus become a 40 Kt bomb). The actual amount of energy released by 
the fusion reaction is negligible, about 1% of the bomb's yield, making 
boosted bomb tests difficult to distinguish from pure fission tests 
(detecting traces of tritium is about the only way). The first boosted 
weapon test was Greenhouse Item (45.5 Kt, 24 May 1954), an oralloy design 
exploded on island Janet at Enewetok.

Due to the marked increase in yield (as well as other reasons) today most 
fission bombs are boosted, including those used as triggers in true fission-
fusion weapons. Boosting can multiply the yield of fission bombs, but still 
has the same fundamental fission bomb design problems for high yield 
designs. The boosting technique is most valuable in small light-weight bombs 
that would otherwise have low efficiency. Tritium is a very expensive 
material to make, and it decays at a rate of 5.5% per year, but the small 
amounts required for boosting make its use economical.

1.5.2  Staged Fission-Fusion and Fission-Fusion-Fission Weapons
These weapons use fusion reactions involving isotopes of light elements 
(e.g. hydrogen and lithium) to remove the yield limits of fission and 
boosted fission designs, to reduce weapon cost by reducing the amount of 
costly enriched uranium or plutonium required for a given yield, and to 
reduce the weight of the bomb. The fusion reactions occur in a package of 
fusion fuel ("the secondary") that is physically separate from the fission 
trigger ("the primary"), thus creating a two-stage bomb (the fission trigger 
counting as the first stage). X-rays from the primary are used to compress 
the secondary through a process known as radiation implosion. The secondary 
is then ignited by a fission "spark plug" in its center. The energy produced 
by the fusion second stage can be used to ignite an even larger fusion third 
stage. Multiple staging allows in principle the creation of bombs of 
virtually unlimited size.

The fusion reactions are used to boost the yield in two ways:
1) By directly releasing a large amount of energy in fusion reactions;
2) By using high-energy or "fast" neutrons generated by fusion to release 
energy through fissioning of a fissionable jacket around the fusion stage. 
This jacket is often made of natural or depleted uranium, so that energy is 
produced by fast fission of cheap U-238. Thorium may also be used for this 
purpose, and weapons were there is a premium on weight may even use 
moderately enriched uranium.

Bombs that release a significant amount of energy directly by fusion, but do 
not use fusion neutrons to fission the fusion stage jacket, are called 
Fission-Fusion weapons. If they employ the additional step of jacket 
fissioning using fusion neutrons they are called Fission-Fusion-Fission 
weapons.

Bombs that are billed as "clean" bombs (a relative term) obtain a large 
majority of their total yield from fusion. The last and largest stage of 
these bombs is always a pure fusion stage, substituting a non-fissionable 
material for the jacket. The fusion-fraction of these designs as 
demonstrated in tests has been as high as 97% (this was the Tsar Bomba, see 
below).

Fission-fusion-fission bomb are dirty, but they have superior "bang for the 
buck" and "pow per pound". They generate a large amount of fission fallout 
since fission accounts for most of their yield. The 5 Mt Redwing Tewa test 
(20 July 1956 GMT, Bikini Atoll) had a fission fraction of 85%. If the 
emphasis is on cheapness, depleted uranium or thorium is usually used for 
the jacket. If the emphasis is on yield per weight (like most modern 
strategic weapons) enriched uranium is often used.

The staging concept allows the use as fuel pure deuterium, or varying 
mixtures of lithium 6 and 7 in the form of a compound with deuterium 
(lithium 6/7 deuteride). These natural stable isotopes are vastly cheaper 
than the artificially made and radioactive tritium.

The first test of a staged thermonuclear device was Ivy Mike on 31 October 
1952 (GMT) on Elugelab/Flora island at Enewetok Atoll. This experimental 
device, called Sausage, used pure deuterium fuel (probably the only time 
this was ever done) and a natural uranium jacket. It was designed by the 
Panda Committee led by J. Carson Mark at Los Alamos. Mike a yield of 10.4 
Mt, 77% of which was fission.

Three stage designs have been tested and deployed to produce very high yield 
weapons. The first three stage U.S. test, and probably the first three stage 
weapon test ever, was the Bassoon device detonated in the Redwing Zuni test 
(27 May 1956 GMT, Bikini Atoll, 3.5 Mt). The largest nuclear explosion ever 
set off (50 Mt), the Tsar Bomba (King of Bombs) was a Soviet three stage 
fission-fusion-fission design. It was exploded on 30 October 1961 over 
Novaya Zemlya at an altitude of 4000 m.

By jacketing the third stage with non-fissionable material, three stage 
devices can produce high yield clean weapons. Both Zuni and Tsar Bomba were 
in fact very clean devices, Zuni was 85% fusion and Tsar Bomba was 97% 
fusion. Both designs permitted replacing the lead or tungsten third stage 
jacket with U-238 however. A version of Bassoon called Bassoon Prime was 
tested in the dirty Tewa test mentioned above. A dirty device derived from 
the Bassoon was weaponized to create the highest yield weapon the U.S. ever 
fielded, the 25 megaton Mk-41. The Tsar Bomba design was for a fission-
fusion-fission bomb with a staggering yield of <b>100-150 megatons</b>!

1.5.3  The Alarm Clock/Layer Cake (Sloika) Design
This idea predates the invention of staged radiation implosion designs, and 
was apparently invented independently at least three times. It was first 
devised by Edward Teller in the United States, who named the design "Alarm 
Clock". Later Andrei Sakharov and Vitalii Ginzburg in the Soviet Union hit 
upon it and dubbed it the "sloika" design. A sloika is a layered Russian 
pastry, rather like a napoleon, and has thus been translated as "Layer 
Cake". Finally it was developed by the British (inventor unknown). Each of 
these weapons research programs hit upon this idea before ultimately 
arriving at the more difficult, but more powerful and efficient, staged 
thermonuclear approach. 

This system was dubbed "Layer Cake" by the Soviets because it uses a 
spherical assembly of concentric shells. In the center is a fission primary 
made of U-235/Pu-239, surrounding is an (optional) layer of U-238 for the 
fission tamper, then a layer of lithium-6 deuteride/tritide, a U-238 fusion 
tamper, and finally the high explosive implosion system. The process begins 
like an ordinary implosion bomb. After the primary in the center completes 
its reaction, the energy it releases compresses and heats the fusion layer 
to thermonuclear temperatures. The burst of fission neutrons then initiates 
a coupled fission-fusion-fission chain reaction. Slower fission neutrons 
generate tritium from the lithium, which then fuses with deuterium to 
produce very fast neutrons, that in turn cause fast fission in the fusion 
tamper, which breed more tritium. In effect the fusion fuel acted as a 
neutron accelerator allowing a fission chain reaction to occur with a large 
normally non-fissionable U-238 mass. While spiking the fusion layer with an 
initial dose of tritium is not strictly necessary for this approach, it 
helps boost the yield. 

The achievable fusion fraction is fairly small, 15-20%, and cannot be 
increased beyond this point. Its use of fusion fuel is also quite 
inefficient. This design is also limited to the same yield range as pure 
fission and boosted fission weapons. This was developed into a deliverable 
weapon by the Soviet Union and the British prior to their development of the 
staged designs described above. The U.S. did not bother to pursue it, 
largely because Teller did not feel it was sufficiently destructive.

The first test of this concept was a device designated RDS-6s, (known as Joe 
4 to the U.S.) on 12 August 1953. By using tritium doping it achieved a 10-
fold boost over the size of the trigger, for a total yield of 400 Kt. The UK 
Orange Herald Small device tested in Grapple 2 (31 May 1957) was similar but 
used a much larger fission trigger (300 Kt range) apparently without tritium 
for a total yield of 720 Kt, a boost in the order of 2.5-fold. This is 
probably the largest test of a high explosive driven version of this design. 

Although apparently not used in any weapons now in service, it remains a 
viable design that should probably be considered distinct from other classes 
of nuclear weapons. This design is something of a hybrid and could be 
considered either a type of boosted fission device, or a one-stage type of 
fission-fusion-fission bomb. 

1.5.4  Neutron Bombs
Neutron bombs are nuclear weapons where the burst of neutrons generated by a 
fusion reaction is intentionally not absorbed, but allowed to escape. The 
intense burst of high-energy neutrons is the principle destructive 
mechanism. High energy neutrons are not readily stopped by most materials.

The U.S. has developed neutron bombs for use as anti-missile weapons (the 
approximately 20 Kt warhead for the Sprint missile), and as an anti-
personnel weapon against armored forces (low kiloton weapons developed both 
as artillery and missile warheads). More than one approach may exist for 
designing these weapons, the issue is discussed in Section 4. Neutron bombs 
may generate a large part of their energy from fusion, but not necessarily. 
The Lance missile warhead developed by the U.S. gained about 60% of its 
energy from fusion, the rest from the fission trigger.

Tactical neutron bombs are primarily intended to kill soldiers who are 
protected by armor. Armored vehicles are very resistant to blast and heat 
produced by nuclear weapons, but steel armor can reduce neutron radiation by 
only a modest amount so the lethal range from neutrons greatly exceeds that 
of other weapon effects. The lethal range for tactical neutron bombs can 
exceed the lethal range for blast and heat even for unprotected troops. 
Armor can absorb neutrons and neutron energy, thus reducing the neutron 
radiation to which the tank crew is exposed, but this offset to some extent 
by the fact that armor can also react harmfully with neutrons. Alloy steels 
for example can develop induced radioactivity that remains dangerous for 
some time. When fast neutrons are slowed down, the energy lost can show up 
as x-rays. Some types of armor, like that of the M-1 tank, employ depleted 
uranium which can undergo fast fission, generating additional neutrons and 
becoming radioactive. Special neutron absorbing armor techniques have also 
been developed, such as armors containing boronated plastics and the use of 
vehicle fuel as a shield.

1.6    Cobalt Bombs and other Salted Bombs</h3><pre>
A "salted" nuclear weapon is reminiscent of fission-fusion-fission weapons, 
but instead of a fissionable jacket around the secondary stage fusion fuel, 
a non-fissionable blanket of a specially chosen salting isotope is used 
(cobalt-59 in the case of the cobalt bomb). This blanket captures the 
escaping fusion neutrons to breed a radioactive isotope that maximizes the 
fallout hazard from the weapon rather than generating additional explosive 
force (and dangerous fission fallout) from fast fission of U-238. 

Variable fallout effects can be obtained by using different salting 
isotopes. Gold has been proposed for short-term fallout (days), tantalum and 
zinc for fallout of intermediate duration (months), and cobalt for long term 
contamination (years). To be useful for salting, the parent isotopes must be 
abundant in the natural element, and the neutron-bred radioactive product 
must be a strong emitter of penetrating gamma rays.

Table 1.6-1 Candidate Salting Agents
Parent        Natural  Radioactive Half-Life 
Isotope      Abundance   Product
Cobalt-59     100%       Co-60     5.26 years
Gold-197      100%       Au-198    2.697 days
Tantalum-181   99.99%    Ta-182    115 days
Zinc-64        48.89%    Zn-65     244 days

The idea of the cobalt bomb originated with Leo Szilard who publicized it in 
Feb. 1950, not as a serious proposal for weapon, but to point out that it 
would soon be possible in principle to build a weapon that could kill 
everybody on earth (see Doomsday Device in Questions and Answers). To design 
such a theoretical weapon a radioactive isotope is needed that can be 
dispersed world wide before it decays. Such dispersal takes many months to a 
few years so the half-life of Co-60 is ideal.

The Co-60 fallout hazard is greater than the fission products from a U-238 
blanket because 1) many fission-produced isotopes have half-lives that are 
very short, and thus decay before the fallout settles or can be protected 
against by short-term sheltering; 2) many fission-produced isotopes have 
very long half-lives and thus do not produce very intense radiation; or 3) 
the fission products are not radioactive at all. The half-life of Co-60 on 
the other hand is long enough to settle out before significant decay has 
occurred, and to make it impractical to wait out in shelters, yet is short 
enough that intense radiation is produced. 

Initially gamma radiation fission products from an equivalent size fission-
fusion-fission bomb are much more intense than Co-60: 15,000 times more 
intense at 1 hour; 35 times more intense at 1 week;  5 times more intense at 
1 month; and about equal at 6 months. Thereafter fission drops off rapidly 
so that Co-60 fallout is 8 times more intense than fission at 1 year and 150 
times more intense at 5 years. The very long lived isotopes produced by 
fission would overtake the again Co-60 after about 75 years.

Zinc has been proposed as an alternate candidate for the "doomsday role". 
The advantage of Zn-64 is that its faster decay leads to greater initial 
intensity. Disadvantages are that since it makes up only half of natural 
zinc, it must either be isotopically enriched or the yield will be cut in 
half; that it is a weaker gamma emitter than Co-60, putting out only one-
fourth as many gammas for the same molar quantity; and that substantially 
amounts will decay during the world-wide dispersal process. Assuming pure 
Zn-64 is used, the radiation intensity of Zn-65 would initially be twice as 
much as Co-60. This would decline to being equal in 8 months, in 5 years Co-
60 would be 110 times as intense.

Militarily useful radiological weapons would use local (as opposed to world-
wide) contamination, and high initial intensities for rapid effects. 
Prolonged contamination is also undesirable. In this light Zn-64 is possibly 
better suited to military applications than cobalt, but probably inferior to 
tantalum or gold. As noted above ordinary "dirty" fusion-fission bombs have 
very high initial radiation intensities and must also be considered 
radiological weapons.

No cobalt or other salted bomb has ever been atmospherically tested, and as 
far as is publicly known none have ever been built. In light of the ready 
availability of fission-fusion-fission bombs, it is unlikely any special-
purpose fallout contamination weapon will ever be developed.

The British did test a bomb that incorporated cobalt as an experimental 
radiochemical tracer (Antler/Round 1, 14 September 1957). This 1 Kt device 
was exploded at the Tadje site, Maralinga range, Australia. The experiment 
was regarded as a failure and not repeated.

<h2>2.0    Introduction to Nuclear Weapon Physics and Design</h2>
Discussions of physical principle, particularly nuclear physics, is 
unavoidable in most of the sections of this FAQ. In this section I set forth 
the basic principles behind all nuclear weapons, although some familiarity 
with physics is assumed. Section 4 deals with the design and engineering of 
nuclear weapons in more detail, and the physics discussions there can be 
considered a continuation of Section 2.

2.1	Fission Weapon Physics</h3><pre>
Nuclear fission occurs when the nuclei of certain isotopes of very heavy 
elements, isotopes of uranium and plutonium for example, capture neutrons. 
The nuclei of these isotopes are just barely stable and the addition of a 
small amount of energy to one by an outside neutron will cause it to 
promptly split into two roughly equal pieces, with the release of a great 
deal of energy (180 MeV of immediately available energy) and several new 
neutrons (an average of 2.52 for U-235, and 2.95 for Pu-239). If on average 
one neutron from each fission is captured and successfully produces fission 
then a self-sustaining chain reaction is produced. If on average *more* than 
one neutron from each fission triggers another fission, then the number of 
neutrons and the rate of energy production will increase exponentially with 
time.

Two conditions must be met before fission can be used to create powerful 
explosions: 1) the number of neutrons lost to fission (from non-fission 
producing neutron captures, or escape from the fissionable mass) must be 
kept low, and 2) the speed with which the chain reaction proceeds must be 
very fast. A fission bomb is in a race with itself: to successfully fission 
most of the material in the bomb before it blows itself apart. The degree to 
which a bomb design succeeds in this race determines its efficiency. A 
poorly designed or malfunctioning bomb may "fizzle" and release only a tiny 
fraction of its potential energy.

2.1.1   The Nature Of The Fission Process</h3><pre>
The nucleus of an atom can interact with a neutron that travels nearby in 
two basic ways. It can scatter the neutron - deflecting the neutron in a 
different direction while robbing it of some of its kinetic energy. Or it 
can capture the neutron, which in turn can affect the nucleus in several 
ways - absorption and fission being most important here. The probability 
that a particular nucleus will scatter or capture a neutron is measured by 
its scattering cross-section and capture cross-section respectively. The 
overall capture cross-section can be subdivided into other cross-sections - 
the absorption cross-section and the fission cross-section.

The stability of an atomic nucleus is determined by its binding energy -  
the amount of energy required to disrupt it. Any time a neutron or proton is 
captured by an atomic nucleus, the nucleus rearranges its structure. If 
energy is released by the rearrangement, the binding energy decreases. If 
energy is absorbed, the binding energy increases.

The isotopes important for the large scale release of energy through fission 
are uranium-235 (U-235), plutonium-239 (Pu-239), and uranium-233 (U-233). 
The binding energy of these three isotopes is so low that when a neutron is 
captured, the energy released by rearrangement exceeds it. The nucleus is 
then no longer stable and must either shed the excess energy, or split into 
two pieces. Since fission occurs regardless of the neutron's kinetic energy 
(i.e. no extra energy from its motion is needed to disrupt the nucleus), 
this is called "slow fission".

By contrast, when the abundant isotope uranium-238 captures a neutron it 
still has a binding energy deficit of 1 MeV after internal rearrangement. If 
it captures a neutron with a kinetic energy exceeding 1 MeV, then this 
energy plus the energy released by rearrangement can over come the binding 
energy and cause fission. Since a fast neutron with a large kinetic energy 
is required, this is called "fast fission".

The slow fissionable isotopes have high neutron fission cross-sections for 
neutrons of all energies, while having low cross-sections for absorption. 
Fast fissionable isotopes have zero fission cross-sections below a certain 
threshold (1 MeV for U-238), but the cross-sections climb quickly above the 
threshold. Generally though, slow-fissionable isotopes are more fissionable 
than fast-fissionable isotopes for neutrons of all energies. 

A general trend among the elements is that the ratio of neutrons to protons 
in an atomic nucleus increases with the element's atomic number (the number 
of protons the nucleus contains, which determines which element it is). 
Heavier elements require relatively more neutrons to stabilize the nucleus. 
When the nucleus of a heavy element like uranium (atomic number 92) is split 
the fragments, having lower atomic numbers, will tend to have excess 
neutrons. These neutrons are shed very rapidly by the excited fragments. 
More neutrons are produced on average than are consumed in fission.

Fission is a statistical process. The nucleus rarely splits into pieces with 
nearly the same mass and atomic number. Instead both the size and atomic 
numbers of the fragments have a Gaussian distributions around two means (one 
for the lighter fragment around 95, one for the heavier around 135). 
Similarly, the number of neutrons produced varies from zero to six or more, 
and their kinetic energy varies from 0.5 MeV to more than 4 MeV, the most 
probable energy is 0.75 MeV, the average (and median) is 2 MeV.

A breakdown of the energy released by fission is given below:
                                          MeV
Kinetic energy of fission fragments  165 +/- 5
Instantaneous gamma rays               7 +/- 1
Kinetic energy of neutrons             5 +/- 0.5
Beta particles from product decay      7 +/- 1
Gamma rays from product decay          6 +/- 1
Neutrinos from product decay          10
TOTAL                                200 +/- 6

All of the kinetic energy is released to the environment instantly, as are 
most of the instantaneous gamma rays. The unstable fission products release 
their decay energies at varying rates, some almost immediately. The net 
result is that about 180 MeV is actually available to generate nuclear 
explosions, the remainder of the decay energy shows up over time as fallout 
(or is carried away by the virtually undetectable neutrinos).

2.1.2    Criticality</h3><pre>
A neutron entering a pure chunk of one of the slow-fissionable isotopes 
would have a high probability of causing fission compared with the chance of 
unproductive absorption. If the chunk is large and compact enough, then the 
rate of neutron escape from its surface will be so low that it becomes a 
"critical mass", a mass in which a self-sustaining chain reaction occurs. 
Non-fissionable materials mixed with these isotopes tend to absorb some of 
the neutrons uselessly, and increase the required size of the critical mass 
or may even make it impossible to achieve altogether.

Typical figures for critical masses for bare (unreflected) spheres of 
fissionable materials are:
U-233                16 kg
U-235                52 kg
Pu-239 (alpha phase) 10 kg
</pre>

<HR><a name=nfaq2.1.3></a><h3>
2.1.3   Time Scale of the Fission Reaction</h3><pre>
The amount of time taken by each link in the chain reaction is determined by 
the speed of the neutrons and the distance they travel before being 
captured. The average distance is called the mean free path. In fissile 
materials at maximum normal densities the mean free path for fission is 
roughly 13 cm for 1 MeV neutrons (a typical energy for fission neutrons). 
These neutrons travel at 1.4x10^9 cm/sec, yielding an average time between 
fission generations of about 10^-8 sec (10 nanoseconds), a unit of time 
sometimes called a "shake". The mean free path for scattering is only 2.5 
cm, so on average a neutron will be scattered 5 times before causing 
fission.

Actual 1 MeV mean free path values are:
         Density   M.F.P. (cm)
U-233      18.9     10.9
U-235      18.9     16.5
Pu-239     19.4     12.7
This shows that fission proceeds faster in some isotopes than others.

The rate of multiplication can be calculated from the multiplication 
coefficient k given by:
     k = f - (lc + le)
where f =  avg. neutrons generated per fission
      lc = avg. neutrons lost to capture
      le = avg. neutrons lost by escaping assembly

When k = 1 an assembly is exactly critical and a chain reaction will be self 
supporting, although it will not increase in rate. When k > 1 then it is 
super-critical and the reaction will continually increase. To make an 
efficient bomb k must be as high as possible, usually somewhere near 2, when 
the chain reaction starts.

Many discussions of fission describe the chain reaction as proceeding by 
discrete generations. Generation zero has 1 neutron, generation one has 2 
neutrons, generation two has 4 neutrons, etc. until, say, 2x10^24 atoms have 
been split - which produces 20 kilotons of energy. The formula for this is:
     Number of atoms split = 2^(n-1), where n is the generation number.
Thus 2x10^24 = 2^(n-1) implies n = (log2 (2x10^24)) + 1 = 81.7 generations. 
That is, it takes about 82 generations to complete the fission process for a 
20 kt bomb, if the reaction starts from one neutron.

This calculation is a useful simplification, but the fission process does 
not really proceed by separate steps, each completing before the next 
begins. It is really a continuous process, the current oldest generation of 
neutrons starts creating the next generation even while it is still being 
formed by neutrons from still older generations. An accurate calculation 
thus requires the use of formulas derived from calculus.

We find that both the number of neutrons present in the assembly (and thus 
the instantaneous rate of the fission reaction), and the number of fissions 
that have occurred since the reaction began, increase at a rate proportional 
to e^((k-1)*(t/g)), where e is the natural log base (2.712...), g is the 
average generation time (time from neutron emission to fission capture), and 
t is the elapsed time. 

If k=2, then a single neutron will multiply to 2x10^24 neutrons (and 
splitting the same number of atoms) in roughly 56 shakes (560 nanoseconds), 
yielding 20 kilotons of energy. This is one-third less time than the 
previous approximate calculation. Due to the exponential rate of increase, 
at any point in the chain reaction 99% of the energy will have been released 
in the last 4.6 generations. It is a reasonable approximation to think of 
the first 53 generations as a latency period leading up to the actual 
explosion, which only takes 3-4 generations.

The extremely rapid buildup in the fission rate as the reaction proceeds has 
some important consequences that should be pointed out. The longer a neutron 
takes to cause fission, the less significant it is in contributing to the 
chain reaction. This is because it becomes quickly outnumbered by the 
descendants of neutrons that undergo fission capture sooner. Thus faster, 
more energetic, neutrons contribute disproportionately compared to slower 
neutrons. This is called "time absorption" since it has the same effect as a 
neutron absorber with a cross-section inversely proportional to velocity. 
Similarly, if a neutron leaves the critical mass and is scattered back in, 
then its contribution is also considerably reduced.

2.1.4   Basic Principles of Fission Weapon Design</h3><pre>
The principle issues that must solved to construct a fission weapon are:
1.  Keeping the fissionable material in a subcritical state before 
detonation;
2.  Bringing the fissionable material into a supercritical mass while 
keeping it free of neutrons;
3.  Introducing neutrons into the critical mass when it is at the optimum 
configuration (i.e. at maximum supercriticality);
4.  Keeping the mass together until a substantial portion of the material 
has fissioned.

Solving issues 1, 2 and 3 together is greatly complicated by the unavoidable 
presence of naturally occurring neutrons. Although cosmic rays generate 
neutrons at a low rate, almost all of these "background" neutrons originate 
from the fissionable material itself through the process of spontaneous 
fission. Due to the low stability of the nuclei of fissionable elements, 
these nuclei will occasionally split without being hit by a neutron. This 
means that the fissionable material itself periodically emits neutrons. 

The process of assembling the supercritical mass must occur in significantly 
less time than the average interval between spontaneous fissions to have a 
reasonable chance of succeeding. This problem is difficult to accomplish due 
to the very large change in reactivity required in going from a subcritical 
state to a supercritical one. The time required to raise the value of k from 
1 to the maximum value of 2 or so is called the reactivity insertion time, 
or simply insertion time.

It is further complicated by the problem of subcritical neutron 
multiplication. If a subcritical mass has a k value of 0.9, then a neutron 
present in the mass will (on average) create a chain reaction that dies out 
in an average of 10 generations. If the mass is very close to critical, say 
k=0.99, then each spontaneous fission neutron will create a chain that lasts 
100 generations. This persistence of neutrons in subcritical masses further 
reduces the time window for assembly, and requires that the reactivity of 
the mass be increased from a value of <0.9 to a value of 2 or so within that 
window. 

Simply splitting a supercritical mass into two identical parts, and bringing 
the parts together rapidly is unlikely to succeed since neither part will 
have a sufficiently low k value, nor will the insertion time be rapid enough 
with achievable assembly speeds.

2.1.4.1  Assembly Techniques - Achieving Supercriticality
The key to achieving objectives 1 and 2 is revealed by the fact that the 
critical mass (or supercritical mass) of a fissionable material is inversely 
proportional to the square of its density. By contriving a subcritical 
arrangement of fissionable material whose average density can be rapidly 
increased, we can bring about the sudden large increase in reactivity needed 
to create a powerful explosion. As a general guide, a suitable highly 
supercritical mass needs to be at least three times heavier than a mass of 
equal density and shape that is merely critical. Thus doubling the density 
of a pit that is slightly sub-critical (thereby making it into nearly four 
critical masses) provides sufficient reactivity insertion for a bomb.

Two general approaches have been used for achieving this idea: implosion 
assembly, and gun assembly. Implosion is capable of very short insertion 
times, gun assembly is much slower.

2.1.4.1.1 Implosion Assembly
The key idea in implosion assembly is to compress a subcritical spherical, 
or sometimes cylindrical, fissionable mass by using specially designed high 
explosives. Implosion works by initiating the detonation of the explosives 
on their outer surface, so that the detonation wave moves inward. Careful 
design allows the creation of a smooth, symmetrical implosion shock wave. 
This shock wave is transmitted to the fissionable core and compresses it, 
raising the density to the point of supercriticality. 

Implosion can be used to compress either solid cores of fissionable 
material, or hollow cores in which the fissionable material forms a shell. 
It is easy to see how implosion can increase the density of a hollow core - 
it simply collapses the cavity. Solid metals can be compressed substantially 
by powerful shock waves also though. A high performance explosive can 
generate shock wave pressures of 400 kilobars (four hundred thousand 
atmospheres), implosion convergence and other concentration techniques can 
boost this to several megabars. This pressure can squeeze atom closer 
together and boost density to twice normal or even more (the theoretical 
limit for a shock wave in an ideal monatomic gas is a four-fold compression, 
the practical limit is always lower). 

The convergent shock wave of an implosion can compress solid uranium or 
plutonium by a factor of 2 to 3. The compression occurs very rapidly, 
typically providing insertion times in the range to 1 to 4 microseconds. The 
period of maximum compression lasts less than a microsecond.

A two-fold compression will boost a slightly sub-critical solid mass to 
nearly four critical masses. Such a solid core design was used for Gadget, 
the first nuclear explosive ever tested, and Fatman, the atomic bomb dropped 
on Nagasaki. In practice hollow core designs also achieve greater than 
normal densities (i.e. they don't rely on collapsing a hollow core alone).

In addition to its major objective of achieving supercriticality, 
compression has another important effect. The increased density reduces the 
neutron mean free path, which is inversely proportional to density. This 
reduces the time period for each generation and allows a faster reaction 
that can progress farther before disassembly occurs. Implosion thus 
considerably increases a bomb's efficiency.

The primary advantages of implosion are:
a. high insertion speed - this allows materials with high spontaneous 
fission rates (i.e. plutonium) to be used;
b. high density achieved, leading to a very efficient bomb, and allows bombs 
to be made with relatively small amounts of material;
c. potential for light weight designs - in the best designs only several 
kilograms of explosive are needed to compress the core.

The principal drawback is its complexity and the precision required to make 
it work. Implosion designs take extensive research and testing, and require 
high precision machining and electronics.

2.1.4.1.2 Gun Assembly
Assembling a critical mass by firing one piece of fissionable material at 
another is an obvious idea and was the first approach developed for 
designing atomic bombs. But it is probably not obvious how you take two 
subcritical masses and obtain the equivalent of three critical masses by 
bringing them together.

This can be made clear by conducting a thought-experiment. Imagine a 
spherical pit made up of about three critical masses of fissionable 
material. Now remove a core (like an apple core) from the pit with a mass 
slightly less than critical. Since the center of the pit is now hollow, its 
effective density has been reduced to 2/3 of the original density. Since we 
now have two critical masses remaining in the pit, and the reduction in 
density leads to a further reduction of (2/3)^2 = 4/9, the pit now contains 
only 2*(4/9) = 8/9 of a critical mass.

The two sub-critical pieces can be brought together by firing the 
cylindrical core down a gun barrel into the center of the hollowed-out pit. 
The insertion time is large - over 1 millisecond. This is the design used in 
Little Boy, the bomb dropped on Hiroshima (except that a slightly less 
efficient squat cylinder was used, rather than a spherical pit).

The primary advantage of gun assembly is simplicity. It is as close to a 
fool-proof design as ordinance technology allows.

The drawbacks are:
a. the lack of compression, which requires large amounts of fissionable 
material, and leads to low efficiency;
b. only uranium-235 (and possibly U-233) can be used due to the slow 
insertion speed;
c. the weight and length of the gun barrel makes the weapon heavy and fairly 
long.

2.1.4.2  Initiating Fission
Assembly techniques only address issues 1 and 2, reconfiguring sub-critical 
masses rapidly into supercritical ones. The next problem is to make sure 
fission does occur when it is desired.

Since neutrons are generated periodically by spontaneous fission, one 
approach would be to hold the supercritical mass together after it is 
assembled until spontaneous neutrons an start the reaction. This is at least 
possible for gun assembly, but it is unsatisfactory for implosion since the 
highly compressed pit begins expanding soon after the shock wave dies out. 
Even in a compressed pit the fission reaction takes about 250 nanoseconds, 
roughly the duration of the maximum compression. It is therefore important 
to initiate the chain reaction very soon after maximum compression is 
achieved, or even slightly before.

A better method is to have some sort of neutron generator whose operation is 
precisely synchronized with the assembly process. Three general mechanisms 
have been developed for this, all of which use charged particle reactions to 
generate neutrons.

The first type of generator to be invented relies on the fact that one of 
the neutrons in beryllium-9 is easily knocked loose. Occasionally if it is 
struck by an alpha particle, like those produced by some produced by some 
radioactive isotopes, a neutron will be released as a result of the 
collision:

     Be-9 + He-4 -> Be-8 + n + He-4

This happens in only 0.008% of collisions, so a strong alpha emitter (like 
polonium-210) is required to achieve the neutron flux needed by an implosion 
weapon. A neutron generation rate of 10-100 million neutrons per second is 
needed to ensure the prompt initiation of the reaction, thus 100-1000 
billion alphas per second are required (3-30 curies of radioactive 
material). The generator is located in the center of the pit. Clever designs 
(still classified in the US, though detailed descriptions now exist in the 
open literature) are needed to keep the alpha emitter and beryllium 
separate, but still allow the implosion process to bring them together 
rapidly. This type of generator was used in all of the early atomic weapons.

The major problem with the beryllium/alpha emitter generators is that the 
strong emitters used have very short half-lifes (138.4 days for Po-210). 
Maintaining a inventory of weapons thus requires continual manufacture and 
replacement of generators. Also, due to difficulties in precisely 
controlling the mixing of the beryllium and polonium it is difficult to 
control the initiation of the fission reaction accurately. These types of 
generators had a tendency to start the reaction later than optimum.

A somewhat similar approach is to use the implosion to initiate a neutron 
generating fusion reactions with tritium and deuterium (described in Section 
2.2 below). It may seem surprising that this can be made to work, given the 
well known fact that fission explosions are required to produce the 
temperatures that fusion reactions normally need. Three considerations 
overcome this obstacle. First, an exceedingly low rate of fusion is actually 
required. One neutron (and thus one fusion) every 10 nanoseconds is 
sufficient, a rate that is only some 10^-24 as fast as an actual fusion 
explosion would need. Second, implosions focus energy and can reach very 
high temperatures near the center. Theoretically the temperature at the 
center is infinitely high, but lack of perfect symmetry reduces this. Even 
so, a high precision implosion can reach temperatures of several hundred 
thousand degrees C. Third, the velocity of atoms in a gas or plasma is a 
statistical (Maxwellian) distribution. A very small portion of the atoms can 
greatly exceed the average energy. Thus enough atoms in the D-T mixture near 
the center can reach fusion energies to produce the required rate of neutron 
production. This type of implosion initiator is even more difficult to 
engineer than the Be/Po-210 type since the very high precision implosion is 
required to achieve the required symmetry. The major advantage is that the 
short half-life Po-210 is not needed.

A more sophisticated system is to use an electronically controlled particle 
accelerator called a pulse neutron tube. These generators use the 
deuterium+deuterium or deuterium+tritium fusion reactions to produce large 
amounts of neutrons. A very short surge of high voltage current accelerates 
a pulse deuterium or tritium nuclei to energies sufficient to cause fusion 
reactions, then slams them into a deuterium or tritium rich target. A short 
pulse containing millions of neutrons is produced. The timing of the pulse 
can be precisely controlled. Because of the large number of neutrons 
produced, the generator can be located anywhere in the weapon with assurance 
that a sufficient number will reach the pit. This is the initiator commonly 
used in most modern nuclear weapons.
 
2.1.4.3  Preventing Disassembly and Increasing Efficiency
By the time a significant percentage of the atoms have fissioned, their 
thermal kinetic energy is so high that the pit will expand enough to shut 
down the reaction in only a few of shakes. This severely limits the 
efficiency of fission weapons (percentage of material fissioned). The 
practical efficiency limit in a pure fission bomb is about 20%, and could be 
much less (Fat Man was 16% efficient, Little Boy had an efficiency of only 
1.4%). Anything that will increase the confinement time of the fissionable 
core or decrease the generation time, even slightly, can cause a significant 
increase in bomb yield.

As noted above, compressing the fissionable material through implosion makes 
the largest contribution to a bomb's efficiency. By doubling the density of 
the pit the length of a shake is cut in half, thus allowing almost twice as 
many fission generations to occur during the brief period before expansion 
halts the reaction.

Another approach for increasing efficiency is reducing the rate of expansion 
through better confinement of the critical mass. A layer of dense material 
called a "tamper" (typically made of natural or depleted uranium or 
tungsten) surrounds the critical mass. A bare hot critical mass does not 
expand uniformly. The material in the center of the mass is confined by the 
pressure of the outer layers of the mass, and thus does not expand 
initially. In the absence of a tamper the outer surface of the mass has no 
external pressure holding it in, and thus begins rapid expansion 
immediately. The material blows off at supersonic speeds, and an expansion 
wave moves inward at the speed of sound. 

A tamper improves confinement for twp reasons. First, the expanding material 
must drive a shock wave through the dense tamper rather than expanding into 
a vacuum. This dramatically reduces the rate of expansion. Second, a layer 
of the tamper next to the mass is heated by the explosion and exerts 
pressure on the surface holding it together. This delays disassembly further 
since the expansion wave must first traverse this hot tamper layer before 
the fissile material can begin to expand.

The tamper has an additional benefit, it can also scatter or "reflect" 
neutrons back into the critical mass after they escape from its surface. 
This means that a smaller amount of fissionable material is necessary to 
make the critical mass. The importance of this effect is often overstated in 
the nuclear weapons literature however. Only a portion of the neutrons are 
scattered back, and since it takes on average several shakes for the 
neutrons that do return to reenter the critical mass, their significance is 
further reduced through "time absorption" (see section 2.1.3). This is 
offset somewhat by the fact that some neutron multiplication occurs in 
natural uranium tampers through fast fission of U-238.

2.2	Fusion Weapon Physics</h3><pre>
Fusion reactions, also called thermonuclear reactions, are reactions between 
the nuclei of certain isotopes of light elements. If the nuclei collide with 
sufficient energy (provided by heat in a bomb, or by a particle accelerator 
in the laboratory) then there is a significant chance that they will merge 
to form one or more new nuclei with the release of energy. Different nuclei 
combinations have different inherent likelihoods of reacting in a collision 
at a particular temperature. The rates of all fusion reactions is affected 
by both temperature and density. The hotter and denser the fusion fuel, the 
faster the fusion "burn".

The fusion reactions that occur in stars are not the same as the ones that 
occur in thermonuclear weapons or (laboratory fusion reactors). The somewhat 
complex catalyzed fusion cycle in stars that converts light hydrogen 
(protium) into helium is extremely slow, which is why the lifetime of the 
Sun is measured in billions of years. The fusion reactions used in bombs and 
prospective powerplant designs are simple, and extremely fast - which is 
essential since the fuel must be fully consumed within microseconds. These 
reactions thus are based on the same general principles as stellar fusion, 
but are completely different in detail.
</pre> 

<HR><a name=nfaq2.2.1></a><h3>
2.2.1   Candidate Fusion Reactions</h3><pre>
The most important fusion reactions for thermonuclear weapons are given 
below:
1.  D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeV
2.  D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeV
3.  D + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV
4.  He-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeV
5.  Li-6 + n -> T + He-4 + 4.78 MeV
6.  Li-7 + n -> T + He-4 + n - 2.47 MeV
[D and T stand for deuteron or deuterium (H-2), and triton or tritium (H-3) 
respectively.]

At the temperatures found in fission bombs reaction 1 has a rate 100 times 
faster than the next fastest candidate (reactions 2 and 3 combined), which 
are in turn 10 times faster than reaction 4. The rates of reactions 1 - 4 
all increase rapidly (exponentially) with temperature, but not in the same 
proportion. At the higher temperatures achievable by fusion, reaction 4 
exceeds the combined rate of reactions 2 and 3. Other reactions also occur 
between the isotopes listed here, but the reactions rates are too low to be 
important.

Some additional important facts about these reactions:
The neutron produced in reaction 1 is extremely energetic, it carries away 
14.06 MeV of the reaction energy, the alpha particle (He-4 nucleus) only 
3.52 MeV.

The neutron produced in reaction 2 has an energy of only 2.45 MeV (similar 
to the faster fission neutrons), with the He-3 carrying 0.82 MeV. The 
division of energy in reaction 3 is 1.01 MeV for the triton, and 3.03 MeV 
for the proton. The two D+D reactions are equally likely and each will occur 
half the time.

In reaction 4 the alpha particle carries off 3.67 MeV, the proton 14.67 MeV.

Reactions 5 and 6 are not thermonuclear reactions, strictly speaking. They 
are neutronic reactions, like fission, and do not require heat or pressure, 
just neutrons in the correct energy range. This distinction is usually 
ignored in the literature about nuclear weapons however. The Li-6 + n 
reaction requires neutrons with energies is the low MeV range or below. The 
Li-7 + n reaction is only significant when the energies are above 4 MeV.

2.2.2    Basic Principles of Fusion Weapon Design</h3><pre>
2.2.2.1  Designs Using the Deuterium+Tritium Reaction
At ordinary material densities (e.g. liquid hydrogen, compressed hydrogen 
gas, or hydrogen-rich solids) reaction 1, the D+T reaction, is the only 
reaction that can occur to a significant extent at the temperature of an 
atomic bomb (50-100 million degrees, the temperature at the center of the 
Sun is only 14 million degrees!). This reaction can be used by simply 
allowing the fission explosion to heat up the fuel to fusion temperatures, 
requiring at most modest compression by the fission reaction itself. The 
high energy neutrons produced by this reaction are thus used to "boost" 
fission bombs.

The shortcoming with using the D+T reaction is that tritium is radioactive 
and decays at a rate of 5.5% year. This means that it does not occur in 
nature and must be manufactured through the use of reaction 5 in a nuclear 
reactor. In a weapons program tritium must compete with plutonium production 
in weapons production reactors, and it costs 80 times as much to produce one 
gram tritium compared with one gram of plutonium due its low atomic weight. 
It would be far too expensive to produce enough to make high yield fusion 
bombs. The decay also means that it must be continually replenished. This 
reaction, using reactor manufactured tritium, has been used in low-yield 
neutron bombs where large amounts of tritium are not necessary

The production of tritium through reaction 5 can also be carried out in an 
atomic bomb, using the neutrons that escape from the critical assembly. This 
approach was used in the first hydrogen bomb tested by the Soviets. A large 
bomb cannot be manufactured using this method though because there are 
insufficient neutrons produced. On average each fission produces roughly one 
spare neutron, and releases 180 MeV of energy. If the spare neutron is 
captured by Li-6, producing one atom of tritium, which then fuses, we get a 
total energy production of 22.4 MeV. We would expect then that the fusion 
yield would be no more than about 10% of that of the fission trigger. If the 
fusion energy were the only contribution to the bomb's yield, then there 
would be no point in using this technique. The 14.1 MeV neutron from the D+T 
reaction can however cause fission in U-238, which is used in the fission 
tamper. This extra fission reaction doubles the bombs yield. Due to the low 
fusion yield inherent to the design this could be considered a type of 
fusion-boosted fission weapon.

2.2.2.2  Designs Using Other Fuels
It is militarily desirable to use fuels that are cheaper, and more stable 
than tritium. Deuterium, the sole fuel in reactions 2 and 3, is relatively 
cheap (especially considering its enormous energy content) and is completely 
stable. Pure deuterium has been used in at least one fusion weapon test - 
Ivy Mike, arguably the first true fusion weapon explosion in history (1 
November 1952). Unfortunately deuterium, like all elemental hydrogen, is 
difficult to store. It must either be highly compressed, or liquified at 
extremely low temperatures. This problem can be overcome by combining the 
deuterium chemically with lithium to form lithium deuteride, a stable solid. 
An additional benefit is that through reactions 5 and 6, the lithium can 
itself participate in the fusion reaction.

To make use of these fuels, the slower reaction rates must be offset by 
compressing them to densities hundreds or thousands of times greater than 
those of normal conditions. At any given temperature the reaction rate goes 
up with the square of the density, a thousand-fold compression gives a 
million-fold reaction rate increase.

The work required to compress a gas is proportional to its temperature (at 
these pressures the physical strength of materials is negligible, and 
everything can be considered a gas). To minimize the work required for 
compression, or alternatively to achieve maximum compression for a given 
amount of work, it is important to keep the fusion fuel from getting hot 
until after the desired density is reached.

The key to making large fusion bombs is finding a way for using the energy 
of an atomic bomb trigger to compress a mass of deuterium sufficiently for 
the D-D reactions to become practical, followed by heating of the mass to 
ignition temperatures after the proper density has been achieved. The 
technique for doing this is staged radiation implosion, also called the 
Teller-Ulam configuration after its original joint inventors, Stanislaw Ulam 
and Edward Teller (also reinvented independently by Andrei Sakharov and his 
associates, and by others in Britain, France, and China). 

The Teller-Ulam configuration makes use of the fact that at the high 
temperatures of a fission bomb 80% or more of the energy exists as soft X-
rays, not kinetic energy. The transport of energy by radiation from the 
fission core greatly exceeds the core's expansion rate (a mere 1000 km/sec 
or so). It is possible then to use this energy to compress, and ignite a 
physically separate mass of fusion fuel (the second stage) through radiation 
implosion before the expanding trigger disrupts it. 

The principles of the Teller-Ulam configuration are more easily explained 
with the help of the diagram below. The bomb casing is roughly cylindrical, 
with the fission trigger at one end. The fusion fuel (lithium deuteride in 
the diagram) is a cylinder or ellipsoid wrapped in a pusher/tamper - a layer 
of very dense material (uranium or tungsten). Running down the axis of the 
fuel cylinder is a Pu-239 or U-235 rod, 2-3 cm or so in diameter. Lining the 
casing is a layer of plastic or plastic foam. Separating the trigger from 
the fuel package is a thick plug of dense material (again U or W).

0 - fission trigger
s - U-238 or tungsten shield

t - U-238 or U-235 fusion pusher/tamper
6 - Li-6/Li-7 Deuteride
f - fissionable rod

When the trigger explodes, the X-rays escaping from the fission trigger fill 
the radiation channel, the space between the bomb casing and the fusion 
capsule, with a photon gas. This space is filled with plastic foam, 
essentially just carbon and hydrogen, which becomes completely ionized and 
transparent as the x-rays penetrate. The inner casing and outer capsule 
surfaces are heated to very high temperatures. The uranium shield between 
the trigger and the fusion capsule, and capsule pusher/tamper, prevents the 
fusion fuel from becoming heated prematurely.

Thermal equilibrium is established extremely rapidly, so that the 
temperature and energy density is uniform throughout the radiation channel. 
As the surface of the tamper becomes heated, it expands and ablates (blows 
off the fuel capsule surface). This ablation process, essentially a rocket 
turned inside out, generates tremendous pressure on the fuel capsule and 
causes an accelerating implosion. Thermal equilibrium assures that the 
implosion pressure is very uniformly distributed. The transparent carbon-
hydrogen plasma retards the early expansion of the tamper and casing 
plasmas, keeping the radiation channel from being blocked by these opaque 
high-Z materials until equilibrium is fully established.

The force that compresses and accelerates the fusion fuel inward is provided 
solely by the ablation pressure. The other two possible sources of pressure 
- plasma pressure (pressure generated by the thermal motion of the plasma 
confined between the casing and the fuel capsule) and radiation pressure 
(pressure generated by thermal X-ray photons) do not directly influence the 
process.

The pressure exerted by the plasma causes cylindrical (or spherical) 
implosion of the fusion capsule, consisting of the pusher/tamper, fuel, and 
the axial fissionable rod. The capsule is compressed to perhaps 1/30 of its 
original diameter for cylindrical compression (1/10 for spherical 
compression), and thus reaches or exceeds 1000 times its original density. 
It is noteworthy that at this point the explosive force released by the 
trigger, an amount of energy sufficient to destroy a small city, is being 
used simply to squeeze several kilograms of fuel!

It is unlikely that the fissionable rod reaches such extreme compression 
however. Located at the center, it will experience an extremely violent 
shock wave that will heat it to high temperatures but compress it only 
modestly, increasing its density by a factor of 4 or so. This is sufficient 
to make the rod super-critical. Depending on the degree of symmetry, and the 
physics of the particular capsule collapse process higher densities are 
possible. Thermalized neutrons trapped in the fusion fuel, which are left 
over from the intense fission neutron flux, initiate a chain reaction as 
soon as the rod becomes critical. The rod fissions at an accelerating rate 
as it, and the rest of the fuel capsule continue to implode and acts as the 
fusion "spark plug". Combined with the high temperatures generated by the 
convergent shock wave, this raises the temperature of the fusion fuel around 
the rod high enough to initiate the fusion reaction. Self-supporting fusion 
burning then spreads outward. The fusion tamper prevents the escape of 
thermal radiation from the fuel. As the temperature rises the fusion 
reactions accelerate, enhancing the burn efficiency considerably. The 
temperatures generated by fusion burning can exceed 300 million K, 
considerably more than that produced by fission.

The fuel in the fission capsule consists of lithium deuteride that may be 
enriched in the Li-6 isotope (which makes up 7.5% of natural lithium). 
Natural lithium has been used with success in fusion bomb designs, but 
modern light weight designs seem to use lithium enriched in Li-6. 

There is some tritium generated by the fission neutrons, but as noted above 
the contribution to bomb yield is insignificant. Far more tritium is 
produced by the D+D reactions, either directly by reaction 3, or by reaction 
5 via the neutrons produced in reaction 2. 

Since the D+T reaction rate is so high, and there is large excess of 
deuterium, the tritium is consumed almost as fast it is produced. The 14.1 
MeV neutrons can also produce large amounts of tritium from Li-7 through 
reaction 6.

A large part of the fusion fuel can be burned before expansion quenches the 
reaction by reducing the density, which takes some 20-40 nanoseconds. The 
power output of a fusion capsule is noteworthy. The largest bomb ever 
exploded had a yield of 50 Mt, almost all produced by its final fusion 
stage. Since 50 Mt is 2.1x10^17 joules, the power produced during the burn 
was around 5.3x10^24 watts. This is more than one percent of the entire 
power output of the Sun (4.3x10^26 watts)!! The peak output was possibly 
even greater.

The 2.45 MeV and 14.1 MeV neutrons that escape from the fusion fuel can also 
contribute greatly to bomb yield by inducing fission in the highly 
compressed fusion tamper. This extra boost can release most of the explosion 
energy, and  commonly accounts for half of the yield of large fission-
fusion-fission bombs and can reach at least 85% of the total yield. 

The Teller-Ulam fusion bomb described so far is called a "two stage bomb". 
The fission trigger (the first stage) compresses the fusion capsule (the 
second stage). As powerful as the trigger is, there is a limit to how large 
a capsule it can compress in the brief time available. If a still bigger 
bomb is desired, then the explosion of the fusion secondary can be used to 
compress and explode a larger third stage. Each stage can be 10-100 times 
the size of the previous stage. The 50 Mt bomb mentioned above was a three 
stage weapon.

<h2>3.0       Matter, Energy, and Radiation Hydrodynamics</h2>
This section provides background in the fundamental physical phenomena that 
govern the design of nuclear weapons, especially thermonuclear weapons. This 
section does not address nuclear physics which are introduced in Section 2, 
and discussed further in Section 4. It addresses instead the behavior of 
matter at high densities and temperatures, and the laws controlling its 
flow.

Although the reader may be able to follow the discussions of physics and 
design in Section 4 without it, familiarity with the principles discussed 
here is essential for genuine insight into the design of nuclear weapons. 
Since the same principles tend to crop up repeatedly in different contexts, 
and it is inconvenient to explain basic physics while addressing engineering 
considerations, I provide an overview of the non-nuclear physical principles 
involved below. Section 2 provides a discussion of the nuclear reactions 
involved.

Readers with a grounding in physics will find much of this discussion too 
elementary to be of interest. Please skip anything you are already familiar 
with.

3.1       Thermodynamics and the Properties of Gases</h3><pre>
Thermodynamics concerns itself with the statistical behavior of large 
collection of particles, a substantial quantity of matter for example. A 
literal reading of the term "thermodynamics" implies that the topic of 
discussion is the motion of heat. In fact, thermodynamics specifically 
addresses the condition of thermal equilibrium, where the motion of heat has 
ceased. The principle motion of interest is the randomized motion of the 
particles themselves, which gives rise to the phenomenon called "heat". It 
is this equilibrium condition of random motion that can be accurately 
characterized using statistical techniques. It is important to realize that 
the topic of thermodynamics is the study of the properties of matter at 
least as much as it is of heat.

There are two very important principles of thermodynamics, called the First 
and Second Laws of Thermodynamics. These are often stated in the form:
     1. The total energy in the universe is constant;
     2. The entropy of the universe is always increasing.

A more useful statement of the First Law in practical situations is to say 
that the change in total energy of a system is equal to the work done on the 
system, plus the heat added to the system. The Second Law states that the 
amount of heat in a closed system never decreases. The implications of these 
laws are discussed further below.

3.1.1     Kinetic Theory of Gases
The gaseous state is the simplest form of matter to analyze. This is 
fortunate, since under the extreme conditions encountered in chemical and 
nuclear explosions, matter can usually be treated as a gas regardless of its 
density or original state.

The basic properties of a gas can be deduced from considering the motions of 
its constituent particles (the kinetic theory). The pressure exerted by a 
gas on a surface is caused by the individual molecules or atoms bouncing 
elastically off that surface. This pressure is equal to the number of 
molecules striking the surface per unit of time, multiplied by the average 
momentum of each molecule normal (i.e. at right angles) to the surface. The 
number of impacts per second is proportional (~=) to the particle density of 
the gas (rho, particles per unit volume), and how fast the molecules are 
travelling (the average molecular velocity v):
Eq. 3.1.1-1
    P ~= rho*v*momentum

The average momentum is proportional to v times the mass of the particles 
(m). The pressure is thus:
Eq. 3.1.1-2
    P ~= rho*v*v*m.
Actually we can state that:
Eq. 3.1.1-3
    P = rho*v*v*m/3
since the contribution of molecular velocity normal to the surface in three 
dimensions is 1/3 of the squared magnitude.

Since v*v*m/2 is the particle kinetic energy (KE_p), we can also say:
Eq. 3.1.1-4
    P = rho*KE_p*(2/3)
That is, pressure is proportional to the average particle kinetic energy and 
the particle density, or equal to two-thirds of the total kinetic energy, 
KE, in a given volume of gas (the kinetic energy density). This is usually 
expressed as:
Eq. 3.1.1-5
     P = 2/3(KE/V), or
     PV = 2/3 KE, 
where P is the pressure

Now the thing we call _temperature_ is simply the average kinetic energy of 
the particles of a gas. A constant of proportionality is used to convert 
kinetic energy, measured in joules or ergs, into degrees Kelvin (K). 
Together these considerations give us the _Ideal Gas Law_:
Eq. 3.1.1-6
     PV = NkT, where 
P = pressure, V = volume, N = number of particles, k = Boltzmann's constant 
(1.380 x 10^-16 erg/degree K), and T = temperature. N/V is of course the 
particle density (designated n).

The constant factor 2/3 was absorbed by Boltzmann's constant. As a result, 
if we want to express the average particle kinetic energy of a gas at 
temperature T we must say:
Eq. 3.1.1-7
     KE_p = 3/2 kT

An _Ideal Gas_ (also called a perfect gas) is one in which there are no 
interactions (that is, repulsive or attractive forces) between atoms. For 
such a gas, the Ideal Gas Law holds true. The simplest case of a perfect gas 
is a _perfect monatomic gas, one in which all of the energy in the gas is in 
the form of particle motion (i.e. the particles themselves do not absorb any 
energy). This is the only case we have considered so far. Helium or argon 
are examples of ideal monatomic gases to a very good approximation (they are 
monatomic, and attractive forces only become significant close to their 
liquefaction temperatures).

Molecular or polyatomic gases, ones in which the particles are molecules of 
two or more atoms, can absorb energy through rotation and vibration. Such 
gases are not monatomic, but they are still ideal. Under some conditions 
gases can absorb energy internally by other processes, like ionization, 
which violate ideal gas behavior. When conditions are such that attractive 
forces become significant (near liquid or solid condensation points) the 
ideal gas law also breaks down.

Perfect monatomic gases are of special interest to us here, not only because 
they are particularly simple to analyze, but because under many extreme 
physical regimes all matter tends to behave like a perfect monatomic gas 
(kinetic energy dominates other forms of energy present).

3.1.2     Heat, Entropy, and Adiabatic Compression
Simply put, heat is the random motion of the particles in matter. In common 
usage we talk about something with a higher temperature as being "hotter". 
However temperature is *not* a universal measure of the thing we call heat. 
Suppose we take a container of a perfect gas, and we squeeze it and reduce 
its volume. To squeeze it and compress the gas we must do work which, by the 
First Law of Thermodynamics, is added to the internal energy of the gas. 
Since this is a perfect gas, all of the added energy appears as kinetic 
energy. That is, the temperature goes up. But have we actually added heat to 
make it hotter? 

The answer is no. We can get the energy back in the form of work, by letting 
it expand back to its original volume. The temperature will also drop back 
to the original state. This compression process (called _adiabatic_ 
compression) is *reversible* since we can return to the original state.

To increase the temperature of the container of gas without changing its 
volume, we must place it in contact with something that is hotter. The heat 
diffuses from the hotter object to the container. As the gas in the 
container warms, the hotter object grows cooler.

How can we return the gas to its original state? We must place it in contact 
with something that is colder than the original gas temperature. The heat 
then diffuses to the colder object. Although the *gas in the container* is 
now in its original state, the whole system is not. The hotter object is 
cooler, the colder object is warmer. This process is *irreversible* (we say 
"entropy of the system has increased").

Temperature is a measure of heat in a gas only at constant volume. The 
generalized measure of heat is _entropy_. Entropy is defined as the ratio of 
the total energy of a system to its temperature. As heat is added to a 
system this ratio increases. Work done on the system leaves the ratio 
unchanged.

Adiabatic compression is compression where the entropy is constant (no heat 
is added or removed). If flows of heat occur, then the process is non-
adiabatic and causes irreversible change.

3.1.3     Thermodynamic Equilibrium and Equipartition
I have just talked about heat flowing from hotter objects to colder ones. 
This process implies that a system of objects tends to move to a state where 
all of the objects are at the same temperature. When this occurs, heat 
ceases to flow. Such a state is called "thermodynamic equilibrium", and all 
systems tend to evolve toward this equilibrium naturally. The faster heat 
can flow in the system, the faster this equilibrium is reached.

The idea of thermodynamic equilibrium is extremely general. It applies not 
only to "objects" - physically separate parts of a system - but *all* parts 
of a system - separate or not.

For example in a mixture of particles of different types, different gas 
molecules say, each type of particle will be in equilibrium with the others. 
That is, they will have the same temperature - the same average kinetic 
energy. If each type of particle has a different mass from the others, then 
each must also have a unique average velocity for the kinetic energies of 
each type to be equal. One implication of this is that when a gas becomes 
ionized, the electrons knocked loose become separate particles and will come 
into thermodynamic equilibrium with the ions and un-ionized atoms. Since 
they are much lighter than atoms or ions, their velocities will be much 
higher.

We have also already applied the equilibrium principle in deriving the Ideal 
Gas Law. The total kinetic energy was divided equally among the three 
spatial directions of motion, e.g. they were in equilibrium with each other. 
These spatial directions are called the "degrees of freedom" of a monatomic 
perfect gas. Since the kinetic energy of a particle in such a gas is 3kT/2, 
each degree of freedom accounts for kT/2 energy per particle. This is also 
true of polyatomic gases, which have additional degrees of freedom (e.g. 
from vibration and rotation). Each available degree of freedom will have 
kT/2 energy when in equilibrium. This is the theorem of _equipartition of 
energy_.

The actual number of available degrees of freedom in a polyatomic gas may 
vary significantly with temperature due to quantum-mechanical 
considerations. Each degree of freedom has a characteristic energy of 
excitation, and if the value of kT/2 is not large enough then the excitation 
of a given state will be negligible.

3.1.4     Relaxation
To reach equilibrium between different particles and different degrees of 
freedom in a system, the different parts of the system must be able to 
exchange energy. The rate of energy exchange determines how long it takes to 
establish equilibrium. The length of this equilibrating period is called the 
_relaxation time_ of the system. A complex system will typically have 
several relaxation times for different system components.

The farther a degree of freedom is from equilibrium, the faster it will 
converge toward the equilibrium state. Conversely, as it approaches 
equilibrium, the rate of convergence declines. This is expressed by the 
standard relaxation equation:
Eq. 3.1.4-1
    dE/dt = (E - E_eq)/t_relax
where E is the measure of the current energy of the degree of freedom (avg. 
kinetic energy, temperature, number of particles excited, etc.), E_eq is the 
equilibrium value, and t_relax is the relaxation time.

The solution of this linear differential equation shows us that the 
difference between the current state and the equilibrium state declines 
exponentially with time:
Eq. 3.1.4-2
    E = E_init*Exp[-t/t_relax] + E_eq*(1 - Exp[-t/t_relax])
Over each time interval t_relax, the difference E - E_eq declines by a 
factor of 1/e. Although according to this equation complete equilibrium is 
never formally reached, over a finite (usually small) number relaxation 
intervals the difference from equilibrium becomes undetectable.

What determines the value of t_relax? This is determined by how frequently a 
member of a degree of freedom can be expected to undergo an energy exchange 
event, and how effective that event is in transferring energy.

For particles of similar mass, a single collision can transfer essentially 
all of the kinetic energy from one particle to the other. The relaxation 
time for bringing two populations of particles with different kinetic 
energies into equilibrium is thus the average time between collisions. In 
air at normal temperatures and pressures, this time is about 0.1 
nanoseconds. At higher densities and temperatures, the distances travelled 
between collisions is shorter, and the velocities are higher, so the time is 
correspondingly shorter.

If colliding particles have greatly different masses, then the efficiency of 
each collision in exchanging energy is reduced by a factor equal to the mass 
ratio. In the case of electrons and ions, since electrons are lighter than 
nucleons by a factor of 1836 (about) this ratio is 1/(1836*A), where A is 
the atomic mass. Unless the temperature of the electrons is much colder than 
that of the ions though, the actual relative relaxation rate is much higher 
than this would indicate because of the high velocities of the light 
electrons. If they are not too far from equilibrium, the actual relaxation 
time ratio between electrons and ions, and ions alone is about equal to the 
square root of the mass ratio: 1/(1836*A)^0.5. 

3.1.5     The Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution Law
So far we have talked about the *average* velocity and kinetic energy of a 
particle. In reality, no particle will have exactly the average energy. Even 
if we created a system in which every particle initially had exactly the 
same energy (*all* were average), within a single relaxation interval the 
energy would be dramatically redistributed. Within a few more intervals a 
stable continuous energy distribution would be established.

Statistical mechanics shows that the actual equilibrium distribution of 
particle energies can be described by the distribution law worked out first 
by Maxwell and refined by Boltzmann. The function creates a roughly bell-
shaped curve, with the peak (most probable) energy at kT. The function 
declines exponentially away from the peak, but never (formally) goes to zero 
at any energy greater than zero, so small numbers of both very fast and very 
slow particles are present in an equilibrium gas.

The Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for energy is:
Eq. 3.1.5-1
 dN/dE = N*2*Pi*(1/(Pi*kT))^(3/2) Exp(-E/kT) E^(1/2)
where N is the number of particles present. Integrating the above equation 
over a given energy range gives the number of particles in that range. 

Most of the terms in the above equation are simply normalizing factors to 
make the integral come out right (after all, integrating from zero energy to 
infinity must equal N). The factor that actually determines the distribution 
law is called the Boltzmann factor: Exp(-E/kT). This distribution factor 
applies to any system of particles where each energy state is equally 
important in a statistical sense (that is, no statistical weight is applied 
to any energy state). A gas where this is true (like the gases treated by 
classical kinetic theory) can be called a Boltzmann gas. There are two other 
types of gases that follow different distribution laws which will be 
discussed later - the Bose gas and the Fermi gas.

3.1.6     Specific Heats and the Thermodynamic Exponent
The Ideal Gas Law describes the properties of gases with respect to 
temperature, that is the kinetic energy of motion. How do we describe the 
properties of a gas with respect to the _total internal energy_? In the case 
of a monatomic gas this is easy of course, since the kinetic energy is the 
total internal energy:
     PV = NkT = 2/3 KE
    
How should we handle polyatomic gases? Before we can do this we need some 
convenient way of measuring the thermodynamic properties of different gases. 

As I have explained above, an ideal gas with additional degrees of freedom 
has a larger internal energy than does an monatomic gas at the same 
temperature. This internal energy, designated U, is also proportional to the 
(absolute) temperature (this is another common way of expressing the concept 
of _ideal gas_). This allows us to establish a constant for each gas that 
describes how much thermal energy is required to raise its temperature a 
fixed amount. This constant is called the _specific heat_. 

There are actually two commonly used specific heat definitions for gases, 
the specific heat at constant volume (c_v) and the specific heat at constant 
pressure (c_p). C_v measures the amount of energy required to raise the 
temperature in a sealed, fixed volume container. In such a container heating 
also causes the pressure to rise. C_p measures the amount of energy required 
to raise the temperature of a gas that is allowed to expand sufficiently to 
maintain constant pressure. 

These two specific heats are not independent. In fact, the ratio between 
them is fixed by the number of degrees of freedom of the gas. This gives us 
the constant that we use for describing the thermodynamic properties of a 
gas -  the thermodynamic exponent. This constant is represented by the lower 
case Greek letter gamma. It is defined by:
Eq. 3.1.6-1
     gamma = c_p/c_v
and is equal to 5/3 for a monatomic gas. The thermodynamic exponent has many 
other names such as the adiabatic index, adiabatic exponent, isentropic 
exponent, and the polytropic exponent.

Recall that the internal energy density of a monatomic gas (KE/V) is given 
by:
     P = 2/3 (KE/V)
Since KE is also the total internal energy we can say:
Eq. 3.1.6-2
     P = 2/3 U/V
The factor 2/3 happens to be equal to gamma minus 1: 5/3 - 1 = 2/3. This is 
a special case of a law valid for all perfect gases. We can thus write the 
general law:
Eq. 3.1.6-3
     P = (gamma - 1)*(U/V)

Why is gamma called the thermodynamic or adiabatic *exponent*? It is because 
of the following relationship that describes the state of matter undergoing 
adiabatic compression:
Eq. 3.1.6-4
    P(V^gamma) = constant
The constant is determined by the gases' original entropy. This is sometimes 
called the polytropic law.

The thermodynamic exponent determines the compressibility of a gas. The 
larger the value of gamma, the more work is required to reduce the volume 
through adiabatic compression (and the larger the increase in internal 
energy). An infinitely compressible gas would have an exponent of 1.

The thermodynamic literature often uses P-V diagrams that plot pressure (P) 
versus volume (V). A plot of the adiabatic function on a P-V diagram 
produces  an adiabatic curve, also called an isentropic curve since every 
point on the curve has the same entropy. In contrast, isothermal curves lie 
below the adiabatic curve with increasing pressure (assuming they start at 
the same P-V state) since a gas must lose entropy to maintain the same 
temperature. Curves where entropy is increased with increasing pressure lie 
above (these are Hugoniot curves which will be discussed further in 
connection with shock waves).

Gamma for a gas is related to the number of degrees of freedom (n_f) by:
Eq. 3.1.6-5
     gamma = (2/n_f) + 1
Thus a monatomic perfect gas is 2/3 + 1 = 5/3 as noted above. A diatomic gas 
has a maximum of 7 degrees of freedom, but only some of them may be excited 
at a given temperature, with more states being excited at higher 
temperatures.

If a gas *releases* energy during compression, thus adding additional 
kinetic energy, (due to a chemical reaction for example) then it will have a 
higher value of gamma.

Some example values of gamma are given below.

3.1.7     Properties of Blackbody Radiation
The equipartition of energy in an equilibrium system also extends to radiant 
energy present in the system. Photons are emitted and absorbed continually 
by matter, creating an equilibrium photon gas that permeates it. This photon 
must have the same temperature as the rest of the system also.

The energy distribution in an equilibrium photon gas is determined by 
quantum mechanical principles known as Bose-Einstein statistics. Photons 
belong to a class of particles called bosons that, by definition, obey these 
statistics. A key feature of bosons is that they prefer to be in the same 
energy state as other bosons. A photon gas is thus an example of a Bose gas. 
The distribution factor for Bose-Einstein statistics is: 1/(Exp(E/kT) - 1).

This fact gives rise to an energy distribution among the particles in a 
photon gas called the blackbody spectrum which has a temperature dependent 
peak reminiscent of the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. The term "blackbody" 
refers to the analytical model used to derive the spectrum mathematically 
which assumes the existence of a perfect photon absorber or (equivalently) a 
leakless container of energy (called in German a "hohlraum").

The kinetic theory of gases can be applied to a photon gas just as easily as 
it can to a gas of any other particle, but we need to make a few 
adjustments. From Eq. 3.1.1-1 we had:
    P ~= rho*v*momentum
Which gave us Eq. 3.1.1-3:
    P = rho*v*v*m/3
once we had substituted m*v to represent the momentum of a particle. Since 
photons have zero mass, we must use a different expression to express the 
momentum of a photon. This is given by:
Eq. 3.1.7-1
    momentum_photon = E_photon/c
where E_photon is the photon energy, and c is the photon velocity (i.e. the 
speed of light, 2.997 x 10^10 cm/sec). It is interesting to compare this to 
an equivalent expression for massive particles: momentum = 2*KE/v. 
Substituting Eq. 3.1.7-1, and the photon velocity, into Eq. 3.1.1-3 give us:
Eq. 3.1.7-2
    P_rad = rho*c*(E_photon/c)/3 = rho*E_photon/3
Since rho*E_photon is simply the energy density of the photon gas, we can 
say:
Eq. 3.1.7-3
    P_rad = (U_rad/V)/3
From Eq. 3.1.6-3 it is clear that:
Eq. 3.1.7-4
    gamma_rad = 1 + 1/3 = 4/3

We can relate the energy density of a blackbody to the thermal radiation 
emissions (energy flux) from its surface (or from a window into an energy 
container). Assuming the energy field is isotropic, the flux is simply the 
product of the energy density and the average velocity with which the 
photons emerge from the radiating surface. Of course all of the photons have 
a total velocity equal to c, but only photons emitted normal to the surface 
(at right angles to it) emerge at this velocity. In general, the effective 
velocity of escape is Cos(theta)*c, where theta is the angle between the 
light ray and the normal vector. Now the fraction of a hemisphere 
represented by a narrow band with width d_theta around theta is 
Sin(theta)*d_theta. Integrating this from zero to 90 degrees gives (in 
Mathematica notation):
(U_rad/V)*Integrate[c*Cos(theta)*Sin(theta),{theta,0,90}] = (U_rad/V)*c/2 
Since the flux is isotropic, half of it is flowing away from the surface. We 
are only concerned with a the flux flowing out so we must divide it by 
another factor of two. This gives:
Eq. 3.1.7-5
    S = c*(U_rad/V)/4
where S is the flux (emission per unit area).

At equilibrium the radiation energy density is determined only by 
temperature, we want then to have a way for relating a temperature T to 
U_rad/V. Using Eq. 3.1.7-3 and a mathematically precise statement of the 
second law of thermodynamics, it is easy to show that U_rad/V is 
proportional to T^4. The standard constant of proportionality, called the 
Stefan-Boltzmann constant and designated sigma, is defined so that:
Eq. 3.1.7-6
    U_rad/V = (4*sigma/c)*T^4
This is a convenient way of formulating the constant, because it allows us 
to say:
Eq. 3.1.7-7
    S = sigma*T^4
Eq. 3.1.7-7 is known as the Stefan-Boltzmann Law. The Stefan-Boltzmann 
constant is derived from Planck's constant and the speed of light. It has 
the value 5.669 x 10^-5 erg/sec-cm^2-K, with T in degrees K. Equation 3.1.6-
3 of course becomes:
Eq. 3.1.7-8
    P_rad = (4*sigma/3*c)*T^4

It can easily be seen from the Stefan-Boltzmann Law that the amount of 
radiant energy present varies dramatically with temperature. At room 
temperature it is insignificant, but it grows very rapidly. At sufficiently 
high temperatures, the energy present in the blackbody field exceeds all 
other forms of energy in a system (which is then said to be "radiation 
dominated"). The average photon energy is directly proportional to T, which 
implies the photon density varies as T^3. In radiation dominated matter we 
can expect the number of photons present to be larger than the number of all 
other particles combined.

If both ordinary particles and photons are present, we have a mixture of 
Boltzmann and Bose gases. Each contribute independently to the energy 
density and pressure of the gas mixture. Since the kinetic energy pressure 
for a perfect gas is:
  PV = NkT -> P = nkT
and the kinetic energy is:
Eq. 3.1.67-9
  P = 2/3 KE/V = 2/3 U_kin/V -> U_kin/V = 3/2 nkT
we have:
Eq. 3.1.7-10
    P_total = nkT + (4*sigma/3*c)*T^4
and:
Eq. 3.1.7-11
    U_total/V = 3/2 nkT + (4*sigma/c)*T^4

We can calculate the relative kinetic and radiation contributions to both 
pressure and energy at different particle densities and temperatures. For 
example in hydrogen at its normal liquid density, radiation energy density 
is equal to the kinetic energy of the ionized gas at 1.3 x 10^7 degrees K.

The energy distribution of the radiation field with photon energy is given 
by Planck's Law, which is usually stated in terms of photon frequency 
instead of energy. The energy of a photon of frequency nu is simply:
Eq. 3.1.7-12
    E_phot = h*nu
where nu is in hertz (c/wavelength), and h is Planck's constant (6.62608 
x10^-27 erg-sec). Planck's law (aka the Planck function) is usually given 
as:
Eq. 3.1.7-13
    dE/dnu = ((8*Pi*h*nu^3)/c^3) * (1/(Exp(h*nu/kT) - 1))
where dE/dnu the energy density/frequency derivative. The last factor in the 
equation is of course the Bose-Einstein distribution factor. Integrating 
over a range of nu gives the energy density in that frequency range. For our 
purposes, it is often more convenient to express the energy density in terms 
of photon energy rather than frequency:
Eq. 3.1.7-1e
    dE/dE_phot = ((8*Pi*E_phot^3)/(h^3 c^3)) * (1/(Exp(E_phot/kT) - 1))

The Planck distribution always has its peak (the maximum spectral power) at 
h*nu_max = 2.822 kT, while 50% of the energy is carried by photons with 
energies greater than 3.505 kT, and 10% of the energy is above 6.555 kT. 
Most of the energy in the field is thus carried by photons with energies 
much higher than the average particle kinetic energy.

3.2       Properties of Matter</h3><pre>
I have already discussed one state of matter - gases - at some length. In 
this section I shift to the application of thermodynamic principles to other 
states of matter, and discuss some properties that are not strictly 
thermodynamic in nature.
 
3.2.1     Equations of State (EOS)
An _equation of state_ (EOS) provides a complete description of the 
thermodynamic properties of a substance; i.e. how the density, pressure, and 
internal energy of a substance relate to each other. The Ideal Gas Law is a 
special case of an equation of state for gases. The generalized gas EOS 
given previously:
     P = (gamma - 1)*(U/V)
expands the ideal law to all gases if an appropriate value of gamma is 
chosen.

Such a simple law is not really adequate for real substances over widely 
varying conditions. Even with comparatively simple substances such as gases, 
the effective value of gamma can change. As molecular gases increase in 
temperature more degrees of freedom may become excited, the gases may 
disassociate into atoms, and the atoms may become ionized. All of these 
processes drive down the value of gamma by absorbing energy that would 
otherwise appear as kinetic motion. By considering the regime of interest, 
we can usually choose a suitable value of gamma to permit the use of the 
simple gas equation. More sophisticated approaches are to provide terms for 
each mechanism that contributes to the total internal energy.

3.2.2     Condensed Matter
The term "condensed matter" refers to two of the three common states of 
matter: solids and liquids. It describes the fact that the matter is not 
gaseous, it has condensed to a compact form bound together by interatomic 
attractive forces. At zero pressure (or atmospheric pressure, which is the 
same thing for practical purposes) condensed matter exists in equilibrium. 
The negative pressure generated by the binding forces is exactly balanced by 
positive forces generated by the mutual repulsion of the outer electron 
shells (Coulomb repulsion) and the thermal motion of the atoms. Condensed 
matter thus does not expand to infinitely low density under zero pressure 
like a gas, it has a definite zero pressure density.

Another important difference between condensed matter and gases is the 
strength of the internal repulsive forces. Coulomb repulsion is much 
stronger than the kinetic forces produced by thermal motion in gases under 
ordinary conditions, which agrees with the common experience that a brick is 
harder to compress than air.

If the thermal energy in matter is low enough, the position of atoms are 
held in fixed positions by Coulomb repulsion - it is a solid. When the 
thermal vibrations become sufficiently energetic, the atoms break free from 
fixed lattice positions and can move around and the solid melts. 

3.2.3     Matter Under Ordinary Conditions
The operative definition of "ordinary conditions" I am using here are the 
conditions under which condensed matter exists. It will be shown below that 
regardless of its composition or initial state, at sufficiently extreme 
conditions of pressure or temperature matter ceases to be condensed and 
tends to behave like a perfect gas.

There are standard definitions of ordinary conditions: STP or Standard 
Temperature and Pressure (0 degrees C temperature, 760 mm Hg pressure); or 0 
degrees K and zero pressure. The conditions of normal human experience do 
not deviate much from STP, and the properties of most substances under these 
conditions are abundantly documented in numerous references. For our 
purposes "ordinary conditions" extends up to  temperatures of a few tens of 
thousands of degrees C, and pressures in the order of several megabars 
(millions of atmospheres). For comparison the conditions in the detonation 
wave of a powerful high explosive do not exceed 4000 degrees C and 500 
kilobars; the pressure at the center of the Earth is approximately 4 
megabars.  

Under our "ordinary conditions" the thermal energy of matter remains below 
both the binding and compressive energies. In this range matter is not 
appreciably ionized. Its mechanical strength is small compared to the 
pressures of interest, and can usually be neglected. 

Since increasing pressure also strengthens the repulsive forces between 
atoms by forcing them closer together, the melting point goes up as well. In 
the megabar range matter remains solid even at temperatures of 20-30,000 
degrees C. However it usually does not matter whether the condensed state is 
liquid or solid, the energy absorbed in melting being too small to notice 
compared to the compressive and thermal energies.

Some materials undergo abrupt phase changes (discontinuous changes in 
structure and density) in this realm. When phase changes occur with 
escalating pressure, atoms suddenly rearrange themselves into lower energy 
configurations that are denser. For example iron undergoes a phase change at 
130 kilobars. The transformation of delta phase plutonium alloys into the 
denser alpha phase at pressures of a few tens of kilobars is of particular 
significance.

Despite these differences and added complexities, we can still produce 
reasonable approximations for condensed matter equations of state using a 
"Gamma Law" similar to the gas law:
Eq. 3.2.3-1
     P + P_0 = (gamma - 1)*U*(rho/rho_0)
where P is the compression pressure at the state of interest, P_0 is the 
internal pressure at STP (or some other reference state), rho is the density 
of the state of interest, and rho_0 is the reference density. Note that P_0 
is exactly balanced by the negative binding pressure under reference 
conditions. 

This gives us an adiabatic law for condensed matter:
Eq. 3.2.3-2
     (P + P_0)*(rho_0/rho)^gamma = constant = P_0

The value of gamma, the "effective thermodynamic exponent", must be 
determined from experimental data. Unfortunately the value of gamma is not 
constant for condensed matter, it declines with increasing density and 
pressure. It is virtually constant below 100 kilobars, but the decline is in 
the range of 15-30% at 2 megabars. Although the rate of decline varies with 
substance, the low pressure value still gives a reasonable indication of 
compressibility of a substance at multi-megabar pressures.

The thermodynamic exponent is usually represented in the literature of solid 
state or condensed matter physics by the "Gruneisen coefficient" designated 
with the upper case Greek letter GAMMA. The relationship between them is:
Eq. 3.2.3-3
    GAMMA = gamma - 1

Representative values of P_0, density_0, and low pressure gamma for some 
materials of particular interest are given below: 
Table 3.2.3-1.

3.2.4     Matter At High Pressures
As pressures continue to increase above several megabars, the electronic 
structure of the atom begins to break down. The Coulomb forces become so 
strong that the outer electrons are displaced from the atomic nuclei. The 
material begins to resemble individual atomic nuclei swimming in a sea of 
free electrons, which is called an electron gas. This gas is governed by 
quantum mechanical laws, and since electrons belong to a class of particles 
called fermions (which obey Fermi-Dirac statistical laws), it is an example 
of a Fermi gas. 

In contrast to the Bose-Einstein gas of photons, where particles prefer to 
be in the same energy state, fermions cannot be in the same energy state. 
Even at absolute zero, the particles in a Fermi gas must have non-zero 
energy. The distribution factor for Fermi statistics is: 1/(Exp(E/kT) + 1).

If all of the electrons are in their lowest energy state, which means the 
gas is cold (no additional thermal energy), it is said to be Fermi 
degenerate. A fully degenerate state is the lowest energy state that a Fermi 
gas can be in. A degenerate Fermi gas is characterized by the Fermi energy, 
the highest energy state in the gas. This is given by:
Eq. 3.2.4-1
  E_Fermi = 5.84 x 10^-27 (n^(2/3)) erg = 3.65 x 10^-15 n^(2/3) eV
where n is the electron density (electrons/cm^3). The average electron 
energy is:
Eq. 3.2.4-2
  E_Favg = 3/5 E_Fermi
and the pressure produced, the Fermi pressure, is:
Eq. 3.2.4-3
  P_Fermi = 2/3 n*E_Favg = 2/5 n*E_Fermi = 2.34 x 10^-33 (n^(5/3)) bars
Note that relationship between the average energy and the pressure is 
precisely the same as that for a classical perfect gas.

When the average electron energy exceeds the binding energy of electrons in 
atoms, then the electrons behave as a Fermi gas. If only some of the outer 
electrons are loosely bound enough meet this criterion, then only these 
electrons count in determining the electron density in the equations above, 
the remainder continue to be bound to the atomic nuclei. 

The Fermi energy of a gas is sometimes characterized by the "Fermi 
Temperature" (or degeneracy temperature). This is defined as T_Fermi such 
that:
Eq. 3.2.4-4
  kT_Fermi = E_Fermi
This is not the actual temperature of the gas. Its significance is that if 
the kinetic temperature is substantially lower than T_Fermi then the kinetic 
energy is small compared to the Fermi energy and the gas can be treated 
reasonably well as if it were completely degenerate ("cold").

To illustrate these ideas here are some examples:
In uranium at twice normal density (37.8 g/cm^3) would have a Fermi energy 
of 156 eV, and a pressure of 895 megabars. This is much higher than the real 
pressure required to achieve this density (5.0 megabars), and indicates that 
the uranium is not a Fermi gas at this pressure.

A pressure of 100,000 megabars corresponds to a Fermi energy of 1034 eV, and 
an average energy of 621 eV. The average energy is about the same as the 
ionization energy for uranium's 38th ionization state. Thus we can expect 
about 41% of uranium's electrons to dissociate at this pressure, and 
contribute to the electron gas density (1.5 x 10^26 electrons/cm^3). This 
gives a density estimate of 1560 g/cm^3.

Deuterium at 1000 times normal liquid density (159 g/cm^3) is a true Fermi 
gas. It has E_Fermi = 447 eV (T_Fermi = 5.2 million degrees K), far higher 
than its ionization energy (13.6 eV), and P_Fermi = 12,500 megabars. What 
this says is that at least 12.5 gigabars of pressure is required to achieve 
the stated density, and that as long as the entropy increase during 
compression keeps the temperature below 5 million degrees, the gas can be 
considered cold and the compression process will be efficient. Pressures 
between 10 and 100 gigabars are representative of conditions required to 
create fusion in thermonuclear weapons. 

Since the only way a cold Fermi gas can acquire additional energy is in the 
form of electron kinetic energy, when the thermal energy is substantially 
above T_Fermi, then the kinetic energy dominates the system and the 
electrons behave like a classical Boltzmann gas.

Thus as the electronic shells of atoms break down, the value of gamma 
approaches a limiting value of 5/3 with respect to the total internal 
energy,  regardless of whether it is thermal or quantum mechanical in 
nature.

The total pressure present is the sum of the Fermi pressure, the kinetic 
pressure of the Boltzmann gas consisting of the nuclei and non-degenerate 
electrons, and the pressure of the photon Bose gas. Similarly, the energy 
density is the sum of the contributions from the Fermi, Boltzmann, and Bose 
gases that are present.

Now when electrons are stripped from atoms through thermal ionization, we 
also have an electron gas which is technically a Fermi gas. We rarely 
consider thermally ionized plasmas to be Fermi gases though, because usually 
the electron densities are so low that the thermal energy is much greater 
than the Fermi energy.

It is useful to note as a rule-of-thumb that most isotopes of most elements 
have a 1:1 neutron/proton ratio in the nucleus. Since the number of 
electrons is equal to the number of protons, we can assume that most 
substances contain a fixed number of electrons per unit mass: 0.5 moles/gram 
(3.01 x 10^23 electrons). This assumption allows us to relate mass density 
to the Fermi gas pressure without worrying about chemical or isotopic 
composition.

The stable isotopes of most light elements follow this rule very closely, 
for two that are commonly used as fuel in thermonuclear weapons (Li-6 and D) 
it is exact. Very heavy elements contain somewhat fewer electrons per gram, 
by 25-30%. The largest deviations are the lightest and heaviest isotopes of 
hydrogen: 1 mole/gram for ordinary hydrogen, and 0.333 moles/gram for 
tritium.

Approximate calculations of the process of shell break down can be conducted 
by means of the Thomas-Fermi Theory. This theory was employed at Los Alamos 
together with the existing high-pressure EOS data to perform the implosion 
calculations for the plutonium bomb. Elements with high electron densities 
(which from the above rule-of-thumb is more or less equivalent to elements 
with high mass densities) are described reasonably well by the Thomas-Fermi 
model at pressures above about 10 megabars.

3.2.5     Matter At High Temperatures
If the thermal or kinetic energy of the atoms in a substance exceeds the 
binding and compressive energies, then regardless of pressure it becomes a 
gas. In highly compressed condensed matter, this occurs at several tens of 
thousands of degrees C. When the kinetic energy substantially exceeds the 
combined energies of all other forms of energy present, matter behaves as a 
perfect gas.

At sufficiently high temperatures, the outer electrons of an atom can become 
excited to higher energy levels, or completely removed. Atoms with missing 
electrons are ions, and the process of electron removal is called 
ionization. Then number of electrons missing from an atom is its ionization 
state.  Excitation and ionization occurs through collisions between atoms, 
collisions between atoms and free electrons, and through absorption of 
thermal radiation photons. When all of the atoms have become ionized, then 
matter is said to be "fully ionized" (in contrast the phrase "completely 
ionized" usually refers to an atom that has had _all_ of its electrons 
removed).

The energy required to remove an unexcited electron is called the ionization 
energy. This energy increases with each additional electron removed from an 
atom due to the increase in ionic charge, and the fact that the electron may 
belong to a shell closer to the nucleus. The ionization energy for the first 
ionization state is typically a few electron volts. Hydrogen has one of the 
highest first ionization energies (13.6 eV), but most elements have first 
ionization energies of 4 - 10 eV. The energy required to remove the last 
electron from a plutonium atom (the 94th ionization state) in contrast is 
120 KeV. The first and last ionization energies for some elements common in 
nuclear weapons are:

Table 3.2.5 Representative First and Last Ionization Energies
Element   First Ionization  Last Ionization
Hydrogen   13.598 eV           -
Lithium     5.39  eV         3rd: 122.4 eV   
Beryllium   9.32  eV         4th: 217.7 eV
Oxygen     13.61  eV         8th: 871.1 eV
Uranium     6     eV         92nd: 115. KeV
Plutonium   6.06  eV         94th: 120. KeV

There is a simple law for computing the ionization energy of the last 
electron (the Zth ionization state for atomic number Z):
Eq. 3.2.5-1
     E_i_Z = Z^2 * 13.6 eV
For other ionization states, the other electrons bound to the nucleus 
provide partial screening of the positive charge of the nucleus and make the 
law more complex.

The energy required to excite an electron is less than the associated 
ionization energy (E_i). An excited electron is more easily removed from an 
atom, the energy required being exactly the difference between the unexcited 
ionization energy and the excitation energy. Under high pressures, excited 
electrons are subjected to strong Coulomb forces which tend to remove them 
from the atom. Also frequent atom-atom, atom-electron, and atom-photon 
interactions will tend to ionize the more weakly bound excited electron. 
Even if it is not removed, electrons tend to drop back to their ground state 
after awhile with the emission of a photon. Excitation is thus unimportant 
in dense, high pressure gases.

The average ionization state of a gas depends on the ionization energy for 
each ionization state, the temperature of the gas, and the density. At a 
temperature T, the average particle is kT. If this value is larger than the 
ionization energy of an electron attached to an atom, then an average 
collision will remove it (for hydrogen E_i corresponds to T = 158,000 
degrees K). We can thus expect the average ionization state to be at least 
equal to i, where i is the greatest ionization state with ionization energy 
less than or equal to kT.  In fact ionization can be appreciably greater 
than this, with higher states for denser gases at the same temperature due 
to more frequent collisions. If the gas density is comparable to the density 
of condensed matter, then the energy of i is typically in the order of 3kT - 
4kT. At the highest temperatures in fission weapons (50 to 100 million 
degrees K), uranium and plutonium can achieve ionization states of 80 to 85.

Ionization is a statistical process so often a mixture of ion states is 
present in varying proportions. At the densities and temperatures 
encountered here though, the effective spread in ionization states is quite 
narrow, and we can assume that there will effectively be only one ionization 
state at a given temperature.

Because kT = 120 KeV at 1.4 billion degrees K, complete ionization of these 
atoms would normally be expected only in the most extreme conditions  of 
thermonuclear weapons (densities of 200-500, and temperatures of 300-350 
million degrees), if at all. Note however, that at these extreme densities 
the atomic shells breakdown and matter exists as a Fermi gas rendering 
ionization moot.

Every electron dislodged from an atom becomes an independent particle and 
acquires its own thermal energy. Since the law E = NkT does not distinguish 
types of particles, at least half of the thermal energy of a fully ionized 
gas resides in this electron gas. At degrees of ionization greater much than 
1, the thermal energy of the atoms (ions) becomes unimportant.

Since an ordinary (as opposed to a quantum) electron gas can absorb energy 
only through kinetic motion, it is a perfect gas with gamma equal to 5/3. 
Although an electron gas is perfect, there are two processes that tend to 
drive the effective value of gamma down below 5/3 when considering large 
increases in internal energy. First, it should be apparent that ionization 
(and excitation) absorbs energy and thus reduces gamma. The second effect is 
due simply to the increase in N with increasing ionization state. The larger 
the number of free electrons, each sharing kT internal energy, the larger 
the sink is for thermal energy. This second effect tends to overwhelm the 
absorption of ionization energy as far as determining the total internal 
energy of the gas, but ionization has very important effects on shock waves 
(discussed below). These effects are especially pronounced in regimes where 
abrupt increases in ionization energy are encountered (e.g. the transition 
from an un-ionized gas to a fully ionized gas; and the point after the 
complete removal of an electron shell, where the first electron of a new 
shell is being removed). 

At high temperatures and ionization states (several millions of degrees and 
up), where large amounts of energy are required to dislodge additional 
electrons, both of these ionization effects can often be ignored since the 
net increase in electron number (and absorption of ionization energy) is 
small even with large increases in internal energy, and the energy gap 
between successive electron shells becomes very large.

At very high temperatures, the effect of radiant energy must be taken into 
account when evaluating the equation of state. Since the energy present as a 
blackbody spectrum photon gas increases as the fourth power of temperature, 
while the kinetic energy increases approximately proportionally with 
temperature (it would be strictly proportional but for the increase in N 
through ionization), at a sufficiently high temperature the radiation field 
dominates the internal energy of matter. In this realm the value of gamma is 
equal to that of a photon gas: 4/3.

3.3       Interaction of Radiation and Matter</h3><pre>
fnord
Photons interact with matter in three ways - they can be absorbed, emitted, 
or scattered - although many different physical processes can cause these 
interactions to occur. For photons with thermal energies comparable to the 
temperatures encountered in thermonuclear weapons, the only significant 
interactions with matter are with electrons. The mechanisms by which photons 
and electrons interact are conveniently divided into three groups: bound-
bound, bound-free, and free-free. Bound-bound refers to interactions in 
which both the initial and final states of the electron involved are bound 
to an atom. Bound-free describes interactions in which one state is bound to 
an atom, and the other is a free electron (it doesn't matter whether it is 
the initial or final state). Free-free interactions are ones in which the 
electron remains free throughout.

Now each mechanism of photon interaction can operate in a forward or reverse 
direction. That is, a process that absorbs a photon can also operate in 
reverse and cause photon emission (making absorption and emission two sides 
of the same coin); or a scattering process that removes energy from a photon 
can also add energy. This principle is called *microscopic reversibility*. 

Frequently, when solving practical problems, we would rather not consider 
each individual mechanism of interaction by itself. It is often preferable 
to have coefficients that describe the overall optical properties of the 
medium being considered. Thus we have absorption coefficients, which combine 
all of the individual absorption mechanisms, emission coefficients, and 
scattering coefficients. Normally we just talk about absorption and 
scattering coefficients (designated k_a and k_s) because we can combine the 
absorption and emission processes, which offset each other, into a single 
coefficient (calling this combined coefficient an "absorption coefficient" 
is just a matter of convenience). Henceforth, "absorption coefficient" will 
include both absorption and emission unless otherwise stated. To 
characterize the optical properties of the medium (also called the 
"opacity") with a single number we can use the "total absorption 
coefficient" (also called the attenuation or extinction coefficient), which 
is the sum of the absorption and the scattering coefficients.

Since, with few exceptions, the cross section of each mechanism of 
interaction varies with photon energy, the optical coefficients vary with 
photon energy as well. If we are dealing a monoenergetic flux of photons 
(like laser beams) then we need to have absorption and scattering 
coefficients for that particular photon frequency. If the flux contains 
photons of different energies then we must compute overall coefficients that 
average the spectral coefficients over the spectral distribution.

The process of averaging opacity over the photon frequency spectrum is  
straightforward only if we can assume that all photon emissions are 
spontaneous (independent of other photons). This is valid if the medium is 
optically thin, that is, much less than an absorption mean free path in 
extent. This type of mean free path is called the Planck mean free path. If 
the medium is optically thick (much larger in extent than the absorption 
mean free path) then this assumption is not valid. Due to the quantum 
statistical behavior of photons, the presence of photons increases the 
likelihood of photon emission to a value above the spontaneous level. This 
effect ("stimulated emission") is responsible for both the existence of the 
blackbody spectrum, and of the phenomenon of lasing. When this effect is 
taken into account during the averaging process, the result is known as the 
Rosseland mean free path.

In addition to the total absorption coefficient k, the opacity of a medium 
can be measured using the mean opacity coefficient K. K is a density 
normalized measure, given in units of cm^2/g (that is total absorption cross 
section per gram), while k is the actual opacity of the medium at its 
prevailing density and is given in units of cm^-1. Although K is normalized 
for mass density, it is often more informative for our purposes to express 
it in terms of particle or atom density (cm^2/mole). The coefficients K and 
k are related to the total photon mean free path (l_phot) by:
Eq. 3.3-1
     l_phot = 1/(K*rho) = 1/k

3.3.1     Thermal Equilibrium
In a system in thermal equilibrium the *principle of detailed balancing* 
also applies. This principle holds that each process is exactly balanced by 
its exact opposite so that the net state of the system is unchanged.

We have already seen that in an equilibrium system, the intensity of the 
radiation field and its spectrum are governed by the blackbody radiation 
laws which hold without reference to the actual mechanisms of photon 
emission and absorption. This indicates that in a fundamental sense, these 
mechanisms are basically irrelevant to determining the state of the 
radiation field in the system. The rates at which they occur are governed by 
quantum principles so that they always generate a blackbody field. If the 
optical coefficients as a function of photon energy are known then computing 
the overall coefficients across the whole radiation spectrum is 
straightforward.

Now having said this, a little qualification is in order. The mechanisms of 
absorption and emission can produce local features in the blackbody 
spectrum. For example, a strong absorption line can create a narrow gap at a 
particular frequency. The energy missing in this gap will be exactly 
balanced by the increased intensity in the remainder of the spectrum, which 
will retain the same relative frequency-dependent intensities of the ideal 
black body spectrum.

A second caveat is that the blackbody spectrum only applies to systems in 
thermal equilibrium. Specific mechanisms can dominate non-equilibrium 
situations, and can occur without significant counterbalance by the reverse 
process. Laser emission and fluorescent emission are common examples of non-
equilibrium processes. 

Although the specific interaction mechanisms in an equilibrium system do not 
affect the radiation spectrum, they still affect the optical coefficients 
because the photon-matter interaction cross sections, and thus the spectral 
coefficients, do depend on the mechanisms involved. The physics of these 
mechanisms is often extremely complex (especially the bound-bound and bound-
free processes), even the process of developing simplifying approximations 
is hard. It is thus often very difficult to determine what the values of the 
optical coefficients should be.

If a system approximates thermal equilibrium then the blackbody spectrum can 
be used to compute overall optical coefficients for the medium. The 
coefficients vary with temperature, not only because the peak of the 
blackbody spectrum varies with temperature, but because the interaction 
mechanisms are usually temperature dependent also (and may be density 
dependent as well). 

Approximate thermal equilibrium occurs where the change in the radiation 
field is gradual with respect to both distance and time (these are necessary 
and sufficient). Gradual change with distance means that the change in 
energy density is relatively small over the distance l_phot. Gradual change 
with time means that the energy density does not change much over a 
radiation relaxation period. Radiation relaxation is usually so fast that 
this last condition is of little importance. Since typically the spectral 
mean free path typically changes with frequency, it is possible for only a 
portion of the spectrum to be in equilibrium. If the portions of the 
spectrum that are not in equilibrium make only a small contribution to the 
energy density, they can be ignored.

The conditions for thermal equilibrium exist in the interior (at least one 
optical thickness from the surface) of an optically thick body where the 
transport process is dominated by scattering. This situation also ensures 
the existence of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE), that is the 
radiation field and matter are in thermodynamic equilibrium at every point 
in the medium. LTE guarantees that the spectral distribution of the flux 
will be a blackbody spectrum, and further that the spectrum at any point 
will be determined by the temperature at that point.

3.3.2     Photon Interaction Mechanisms
It is useful to survey the mechanisms by which matter and energy interact in 
more detail, to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that affect 
opacity. In some systems of interest (such as fully ionized matter) the 
coefficient can be calculated directly from the underlying interaction 
mechanisms, in others it may be extremely difficult and require experimental 
validation.

If fact often it is not practical to calculate opacity values directly from 
basic principles. In these cases they must be determined by direct 
measurements in the systems of interest. It is also possible to estimate 
upper and lower bounding values, but these are often very loose.

3.3.2.1   Bound-Bound Interactions
These interactions occur when an electron bound to an atom (or ion) moves 
between energy levels as a result of photon capture or emission. Capture 
raises the electron to a higher energy level, emission causes the electron 
to drop to a lower one. The phenomena known as fluorescence is the process 
of capturing a photon, followed by the emission of a lower energy photon as 
the excited electron drops back to its ground state through some 
intermediate energy absorbing process. 

Photon capture by this mechanism requires that that the photon energy 
correspond exactly to the energy difference between the energy level an 
electron is currently occupying, and a higher one. The capture cross section 
for a photon meeting this criteria is extremely large, otherwise it is zero. 
Quantum uncertainty gives the absorption line a narrow finite width, rather 
than the zero width an infinite precision match would indicate.

In principle any atom has an infinite number of possible energy levels. In 
practice, at some point the binding energy to the atom is so weak that the 
electron is effectively free. The hotter and denser matter gets, the lower 
is the energy level (and the greater is the binding energy) where this 
occurs.

In hot dense gases that are not completely ionized (stripped of electrons) 
line absorption contributes significantly to the opacity of the gas, and may 
even dominate it.

Fermi gases resemble completely ionized gases in that no electron is bound 
to a nucleus. In both cases bound-bound transitions between atomic quantum 
energy levels cannot occur. Fermi gases have quantum energy levels of their 
own however, and bound-bound transition between these energy levels are 
possible.

3.3.2.2   Bound-Free Interactions
The process in which a bound electron absorbs a photon with energy at least 
equal to its binding energy, and thereby is dislodged from the atom is 
called the photoelectric effect. This process can occur with any photon more 
energetic than the binding energy. The cross section for this process is 
quite significant. When matter is being heated by a thermal photon flux 
(that is, the matter is not in thermal equilibrium with the flux), 
photoelectric absorption tends to dominate the opacity.

The reverse process by which atoms capture electrons and emit photons is 
called radiative electron capture. The balance between these two processes 
maintains the ionization state of an equilibrium gas.

3.3.2.3   Free-Free Interactions
There are two principal mechanisms by which photons interact with free 
electrons. These are a photon emission process called bremsstrahlung (and 
its reverse absorption process), and photon scattering. Naturally, these are 
the only processes that occur in a completely ionized gas (atoms are 
completely stripped). In a highly ionized gas (all atoms are ionized, and 
most but not all of the electrons have been removed) these processes often 
dominate the opacity. Theoretically free-free interactions are much easier 
to describe and analyze than the bound-bound and bound-free processes.

3.3.2.3.1 Bremsstrahlung Absorption and Emission
The term "bremsstrahlung" is German and means "slowing down radiation". It 
occurs when an electron is slowed down through being scattering by an ion or 
atom. The momentum, and a small part of the energy, is transferred to the 
atom; the remaining energy is emitted as a photon. Inverse bremsstrahlung 
(IB) occurs when a photon encounters an electron within the electric field 
of an atom or ion. Under this condition it is possible for the electron to 
absorb the photon, with the atom providing the reaction mass to accommodate 
the necessary momentum change. In principal bremsstrahlung can occur with 
both ions and neutral atoms, but since the range of the electric field of an 
ion is much greater than that of a neutral atom, bremsstrahlung is a 
correspondingly stronger phenomenon in an ionized gas.

In a bremsstrahlung event, we have:
    m_e*d_v_e = m_i*d_v_i
due to the conservation of momentum (m_e and d_v_e are the electron mass and 
velocity change, m_i and d_v_i are for the ion). Which gives us:
    m_i/m_e = d_v_e/d_v_i
Since m_i/m_e (the mass ratio between the ion and electron) is 1836*A (where 
A is the atomic mass of the ion), the velocity change ratio is 1/1836*A. 
Kinetic energy is proportional to m*v^2, so the kinetic energy change for 
the ion is only about 1/1836*A of the energy gained or lost by the electron. 
Bremsstrahlung/IB is thus basically a mechanism that exchanges energy 
between photons and electrons. Coupling between photons and ions must be 
mediated by ion-electron collisions, which requires on the order of 1836*A 
collisions.

Unlike the bound-bound and bound-free processes, whose macroscopic cross 
section is proportional to the density of matter, the bremsstrahlung/IB 
cross sections increase much faster with increasing density. It thus tends 
to dominate highly ionized, high density matter.

The absorption coefficient k_v from bremsstrahlung (assuming a Maxwellian 
electron velocity distribution at temperature T) in cm^-1 is:
Eq. 3.3.2.3.1-1
   k_v = 3.69 x 10^8 (1 - Exp(-h*nu/k*T))(Z^3 * n_i^2)/(T^0.5 * nu^3)
or
Eq. 3.3.2.3.1-2
   k_v = 2.61 x 10^-35 (1 - Exp(-pe/k*T))(Z^3 * n_i^2)/(T^0.5 * pe^3)
where Z is the ionic charge, n_i is the ion density, T is the electron 
temperature (K), and nu is the photon frequency, h is Planck's constant 
(6.624 x 10^-27 erg cm^2/sec), k is Boltzmann's constant, pe is photon 
energy (eV), and the other units are CGS.

We can compute the effective overall absorption coefficient by averaging 
across the frequency spectrum:
Eq. 3.3.2.3.1-3
   k_1 = 6.52 x 10^-24 (Z^3 * n_i^2)/(T^3.5)
The absorption mean free path (in cm)is simply 1/k_1:
Eq. 3.3.2.3.1-4
   l_1 = 1.53 x 10^23 (T^3.5)/(Z^3 * n_i^2)

The total amount of energy emitted per cm^3 per sec (assuming electron and 
photon thermal equilibrium) is:
Eq. 3.3.2.3.1-5
 e = 1.42 x 10^-27 Z^3 n_i^2 T^0.5 ergs/cm^3-sec

The mean free path formulae given above is based on the assumption that all 
photon emissions are spontaneous (i.e. the medium is optically thin). 
Compensating for stimulated emission gives us the Rosseland mean free path 
for bremsstrahlung, which is longer than the spontaneous value by a constant 
factor:
Eq. 3.3.2.3.1-6
   l_R = 4.8 x 10^24 (T^3.5)/(Z^3 * n_i^2)

3.3.2.3.2 Scattering
All of the processes described so far are absorption and emission processes 
which involve photon destruction and creation, and necessarily exchange 
substantial amounts of energy between matter and the radiation field. Photon 
scattering does not, in general, involve significant exchanges in energy 
between particles and photons. Photon direction and thus momentum is 
changed, which implies a momentum and energy change with the scattering 
particle. But photon momentum is usually so small that the energy exchange 
is extremely small as well.  

3.3.2.3.2.1 Thomson Scattering
The only way a photon can interact with an electron in the absence of a 
nearby atom or ion is to be scattered by it. In classical physics this 
scattering process (which is due to the electron acting as a classical 
oscillator) cannot change the photon energy and has a fixed cross section 
known as the Thomson cross section, which is 6.65 x 10^-25 cm^2. This is 
multiplied by the electron density to obtain the scattering coefficient k_s. 
The scattering mean free path is then:
Eq. 3.3.2.3.2.1-7
   l_s = 1.50 x 10^24 /(Z * n_i)

Referring to Eq. 3.3.3.1-3, above we can see that at a sufficiently high 
temperature, the bremsstrahlung absorption coefficient may become smaller 
than the Thomson coefficient, which will then tend to control radiation 
transport.

3.3.2.3.2.2 Compton Scattering
When the photon energy becomes comparable to the electron rest-mass (511 
KeV), the photon momentum is no longer negligible and an effect called 
Compton scattering occurs. This results in a larger energy-dependent 
scattering cross section. Compton scattering transfers part of the energy of 
the photon to the electron, the amount transferred depends on the photon 
energy and the scattering angle. 511 KeV is an energy much higher than the 
typical thermal photon energies encountered in our domain of interest. At 
high thermonuclear temperatures (35 KeV) a significant proportion of photons 
in the upper end of the Planck spectrum will undergo this process.

In a hot gas, where electrons have substantial kinetic energy, inverse 
Compton scattering also occurs which transfers energy from the electron to 
the photon.

3.3.3     Opacity Laws
As noted earlier, the actual opacity of a material is the sum of the 
absorption and scattering coefficients:
Eq. 3.3.3-1
    k_t = k_a + k_s
The total photon mean free path is then:
Eq. 3.3.3-2
    l_phot = 1/k_t = 1/(k_a+k_s) = 1/((1/l_a)+(1/l_s)) = (l_a*l_s)/(l_a+l_s)

The absorption and scattering coefficients, k_a and k_s, are in turn the sum 
of all of the component absorption and scattering processes described in the 
subsections above. In some cases, not all of these are present to a 
significant extent, but in others there may be many contributors. In 
performing photon transport calculations though, it is very undesirable to 
individually model and compute each interaction process. These processes 
tend to be rather complicated in form and, at worst, are almost intractably 
difficult to compute. Simulations that include photon transport as but one 
component would be exorbitantly expensive computation-wise if these 
processes were always included explicitly. And it is completely impossible 
to conduct analytical studies of transport processes without introducing 
radical simplifications.

Formulating laws of simpler form is essential to the practical study of 
photon transport. These law are approximations that describe the dependency 
of the total opacity on temperature and density in the range of interest. 
They are not universally valid and care must be taken to ensure that the law 
chosen is actually applicable in the range where it is to be applied.  

A popular form of an opacity law is:
3.3.3-3
     K = (K_0 * rho^C * T^-m) + K_1
where K, K_0, and K_1 are the opacities in cm^2/g, rho is density, T is 
temperature, and C and m are constants. 

Opacity laws are simplest when we can assume complete ionization of the 
material. For an optically thick medium we can easily derive these factors 
from Equation 3.3.2.3.1-6 and 3.3.2.3.1-7:
m = 3.5;
C = 1; and
K_0 = 2.1x10^-25 * Z^3 * (Avg/A)^2;
K_1 = 6.65x10^-25 * Z * (Avg/A);
where Z is the atomic number, Avg is Avogadro's Number, A is the atomic 
mass. The first term is due entirely to bremsstrahlung, and the second term 
(K_1) is due to Thomson scattering.

For fusion fuels, usually mixtures of hydrogen, lithium, and helium, 
complete ionization can be assumed due to their relatively low ionization 
temperatures, and this law is applicable. Higher Z materials that may be 
used in the construction of nuclear weapons, like carbon, aluminum, iron, 
lead, tungsten, and uranium must take into account the effects of bound 
electrons. For these higher Z materials an m value of 1.5 to 2.5 is typical. 
For very high Z materials, like uranium, an m value of 3 is commonly 
assumed. Since absorption through bound electrons is due to photon-atom (or 
photon-ion) interactions, for a given ionization state opacity should be 
roughly proportional to atom (ion) density giving us C = 0. Strict 
proportionality doesn't occur since the ionization state is affected by 
density.

The appropriate values of K_0 for high Z materials at the densities and 
temperatures of interest are not readily available however. In the United 
States, opacities for elements with Z > 71 are still classified. Even for 
elements with Z < 71, for which the opacities are not classified, U.S. 
government data has not yet been released, and little information from other 
sources appears available in the public domain.

Parameters for the opacity law can be derived for some elements with Z up to 
40 from figures published in Los Alamos Report LAMS-1117. This document 
covers temperatures (0.5 - 8 KeV) and densities (1-30 g/cm^3 for carbon, 
3.5-170 g/cm^3 for copper) in the range of interest for radiation implosion 
systems.

Table 3.3.4-1 Opacity Law Parameters 
Element    Z   m    C    K_0    K_1
Carbon     6  4.9  0.92  0.074  0.22
Aluminum  13  5.0  0.93  1.4    0.21
Iron      26  2.9  0.62  6.6    0.15
Copper    29  2.7  0.55  7.0    0.14
Zirconium 40  1.8  0.72  1.2    0.15

Although some general trends seem apparent in the table above, they cannot 
be extrapolated easily to much higher Z values. We can see that zirconium 
disrupts trends in C and K_0 indicated by Z=6 through Z=29. As we ascend the 
periodic table and electron shells are successively filled, and new ones 
started, abrupt changes in ionization behavior, and hence opacity will 
occur. 

3.3.4     Radiation Transport 
fnord
The transport of radiation through matter often alters the physical state of 
matter in significant ways. Matter absorbs and emits radiation which leads 
to it heating up and cooling down. The existence of significant radiation 
transport implies the existence of energy density and temperature gradients, 
which in turn imply the existence of pressure gradients. Given sufficient 
time, pressure gradients may lead to fluid flow, and changes in the density 
of matter. Problems that include both the motion of matter and radiation are 
the domain of radiation hydrodynamics, which is discussed in another 
subsection below. This subsection generally treats the properties of matter 
as being static (not affected by the transport process), although the 
effects of heating are considered under radiation heat conduction.

When a ray of photons pass through a layer of matter, the initial flux is 
attenuated according to the law:
Eq. 3.3.4-1
    I_x = I_0 * Exp[-x/l_phot]
The flux attenuates exponentially, decreasing to 1/e over a thickness equal 
to the photon MFP. The ratio x/l_phot is called the "optical thickness", 
usually designated "tau". If the optical coefficient is not constant through 
a layer, then its optical thickness may be found simply be integrating k_t 
along the photon path.

The energy flux actually deposited in a thin layer of thickness dx located 
at x_1 is:
Eq. 3.3.4-2
    I_x = k_a*dx*I_x_1 = k_a*dx*I_0*Exp[-x_1/l_phot]
since only the absorption cross section actually deposits energy in the 
layer.

This model of pure attenuation assumes that photon emission by the layer is 
not significant. If photon emission does occur then instead of merely 
attenuating towards zero, the photon flux will converge to an equilibrium 
value, e.g. the radiation field and matter will relax to state of 
equilibrium. The photon MFP provides the distance scale required for 
establishing equilibrium, and accordingly is sometimes called the 
"relaxation length". Since the velocity of photons is c (the speed of 
light), the relaxation time is l_phot/c.

An additional limitation of this model which remains even when photon 
emission is taken into account is that it treats only a "ray" of photons - a 
beam in which all photons travel in the same direction. In practice, there 
is always an angular distribution of the photon flux around the net 
direction of radiation flow. When the flux drops off rapidly as the angle 
from the net direction of flow increases, then the "ray" model remains a 
good approximation. 

When there is a substantial flux at large angles from the net direction of 
flow, then other models of photon transport are needed. Photon fluxes with 
large angular spreads inevitably arise when the flux travels through a 
medium that is several optical thicknesses across, since photons are quickly 
scattered in all directions. Two important approaches to approximating such 
situations are radiation diffusion and radiation heat conduction. 

A final limitation should be noted concerning the "ray" model. For a beam of 
photons originating outside of the optically thin medium and travelling 
through it, the spectral distribution of the flux can be anything at all - a 
monoenergetic flux like a laser beam, a Boltzmann distribution, etc. A 
single absorption and scattering cross section can only be used if the 
spectral cross sections are appropriately weighted for the flux spectrum.  

3.3.4.1   Radiation Diffusion
Radiation diffusion (based on the application of diffusion theory) describes 
photon transport where the energy density gradient is small, i.e. in 
conditions of approximate local thermal equilibrium (LTE). This situation 
exists in the interior (at least one optical thickness from the surface) of 
any optically thick body.

The rate of energy is determined by the diffusion equation:
Eq. 3.3.4.1-1
     S = -((l_phot*c)/3) * Grad(U)
where S is the energy flux (flow rate), c is the speed of light, U is the 
enrgy density, and Grad(U) is the energy density gradient (the rate at which 
energy density changes with distance along the vector J). Due to the gradual 
change in state in diffusion, if the thickness of the body is x then the 
flux can be approximated by:
Eq. 3.3.4.1-2
     S = ((l_phot*c)/x) * U
That is, the flux is inversely proportional to the optical thickness.

During diffusion, photons are scattered repeatedly and advance in a random 
walk, travelling much farther than the straight-line distance. In the 
diffusion process a photon undergoes on the order of (x/l_phot)^2 
interactions which the material while advancing the distance x. The 
characteristic diffusion time t_diff is thus (x^2/(c*l_phot)). When the 
physical scale of a system is much larger than the photon MFP, the photon 
field is effectively trapped and is always in local equilibrium with the 
state of the material, and it is possible for the material to flow faster 
than the photon flux itself. In the case of stars, where l_phot is on the 
order of a millimeter, but x is on the order of a million kilometers, it can 
take millions of years for photons created in the interior to diffuse to the 
surface (they are absorbed and reemitted many times during the journey of 
course)!

It is interesting to note that the Rosseland mean free path is equal to the 
spectral mean free path when the energy of photons is given by:
   hv = 5.8 kT
This means that when a body is optically thick, and radiant energy transport 
occurs through radiation diffusion, the main energy transport is due to 
photons with energies much higher than the average particle kinetic energy. 
On the other hand when a body is optically thin, and energy is radiated from 
the entire volume, then most of the energy is transported by photons with 
energies only moderately higher than the average kinetic energy.

This phenomenon is almost always true to some extent, and can greatly affect 
radiation transport. If the MFP increases with energy (as it does with 
bremmstrahlung in optically thick bodies), then energy transport is due to 
very energetic photons which may only comprise a small fraction of the 
radiation field. On the other hand, the converse may be true. This is the 
case during early fireball growth in nuclear explosion, when only the 
radiation in the normal optical range can escape to infinity from the X-ray 
hot fireball.

3.3.4.2   Radiation Heat Conduction

*******
This approximation of radiation transport is very closely related to the 
diffusion approximation, and like diffusion applies when LTE exists. The 
principle difference between radiation heat conduction and diffusion is that 
the conduction equations are based on temperature gradients, rather than 
energy density gradients. This is important because at LTE, the temperature 
of matter and radiation are equal, and the physical state and thermodynamic 
properties of matter are a function of temperature. If we want to take into 
account the effects of radiation heating on matter then we must treat the 
problem in terms of temperature.

Before considering radiation heat conduction, it is helpful to first look at 
ordinary heat conduction - the familiar conduction process encountered in 
everyday life.

The ordinary conductive heat flux is given by:
Eq. 3.3.4.2-1
     S = -kappa * Grad(T)
where S in the flux, kappa is the coefficient of thermal conductivity of hte 
material, and Grad(T) is the tmeperature gradient. Since the conductive flux is 
proportional to the temperature gradient this is called linear heat conduction. 

Eq. 3.3.4.2-2
     S = -((l_phot*c)/3) * Grad(U) 
       = -((l_phot*c)/3) * Grad((4*sigma*T^4)/c)
Eq. 3.3.4.2-3
     kappa = ((l_phot*c)/3) * dU/dT = (16 * l_phot * sigma * T^3)/3
Eq. 3.3.4.2-4
     c_rad = dU/dT = (16 * sigma * T^3)/c
Eq. 3.3.4.2-5
     l_phot = A * T^m, m > 0
Eq. 3.3.4.2-6
     kappa = (16 * sigma * A * T^n)/3 = BT^n, n = m + 3

Eq. 3.3.4.2-
     chi = kappa/(rho * c_p)
Eq. 3.3.4.2-
     chi = (l_mol * v_mean)/3
Eq. 3.3.4.2-
     chi = kappa/(rho * c_v) = ((l_phot*c)/3) * c_rad/(rho*c_v)
Eq. 3.3.4.2-
     chi = (B * T^n)/(rho * c_v) = a * T^n
(after this, do thermal waves, then implosion processes and extreme 
compression)

3.4       Hydrodynamics</h3><pre>
Hydrodynamics (also called gas or fluid dynamics) studies the flow of 
compressible fluids, and the changes that occur in the state of the fluid 
under different conditions. Radiation gas dynamics adds the energy transfer 
effects of thermal radiation. This becomes significant only when the gas is 
hot enough for radiation transport to be appreciable compared to the energy 
transport of fluid flow. Before dealing with the effects of radiation, it is 
necessary to review the basics of conventional hydrodynamics.

3.4.1     Acoustic Waves
Any local pressure disturbance in a gas that is not too strong will be 
transmitted outward at the speed of sound. Such a spreading disturbance is 
called an acoustic wave. This speed, designated c_s, is a function of gas 
pressure, density (rho) and gamma; or equivalently by the temperature and R 
(the universal gas constant per unit mass):
Eq. 3.4.1-1
     c_s = (gamma*pressure/rho)^0.5 = (gamma*R*T)^0.5

Since we have previously dealt with k (Boltzmann's constant), n (particle 
density), and rho (mass density) but not R is useful to note that:
Eq. 3.4.1-2
     R = k*n/rho = k*m_part
where m_part is the average mass of a particle.

If the local pressure disturbance is cyclical in nature, creating 
alternating high and low pressures, a series of acoustic waves is produced 
that evokes the sensation of sound. The pressure of sound waves is usually 
quite weak compared to ambient air pressure, for example even a 130 dB sound 
(an intensity that inflicts pain and auditory damage on humans) causes only 
a 0.56% variation in air pressure.

3.4.2     Rarefaction and Compression Waves
A disturbance that decreases gas pressure is called a rarefaction wave, a 
disturbance that increases pressure is a compression wave. With either type 
of acoustic wave the change in state of the gas is essentially adiabatic.

When a gas is adiabatically expanded the speed of sound decreases, when it 
is adiabatically compressed c_s  increases. The speed of sound thus 
decreases behind the leading edge of a rarefaction wave, and increases 
behind the leading edge of a compression wave. Because of this rarefaction 
waves tend to stretch out as the propagate, each portion of the disturbance 
progressively lagging farther and farther behind the leading edge which 
propagates at the speed of the undisturbed gas. Lagging portions of 
compression waves tend to catch up with the leading edge since they 
propagate at higher speeds through the disturbed (compressed) gas. The 
pressure profile of the compression wave thus becomes steeper and steeper. 
When a portion of the wave catches up with the leading edge, the slope at 
that point becomes infinitely steep, i.e. a sudden pressure jump occurs. A 
wave that causes an instantaneous pressure increase is called a shock wave.

3.4.3     Hydrodynamic Shock Waves
Compression waves are fundamentally unstable. They naturally tend to steepen 
in time and eventually (if they propagate long enough) will become 
infinitely steep: a shock wave. On the other hand, rarefaction waves are 
stable and a rarefaction shock (a sudden pressure drop) is impossible.

3.4.3.1   Classical Shock Waves
The idealized representation of shock waves used in shock wave theory 
assumes the pressure jump at the front of the wave is a mathematical 
discontinuity. When a particle of matter passes through an ideal shock front 
it undergoes an instantaneous change in state. The pressure it is subjected 
to increases, it is compressed to higher density, its temperature increases, 
and it acquires velocity in the direction of shock wave travel. 

A classical shock wave is distinguished from non-classical shocks by the 
assumption that the only process of energy transport or change of state 
present is the shock compression itself.

A diagram of such a shock wave is given below. The subscript 0 designates 
the initial unshocked state, and 1 designates the shock compressed state.

                     Shock Front

There is a fundamental difference between continuous compression waves and  
shock waves. The change of state in a compression wave is always adiabatic 
no matter how steep the pressure profile. It can be shown theoretically that 
in an instantaneous pressure jump adiabatic compression is impossible, there 
must be an increase in entropy. 

Of course truly instantaneous changes cannot occur in reality. So, just how 
sudden is this shock transition really? It turns out that the shock 
transition occurs over a distance which is on the order of the molecular 
collision mean free path in the substance propagating the shock wave. That 
is to say, only one or two collisions are sufficient to impart the new 
shocked state to matter passing through the shock front. In condensed 
matter, this path length is on the order of an atomic diameter. The shock 
front is thus on the order of 1 nanometer thick! Since shock waves propagate 
at a velocity of thousands of meters per second, the transition takes on the 
order of 10^-13 seconds (0.1 picoseconds)!!

Physically the change in entropy in real shock waves is brought about by 
viscous forces and heat conduction connected with the discrete nature of 
matter at the scale of the shock front thickness. Since even very fast 
continuous compression occurs many orders of magnitude slower than shock 
compression, with a compression front thickness correspondingly thicker, 
viscosity is almost always negligible (thus validating the idea of adiabatic 
compression).

The shock velocity D is always supersonic with respect to the unshocked 
matter. That is, D is always higher than the speed of sound c_s for the 
material through which the shock is propagating.

The shock velocity is always _subsonic_ with respect to the compressed 
material behind the front. That is, D - u_p is always less than the speed of 
sound in the shock compressed material. This means that disturbances behind 
the shock front can catch up to the shock wave and alter its behavior.

Obviously a shock wave does work (expends energy) as it travels since it 
compresses, heats, and accelerates the material it passes through. The fact 
that events behind the shock front can catch up to it allows energy from 
some source or reservoir behind the shock wave (if any) to replenish the 
energy expended (a fact of great significance in detonating high 
explosives).

Mathematically it is often simpler to view a shock front as stationary, and 
assume that matter is flowing into the shock front at a velocity u_0 equal 
to -D, and that it is compressed and decelerated to u_1 by passing through 
the front (u_1 = u_p - D). This is actually the natural way of viewing shock 
waves in certain situations, like the supersonic flow of air into a nozzle.

It is also often convenient to use the "specific volume" instead of density 
to simplify the mathematics. Specific volume v_0 is defined as 1/rho_0; v_1 
= 1/rho_1.

There is a simple relationship between u_0, u_1, and the density ratio 
between the shocked and unshocked material (rho_1/rho_0). It can easily be 
understood by considering the requirement for the conservation of mass. 
Since matter cannot accumulate in the infinitely thin shock front, the mass 
flow rate on either side must be the same. That is:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-1
     u_0*rho_0 = u_1*rho_1 
which gives:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-2
     u_0/u_1 = rho_1/rho_0 = D/(D - u_p)

We can gain some intuitive idea of the behavior of a shock wave by examining 
some limiting cases, very weak and very strong shocks. When we talk about 
the strength of a shock wave a number of different measures of "strength" 
can be used. In ordinary gases (i.e. not condensed matter) the pressure 
ratio p_1/p_0, or the Mach number (D/c_s) are convenient. In either case a 
very weak shock was a value not much higher than 1, a very strong shock has 
a value of 10-100 (easy to reach for a gas at atmospheric pressure).

Since the "initial pressure" in condensed matter cannot be measured 
directly, we use the absolute pressure increase instead of pressure ratios 
for measuring shock strength. Absolute shock velocity, or more rarely Mach 
number, is also used. To reach similar limiting "strong shock" conditions 
for condensed matter, shock velocities of >30 km/sec, and pressures of 10-
100 megabars are required, and are beyond the reach of chemical explosives 
(maximum values are about 400 kilobars and 9 km/sec).

A very weak shock wave travels only very slightly faster than sound, it 
creates a small pressure increase behind the front, imparts a small velocity 
to the material it passes through, and causes a extremely small entropy 
increase. The velocity of sound behind a weak shock is about the same as it 
is in front. The behavior of a weak shock wave is thus not much different 
from an acoustic wave (in fact an acoustic wave can be considered to be the 
limiting case of a weak shock).

As shock strength increases, the proportions by which the energy expended by 
the wave is divided between compressive work, entropic heating, and 
imparting motion also changes. The density of matter crossing the shock 
front cannot increase indefinitely, no matter how strong the shock. It is 
limited by the value of gamma for the material. The limiting density 
increase is:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-3
    density_ratio = rho_1/rho_0 = v_0/v_1 = (gamma + 1)/(gamma - 1)

Consequently, for a perfect monatomic gas the limit for shock compression is 
4. Material with higher gammas (e.g. essentially all condensed matter) has a 
lower compressive limit. In regimes where abrupt increases in ionization 
energy absorption occur (initial ionization, initial electron removal from a 
new shell), the effective gamma can be driven down to the range of 1.20 to 
1.25, leading to density increases as high as 11 or 12. As shocks continue 
to increase in strength above such a regime the kinetic excitation again 
dominates, and the value of gamma rises back to 5/3 (until the next such 
regime is encountered).

There is also a limiting ratio between the shock velocity D and u_p:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-4
     u_p =  D*(density_ratio - 1)/density_ratio
For a perfect gas this is 3/4 of the shock velocity.

In a strong shock, the limiting partition of energy between kinetic energy 
and internal energy (compression plus entropy) in the compressed material is 
50/50. Since the degree of compression (and thus compressive work) has a 
fixed limit, entropy must increase without limit. In an extremely strong 
shock (one where the limiting ratios are approached), almost all of the 
energy expended goes into kinetic energy and entropic heating.

There are three basic equations, called the Rankine-Hugoniot shock relations 
(jump conditions), that taken together define the classical shock 
transition. They are easily derived from conservation laws, in fact one of 
them has already been given (using the conservation of mass):
Eq. 3.4.3.1-5a  Rankine-Hugoniot Relation 1a
    u_0*rho_0 = u_1*rho_1  
or
Eq. 3.4.3.1-5b  Rankine-Hugoniot Relation 1b
    D*rho_0 = (D - u_p)*rho_1

The mass entering the shock front in a unit of time dt (equal to 
A*dt*u_0*rho_0) undergoes a velocity change of u_0-u_1, and thus a momentum 
change of change A*dt*u_0*rho_0*(u_0-u_1). Conservation of momentum requires 
that the momentum change be balanced by the force acting over the time dt 
(momentum is force*time). This force is (p_1 - p_0)*A*dt. We can then derive 
the second shock relation:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-6  Rankine-Hugoniot Relation 2
    p_1 - p_0 = u_0*rho_0*(u_0-u_1) = D*rho_0*u_p

In a similar manner the conservation of energy, when combined with 
expressions for kinetic energy changes and compressive work at the shock 
front, gives us the energy equation:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-7  Rankine-Hugoniot Relation 3
    E_1 - E_0 = 1/2 (p_1 + p_0)(v_0 - v_1)

R-H relations 1 and 2 are independent of the material being shocked. Solving 
the third equation requires having an equation of state for the material. If 
we use the gas law EOS, we can write an expression for specific volume as a 
function of the initial state of the material (p_0, v_0), gamma, and the 
shock pressure (p_1):
Eq. 3.4.3.1-8
    v_1 = [p_0*v_0*(gamma + 1) + p_1*v_0*(gamma - 1)]/ 
          [p_0*(gamma - 1) + p_1*(gamma + 1)]

Plotted on the a P-V diagram (pressure vs. volume, see 3.1.5 above) this 
function defines a Hugoniot curve. This curve is the locus of all possible 
shock states (produced by shocks of varying strength) from a given initial 
state. The shock velocity D happens to be equal to the slope of the straight 
line (called the Rayleigh Line) connecting state 0 and state 1 on the 
Hugoniot. Equation 1 can then give the particle velocity u_p.

For convenience, D can be calculated from :
Eq. 3.4.3.1-9
     D^2 = v_0^2 * (p_1 - p_0)/(v_0 - v_1)
Or, if we are dealing with a gas we can include the equation of state and 
omit v_1 explicitly:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-10
     D^2 = (p_1(1 + gamma) - p_0(1 - gamma))v_0/2

The Hugoniot curve lies above the isentropic curve defined by:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-11
    p_1*(v_1^gamma) = p_0*(v_0^gamma), 
although the two curves are very close together for weak shocks.

Since force*distance defines work done, and any two points in the P-V 
diagram define changes in pressure and volume, the area under a curve 
connecting two points gives the energy change involved in moving between the 
two states. Expressed in differential form this is:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-12
     dE = -p * dv
Adiabatic changes move along the isentropic curve, and the energy change is 
the area below it. Shock jumps however move instantaneously between the two 
points, and the energy change must be calculated by the finite difference 
form:
Eq. 3.4.3.1-13
    delta E = -(p_1 + p_0)/2 * delta v.
This is the area under the Rayleigh Line connecting the two states. The 
difference between this area and the area under the isentropic curve passing 
through state 0 and p_1 gives the increase in entropy due to shock 
compression. [I apologize for the lack of graphics to show these curves, 
ASCII just doesn't cut it for this.]

3.4.3.2   Detonation Waves
A detonation wave is a shock wave in an explosive that is supported by the 
chemical energy released by reactions triggered by the change of state at 
the shock front. The ability of an explosive to support a detonation wave is 
the definition of "high explosive" (HE). Low explosives, like black powder 
("gun powder") and smokeless powder, merely burn very fast without producing 
true shock waves.

The chemical reaction in a high explosive takes much longer than the shock 
transition. The time scale is typically between 1 nanosecond and 1 
microsecond, and is thus 1,000 to 1,000,000 times slower than the shock 
jump. The thickness of the reaction zone thus ranges from on the order of 
several microns to several millimeters. The ability for the energy released 
by the high explosive reaction products to reach the detonation front, and 
thus maintain it, is due to the fact that shock front propagation is 
subsonic with respect to the shocked explosive.

A given explosive has a characteristic detonation velocity, D. This is the 
steady state velocity of a detonation wave travelling through the explosive. 
Representative values for the explosives of major interest in the design of 
nuclear weapons are given below, density and form are given for each 
measured velocity:

The detonation velocity is closely related the energy density of the 
explosive. Generally the more powerful the explosive, the higher the 
detonation velocity. Not surprisingly, higher detonation velocities 
correspond to higher detonation pressures. 

Shock waves travelling at velocities higher than the steady detonation 
velocity (called a strong detonation) will tend to slow down with time to 
the steady state value (called a Chapman-Jouget, or CJ, detonation). Shock 
waves that are slower than the detonation velocity (a weak detonation) will 
tend to accelerate (as long as they are strong enough to initiate the 
explosion process to begin with). 

Besides the energetic reactions of the explosive, expansion of the 
compressed reaction product gases behind the detonation front also affect 
the detonation velocity. If the detonation wave is propagating down a 
cylinder of explosive, gases can expand out to the side immediately behind 
the wave front. This robs energy from the detonation wave and tends to slow 
it down. The narrower the cylinder, the greater the reduction in detonation 
velocity. If the cylinder is narrow enough, the detonation front cannot be 
sustained and it dies out entirely. In most explosives the drop in velocity 
becomes significant when the diameter is in the range of 1-5 cm, with 
failure occurring with diameters in the range of 0.25-1.5 cm. A notable 
exception to this is PETN, which does not suffer velocity decreases until 
the diameter is below 0.2 cm, with failure at only 0.08 cm (HMX does nearly 
as well). For this reason PETN is used to make a flexible detonating cord 
called "primacord". The velocities in the table above were generally 
measured using 2.5 cm cylinders, and thus may not represent the maximum CJ 
detonation velocities.

Some insight into the detonation process can be gained by considering a 
detonation beginning at the rear surface of an unconfined block of explosive 
which is wide enough for the edge effect to be negligible. Also assume the 
detonation front is a plane wave (not curved). The explosive is accelerated 
in the forward direction by passing through the detonation front, in other 
words, it gains forward momentum. The conservation of momentum requires that 
there be a balancing rearward flow. This is brought about by the expansion 
of the detonation gases out the rear surface of the explosive (a process 
known as escape).

The expansion of the reaction products (and a corresponding drop in 
pressure) actually begins as soon as the explosive passes through the shock 
front. As expansion proceeds with increasing distance from the shock front, 
the pressure steadily drops, and the internal energy of the gases is 
progressively converted to kinetic energy directed opposite to the shock 
wave direction of travel. The rear surface of the reaction zone (called the 
CJ surface) is defined by the point where the expansion has accelerated the 
gases rearward enough that they are travelling at exactly the local speed of 
sound relative to the shock front (energy released behind this point cannot 
reach the front). Behind this surface the gases (which are still moving 
forward) continue to expand and decelerate until a point is reached where 
they are motionless, from this point on the gases move rearward with 
increasing velocity. 

The region of decreasing pressure behind the shock front is sometimes called 
the Taylor wave.

In a plane detonation propagating through a solid high explosive, the 
thickness of the zone of forward moving gases grows linearly with detonation 
wave travel, and is about half the distance the detonation wave has 
traversed since initiation.

3.4.3.3   Linear Equation of State for Shock Compression
There is a specialized but very useful equation of state that describes the 
behavior of materials under shock compression. This is called the Linear EOS 
or the Linear Hugoniot. This EOS describes a very simple relationship 
between the velocity of the shock wave, and the particle velocity behind the 
shock:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-1
     D = C + Su_p
where D is the shock velocity, u_p is the particle velocity, C is the speed 
of sound in the material at zero pressure, and S is a constant for the 
particular material.

Conservation of mass requires that the degree of compression, rho/rho_0, be 
equal to:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-2
     rho/rho_0 = D/(D - u_p)
Substituting the Linear EOS for U_p, with appropriate rearrangements gives 
us:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-3
     rho/rho_0 = S/(S + C/D - 1)
This implies that the limiting shock compression as D becomes large compared 
to C is:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-4
     rho/rho_0 = S/(S - 1)

The Linear EOS turns out to be quite accurate for virtually all materials 
under a wide range of conditions, reaching into extreme shock pressures 
(many tens of megabars). That this is so is really quite surprising. A wide 
variety of physical processes occur as materials are shocked from STP to 
extreme pressures and temperatures. In particular, it will be recalled from 
section 3.2.2 that the compressibility of the material (indicated by gamma) 
steadily declines with pressure. No strong theoretical basis is known to 
explain the linear relationship, or the value of S.

A correspondence can be drawn though between the limiting density given by 
the linear EOS, and the limiting density of shock compression in a perfect 
gas:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-5
     rho/rho_0 = S/(S - 1) = (gamma + 1)/(gamma - 1)
Which implies:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-6
     gamma = 2S - 1, or S = (gamma + 1)/2
If we use the value of gamma for a perfect monatomic gas, 5/3, we get:
Eq. 3.4.3.3-7
     S = 4/3 = 1.333
Interestingly, the value of S for the elements varies from about 0.9 to 1.9 
(most between 1.1 and 1.6), with the distribution centered around 1.33. 

Deviations in the linear relationship occur when significant phase changes 
occur. These show up as kinks in the slope, but affect the overall trend 
only slightly.

3.5       Radiation Hydrodynamics</h3><pre>
Many elements of radiation hydrodynamics of have already been discussed: the 
properties of blackbody radiation and photon gases, and the mechanisms of 
interaction between radiation and matter. This section focuses specifically 
on radiating fluid flow, in particular the limiting case of compressive 
flows - shock waves.

3.5.1     Radiative Shock Waves
Classical shock waves assume the only process that affects the state of the 
shocked material is the compression jump at the shock front. In an extremely 
strong shock the temperature of the material behind the front becomes high 
enough to radiate significantly, and the thermal radiation transport of 
energy must be taken into account. The key distinguishing feature of all 
radiative shock waves is that the radiation of the shocked gas preheats the 
matter ahead of the kinetic shock jump. Conditions in radiative shock waves 
are always extreme enough to allow us to treat the shocked material as a 
gas, and usually a perfect gas.

Classical shocks can be quite luminous of course, but the actual energy flux 
from radiation is insignificant compared to the hydrodynamic energy flux, 
resulting in negligible preheating. In air and most other gases the 
preheating from a classical shock wave is virtually zero because the gas is 
also transparent to the emitted radiation. 

High explosives are incapable of generating radiative shocks. Radiative 
shock waves arise in collisions at celestial velocities (meteors, comets, 
etc.), astrophysics (stellar dynamics), and nuclear explosions.

Radiative shock waves can be conveniently divided into four classes in order 
of increasing strength:
* Subcritical Shocks
* Critical Shocks
* Supercritical Shocks
* Radiation Dominated Shocks

Ionization effects occur in radiative shock regimes. Initial ionization 
occurs in the subcritical region. Additional shell ionization effects occur 
in the supercritical region, and (depending on the element involved) perhaps 
in the subcritical region as well.

3.5.2     Subcritical Shocks
In these shocks the preheating is relatively small. More precisely, the 
temperature of the preheated gas is always less than the final (equilibrium) 
temperature of the gas behind the shock front. An illustrative shock 
temperature profile is given below.
                         *

                           ********* Unshocked Temperature
__________________________________________________________

We can see that a small amount of preheating occurs immediately ahead of the 
shock. The thickness of the preheating layer is approximately equal to the 
average photon mean free path in the cold gas. The shock jump heats the gas 
further, creating a temperature spike just behind the front. This layer of 
superheated gas cools by radiation to the final shock temperature, creating 
the preheated layer in the process. The superheated gas layer is also about 
one photon mean free path in thickness.

In air at STP, radiation transport begins to be significant when the shocked 
gas temperature reaches some 50,000 degrees K. This corresponds to a shock 
velocity of 23 km/sec (Mach 70), and a preheating temp of 6300 K. The 
preheating layer will be only 1 mm or so thick.

Subcritical radiative shocks are strong enough to achieve compressions close 
to the limiting value of (gamma + 1)/(gamma - 1); a factor of 4 for perfect 
monatomic gases. In strong subcritical shocks in low-Z gases (e.g. air) an 
effective gamma value of 1.25 is typical due to energy absorption in 
ionization, resulting in a density increase of 9.

The temperature increase in the preheating layer increases the gas pressure 
above its initial state, and the resulting pressure gradient generates a 
weak compression wave in front of the shock. The density increase ahead of 
the shock front is always small in subcritical shocks. For example, a Mach 
70 shock in air results in a density increase on the order of 1% ahead of 
the front. Most of the compression occurs in the shock jump, but it 
continues to increase as the superheated gas cools to the final temperature 
(accompanied by a proportionality much smaller pressure increase as cooling 
proceeds).

The relationship between the temperature and density at different points in 
a radiative shock wave, and the final temperature and density, is given by 
the general law:
Eq. 3.5.2-1
     T/T_final = eta(1- eta)/(eta_final * (1 - eta_final))
where T_final is the final temperature; eta is the volume ratio V_shock/V_0 
(the reciprocal of the density ratio); and eta_final is final (and maximum) 
value of shock compression for the gas in question. This shows that when the 
preheating is small, so is the compression. When the shock jump compresses 
the gas to a density close to the final value, the peak temperature is not 
much higher than the final one.

These effects increase as shock strength comes closer to the critical value 
(a shock temp of 285,000 K for air at STP). When the final shock temp is 
100,000 K (D = 41 km/sec), preheating reaches 25,000 K; at 150,000 K (D = 
56.5 km/sec), preheating is 60,000 K; at 250,000 K (D = 81.6 km/sec), 
preheating is 175,000 K. Above about 90,000 K the preheating layer begins 
thick enough that it obscures the superheated shock in visible light, an 
observer in front of the shock sees only the lower temperature preheated 
layer.

When the radiation energy density can be neglected, T_final can be 
calculated from the equation:
Eq. 3.5.2-2
     T_final =  (2*(gamma - 1)*rho*D^2)/(n*k*(gamma + 1)^2)
where n is the particle density.

Applying the above equation to regimes where strong ionization effects occur 
presents problems. Ionization increases the particle density, and absorbs 
additional energy thus driving down the effective value of gamma. If pre-
shock values of gamma and n are used in these cases the calculated value of 
T_final may be greatly overestimated. In ionization regimes closed form 
equations are not satisfactory and numerical methods are required for exact 
answers. It also fails close to critical shock conditions when the radiation 
energy intensity can no longer be neglected. This failure occurs around the 
point where T_final reaches 70% of T_critical.

Overall, subcritical shocks are not notably different from classical shocks. 
The energy transport is still dominated by the shock compression, and the 
equations governing the shock behavior deviate little from the classical 
equations.

3.5.3     Critical Shock Waves
At critical strength, the radiative preheating equals the final shock 
temperature. At this point the radiation energy flux equals that of 
hydrodynamic energy flux. Above this point we enter the regime of radiation 
hydrodynamics proper.

_____________________________________________________________

In air initially at STP, critical strength and is reached at a temperature 
of 285,000 K (T_critical). This corresponds to a shock velocity of 88.1 
km/sec. It is this temperature and shock condition that marks the moment of 
"hydrodynamic separation" in the early fireball of a nuclear explosion, 
where the hydrodynamic shock takes over in leading the fireball expansion, 
and causes the brightness of the fireball to fall from its first peak to a 
temporary minimum.

Determining the exact value of the critical shock velocity and temperature 
generally requires numerical techniques.

The thickness of the preheated layer becomes greater than a mean free path 
as shocks near critical strength since the energy flux from the preheated 
layer becomes so large that it contributes to preheating air even further 
ahead. The density increase ahead of the shock front is still small.

3.5.4     Supercritical Shock Waves
In these shocks the principal transport of energy is carried out by 
radiation. Nearly all of this energy transport is completed before the 
arrival of the hydrodynamic shock front. The compression wave in the 
preheated region is still relatively weak however, virtually all of the 
compression occurs as matter crosses the shock front. Recall though, that in 
shocks of this strength the energy expended in compression is negligible 
compared to that expended in heating and shock acceleration.

__________________________________________________________________

The preheating temperature is the same as the final temperature in all 
supercritical shocks. As shock intensity increases above critical strength 
the preheated layer becomes progressively thicker, while the superheated 
layer becomes thinner. So in a supercritical shock the preheating layer is 
typically several free paths thick, while the superheated shock layer is 
less than one free path thick.  This is because of the T^4 relationship with 
radiation flux and radiation density, which causes the shock superheated 
layer to cool extremely rapidly. The maximum temperature behind the shock 
wave is:
Eq. 3.5.4-1
    T_shock = T_final * (3 - gamma)
or 4/3 final for a perfect gas. Since the preheating zone is optically 
thick, energy transport ahead of the shock front is governed by radiation 
heat conduction. This radiation heat conduction front is called a Marshak 
wave (or a radiation diffusion wave).

In air, a shock with a final temperature of 750,000 K has a preheated layer 
some 14 mean free paths thick (about 2 m). At 500,000 K the layer is only 
3.4 MFPs thick (40 cm).

It is a supercritical shock that is responsible for the first flash of a 
nuclear explosion. Even though the fireball is only a few meters across in 
this phase (for a kiloton range explosion), and even though air is 
transparent only to an extremely small fraction of the emitted photons, this 
is still sufficient to make the early fireball as bright (or brighter) at a 
distance as the later fireball at its maximum size.

3.5.5     Radiation Dominated Shock Waves
In extremely large shocks the radiation pressure and energy density exceeds 
the kinetic pressure and energy of the gas. At this point we basically have 
a shock in a photon gas. We might say that the gas particles (ions and 
electrons) are just "along for the ride". Accordingly, it is the properties 
of a photon gas (gamma = 4/3) that dominates the situation. The maximum 
shock compression is thus: (4/3 + 1)/(4/3 - 1) = 7. 

In uranium at normal density (18.9), as might be encountered in the core or 
tamper of an implosion bomb near maximum power output, the point where 
radiation and kinetic energy densities are the same is reached at 4.8 x 10^7 
degrees K. In a lithium deuteride Fermi gas at a density of 200 (typical of 
compressed fusion fuel) this point is 1.35 x 10^8 K.

In radiation dominated shocks the preheating effect is so large that the one 
hallmark of classical shock waves - the sudden jump in pressure and density 
at the hydrodynamic shock front - diminishes and completely disappears in a 
sufficiently strong shock. This point is finally reached when the ratio 
between radiation pressure and gas pressure is 4.45. This corresponds to a 
temperature of 1.75 x 10^8 degrees K in U-238 (density 18.9), or 2.2 x 10^8 
K in LiD (density 200).

Since fission bomb core temperatures can exceed 100 million degrees, and 
fusion fuel can exceed 300 million degrees, we can expect radiation 
dominated shock waves to be the normal means of energy transport through 
matter within a bomb. The temperatures can be expected to cool to being 
simply a supercritical shock about the time it escapes the bomb casing.

The absence of a sudden pressure jump indicates that the hydrodynamic 
component of a radiative shock wave has completely disappeared. In this case 
the radiation dominated shock wave is a pure Marshak wave.

The shock velocity relationship Eq. 3.4.3.1-9 given for classical shock 
waves: D^2 = v_0^2 * (p_1 - p_0)/(v_0 - v_1)
is still valid. By replacing specific volumes with initial density and 
eta_max; and substituting the sum of kinetic pressure and the blackbody 
radiation pressure for (p_1 - p_0) we get:
Eq. 3.5.5-1
     D_rad^2 = ((4*sigma/3*c)*T^4 + nkT)/(rho*(1 - eta_max))
             = ((gamma + 1)*((4Pi/3c)*sigma*T^4 + nkT))/(2*rho)

where k is the Boltzmann's constant (1.380 x 10^-16 erg/degree K), sigma is 
the Stefan-Boltzmann constant (5.669 x 10^-5 erg/sec-cm^2-K), and T is 
temperature (degrees K), c is the speed of light, and n is particle density. 
Since this equation includes the combined energy densities of thermal 
radiation and particle kinetics, it can be used for other radiative shocks 
as well.

The speed of sound in radiation dominated matter is:
Eq. 3.5.5-2
     c_s_rad = [gamma*((4*sigma/3*c)*T^4 + nkT)/rho]^0.5

Using this shock velocity relationship we can calculate the shock velocity 
in a material such as uranium. At 10^8 degrees K it is 1480 km/sec; at 4.8 x 
10^7 K it has slowed to 533 km/sec; at 10^7 K it is a mere 166 km/sec. 
Although 1480 km/sec is very fast, being 160 times higher than the 
detonation velocity of the best conventional explosives, it is interesting 
to note that the energy density in the nuclear explosive is some 100 million 
times higher. The principle reasons for this disparity are that velocity 
only increases with the square root of energy density, and the high mass 
density of the fission explosive.

3.6       Shock Waves in Non-Uniform Systems</h3><pre>
So far I have discussed shock waves passing through a uniform medium where 
physical properties like density do not change. We are necessarily 
interested in the behavior of shocks in non-uniform systems since nuclear 
weapon design techniques include:
* Compression of one material (uranium say) by shock waves generated in
  another (high explosive); and
* Generation of shock waves by collisions between two materials.

3.6.1     Shock Waves at an Interface
The dimensions of the components of a nuclear weapon are small. This means 
that shock waves propagating in these components must eventually reach a 
boundary (in contrast explosion shocks in the atmosphere or ocean may die 
out without encountering a boundary). Since the most important physical 
property of a material for determining shock behavior is density, two basic 
types of interfaces exist: 
* an interface where the shock enters a material of lower density
and
* an interface where the shock enters a material of higher density.

A shock wave is not affected by an interface ahead of the shock until the 
leading edge of the wave reaches it. In classical shocks this means that the 
shock propagates in a uniform manner until the shock front is actually at 
the interface at which point it will undergo an instantaneous change in 
behavior. In radiation shocks the leading edge is the edge of the Marshak 
wave preheating zone. This results in a more gradual interaction.

Two conditions that must be satisfied when a shock reaches an interface are:
* the pressures on both sides of the interface must equal; and 
* the particle velocities on both sides of the interface must equal.

3.6.1.1   Release Waves
When shock waves meet a boundary with a lower density material a release 
wave is generated. This is a rarefaction wave, a reduction or release in 
pressure that converts internal energy of the shock compressed gas into 
kinetic energy. 

The limiting case of a release wave is the arrival of a shock at a vacuum 
interface, also called a free surface. We can claim that the shock 
disappears in any meaningful sense at this point. All we have is a mass of 
compressed, moving material adjacent to a vacuum. The compressed material 
immediately begins to expand, converting the internal energy into even 
greater kinetic motion. In gases this expansion process is called escape. 
The expansion in turn creates a rarefaction wave that propagates back into 
the shock compressed material at the local speed of sound c_s.

3.6.1.1.1 Free Surface Release Waves in Gases
Let us assume that material supporting the shock wave is a gas. Since the 
pressure change in a rarefaction wave is always continuous (no instantaneous 
pressure drops), the pressure at the leading edge of the escaping gas is 
zero (in keeping with the requirement of equal pressures at the gas/vacuum 
interface) and the process of converting internal energy into kinetic energy 
is complete. The front edge thus immediately accelerates to the final 
maximum velocity (escape velocity) when it reaches the free surface. Farther 
back in the release wave the pressure increases and the velocity decreases. 
At the release wave boundary (which moves backward at c_s) the pressure and 
velocities are the same as in the original shock wave. 

The escape velocity of a gas is equal to:
Eq. 3.6.1.1.1-1
     u_escape = (2*c_s)/(gamma - 1)
If we use a frame of reference in which the unshocked gas was stationary we 
get:
Eq. 3.6.1.1.1-2
     u_escape = (2*c_s)/(gamma - 1) + u_particle
and the rear edge of the release wave travels backwards at
Eq. 3.6.1.1.1-3
     v_release = u_particle - c_s

The release wave thus stretches itself out with time at a speed of:
Eq. 3.6.1.1.1-4
     ((2/(gamma - 1)) + 1)*c_s
which for a perfect monatomic gas is 4*c_s.

3.6.1.1.2 Free Surface Release Waves in Solids
If the material is not a gas but a solid (and the shock has not vaporized 
it), the situation is a bit different. The solid cannot expand indefinitely, 
so expansion halts when it reaches the normal zero pressure density. The 
release propagates backward at c_s as before. In metals at moderate shock 
strengths (1 megabar and below), this expansion  causes a phenomena called 
"velocity doubling", since the release wave doubles the velocity imparted by 
the shock. This doubling law begins to break down when shock strengths are 
high enough to cause substantial entropy increases.

Another important difference in solids is the existence of tensile strength. 
We have seen that in detonation waves that the pressure drops rapidly a 
short distance behind the shock front. When high explosives are used to 
generate shocks in metal plates a phenomenon called "spalling" can occur due 
to the interaction between the tensile properties of the metal, the release 
wave, and this shock pressure drop.

As the rarefaction wave moves back into the plate, it causes the pressure to 
drop from the shock peak pressure to zero. As it moves farther back into the 
plate it continues to cause pressure drops of the same absolute magnitude. 
When it encounters pressures below the shock peak this means that the 
pressure in the plate goes negative, that is, tensile stress is produced 
(you can think of this as the faster moving part of the plate pulling the 
slower moving part of the plate along). If the negative pressure exceeds the 
tensile strength of the metal, the plate will fracture. The fracture may 
simply open a void in the plate, but often the velocity doubled layer will 
peel off entirely and fly off the front of the plate. 

If the original plate was actually a stack of two or more plates, the shock 
propagation into the plate stack would occur as before. However when the 
release wave reaches the boundary between plates, and if tensile stress 
exists at that point, the front plate will fly off and a new release wave 
will begin at the front side of the plate behind it.

3.6.1.1.3 Shock Waves at a Low Impedance Boundary
If the boundary is with a second material of lower density, rather than a 
true vacuum, we have a low impedance boundary. If this second material has a 
density *much* lower than the first, then the situation is essentially the 
same as the free surface case as far as the first material is concerned. The 
pressure at the release wave front will be negligible compared to the shock 
pressure and the escape velocity will be virtually the same.

The increased particle velocity at the front of the release wave acts like a 
piston in the second material, driving a shock wave ahead of itself. Since 
the particle velocity is steady behind a shock front, and the particle 
velocity on both sides of the material interface must be the same, we can 
see that the particle velocity behind the shock front in the second material 
will be the same as the velocity of the release wave front (i.e. the 
velocity of material ahead of a piston is the same as the piston itself). If 
we assume that the second material is a gas, and that the shock is strong 
enough to reach the limiting compression, then the second shock wave 
velocity will be:
Eq. 3.6.1.1.3-3
     D_2ndshock = u_escape * (gamma + 1)/2
The pressure in this shock will be negligible compared to the original shock 
of course.

If the density of the second material is not negligible compared to the 
first, the result is intermediate between the case above and the case of a 
shock propagating through a material of unchanging density. The pressure at 
the interface drops, but not as drastically. The velocity of the release 
wave front is lower, and creates a shock in the second material that is 
slower, but with a higher pressure. The rear of the release wave travels 
backwards at the same speed (c_s), but since the pressure drop at the 
release front is not as sharp, and it moves forward more slowly, the 
pressure gradient in the release wave is not as steep.

3.6.1.2   Shock Reflection
When shock waves meet a boundary with a higher density material a shock wave 
is reflected back into the first material, increasing its pressure and 
entropy, but decreasing its velocity.  

3.6.1.2.1 Shock Waves at a Rigid Interface
The limiting case of an interface with a higher density material, is an 
infinitely rigid boundary. With such an interface there is no shock wave 
transmitted into the second material, all of the energy is reflected. This 
causes a doubling of pressure, and a decrease in particle velocity to zero. 
An interface between air and a solid (like the ground) is essentially a 
rigid interface.

3.6.1.2.2 Shock Waves at a High Impedance Boundary
If the second material is not enormously denser than the first, a 
transmitted shock is created in the second material, along with the 
reflected shock in the first. The shock reflection causes an increase in 
pressure and decrease in particle velocity in the first material. Continuity 
in pressure at the interface indicates that the transmitted shock must also 
be higher in pressure than the original shock, but the particle velocity 
(and shock velocity) will be lower.

3.6.2     Collisions of Moving Bodies
The detonation of high explosives is one way of generating shock waves. 
Another is high velocity collision between two materials. 

To illustrate the situation, first consider the head on collision between 
two plates of identical composition, and equal mass and velocity magnitude 
|V|. At the moment of contact the colliding surfaces will come to rest, and 
a shock wave will begin to propagate into each plate of sufficient strength 
to cause a velocity change of magnitude |V|. If |V| is not too great, then 
the shock velocity will be close to the acoustic speed in the plates. When 
the shocks reach the opposite surface of each plate, all portions of both 
plates will be at rest. A release wave will begin at the plate free 
surfaces, resulting in velocity doubling. When the release waves reach the 
original impacting surfaces, both plates will have returned to their 
original (zero pressure) physical state, but they will now have velocities 
of magnitude |V| headed in opposite directions to their original motion; 
they will have "bounced" off each other.

What we have just described is an elastic collision, a collision in which no 
kinetic energy is dissipated. This the limiting case for colliding bodies at 
low velocities. If the collision velocities are below the acoustic speed in 
the bodies then the collision forces are transmitted by acoustic waves. If 
the velocities become too large then true shock waves are formed. At still 
higher velocities, entropic heating and equation of state effects start to 
deviate from the velocity doubling rule. At this point the collisions become 
progressively less elastic with increasing speed.

Typically we encounter colliding bodies in physical systems in which we view 
one body as stationary. The impacting body travels at velocity V, and after 
collision shock waves propagate into the bodies with u_p equal to V/2 (if 
they are of identical composition). The actual shock front velocity depends 
on the degree of compression, which can be found by consulting the Rankine-
Hugoniot relations, and the initial state and the EOS of the material.

3.6.3    Collisions of Shock Waves
Shock reflections at an interface are an example of a shock wave collision. 
The general case of head on shock collisions presents no additional 
difficulties. From the point of collision, waves must propagate in either 
direction. The properties of each wave must be such that they bring the 
pressures and particle velocities on both sides of the collision interface 
into equilibrium. Symmetrical shock collisions act exactly like a shock wave 
encountering an infinitely rigid interface from the point of view of both 
shocks. 

Entirely new phenomena occur though when shock collisions are not head on. 
The discussion below assumes we are dealing with strong shocks and/or dense 
matter (the effects are somewhat different for low density gases and 
moderate or weak shocks).

At very small angles, the point of collision moves very rapidly along the 
interface (V/Sin alpha; where alpha is the collision angle, 0 for head on). 
If the speed with which the collision point moves is supersonic with respect 
to the material behind the reflected shocks then the only new phenomena are 
that the shocks are reflected at an angle, and the pressure behind the 
reflected shocks is increased. 

As alpha increases, the speed of travel of the collision point decreases and 
the reflected shock pressure increases. At a certain critical value of alpha 
(generally around 70 degrees) the collision point travels at sonic velocity 
or less, and a new shock front is formed by the collision (a phenomenon 
called the Mach effect). This shock, called the Mach stem, bridges the two 
principal colliding shocks, replacing the V-shaped two-shock collision with 
a three sided shock collision. The stem travels parallel to the direction of 
travel of the collision point.

At the critical angle where the Mach front is formed the pressure reaches a 
maximum, which can be some six to eight times the original shock pressure. 
Above the critical angle, the pressure drops again. When alpha reaches 180 
degrees the two shocks are no longer colliding and the pressure drops back 
to its original value.

3.6.4    Oblique Collisions of Moving Bodies
A phenomenon of some importance related to the Mach effect arises when 
oblique collisions are between two bodies in a void, not shocks travelling 
through a continuous medium. In this case there is nothing for a shock to 
travel through ahead of the collision point, so a Mach stem cannot form. 
Instead at the critical angle where the collision point is sonic or subsonic 
with respect to the reflected shock, a high velocity jet of material is 
ejected along the collision point trajectory. This is variously called the 
Neumann, Monroe, hollow charge, or shaped charge effect. When the collision 
is cylindrical or conical instead of planar, a jet is always created 
regardless of the angle of collision.

This effect is used in conventional weapons systems such as anti-tank 
missiles to create jets capable of penetrating thick armor. The effect can 
also arise in implosion systems when shock wave irregularities occur. In 
this case it is very undesirable because it disrupts the implosion.

3.7      Principles of Implosion</h3><pre>
The term "implosion", which denotes a violent inward collapse or 
compression, fits many different physical schemes for rapidly compressing 
materials to high densities. An implosion may be adiabatic or shock induced, 
or both; the geometry of the compression may be one, two, or three 
dimensional. This subsection surveys these various implosive systems, 
describing their principles and properties.

3.7.1    Implosion Geometries
An compression process can be symmetric about one, two, or three spatial 
axes.

A good example of one dimensional compression (linear compression) is the 
compression of the fuel/air mixture in the cylinder of an internal 
combustion engine. If r_0 is the original length of the gas column in the 
cylinder, and r_1 is the length after compression, then the density increase 
is:
Eq. 3.7.1-1
     rho_1/rho_0 = r_0/r_1
That is to say, it is inversely proportional to the change in scale (the 
relative change in length). 

Two dimensional compression (cylindrical compression) can be thought of as 
squeezing a tube so that its radius decreases uniformly (it doesn't get 
squashed flat). If r_0 denotes the original radius, and r_1 the radius after 
compression then we can say:
Eq. 3.7.1-2
     rho_1/rho_0 = (r_0/r_1)^2
I.e. it is inversely proportional to the SQUARE of the change in scale. 

Three dimensional compression (spherical compression) can be thought of as 
squeezing a sphere so that its radius decreases uniformly. In this case we 
can say:
Eq. 3.7.1-3
     rho_1/rho_0 = (r_0/r_1)^3
I.e. it is inversely proportional to the CUBE of the change in scale.

For the same change in scale, a higher dimensional implosion produces a much 
greater degree of compression. The relatively sluggish linear case in fact 
is rarely though of as being an "implosion".

The spherical implosion gives the most rapid compression and, being 
symmetrical in all directions, is also relatively easy to analyze 
theoretically. It is the most widely used geometry for implosion in nuclear 
weapon designs.

3.7.2    Classes of Implosive Processes
In addition to geometry, another critical factor in characterizing implosion 
systems is the pressure-time curve that actually causes the compression.

At one extreme, we have gradual homogenous adiabatic compression. In this 
case the pressure exerted on the implosion system increases continuously, at 
a slow enough rate that the pressure within the implosion system is uniform 
everywhere. This type of implosion does not increase entropy and allows 
arbitrarily high degrees of compression, if sufficient force can be exerted. 

The other extreme is shock compression. Here the pressure increase is 
instantaneous, and entropy is always increased. There is a theoretical limit 
to the degree of compression achievable in this manner, regardless of the 
shock pressures available.

Other important cases can be defined that lie between these extremes, 
depending of the pressure-time function. For example, pressure curves that 
increase exponentially with time (physically unachievable of course) allow 
infinitely high compression in arbitrarily short length of time.

In characterizing the properties of different classes of implosions we use 
spherical compression as the model, due to its theoretical simplicity, and 
practical interest.

Vehn (and others):

3.7.3    Convergent Shock Waves
fnord
This is the most obvious method of achieving implosion, and was the first 
two and three dimensional implosion system to be developed (during the 
Manhattan Project). The idea is to create a cylindrical or spherical inward 
directed shock wave which converges on the material to be compressed.

In a convergent shock wave the flow of matter behind the shock front is also 
convergent (inward directed). This means that following the shock 
compression there is an adiabatic compression phase in which the kinetic 
energy of the shocked material is converted into internal energy, causing 
the flow to decelerate. The pressure behind the shock front, rather than 
remaining constant as in a classical shock wave, continues to rise. This 
increasing pressure is transmitted to the shock front, causing it to 
continuously strengthen and accelerate.

In theory the acceleration of the shock front continues without limit as the 
shock approaches the center, achieving infinite velocity, pressure, and 
temperature. Since the area of the shock front is diminishing, the actual 
total energy in the shock front decreases, reaching zero at the center.

Although the increase in shock strength is unbounded in principle, subject 
only to the granularity of atomic structure, in practice the symmetry of the 
implosion breaks down long before then, providing a much lower limit to the 
maximum degree of energy cumulation.

The increase in density at the shock front is bounded of course, and so is 
the maximum density due to adiabatic compression. In fact, when the shock 
reaches the center, the density is everywhere uniform. The temperature and 
pressure profile established at this point increases without limit toward 
the center.

The degree of shock intensification depends on the geometry (planar, 
cylindrical, or spherical), and the equation of state of the material. It is 
higher for less compressible materials.

The scaling laws make use of the parameter alpha given in the table below 
(assuming a gas law EOS):
Table 3.7.3-1. Alpha Values for Varying Gammas and Geometries
    Gammas:   1   6/5    7/5    5/3      3
Cylindrical   1  0.861  0.835  0.816  0.775
Spherical     1  0.757  0.717  0.688  0.638

The velocity of the converging shock front is given by:
     V = K1*r^[(alpha-1)/alpha]
where alpha is selected from the above table, and the proportionality 
constant K1 is determined by initial conditions (V_0 and r_0). If the value 
of gamma is 3 (close to that of uranium) in a spherical implosion then alpha 
is 0.638. This gives us:
Eq.  3.7.3-1
     V_Usphere = K1*r^(-0.567)
The shock velocity is thus approximately proportional to the inverse square 
root of the radius.

The pressure behind the shock front is given by:
Eq.  3.7.3-2
     P = K2*r^[2*(alpha-1)/alpha]
Again K2 is established by initial conditions (p_0, r_0). For gamma=3, this 
is:
Eq.  3.7.3-3
     P_Usphere = K2*r^(-1.134)
The pressure is thus approximately proportional to the inverse of the 
radius.

[Side note:
The scaling laws for implosion were obtained by consulting several mutually 
supporting sources that analyze the theoretical properties of converging 
shock waves, which cross checks with published data on converging shock 
waves. These laws also appear generally consistent with the known properties 
of the Fatman implosion bomb.

There is a curious belief found in the public domain nuclear weapons 
literature that implosion shock velocity scales with the inverse square 
(*NOT* square root) of the radius, and thus the pressure scales as the 
inverse FOURTH power of the radius (see for example Lovins, 1980, Nature V. 
283, pg. 821). Since the area of the shock front is proportional to r^2, and 
the energy density in a shock wave is proportional to the pressure, this 
belief leads to the astonishing (and impossible) conclusion that the TOTAL 
energy in the shock increases rapidly, and without limit (i.e. it is a 
source of "free energy", in contravention to the laws of thermodynamics).

The origin of this belief appears to be a comment in a biography of Edward 
Teller (_Energy and Conflict: The Life and Times of Edward Teller_), judging 
by a statement made by De Volpi in _Proliferation, Plutonium, and Policy_, 
1979, pg. 300.]

The time for the shock wave to reach the center from r_0, and V_0 is
Eq.  3.7.3-4
     t_c = (r_0/V_0)*alpha

The location of the shock front at time t is:
Eq.  3.7.3-5
     r(t) = (t_c - t)^alpha * K3
Where K3 can be calculated by:
Eq.  3.7.3-6
     K3 = (r_0^(1-alpha) * V_0^alpha)/(alpha^alpha)

The compression achieved at the shock front has the classical shock 
compression limit: nu = (gamma + 1)/(gamma - 1).

Now the maximum degree of compression would be achieved if all of the 
kinetic energy were converted into internal energy, bringing the imploding 
gas to rest. We can make a somewhat naive estimate of what this compression 
limit is by remembering that in an extremely strong shock, energy is divided 
equally between kinetic energy and internal energy. Then by using the gas 
law EOS and the adiabatic compression law, we can calculate the additional 
density increase if the kinetic energy were converted to internal energy 
adiabatically:
Eq.  3.7.3-7
     rho_2/rho_1 = 2^(1/gamma-1) 
where rho_1 is the shock compressed density and rho_2 is the adiabatically 
compressed density. 

This gives us for gamma = 5/3 a density increase of 
Eq.  3.7.3-8
     rho_2/rho_1 = 2^1.5 = 2.82, or rho_2/rho_0 = 11.3.
For gamma = 3 (more typical of condensed matter) the increase is:
Eq.  3.7.3-9
     rho_2/rho_1 = 2^0.5 = 1.41, or rho_2/rho_0 = 2.82.

This estimate is naive because the state of zero flow is never achieved. 
When the shock reaches the center, the gas is still flowing inward 
everywhere. An accurate value for rho_2/rho_0 at this moment, when gamma = 
5/3, is 9.47.

In an extremely intense implosion shock that ionizes the material through 
which it passes the initial shock compression is much greater than in an 
ideal gas. The shocked gas acts as an ideal monatomic gas with a gamma of 
5/3. If we assume an initial compression of 12 (3 times higher than for an 
ideal monatomic gas) then the final density after convergence will be on the 
order of 30.

When the shock reaches the center it should, theoretically, create a 
reflected shock moving outward driven by the increasing pressure toward the 
center. This shock is a relatively slow one (compared to the imploding 
phase). The reflected shock front reverses the inflow of gas. Behind the 
front the gas is expanding outward, again quite slowly compared to its 
inward velocity. The density reaches a new maximum at the shock front, but 
falls rapidly behind it reaching zero at the center. This is a consequence 
of the increasing entropy toward the center, but is augmented by the fact 
that pressure drops behind a diverging shock front. The new density maximum 
is thus a local phenomenon at the shock front. Matter is actually being 
driven outward from the center and for any volume around the center, the 
density falls continuously once the reflected shock front has passed. You 
can think of the implosion as having "bounced" at the center, and is now 
rebounding outward.

The compression achieved at the shock front for gamma = 5/3 in spherical 
geometry is rho_3/rho_0 = 32.0 For 7/5 it reaches a value of 216. For 
cylindrical geometry and gamma = 5/3, rho_3/rho_0 is 22.8. If we get a 
factor of 4 initial compression enhancement due to an ionizing shock, and a 
gamma of 5/3 afterward, then the compression for spherical geometry will be 
96, and 68.4 for cylindrical geometry.

Whether the high densities achieved at the outgoing shock front are "useful" 
or not depends on the characteristic length scale of the physical processes 
being enhanced by the compression. In a fission reaction the scale is given 
by the neutron mean free path, the average distance a neutron travels 
between interactions, which is typically a few centimeters. If the thickness 
of the shock compressed layer is less than this, the reaction will be more 
affected by the average density of the core than by the local density at the 
front. In a fusion reaction the reaction rate at a given temperature is 
governed by the local density of the fuel, so the reaction rate will be 
enhanced by the rebounding shock.

It appears that the peak compression at the reflected shock is less than 
that predicted by theory and it not hard to guess why. Before this second 
symmetric shock phase begins the implosion has to pass through a singularity 
in the center where the shock front decreases to zero size, and increases to 
infinite strength. Since implosion symmetry breaks down before this point, 
we actually get a turbulent flow that dissipates some of the inflowing 
kinetic energy as heat. We thus get an expanding stagnation front with 
higher entropy increases, and lower compressions than theory would indicate. 

The problem of non-ideal behavior near the center can probably be alleviated 
by placing a small high density object in the center of the implosion to 
reflect the shock back outward before it converges to the point where 
asymmetry becomes severe. This also reduces the amount of energy deposited 
as heat at the center, which is probably an advantage, but it starts to 
change the character of the implosion from the simple ideal model.

If the main imploding mass is surrounded by a higher density imploding layer 
then additional compression is achieved when the outgoing shock is reflected 
at this high density interface. If a high density central mass is also 
present a series of alternating inward and outward reflected shocks can be 
created that achieve very high densities. In this case it is the kinetic 
energy of the decelerating high density layer (acting as a pusher/tamper) 
that is supplying the additional compressive work. Such a system is of 
course much more complex than a simple convergent shock implosion.

3.7.4    Collapsing Shells
A variation of implosion that is of interest is the collapse of a hollow 
cylindrical or spherical shell. We consider two cases here:
* a shell initially at a uniform velocity, but not acted on by outside 
  forces;
* a shell initially at rest, but reacting to an external pressure.

3.7.4.1  Shell in Free Fall 
The first case is often referred to as a "free falling" shell, although it 
is not really falling, just imploding due to inertia. We assume that every 
particle in the shell has a velocity vector directed towards the center of 
the hollow shell, and that the magnitude is uniform everywhere. 

This situation is typical of a thin shell that has just been accelerated by 
an imploding shock wave after the velocity doubling pressure release has 
been completed.

As the shell implodes the area of its outer surface gets smaller. This means 
that the shell is either getting thicker, or it is getting denser, or both.

If it is getting thicker, then the inner surface is moving farther than the 
outer surface, which means that it is also moving faster than the outer 
surface. Since they were initially moving at the same speed, the inner 
surface must be accelerating. Due to the conservation of momentum and 
energy, this means that the outer surface is also slowing down. This is the 
only situation possible in a shell made of incompressible material.

This transfer of momentum creates a pressure gradient in the shell. Moving 
from the outer surface inward, the pressure increases from zero at the 
surface to a maximum that marks the division between the accelerating and 
decelerating regions. The pressure then drops to zero again at the inner 
surface. This maximum pressure will be much closer to the inner surface than 
the outer surface. Real materials are compressible to some extent so the 
pressure increase inside the shell is also accompanied by an increase in 
density.

3.7.4.2  Shell Collapse Under Constant Pressure
To investigate the second case, let us assume that the shell is initially at 
rest with no forces acting upon it. Then let a uniform external pressure be 
applied suddenly (we will ignore the mechanism by which the pressure is 
generated). The sudden pressure jump will create an acoustic of shock 
compression wave that will move inward, accelerating and compressing the 
shell. When the wave reaches the inner surface, a release wave will be 
generated that will move outward at the speed of sound. When the edge of the 
release wave, the point where the pressure drop begins, reaches the outer 
surface it will halt (we assume it cannot propagate beyond the shell, or 
alter the pressure being exerted). A pressure profile will have been 
established in the shell, dropping from the maximum applied pressure at the 
outer surface to zero at the inner surface. Similarly, a continuous density 
and velocity profile will exist. 

If the shock was strong enough to convert the shell into a gas, then the 
inner surface will begin imploding at escape velocity when the shock reaches 
it. The leading edge of the implosion, travelling at high speed, but with 
zero density and pressure will reach the center of the void far ahead of the 
outer surface. If the shell remains solid, then the inner surface will 
undergo "velocity doubling", and drop to its zero pressure density.

The external pressure, not balanced by any internal pressure until the inner 
surface reaches the center, will cause the shell to continue to accelerate. 
The acceleration will be transmitted to the inner surface by the pressure 
gradient.

3.7.5     Methods for Extreme Compression
What densities are actually achievable with real implosion systems and real 
materials? We must consider actual compressibility limitations, and how 
close physical implosion systems can get to the ideal limiting case.

Although the value of gamma for condensed matter at zero pressure (and 
compression) is greater than the 5/3 of a perfect gas, this is partially 
offset by the fact that the value of gamma always falls as the density of 
condensed matter increases (approaching 5/3 as a limit). However, extremely 
high shock pressures are required to approach the limiting shock compression 
value, even using the STP gammas. For example the STP value of gamma for 
uranium (2.9) drops to 2.4 when its density has been doubled. Using the STP 
value we can estimate a limiting compression for uranium of ((2.9 + 1)/(2.9 
- 1) = 2.05. 

This degree of compression is actually achieved at a shock strength of 7 
megabars, approaching the practical limits of high explosive implosion. A 
static pressure of 5 megabars would have been sufficient to achieve this 
density through adiabatic compression. The 2 megabars of "lost compression" 
in the shock is due to energy expended in heating the uranium. The 
inefficiency of shock compression starts to increase rapidly above this 
point. A 20 megabar shock compresses uranium by a factor of 2.5, comparable 
to 12 megabars for shockless compression. In extremely strong shock waves, 
the energy of the shock is divided equally between heating and kinetic 
energy, with a negligible portion going into actual compression.

To achieve much higher compressions we have two options: successive shock 
waves, or adiabatic (i.e. non-shock induced) compression.

The description of a single shock implosion given in subsection 3.7.2 shows 
that adiabatic compression naturally follows the implosion shock, but the 
amount of compression achievable is still limited. If much higher densities 
are required some method of enhancing the adiabatic compression process is 
required.

By dividing the pressure increase into two or more shock steps, the 
inefficiency of very strong shocks can be dramatically reduced. In fact, two 
shocks are sufficient to eliminate nearly all of the entropic heating for 
pressure increases up to many tens of megabars.

If the pressure increase is divided between a large number of weak shocks, 
the effect is essentially identical to adiabatic compression. In fact, true 
adiabatic compression can be considered the limiting case of an infinite 
number of infinitely weak shocks. Conversely in very rapid adiabatic 
compression where the pressure gradients are steep, the inherent instability 
of compression waves tends to cause the pressure gradient to break up into 
multiple shocks. Thus for practical purposes the multi-shock and adiabatic 
compression approaches are closely related, and either model can suffice for 
analyzing and modelling extreme compression.

In an optimal multi-shock implosion system the shocks would be timed so that 
they all reach the center simultaneously (each successive shock is faster 
and will tend to overtake the earlier shocks). If they overtake each other 
earlier, then a single intense shock will form. If they do not merge before 
reaching the center, then shock wave rebounds will collide with incoming 
shocks, creating complicated shock reflection effects. Similarly the time 
pressure curve in adiabatic compression should avoid steepening into a 
single strong shock, or breaking up into a rebounding shock sequence.

The maximum speed of high density compression is determined by the speed of 
the leading edge of the pressure gradient, and the thickness of the material 
to be compressed. In true adiabatic (shockless) compression, this speed is 
the acoustic velocity in the uncompressed material. Since normal acoustic 
velocities are on the order of 1-3 km/sec, and material thicknesses are at 
least a few cm, this compression time is on the order of 10-100 
microseconds. And since nuclear bombs typically disassemble in a microsecond 
or less, it is clear that an initial strong shock with a velocity 
approaching 100 km/sec is unavoidable.

Let us consider an example where the fuel being compressed is Li6D, and the 
total pressure increment is 10,000 megabars. The density of the fuel being 
compressed (designated rho_init) is 0.82, and if the initial shock pressure 
(p_0)is 50 megabars then the shock velocity is roughly:
Eq.  3.7.5-1
D_0 = [p_0(gamma + 1)/2*rho_init]^0.5
    = [((5 x 10^7 bars)*(10^6 dynes/cm^2/bar)*(1 + 5/3))/(2 * 0.82)]^0.5 
    = 9.0 x 10^6 cm/sec
Since this an ionizing shock in Li6D initially at STP, the density after 
initial shock compression (rho_0) may be as high as 12 or so.

From the adiabatic law:
   P_1 * V_1^gamma = P_final * V_final^gamma 
we get the following expression for the adiabatic compression ratio:
Eq.  3.7.5-2
   (P_final/P_0)^(1/gamma) = V_0/V_final = rho_final/rho_0
If all of the remaining pressure increase is adiabatic and gamma = 5/3, then 
   rho_final/rho_0 = 200^(3/5) = 24.0
giving a final density of around 288.

The next question is how many discrete shocks are necessary to approach this 
performance. To examine this, we will assume a plane geometry for the shocks 
(i.e. they neither diverge or converge). 

The compression ratio from a shock is:
Eq.  3.7.5-3
   V_i/V_i+1 = [(gamma + 1)*P_i+1 + (gamma - 1)*P_i] /
               [(gamma - 1)*P_i+1 + (gamma + 1)*P_i]
where i is the pre-shock state and i+1 is the post-shock state. If we divide 
the pressure jump from P_0 to P_final into n jumps with the same pressure 
ratio (P_r) then the ratio for a single jump is:
Eq.  3.7.5-4
   P_r = P_i+1/P_i = Exp[ln(P_final/P_1) / n]
where i = 1, 2 ... n (this numbering explains why the initial shock was 
called the zeroth shock).

The compression ratio with each shock in the sequence is:
Eq.  3.7.5-5
   rho_r = rho_i+1/rho_i  = [(gamma + 1)*P_r + (gamma - 1)] / 
                            [(gamma - 1)*P_r + (gamma + 1)]
and the total compression by this sequence is obviously:
Eq.  3.7.5-6
   rho_final/rho_0  = (rho_i+1/rho_i)^n = (rho_r)^n

By computing various values of n, and assuming gamma = 5/3, for the earlier 
example we find:
Table 3.7.5-1. Total Compression Vs. Number of Shock Steps
 n    rho_final/rho_1  P_r
 1         3.92        200
 2        10.07         14.14
 3        15.20          5.85
 4        18.26          3.76
 5        20.05          2.89
10        22.92          1.70
25        23.84          1.24
50        23.98          1.11
infinity  24.00          1.00

We see from the table that on the order of five shocks can capture a large 
majority of the adiabatic compression. Another way of looking at it is: we 
are assured of losing little compression if a continuous pressure gradient 
breaks up into shocks each with a pressure jump of less than 3 or so.

fnord
In this analysis I have implicitly assumed that the shock sequence is 
unidirectional (i.e. the compression is caused by a sequence of shocks 
travelling in the same direction). This need not necessarily be the case. I 
have already described a system at the end of Section 7.2.3 that generates a 
series of alternating reflected shocks. The implications for compression 
efficiency are of course the same.

In a unidirectional shock sequence, to achieve maximum compression 
throughout the layer each shock should be timed so that they all reach the 
opposite interface of the material simultaneously. If the thickness of the 
material is d, then the transit time for the initial shock is:
Eq.  3.7.5-7
     t_transit_0 = d/D_0

Each shock in the following sequence travels through material that has been 
compressed and accelerated. For the ith shock we can say:
Eq.  3.7.5-8
D_i = [[(gamma + 1)*(P_r^i)*P_0 + (gamma - 1)*(P_r^(i-1))*P_0] /
      [2*(rho_r^(i-1))*rho_0]] + (1 - (1/rho_r))*D_i-1
except for the first shock in the sequence where we have:
Eq.  3.7.5-9
D_1 =  [[(gamma + 1)*P_0 + (gamma - 1)*P_0] / 2*rho_0] + 
       (1 - ((gamma-1)/(gamma+1)))*D_0

Since the driving interface of the layer is accelerated by the initial 
shock, the distance required to traverse the layer is less for subsequent 
shocks. When combined with the increasing shock velocities in the initial 
frame of reference, and multiplicative nature of the pressure increases, we 
can easily see that the driving pressure must rise very rapidly close to 
t_transit_0.

Brueckner and Jorna [_Laser Driven Fusion_, Reviews of Modern Physics, Vol. 
46, No. 2; April 1974; pg. 350] derive an expression for how pressure must 
change with time using an assumption of adiabatic compression, treating i as 
a continuous variable, taking gamma as 5/3, and apparently also treating d 
as being constant:
Eq.  3.7.5-10
     P(t_i)/P_0 = [[3*(t_i/(t_transit_0 - t_i)) / (8*(5^0.5))] + 1]^5
Plotting this function of P(t_i) vs. t_i shows this quasi-asymptotic rise.

The geometry of the systems we are actually interested are not really planar, but 
spherical or cylindrical instead. Still, this model provides valuable insight. 
Since the fuel volume is proportional to r^3 (for spherical geometry) or r^2 (for 
cylindrical geometry), it follows that most of the fuel mass resides at a fairly 
small radial distance from the surface. Half of the fuel is within 0.103 radii of 
the surface of a spherical mass, 0.146 radii of a cylindrical one. The effects of 
shock front convergence at these small radial distances is slight.

The fact that the opposite side of a fuel layer containing most of the fuel is 
not a free surface also relaxes the pressure history requirements. It does not 
matter whether the shock sequence or pressure gradient converges to a single 
shock at this point since the shocks will continue onward toward the center. The 
pressure increase does not need to be as fast or steep. It *is* important to 
avoid the buildup of excessively strong shocks in this outer layer of fuel, but 
farther in toward the center it does not matter much since inefficient 
compression here has little effect on the overall compression.

How to achieve the desired pressure-time curve in a fusion bomb where the 
shock production system (the fission trigger) destroys itself in a very 
short burst of energy, is a difficult and intriguing problem.

Possible approaches include using:
1. a radiation barrier between the primary and secondary with variable 
   opacity to create a suitable time-dependent energy flux;
2. a pusher that transfers momentum and energy to the fuel over time;
3. layers of materials of different densities (shock buffers) to create
   multiple reflected shocks (this option can be considered a variant of the
   second); or
4. modulating the production of energy to provide the desired quasi-
   exponential pressure-time curve directly (e.g. tailoring the 
   neutron multiplication rate, use of fusion boosting, use of multiple 
   staging, or some combination of these).

3.8     Instability</h3><pre>
Instabilities arise when force is exerted (or work is done) at a fluid 
interface. In unstable situations small deviations from symmetry or 
planarity tend to grow with time, magnifying the original imperfections. 
Since in the real world perfect symmetry or plane surfaces never exist (if 
only due to the atomic granularity of matter), unstable situations 
inevitably disrupt themselves with time. The key question is whether the 
initial irregularity magnitude, the rate of growth, and the length of time 
the unstable situation lasts are together sufficient to cause significant 
disruption. 

3.8.1   Rayleigh-Taylor Instability
Probably the best known instability is the Rayleigh-Taylor instability.
It arises when a denser fluid  exerts force on a less dense one. The classic 
example of this is trying to float water on oil. Even if a (nearly) perfect 
layer of water can be initially established on top of the oil layer, it 
quickly sinks through to the bottom. The water-on-oil system is not stable.

The water sinks to the bottom because, as is generally true in physical 
systems, the water-on-oil system evolves to a configuration of lower 
potential energy. The energy gained by the oil rising is more than offset by 
the energy given up by the water sinking. No matter how perfect the water 
layer is initially, it will eventually sink to the bottom unless other 
stabilizing forces exist (like surface tension).

The smoother the interface is, the slower the instability develops. By the 
same token it is a rapidly accelerating process. Each increase in 
irregularity leads to even more rapid growth. The growth in irregularities 
is in fact exponential with time. Even absolutely perfect interfaces cannot 
prevent this from occurring since Brownian motion will create atomic scale 
irregularities where none initially existed.

This issue arose during the Manhattan Project when the forces involved in 
atomic bomb assembly and disassembly were being considered. Atomic bombs are 
made of materials of different densities. Large forces are generated by high 
explosive implosion, and immensely larger ones are generated by the fission 
energy release. Do instability problems arise that constrain the design, or 
limit the efficiency of the bomb?

A typical law governing the growth of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities is:
Eq.  3.8.1-1
     P = e^t*[a*k*(rho_1 - rho_2)/(rho_1 + rho_2)]^0.5
where P is the perturbation amplification, a is acceleration, rho_1 and 
rho_2 are the densities of the denser and lighter liquids, t is time, k is 
the perturbation wave number (determined by the scale of the perturbation 
relative to the scale of the whole interface), and e is the natural 
logarithm base. From this we can see that the exponential growth rate is 
affected by the relative and absolute densities of the fluids, and the 
acceleration (that is to say, the force exerted across the interface).

It is evident from the above equation that for a fixed velocity increment, 
the amplification of irregularities is lower for higher accelerations (there 
is less time for growth). In the limiting case of shock acceleration, it 
does not occur at all. It is only when unbalanced forces exist for 
significant time intervals that the instability becomes a problem. 

This can occur during adiabatic compression, the collapse of thick shells, 
or when expansive forces are being generated by explosive reactions. The 
possible instability of the fissile core/tamper interface in both Manhattan 
Project bomb designs caused substantial concern (later shown to be 
unwarranted).

Despite considerable attention paid to this potential problem, it appears 
that it is largely a non-issue in weapons design. Due to the extremely short 
time scales involved, and the dominance of shock compression phenomena, 
significant instability problems do not appear to arise often. In fission 
bombs this is mostly a problem during the adiabatic compression phase behind 
the convergent shock wave of an implosion. It can also be an important 
factor during the confinement and expansion of the fusion fuel in a 
thermonuclear secondary, where a low density fuel first halts the pusher 
implosion, then drives the pusher outward.

3.8.2   Richtmyer-Meshkov Instability
Unlike Rayleigh-Taylor, which does not arise in shock compression, 
Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is a phenomenon only found during shock 
compression. It is caused by the variation in shock velocity with density. 
If the interface between two media of differing density is not plane but 
contains irregularities, then when the shock arrives at the interface the 
portions of the shock front in the denser medium will lag behind the 
portions in the less dense one. An initially flat shock then ceases to be 
flat, and this waviness will tend to grow with time. In a plane shock, once 
the shock has moved entirely into the second medium the shock will tend to 
return to planarity due to the inherent stability of plane shock waves. 
Convergent shocks are not stable though, so Richtmyer-Meshkov can be a 
serious problem in implosion systems. In addition, the shock front 
irregularities generate vortexes behind the front which can lead to mixing 
that continues long after the shock has passed by.

Unlike Rayleigh-Taylor, Richtmyer-Meshkov instability is not dependent on 
which side of the interface the compression force arrives from. Shocks 
travelling from low density regions to high density ones, and from high 
density regions to low density both cause this phenomenon. The growth of the 
instability with time is linear instead of exponential though, which tends 
to limit its severity.

<h2>5.0       Effects of Nuclear Explosions</h2>
Nuclear explosions produce both immediate and delayed destructive effects. 
Immediate effects (blast, thermal radiation, prompt ionizing radiation) are 
produced and cause significant destruction within seconds or minutes of a 
nuclear detonation. The delayed effects (radioactive fallout and other 
possible environmental effects) inflict damage over an extended period ranging 
from hours to centuries, and can cause adverse effects in locations very 
distant from the site of the detonation. These two classes of effects are 
treated in separate subsections. 

The distribution of energy released in the first minute after detonation among 
the three damage causing effects is:
                      Low Yield (<100 Kt)   High Yield (>1 Mt)
Thermal Radiation        35%                      45%
Blast Wave               60%                      50%
Ionizing Radiation        5%                       5%
(80% gamma, 20% neutrons)

The radioactive decay of fallout releases an additional 5-10% over time.

<HR><a name=nfaq5.1><h3>
5.1       Overview of Immediate Effects</a></h3><pre>
The three categories of immediate effects are: blast, thermal radiation 
(heat), and prompt ionizing or nuclear radiation. Their relative importance 
varies with the yield of the bomb. At low yields, all three can be significant 
sources of injury. With an explosive yield of about 2.5 Kt, the three effects 
are roughly equal. All are capable of inflicting fatal injuries at a range of 
1 km. 

The equations below provide approximate scaling laws for relating the 
destructive radius of each effect with yield:

r_thermal = Y^0.41 * constant_th
r_blast = Y^0.33 * constant_bl
r_radiation = Y^0.19 * constant_rad

If Y is in multiples (or fractions) of 2.5 Kt, then the result is in km (and 
all the constants equal one). This is based on thermal radiation just 
sufficient to cause 3rd degree burns (8 calories/cm^2); a 4.6 psi blast 
overpressure (and optimum burst height); and a 500 rem radiation dose. 

The underlying principles behind these scaling laws are easy to explain. The 
fraction of a bomb's yield emitted as thermal radiation, blast, and ionizing 
radiation are essentially constant for all yields, but the way the different 
forms of energy interact with air and targets vary dramatically.

Air is essentially transparent to thermal radiation. The thermal radiation 
affects exposed surfaces, producing damage by rapid heating. A bomb that is 
100 times larger can produce equal thermal radiation intensities over areas 
100 times larger. The area of an (imaginary) sphere centered on the explosion 
increases with the square of the radius. Thus the destructive radius increases 
with the square root of the yield (this is the familiar inverse square law of 
electromagnetic radiation). Actually the rate of increase is somewhat less, 
partly due to the fact that larger bombs emit heat more slowly which reduces 
the damage produced by each calorie of heat. It is important to note that the 
area subjected to damage by thermal radiation increases almost linearly with 
yield.

Blast effect is a volume effect. The blast wave deposits energy in the 
material it passes through, including air. When the blast wave passes through 
solid material, the energy left behind causes damage. When it passes through 
air it simply grows weaker. The more matter the energy travels through, the 
smaller the effect. The amount of matter increases with the volume of the 
imaginary sphere centered on the explosion. Blast effects thus scale with the 
inverse cube law which relates radius to volume.

The intensity of nuclear radiation decreases with the inverse square law like 
thermal radiation. However nuclear radiation is also strongly absorbed by the 
air it travels through, which causes the intensity to drop off much more 
rapidly.

These scaling laws show that the effects of thermal radiation grow rapidly 
with yield (relative to blast), while those of radiation rapidly decline.

In the Hiroshima attack (bomb yield approx. 15 Kt) casualties (including 
fatalities) were seen from all three causes. Burns (including those caused by 
the ensuing fire storm) were the most prevalent serious injury (two thirds of 
those who died the first day were burned), and occurred at the greatest range. 
Blast and burn injuries were both found in 60-70% of all survivors. People 
close enough to suffer significant radiation illness were well inside the 
lethal effects radius for blast and flash burns, as a result only 30% of 
injured survivors showed radiation illness. Many of these people were 
sheltered from burns and blast and thus escaped their main effects. Even so, 
most victims with radiation illness also had blast injuries or burns as well.

With yields in the range of hundreds of kilotons or greater (typical for 
strategic warheads) immediate radiation injury becomes insignificant. 
Dangerous radiation levels only exist so close to the explosion that surviving 
the blast is impossible. On the other hand, fatal burns can be inflicted well 
beyond the range of substantial blast damage. A 20 megaton bomb can cause 
potentially fatal third degree burns at a range of 40 km, where the blast can 
do little more than break windows and cause superficial cuts. 

It should be noted that the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki caused 
fatality rates were ONE TO TWO ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE higher than the rates in 
conventional fire raids on other Japanese cities. Eventually on the order of 
200,000 fatalities, which is about one-quarter of all Japanese bombing deaths, 
occurred in these two cities with a combined population of less than 500,000. 
This is due to the fact that the bombs inflicted damage on people and 
buildings virtually instantaneously and without warning, and did so with the 
combined effects of flash, blast, and radiation. Widespread fatal injuries 
were thus inflicted instantly, and the many more people were incapacitated and 
thus unable to escape the rapidly developing fires in the suddenly ruined 
cities. Fire raids in comparison, inflicted few immediate or direct 
casualties; and a couple of hours elapsed from the raid's beginning to the 
time when conflagrations became general, during which time the population 
could flee.

A convenient rule of thumb for estimating the short-term fatalities from all 
causes due to a nuclear attack is to count everyone inside the 5 psi blast 
overpressure contour around the hypocenter as a fatality. In reality, 
substantial numbers of people inside the contour will survive and substantial 
numbers outside the contour will die, but the assumption is that these two 
groups will be roughly equal in size and balance out. This completely ignores 
any possible fallout effects.

<HR><a name=nfaq5.2></a><h3>
5.2     Overview of Delayed Effects</h3><pre>
5.2.1   Radioactive Contamination
The chief delayed effect is the creation of huge amounts of radioactive 
material with long lifetimes (half-lifes ranging from days to millennia). The 
primary source of these products is the debris left from fission reactions. A 
potentially significant secondary source is neutron capture by non-radioactive 
isotopes both within the bomb and in the outside environment.

When atoms fission they can split in some 40 different ways, producing a mix 
of about 80 different isotopes. These isotopes vary widely in stability, some 
our completely stable while others undergo radioactive decay with half-lifes 
of fractions of a second. The decaying isotopes may themselves form stable or 
unstable daughter isotopes. The mixture thus quickly becomes even more 
complex, some 300 different isotopes of 36 elements have been identified in 
fission products.

Short-lived isotopes release their decay energy rapidly, creating intense 
radiation fields that also decline quickly. Long-lived isotopes release energy 
over long periods of time, creating radiation that is much less intense but 
more persistent. Fission products thus initially have a very high level of 
radiation that declines quickly, but as the intensity of radiation drops, so 
does the rate of decline.

A useful rule-of-thumb is the "rule of sevens". This rule states that for 
every seven-fold increase in time following a fission detonation (starting at 
or after 1 hour), the radiation intensity decreases by a factor of 10. Thus 
after 7 hours, the residual fission radioactivity declines 90%, to one-tenth 
its level of 1 hour. After 7*7 hours (49 hours, approx. 2 days), the level 
drops again by 90%. After 7*2 days (2 weeks) it drops a further 90%; and so on 
for 14 weeks. The rule is accurate to 25% for the first two weeks, and is 
accurate to a factor of two for the first six months. After 6 months, the rate 
of decline becomes much more rapid. The rule of sevens corresponds to an 
approximate t^-1.2 scaling relationship.

These radioactive products are most hazardous when they settle to the ground 
as "fallout". The rate at which fallout settles depends very strongly on the 
altitude at which the explosion occurs, and to a lesser extent on the size of 
the explosion.

If the explosion is a true air-burst (the fireball does not touch the ground), 
when the vaporized radioactive products cool enough to condense and solidify, 
they will do so to form microscopic particles. These particles are mostly 
lifted high into the atmosphere by the rising fireball, although significant 
amounts are deposited in the lower atmosphere by mixing that occurs due to 
convective circulation within the fireball. The larger the explosion, the 
higher and faster the fallout is lofted, and the smaller the proportion that 
is deposited in the lower atmosphere. For explosions with yields of 100 Kt or 
less, the fireball does not rise abve the troposphere where precipitation 
occurs. All of this fallout will thus be brought to the ground by weather 
processes within months at most (usually much faster). In the megaton range, 
the fireball rises so high that it enters the stratosphere. The stratosphere 
is dry, and no weather processes exist there to bring fallout down quickly. 
Small fallout particles will descend over a period of months or years. Such 
long-delayed fallout has lost most of its hazard by the time it comes down, 
and will be distributed on a global scale. As yields increase above 100 Kt, 
progressively more and more of the total fallout is injected into the 
stratosphere.

An explosion closer to the ground (close enough for the fireball to touch) 
sucks large amounts of dirt into the fireball. The dirt usually does not 
vaporize, and if it does, there is so much of it that it forms large 
particles. The radioactive isotopes are deposited on soil particles, which can 
fall quickly to earth. Fallout is deposited over a time span of minutes to 
days, creating downwind contamination both nearby and thousands of kilometers 
away. The most intense radiation is created by nearby fallout, because it is 
more densely deposited, and because short-lived isotopes haven't decayed yet. 
Weather conditions can affect this considerably of course. In particular, 
rainfall can "rain out" fallout to create very intense localized 
concentrations. Both external exposure to penetrating radiation, and internal 
exposure (ingestion of radioactive material) pose serious health risks.

Explosions close to the ground that do not touch it can still generate 
substantial hazards immediately below the burst point by neutron-activation. 
Neutrons absorbed by the soil can generate considerable radiation for several 
hours.

The megaton class weapons that were developed in the US and USSR during the 
fifties and sixties have been largely retired, being replaced with much 
smaller yield warheads. The yield of a modern strategic warhead is, with few 
exceptions, now typically in the range of 200-750 Kt. Recent work with 
sophisticated climate models has shown that this reduction in yield results in 
a much larger proportion of the fallout being deposited in the lower 
atmosphere, and a much faster and more intense deposition of fallout than had 
been assumed in studies made during the sixties and seventies. The reduction 
in aggregate strategic arsenal yield that occurred when high yield weapons 
were retired in favor of more numerous lower yield weapons has actually 
increased the fallout risk.

5.2.2   Effects on the Atmosphere and Climate 
Although not as directly deadly as fallout, other environmental effects can be 
quite harmful.

5.2.2.1 Harm to the Ozone Layer
The high temperatures of the nuclear fireball, followed by rapid expansion and 
cooling, cause large amounts of nitrogen oxides to form from the oxygen and 
nitrogen in the atmosphere (very similar to what happens in combustion 
engines). Each megaton of yield will produce some 5000 tons of nitrogen 
oxides. The rising fireball of a high kiloton or megaton range warhead will 
carry these nitric oxides well up into the stratosphere, where they can reach 
the ozone layer. A series of large atmospheric explosions could significantly 
deplete the ozone layer. The high yield tests in the fifties and sixties 
probably did cause significant depletion, but the ozone measurements made at 
the time were too limited to pick up the expected changes out of natural 
variations.

5.2.2.2  Nuclear Winter
The famous TTAPS (Turco, Toon, Ackerman, Pollack, and Sagan) proposal 
regarding a potential "nuclear winter" is another possible occurrence. This 
effect is caused by the absorption of sunlight when large amounts of soot are 
injected into the atmosphere by the widespread burning of cities and petroleum 
stocks destroyed in a nuclear attack.

Similar events have been observed naturally when large volcanic eruptions have 
injected large amounts of dust into the atmosphere. The Tambora eruption of 
1815 (the largest volcanic eruption in recent history) was followed by "the 
year without summer" in 1816, the coldest year in the last few centuries.
Soot is far more efficient in absorbing light than volcanic dust, and soot 
particles are small and hydrophobic and thus tend not to settle or wash out as 
easily. 

Although the initial TTAPS study was met with significant skepticism and 
criticism, later and more sophisticated work by researchers around the world 
have confirmed it in all essential details. These studies predict that the 
amount of soot that would be produced by burning most of the major cities in 
the US and USSR would severly disrupt climate on a world-wide basis. The major 
effect would be a rapid and drastic reduction in global temperature, 
especially over land. All recent studies indicate that if large scale nucelar 
attack occur against urban or petrochemical targets, average temperature 
reductions of at least 10 degrees C would occur lasting many months. This 
level of cooling far exceeds any that has been observed in recorded history, 
and is comparable to that of a full scale ice age. In areas downwind from 
attack sites, the cooling can reach 35 degrees C. It is probable that no large 
scale temperature excursion of this size has occurred in 65 million years.

Smaller attacks would create reduced effects of course. But it has been 
pointed out that most of the world's food crops are subtropical plants that 
would have dramatic drops in productivity if an average temperature drop of 
even one degree were to occur for even a short time during the growing season. 
Since the world maintains a stored food supply equal to only a few months of 
consumption, a war during the Northern Hemisphere spring or summer could still 
cause deadly starvation around the globe from this effect alone even if it 
only produced a mild "nuclear autumn".

5.3     Physics of Nuclear Weapon Effects</h3><pre>
Thermal radiation and blast are inevitable consequences of the near 
instantaneous release of an immense amount of energy in a very small volume, 
and are thus characteristic to all nuclear weapons regardless of type or 
design details. The release of ionizing radiation, both at the instant of 
explosion and delayed radiation from fallout, is governed by the physics of 
the nuclear reactions involved and how the weapon is constructed, and is thus 
very dependent on both weapon type and design.

5.3.1    Fireball Physics
The fireball is the hot ball of gas created when a nuclear explosion heats the 
bomb itself, and the immediate surrounding environment, to very high 
temperatures. As this incandescent ball of hot gas expands, it radiates part 
of its energy away as thermal radiation (including visible and ultraviolet 
light), part of its energy also goes into creating a shock wave or blast wave 
in the surrounding environment. The generation of these two destructive 
effects are thus closely linked by the physics of the fireball. In the 
discussion below I assume the fireball is forming in open air, unless stated 
otherwise.

5.3.1.1  The Early Fireball
Immediately after the energy-producing nuclear reactions in the weapon are 
completed, the energy is concentrated in the nuclear fuels themselves. The 
energy is stored as (in order of importance): thermal radiation or photons; as 
kinetic energy of the ionized atoms and the electrons (mostly as electron 
kinetic energy since free electrons outnumber the atoms); and as excited 
atoms, which are partially or completely stripped of electrons (partially for 
heavy elements, completely for light ones).

Thermal (also called blackbody) radiation is emitted by all matter. The 
intensity and most prevalent wavelength is a function of the temperature, both 
increasing as temperature increases. The intensity of thermal radiation 
increases very rapidly - as the fourth power of the temperature. Thus at the 
60-100 million degrees C of a nuclear explosion, which is some 10,000 times 
hotter than the surface of the sun, the brightness (per unit area) is some 10 
quadrillion (10^16) times greater! Consequently about 80% of the energy in a 
nuclear explosion exists as photons. At these temperatures the photons are 
soft x-rays with energies in the range of 10-200 KeV.

The first energy to escape from the bomb are the gamma rays produced by the 
nuclear reactions. They have energies in the MeV range, and a significant 
number of them penetrate through the tampers and bomb casing and escape into 
the outside world at the speed of light. The gamma rays strike and ionize the 
surrounding air molecules, causing chemical reactions that form a dense layer 
of "smog" tens of meters deep around the bomb. This smog is composed primarily 
of ozone, and nitric and nitrous oxides.

X-rays, particularly the ones at the upper end of the energy range, have 
substantial penetrating power and can travel significant distances through 
matter at the speed of light before being absorbed. Atoms become excited when 
they absorb x-rays, and after a time they re-emit part of the energy as a new 
lower energy x-ray. By a chain of emissions and absorptions, the x-rays carry 
energy out of the hot center of the bomb, a process called radiative 
transport. Since each absorption/re-emission event takes a certain amount of 
time, and the direction of re-emission is random (as likely back toward the 
center of the bomb as away from it), the net rate of radiative transport is 
considerably slower than the speed of light. It is however initially much 
faster than the expansion of the plasma (ionized gas) making up the fireball 
or the velocity of the neutrons.

An expanding bubble of very high temperatures is thus formed called the "iso-
thermal sphere". It is a sphere were everything has been heated by x-rays to a 
nearly uniform temperature, initially in the tens of millions of degrees. As 
soon as the sphere expands beyond the bomb casing it begins radiating light 
away through the air (unless the bomb is buried or underwater). Due to the 
still enormous temperatures, it is incredibly brilliant (surface brightness 
trillions of times more intense than the sun). Most of the energy being 
radiated is in the x-ray and far ultraviolet range to which air is not 
transparent. Even at the wavelengths of the near ultraviolet and visible 
light, the "smog" layer absorbs much of the energy. Then too, at this stage 
the fireball is only a few meters across. Thus the apparent surface brightness 
at a distance, and the output power (total brightness) is not nearly as 
intense as the fourth-power law would indicate.

5.3.1.2  Blast Wave Development and Thermal Radiation Emission 
As the fireball expands, it cools and the wavelength of the photons 
transporting energy drops. Longer wavelength photons do not penetrate as far 
before being absorbed, so the speed of energy transport also drops. When the 
isothermal sphere cools to about 300,000 degrees C (and the surface brightness 
has dropped to being a mere 10 million times brighter than the sun), the rate 
of radiative growth is about equal to the speed of sound in the fireball 
plasma. At this point a shock wave forms at the surface of the fireball as the 
kinetic energy of the fast moving ions starts transferring energy to the 
surrounding air. This phenomenon, known as "hydrodynamic separation", occurs 
for a 20 Kt explosion about 100 microseconds after the explosion, when the 
fireball is some 13 meters across. A shock wave internal to the fireball 
caused by the rapidly expanding bomb debris may overtake and reinforce the 
fireball surface shock wave a few hundred microseconds later.

The shock wave initially moves at some 30 km/sec, a hundred times the speed of 
sound in normal air. This compresses and heats the air enormously, up to 
30,000 degrees C (some five times the sun's surface temperature). At this 
temperature the air becomes ionized and incandescent. Ionized gas is opaque to 
visible radiation, so the glowing shell created by the shock front hides the 
much hotter isothermal sphere inside. The shock front is many times as bright 
as the sun, but since it is much dimmer than the isothermal sphere it acts as 
an optical shutter, causing the fireball's thermal power to drop rapidly. 

The fireball is at its most brilliant just as hydrodynamic separation occurs, 
the great intensity compensating for the small size of the fireball. The rapid 
drop in temperature causes the thermal power to drop ten-fold, reaching a 
minimum in about 10 milliseconds for a 20 Kt bomb (100 milliseconds for 1 Mt 
bomb). This "first pulse" contains only about 1 percent of the bomb's total 
emitted thermal radiation. At this minimum, the fireball of a 20 Kt bomb is 
180 meters across. 

As the shock wave expands and cools to around 3000 degrees, it stops glowing 
and gradually also becomes transparent. This is called "breakaway" and occurs 
at about 15 milliseconds for a 20 Kt bomb, when the shock front has expanded 
to 220 meters and is travelling at 4 km/second. The isothermal sphere, at a 
still very luminous 8000 degrees, now becomes visible and both the apparent 
surface temperature and brightness of the fireball climb to form the "second 
pulse". The isothermal sphere has grown considerably in size and now consists 
almost entirely of light at wavelengths to which air is transparent, so it 
regains much of the total luminosity of the first peak despite its lower 
temperature. This second peak occurs at 150 milliseconds for a 20 Kt bomb, at 
900 milliseconds for a 1 Mt bomb. After breakaway, the shock (blast) wave and 
the fireball do not interact further. 

A firm cutoff for this second pulse is impossible to provide because the 
emission rate gradually declines over an extended period. Some rough 
guidelines are that by 300 milliseconds for a 20 Kt bomb (1.8 seconds for a 1 
Mt) 50% of the total thermal radiation has been emitted, and the rate has 
dropped to 40% of the second peak. These figures become 75% total emitted and 
10% peak rate by 750 milliseconds (20 Kt) and 4.5 second (1 Mt). The emission 
time scales roughly as the 0.45 power of yield (Y^0.45).

Although this pulse never gets as bright as the first, it emits about 99% of 
the thermal radiation because it is so much longer.

5.3.2   Ionizing Radiation Physics
There are four types of ionizing radiation produced by nuclear explosions that 
can cause significant injury: neutrons, gamma rays, beta particles, and alpha 
particles. Gamma rays are energetic (short wavelength) photons (as are X-
rays), beta particles are energetic (fast moving) electrons, and alpha 
particles are energetic helium nuclei. Neutrons are damaging whether they are 
energetic or not, although the faster they are, the worse their effects.

They all share the same basic mechanism for causing injury though: the 
creation of chemically reactive compounds called "free radicals" that disrupt 
the normal chemistry of living cells. These radicals are produced when the 
energetic radiation strikes a molecule in the living issue, and breaks it into 
ionized (electrically charged) fragments. Fast neutrons can do this also, but 
all neutrons can also transmute ordinary atoms into radioactive isotopes, 
creating even more ionizing radiation in the body.

The different types of radiation present different risks however. Neutrons and 
gamma rays are very penetrating types of radiation. They are the hardest to 
stop with shielding. They can travel through hundreds of meters of air and the 
walls of ordinary houses. They can thus deliver deadly radiation doses even if 
an organism is not in immediate contact with the source. Beta particles are 
less penetrating, they can travel through several meters of air, but not 
walls, and can cause serious injury to organisms that are near to the source. 
Alpha particles have a range of only a few centimeters in air, and cannot even 
penetrate skin. Alphas can only cause injury if the emitting isotope is 
ingested. 

The shielding effect of various materials to radiation is usually expressed in 
half-value thickness, or tenth-value thickness: in other words, the thickness 
of material required to reduce the intensity of radiation by one-half or one-
tenth. Successive layers of shielding each reduce the intensity by the same 
proportion, so three tenth-value thickness reduce the intensity to one-
thousandth (a tenth-value thickness is about 3.3 half-value thicknesses). Some 
example tenth-value thicknesses for gamma rays are: steel 8.4-11 cm, concrete 
28-41 cm, earth 41-61 cm, water 61-100 cm, and wood 100-160 cm. The thickness 
ranges indicate the varying shielding effect for different gamma ray energies.

Even light clothing provides substantial shielding to beta rays.

5.3.2.1 Sources of Radiation
5.3.2.1.1 Prompt Radiation
Radiation is produced directly by the nuclear reactions that generate the 
explosion, and by the decay of radioactive products left over (either fission 
debris, or induced radioactivity from captured neutrons).

The explosion itself emits a very brief burst (about 100 nanoseconds) of gamma 
rays and neutrons, before the bomb has blown itself apart. The intensity of 
these emissions depends very heavily on the type of weapon and the specific 
design. In most designs the initial gamma ray burst is almost entirely 
absorbed by the bomb (tamper, casing, explosives, etc.) so it contributes 
little to the radiation hazard. The neutrons, being more penetrating, may 
escape. Both fission and fusion reactions produce neutrons. Fusion produces 
many more of them per kiloton of yield, and they are generally more energetic 
than fission neutrons. Some weapons (neutron bombs) are designed specifically 
to emit as much energy in the form as neutrons as possible. In heavily tamped 
fission bombs few if any neutrons escape. It is estimated that no significant 
neutron exposure occurred from Fat Man, and only 2% of the total radiation 
dose from Little Boy was due to neutrons.

The neutron burst itself can be a significant source of radiation, depending 
on weapon design. As the neutrons travel through the air they are slowed by 
collisions with air atoms, and are eventually captured. Even this process of 
neutron attenuation generates hazardous radiation. Part of the kinetic energy 
lost by fast neutrons as they slow is converted into gamma rays, some with 
very high energies (for the 14.1 MeV fusion neutrons). The duration of 
production for these neutron scattering gammas is about 10 microseconds. The 
capture of neutrons by nitrogen-14 also produces gammas, a process completed 
by 100 milliseconds.

Immediately after the explosion, there are substantial amounts of fission 
products with very short half-lifes (milliseconds to minutes). The decay of 
these isotopes generate correspondingly intense gamma radiation that is 
emitted directly from the fireball. This process is essentially complete 
within 10 seconds.

The relative importance of these gamma ray sources depends on the size of the 
explosion. Small explosions (20 Kt, say) can generate up to 25% of the gamma 
dose from the direct gammas and neutron reactions. For large explosions (1 Mt) 
this contribution is essentially zero. In all cases, the bulk of the gammas 
are produced by the rapid decay of radioactive debris.

5.3.2.1.2 Delayed Radiation
Radioactive decay is the sole source of beta and alpha particles. They are 
also emitted during the immediate decay mentioned above of course, but their 
range is too short to make any prompt radiation contribution. Betas and alphas 
become important when fallout begins settling out. Gammas remain very 
important at this stage as well.

Fallout is a complex mixture of different radioactive isotopes, the 
composition of which continually changes as each isotope decays into other 
isotopes. Many isotopes make significant contributions to the overall 
radiation level. Radiation from short lived isotopes dominates initially, and 
the general trend is for the intensity to continually decline as they 
disappear. Over time the longer lived isotopes become increasingly important, 
and a small number of isotopes emerge as particular long-term hazards.

Radioactive isotopes are usually measured in terms of curies. A curie is the 
quantity of radioactive material that undergoes 3.7x10^10 decays/sec (equal to 
1 g of radium-226). More recently the SI unit bequerel has become common in 
scientific literature, one bequerel is 1 decay/sec . The fission of 57 grams 
of material produces 3x10^23 atoms of fission products (two for each atom of 
fissionable material). One minute after the explosion this mass is undergoing 
decays at a rate of 10^21 disintegrations/sec (3x10^10 curies). It is 
estimated that if these products were spread over 1 km^2, then at a height of 
1 m above the ground one hour after the explosion the radiation intensity 
would be 7500 rads/hr.

Isotopes of special importance include iodine-131, strontium-90 and 89, and 
cesium-137. This is due to both their relative abundance in fallout, and to 
their special biological affinity. Isotopes that are readily absorbed by the 
body, and concentrated and stored in particular tissues can cause harm out of 
proportion to their abundance.

Iodine-131 is a beta and gamma emitter with a half-life of 8.07 days (specific 
activity 124,000 curies/g)  Its decay energy is 970 KeV; usually divided 
between 606 KeV beta, 364 KeV gamma. Due to its short half-life it is most 
dangerous in the weeks immediately after the explosion, but hazardous amounts 
can persist for a few months. It constitutes some 2% of fission-produced 
isotopes -  1.6x10^5 curies/Kt. Iodine is readily absorbed by the body and 
concentrated in one small gland, the thyroid.

Strontium-90 is a beta emitter (546 KeV, no gammas) with a half-life of 28.1 
years (specific activity 141 curies/g), Sr-89 is a beta emitter (1.463 MeV, 
gammas very rarely) with a half-life of 52 days (specific activity 28,200 
Ci/g). Each of these isotopes constitutes about 3% of total fission isotopes: 
190 curies of Sr-90 and 3.8x10^4 curies of Sr-89 per kiloton. Due to their 
chemical resemblance to calcium these isotopes are absorbed fairly well, and 
stored in bones. Sr-89 is an important hazard for a year or two after an 
explosion, but Sr-90 remains a hazard for centuries. Actually most of the 
injury from Sr-90 is due to its daughter isotope yttrium-90. Y-90 has a half-
life of only 64.2 hours, so it decays as fast as it is formed, and emits 2.27 
MeV beta particles.

Cesium-137 is a beta and gamma emitter with a half-life of 30.0 years 
(specific activity 87 Ci/g). Its decay energy is 1.176 MeV; usually divided by 
514 KeV beta, 662 KeV gamma. It comprises some 3-3.5% of total fission 
products - 200 curies/Kt. It is the primary long-term gamma emitter hazard 
from fallout, and remains a hazard for centuries. 
Although not important for acute radiation effects, the isotopes carbon-14 and 
tritium are also of interest because of possible genetic injury. These are not 
direct fission products. They are produced by the interaction of fission and 
fusion neutrons with the atmosphere and, in the case of tritium, as a direct 
product of fusion reactions. Most of the tritium generated by fusion is 
consumed in the explosion but significant amounts survive. Tritium is also 
formed by the capture of fast neutrons by nitrogen atoms in the air: N-14 + n 
-> T + C-12. Carbon-14 in also formed by neutron-nitrogen reactions: N-14 + n 
-> C-14 + p.
Tritium is a very weak beta emitter (18.6 KeV, no gamma) with a half-life of 
12.3 years (9700 Ci/g).
Carbon-14 is also a weak beta emitter (156 KeV, no gamma), with a half-life of 
5730 years (4.46 Ci/g). Atmospheric testing during the fifties and early 
sixties produced about 3.4 g of C-14 per kiloton (15.2 curies) for a total 
release of 1.75 tonnes (7.75x10^6 curies). For comparison, only about 1.2 
tonnes of C-14 naturally exists in the atmosphere (1 tonne) and living matter 
(0.2 tonne). Another 50-80 tonnes is dissolved in the oceans. Due to carbon 
exchange between the atmosphere and oceans, the half-life of C-14 residing in 
the atmosphere is only about 6 years. By now the atmospheric concentration has 
returned to within 1% or so of normal. High levels of C-14 remain in organic 
material formed during the sixties (in wood, say, or DNA).

5.4       Air Bursts and Surface Bursts</h3><pre>
It might seem logical that the most destructive way of using a nuclear weapon 
would be to explode it right in the middle of its target - i.e. ground level. 
But for most uses this is not true. Generally nuclear weapons are designed to 
explode above the ground -  as air bursts (the point directly below the burst 
point is called the hypocenter). Surface (and sub-surface) bursts can be used 
for special purposes.

5.4.1     Air Bursts
When an explosion occurs it sends out a shock wave like an expanding soap 
bubble. If the explosion occurs above the ground the bubble expands and when 
it reaches the ground it is reflected - i.e. the shock front bounces off the 
ground to form a second shock wave travelling behind the first. This second 
shock wave travels faster than the first, or direct, shock wave since it is 
travelling through air already moving at high speed due to the passage of the 
direct wave. The reflected shock wave tends to overtake the direct shock wave 
and when it does they combine to form a single reinforced wave. 

This is called the Mach Effect, and produces a skirt around the base of the 
shock wave bubble where the two shock waves have combined. This skirt sweeps 
outward as an expanding circle along the ground with an amplified effect 
compared to the single shock wave produced by a ground burst.

The higher the burst altitude, the weaker the shock wave is when it first 
reaches the ground. On the other hand, the shock wave will also affect a 
larger area. Air bursts therefore reduce the peak intensity of the shock wave, 
but increase the area over which the blast is felt. For a given explosion 
yield, and a given blast pressure, here is a unique burst altitude at which 
the area subjected to that pressure is maximized. This is called the optimum 
burst height for that yield and pressure.

All targets have some level of vulnerability to blast effects. When some 
threshold of blast pressure is reached the target is completely destroyed. 
Subjecting the target to pressures higher than that accomplishes nothing. By 
selecting an appropriate burst height, an air burst can destroy a much larger 
area for most targets than can surface bursts.

The Mach Effect enhances shock waves with pressures below 50 psi. At or above 
this pressure the effect provides very little enhancement, so air bursts have 
little advantage if very high blast pressures are desired.

An additional effect of air bursts is that thermal radiation is also 
distributed in a more damaging fashion. Since the fireball is formed above the 
earth, the radiation arrives at a steeper angle and is less likely to be 
blocked by intervening obstacles and low altitude haze.

5.4.2     Surface Bursts
Surface bursts are useful if local fallout is desired, or if the blast is 
intended to destroy a buried or very hard structure like a missile silo or a 
dam. Shock waves are transmitted through the soil more effectively if the bomb 
is exploded in immediate contact with it, so ground bursts would be used for 
destroying buried command centers and the like. Some targets, like earth-fill 
dams, require actual cratering to be destroyed and would be ground burst 
targets.

5.4.3     Sub-Surface Bursts
Exploding a bomb below ground level can be even more effective for producing 
craters and destroying buried structures. It can also eliminate thermal 
radiation and reduce the range of blast effects substantially. The problem, of 
course is getting the bomb underground. Earth-penetrating bombs have been 
developed that can punch over one hundred feet into the earth.

<HR><a name=nfaq5.5></a><h3>
5.5       Electromagnetic Effects</h3><pre>
The high temperatures and energetic radiation produced by nuclear explosions 
also produce large amounts of ionized (electrically charged) matter which is 
present immediately after the explosion. Under the right conditions, intense 
currents and electromagnetic fields can be produced, generically called EMP 
(Electromagnetic Pulse), that are felt at long distances. Living organisms are 
impervious to these effects, but electrical and electronic equipment can be 
temporarily or permanently disabled by them. Ionized gases can also block 
short wavelength radio and radar signals (fireball blackout) for extended 
periods.

The occurrence of EMP is strongly dependent on the altitude of burst. It can 
be significant for surface or low altitude bursts (below 4,000 m); it is very 
significant for high altitude bursts (above 30,000 m); but it is not 
significant for altitudes between these extremes. This is because EMP is 
generated by the asymmetric absorption of instantaneous gamma rays produced by 
the explosion. At intermediate altitudes the air absorbs these rays fairly 
uniformly and does not generate long range electromagnetic disturbances. 

The formation EMP begins with the very intense, but very short burst of gamma 
rays caused by the nuclear reactions in the bomb. About 0.3% of the bomb's 
energy is in this pulse, but it lasts for only 10 nanoseconds or so. These 
gamma rays collide with electrons in air molecules, and eject the electrons at 
high energies through a process called Compton scattering. These energetic 
electrons in turn knock other electrons loose, and create a cascade effect 
that produces some 30,000 electrons for every original gamma ray.

In low altitude explosions the electrons, being very light, move much more 
quickly than the ionized atoms they are removed from and diffuse away from the 
region where they are formed. This creates a very strong electric field which 
peaks in intensity at 10 nanoseconds. The gamma rays emitted downward however 
are absorbed by the ground which prevents charge separation from occurring. 
This creates a very strong vertical electric current which generates intense 
electromagnetic emissions over a wide frequency range  (up to 100 MHZ) that 
emanate mostly horizontally. At the same time, the earth acts as a conductor 
allowing the electrons to flow back toward the burst point where the positive 
ions are concentrated. This produces a strong magnetic field along the ground. 
Although only about 3x10^-10 of the total explosion energy is radiated as EMP 
in a ground burst (10^6 joules for 1 Mt bomb), it is concentrated in a very 
short pulse. The charge separation persists for only a few tens of 
microseconds, making the emission power some 100 gigawatts. The field 
strengths for ground bursts are high only in the immediate vicinity of the 
explosion. For smaller bombs they aren't very important because they are 
strong only where the destruction is intense anyway. With increasing yields, 
they reach farther from the zone of intense destruction. With a 1 Mt bomb, 
they remain significant out to the 2 psi overpressure zone (5 miles).

High altitude explosions produce EMPs that are dramatically more destructive. 
About 3x10^-5 of the bomb's total energy goes into EMP in this case, 10^11 
joules for a 1 Mt bomb. EMP is formed in high altitude explosions when the 
downwardly directed gamma rays encounter denser layers of air below. A pancake 
shaped ionization region is formed below the bomb. The zone can extend all the 
way to the horizon, to 2500 km for an explosion at an altitude of 500 km. The 
ionization zone is up to 80 km thick at the center. The Earth's magnetic field 
causes the electrons in this layer to spiral as they travel, creating a 
powerful downward directed electromagnetic pulse lasting a few microseconds. A 
strong vertical electrical field (20-50 KV/m) is also generated between the 
Earth's surface and the ionized layer, this field lasts for several minutes 
until the electrons are recaptured by the air. Although the peak EMP field 
strengths from high altitude bursts are only 1-10% as intense as the peak 
ground burst fields, they are nearly constant over the entire Earth's surface 
under the ionized region.

The effects of these field on electronics is difficult to predict, but can be 
profound. Enormous induced electric currents are generated in wires, antennas, 
and metal objects (like missiles, airplanes, and building frames). Commercial 
electrical grids are immense EMP antennas and would be subjected to voltage 
surges far exceeding those created by lightning, and over vastly greater 
areas. Modern VLSI chips are extremely sensitive to voltage surges, and would 
be burned out by even small leakage currents. Military equipment is generally 
designed to be resistant to EMP, but realistic tests are very difficult to 
perform and EMP protection rests on attention to detail. Minor changes in 
design, incorrect maintenance procedures, poorly fitting parts, loose debris, 
moisture, and ordinary dirt can all cause elaborate EMP protections to be 
totally circumvented. It can be expected that a single high yield, high 
altitude explosion over an industrialized area would cause massive disruption 
for an indeterminable period, and would cause huge economic damages (all those 
damaged chips add up).

A separate effect is the ability of the ionized fireball to block radio and 
radar signals. Like EMP, this effect becomes important with high altitude 
bursts. Fireball blackout can cause radar to be blocked for tens of seconds to 
minutes over an area tens of kilometers across. High frequency radio can be 
disrupted over hundreds to thousands of kilometers for minutes to hours 
depending on exact conditions.

5.6       Mechanisms of Damage and Injury</h3><pre>
The different mechanisms are discussed individually, but it should be no 
surprise that in combination they often accentuate the harm caused by each 
other. I will discuss such combined effects wherever appropriate.

5.6.1     Thermal Damage and Incendiary Effects
Thermal damage from nuclear explosions arises from the intense thermal (heat) 
radiation produced by the fireball. The thermal radiation (visible and 
infrared light) falls on exposed surfaces and is wholly or partly absorbed. 
The radiation lasts from about a tenth of a second, to several seconds 
depending on bomb yield (it is longer for larger bombs). During that time its 
intensity can exceed 1000 watts/cm^2 (the maximum intensity of direct sunlight 
is 0.14 watts/cm^2). For a rough comparison, the effect produced is similar to 
direct exposure to the flame of an acetylene torch.

The heat is absorbed by the opaque surface layer of the material on which it 
falls, which is usually a fraction of a millimeter thick. Naturally dark 
materials absorb more heat than light colored or reflective ones. The heat is 
absorbed much faster than it can be carried down into the material through 
conduction, or removed by reradiation or convection, so very high temperatures 
are produced in this layer almost instantly. Surface temperatures can exceed 
1000 degrees C close to the fireball. Such temperatures can cause dramatic 
changes to the material affected, but they do not penetrate in very far. 

More total energy is required to inflict a given level of damage for a larger 
bomb than a smaller one since the heat is emitted over a longer period of 
time, but this is more than compensated for by the increased thermal output.  
The thermal damage for a larger bomb also penetrates further due to the longer 
exposure.

Thermal radiation damage depends very strongly on weather conditions. Cloud 
cover, smoke, or other obscuring material in the air can considerably reduce 
effective damage ranges over clear air conditions. 

For all practical purposes, the emission of thermal radiation by a bomb is 
complete by the time the shock wave arrives. Regardless of yield, this 
generalization is only violated in the area of total destruction around a 
nuclear explosion where 100% mortality would result from any one of the three 
damage effects.

Incendiary effects refer to anything that contributes to the occurrence of 
fires after the explosion, which is a combination of the effects of thermal 
radiation and blast.

5.6.1.1   Thermal Injury
The result of very intense heating of skin is to cause burn injuries. The 
burns caused by the sudden intense thermal radiation from the fireball are 
called "flash burns". The more thermal radiation absorbed, the more serious 
the burn. The table below indicates the amount of thermal radiation required 
to cause different levels of injury, and the maximum ranges at which they 
occur, for different yields of bombs. The unit of heat used are gram-calories, 
equal to 4.2 joules (4.2 watts for 1 sec). Skin color significantly affects 
susceptibility, light skin being less prone to burns. The table assumes medium 
skin color.

SEVERITY        20 Kilotons               1 Megaton           20 Megatons
1st Degree  2.5 cal/cm^2 (4.3 km)  3.2 cal/cm^2 (18 km)   5 cal/cm^2 (52 km)
2nd Degree  5 cal/cm^2 (3.2 km)    6 cal/cm^2 (14.4 km)   8.5 cal/cm^2 (45 km)
3rd Degree  8 cal/cm^2 (2.7 km)    10 cal/cm^2 (12 km)    12 cal/cm^2 (39 km)

Convenient scaling laws to allow calculation of burn effects for any yield 
are:
r_thermal_1st = Y^0.38 * 1.20
r_thermal_2nd = Y^0.40 * 0.87
r_thermal_3rd = Y^0.41 * 0.67
Range is in km, yield is in Kt; the equations are accurate to within 10% or so 
from 1 Kt to 20 Mt. 

First degree flash burns are not serious, no tissue destruction occurs. They 
are characterized by immediate pain, followed by reddening of the skin. Pain 
and sensitivity continues for some minutes or hours, after which the affected 
skin returns to normal without further incident.

Second degree burns cause damage to the underlying dermal tissue, killing some 
portion of it. Pain and redness is followed by blistering within a few hours 
as fluids collect between the epidermis and damaged tissue. Sufficient tissue 
remains intact however to regenerate and heal the burned area quickly, usually  
without scarring. Broken blisters provide possible infection sites prior to 
healing.

Third degree burns cause tissue death all the way through the skin, including 
the stem cells required to regenerate skin tissue. The only way a 3rd degree 
burn can heal is by skin regrowth from the edges, a slow process that usually 
results in scarring, unless skin grafts are used. Before healing 3rd degree 
burns present serious risk of infection, and can cause serious fluid loss. A 
3rd degree burn over 25% of the body (or more) will typically precipitate 
shock in minutes, which itself requires prompt medical attention.

Even more serious burns are possible, which have been classified as fourth 
(even fifth) degree burns. These burns destroy tissue below the skin: muscle, 
connective tissue etc. They can be caused by thermal radiation exposures 
substantially in excess of those in the table for 3rd degree burns. Many 
people close to the hypocenter of the Hiroshima bomb suffered these types of 
burns. In the immediate vicinity of ground zero the thermal radiation exposure 
was 100 c/cm^2, some fifteen times the exposure required for 3rd degree burns, 
most of it within the first 0.3 seconds (which was the arrival time of the 
blast wave). This is sufficient to cause exposed flesh to flash into steam, 
flaying exposed body areas to the bone.

At the limit of the range for 3rd degree burns, the time lapse between 
suffering burns and being hit by the blast wave varies from a few seconds for 
low kiloton explosions to a minute of so for high megaton yields.

5.6.1.2   Incendiary Effects
Despite the extreme intensity of thermal radiation, and the extraordinary 
surface temperatures that occur, it has less incendiary effect than might be 
supposed. This is mostly due to its short duration, and the shallow 
penetration of heat into affected materials. The extreme heating can cause 
pyrolysis (the charring of organic material, with the release of combustible 
gases), and momentary ignition, but it is rarely sufficient to cause self-
sustained combustion. This occurs only with tinder-like, or dark, easily 
flammable materials: dry leaves, grass, old newspaper, thin dark flammable 
fabrics, tar paper, etc. The incendiary effect of the thermal pulse is also 
substantially affected by the later arrival of the blast wave, which usually 
blows out any flames that have already been kindled. Smoldering material can 
cause reignition later however. 

The major incendiary effect of nuclear explosions is caused by the blast wave. 
Collapsed structures are much more vulnerable to fire than intact ones. The 
blast reduces many structures to piles of kindling, the many gaps opened in 
roofs and walls act as chimneys, gas lines are broken open, storage tanks for 
flammable materials are ruptured. The primary ignition sources appear to be 
flames and pilot lights in heating appliances (furnaces, water heaters, 
stoves, ovens, etc.). Smoldering material from the thermal pulse can be very 
effective at igniting leaking gas. 

Although the ignition sources are probably widely scattered a number of 
factors promote their spread into mass fires. The complete suppression of fire 
fighting efforts is extremely important. Another is that the blast scatters 
combustible material across fire breaks that normally exist (streets, yards, 
fire lanes, etc.).

The effectiveness of building collapse, accompanied by the disruption of fire 
fighting, in creating mass fires can be seen in the San Francisco earthquake 
(1906), the Tokyo-Yokahama earthquake (1923), and the recent Kobe earthquake  
(1995). In these disasters there was no thermal radiation to ignite fires, and 
the scattering of combustible materials did not occur, but huge fires still 
resulted. In San Francisco and Tokyo-Yokohama these fires were responsible for 
most of the destruction that occurred.

In Hiroshima the fires developed into a true firestorm. This is an extremely 
intense fire that produces a rapidly rising column of hot air over the fire 
area, in turn powerful winds are generated which blow in to the fire area, 
fanning and feeding the flames. The fires continue until all combustible 
material is exhausted. Firestorms develop from multiple ignition sources 
spread over a wide area that create fires which coalesce into one large fire. 
Temperatures in firestorm areas can reach many hundreds of degrees, carbon 
monoxide reaches lethal levels, few people who see the interior of a firestorm 
live to tell about it. Firestorms can melt roads, cars, and glass. They can 
boil water in lakes and rivers, and cook people to death in buried bomb 
shelters. The in-blowing winds can reach gale force, but they also prevent the 
spread of the fires outside of the area in which the firestorm initially 
develops. The firestorm in Hiroshima began only about 20 minutes after the 
bombing.

Nagasaki did not have a firestorm, instead it had a type of mass fire called a 
conflagration. This is a less intense type of fire, it develops and burns more 
slowly. A conflagration can begin in multiple locations, or only one. 
Conflagrations can spread considerable distances from their origins. The fires 
at Nagasaki took about 2 hours to become well established, and lasted 4-5 
hours.

5.6.1.3   Eye Injury
The brightness and thermal output of a nuclear explosion presents an obvious 
source of injury to the eye. Injury to the cornea through surface heating, and 
injury to the retina are both possible risks. Surprisingly, very few cases of 
injury were noted in Japan. A number of factors acted to reduce the risk. 
First, eye injury occurs when vision is directed towards the fireball. People 
spend relatively little time looking up at the sky so only a very small 
portion of the population would have their eyes directed at the fireball at 
the time of burst. Second, since the bomb exploded in bright daylight the eye 
pupil would be expected to be small.

About 4% of the population within the 3rd degree burn zone at Hiroshima 
reported keratitis, pain and inflammation of the cornea, which lasted several 
hours to several days. No other corneal damage was noted.

The most common eye injury was flashblindness, a temporary condition in which 
the visual pigment of retina is bleached out by the intense light. Vision is 
completely recovered as the pigment is regenerated, a process that takes 
several seconds to several minutes. This can cause serious problems though in 
carrying out emergency actions, like taking cover from the oncoming blast 
wave.

Retinal injury is the most far reaching injury effect of nuclear explosions, 
but it is relatively rare since the eye must be looking directly at the 
detonation. Retinal injury results from burns in the area of the retina where 
the fireball image is focused. The brightness per unit area of a fireball does 
not diminish with distance (except for the effects of haze), the apparent 
fireball size simply gets smaller. Retinal injury can thus occur at any 
distance at which the fireball is visible, though the affected area of the 
retina gets smaller as range increases. The risk of injury is greater at night 
since the pupil is dialated and admits more light. For explosions in the 
atmosphere of 100 Kt and up, the blink reflex protects the retina from much of 
the light. 

5.6.2     Blast Damage and Injury
Blast damage is caused by the arrival of the shock wave created by the nuclear 
explosion. Shock waves travel faster than sound, and cause a virtually 
instantaneous jump in pressure at the shock front. The air immediately behind 
the shock front is accelerated to high velocities and creates a powerful wind. 
The wind in turn, creates dynamic pressure against the side of objects facing 
the blast. The combination of the pressure jump (called the overpressure)and 
the dynamic pressure causes blast damage.

Both the overpressure and dynamic pressure jump immediately to their peak 
values when the shock wave arrives. They then decay over a period ranging from 
a few tenths of a second to several seconds, depending on the strength of the 
blast and the yield. Following the this there is a longer period of weaker 
negative pressure before the atmospheric conditions return to normal. The 
negative pressure has little significance as far as causing damage or injury 
is concerned. A given pressure is more destructive from a larger bomb, due its 
longer duration.

The is a definite relationship between the overpressure and the dynamic 
pressure. The overpressure and dynamic pressure are equal at 70 psi, and the 
wind speed is 1.5 times the speed of sound. Below an overpressure of 70 psi, 
the dynamic pressure is less than the overpressure; above 70 psi it exceeds 
the overpressure. Since the relationship is fixed it is convenient to use the 
overpressure alone as a yardstick for measuring blast effects. At 20 psi 
overpressure the wind speed is still 500 mph, higher than any tornado wind.

As a general guide, city areas are completely destroyed (with massive loss of 
life) by overpressures of 5 psi, with heavy damage extending out at least to 
the 3 psi contour. The dynamic pressure is much less than the overpressure at 
blast intensities relevant for urban damage, although at 5 psi the wind speed 
is still 162 mph - close to the peak wind speeds of the most intense 
hurricanes.

Humans are actually quite resistant to the direct effect of overpressure. 
Pressures of over 40 psi are required before lethal effects are noted. This 
pressure resistance makes it possible for unprotected submarine crews to 
escape from emergency escape locks at depths as great as one hundred feet (the 
record for successful escape is actually an astonishing 600 feet, representing 
a pressure of 300 psi). Loss of eardrums can occur, but this is not a life 
threatening injury.

The danger from overpressure comes from the collapse of buildings that are 
generally not as resistant. The violent implosion of windows and walls creates 
a hail of deadly missiles, and the collapse of the structure above can crush 
or suffocate those caught inside.

The dynamic pressure causes can cause injury by hurling large numbers of 
objects at high speed. Urban areas contain many objects that can become 
airborne, and the destruction of buildings generates many more.  Serious 
injury or death can also occur from impact after being thrown through the air.

Blast effects are most dangerous in built-up areas due to the large amounts of 
projectiles created, and the presence of obstacles to be hurled against.
 
The blast also magnifies thermal radiation burn injuries by tearing away 
severely burned skin. This creates raw open wounds that readily become 
infected.

These many different effects make it difficult to provide a simple rule of 
thumb for assessing the magnitude of harm produced by different blast 
intensities. A general guide is given below:

1 psi     Window glass shatters
          Light injuries from fragments occur.
3 psi     Residential structures collapse.
          Serious injuries are common, fatalities may occur.
5 psi     Most buildings collapse.
          Injuries are universal, fatalities are widespread.
10 psi    Reinforced concrete buildings are severely damaged or demolished.
          Most people are killed.
20 psi    Heavily built concrete buildings are severely damaged or demolished.
          Fatalities approach 100%.

Suitable scaling constants for the equation r_blast = Y^0.33 * constant_bl
are:
constant_bl_1_psi = 2.2
constant_bl_3_psi = 1.0
constant_bl_5_psi = 0.71
constant_bl_10_psi = 0.45
constant_bl_20_psi = 0.28
where Y is in kilotons and range is in km.

5.6.3     Radiation Injury
Ionizing radiation produces injury primarily through damage to the 
chromosomes. Since genetic material makes up a very small portion of the mass 
of a cell, the damage rarely occurs from the direct impact of ionizing 
radiation on a genetic molecule. Instead the damage is caused by the radiation 
breaking up other molecules and forming chemically reactive free radicals or 
unstable compounds. These reactive chemical species then damage DNA and 
disrupt cellular chemistry in other ways - producing immediate effects on 
active metabolic and replication processes, and long-term effects by latent 
damage to the genetic structure. 

Cells are capable of repairing a great deal of genetic damage, but the repairs 
take time and the repair machinery can be overwhelmed by rapid repeated 
injuries. If a cell attempts to divide before sufficient repair has occurred, 
the cell division will fail and both cells will die. As a consequence, the 
tissues that are most sensitive to radiation injury are ones that are 
undergoing rapid division. Another result is that the effects of radiation 
injury depend partly on the rate of exposure. Repair mechanisms can largely 
offset radiation exposures that occur over a period of time. Rapid exposure to 
a sufficiently large radiation dose can thus cause acute radiation sickness, 
while a longer exposure to the same dose might cause none. 

By far the most sensitive are bone marrow and lymphatic tissues - the blood 
and immune system forming organs of the body. Red blood cells, which provide 
oxygen to the body, and white blood cells, which provide immunity to 
infection, only last a few weeks or months in the body and so must be 
continually replaced. The gastrointestinal system is also sensitive, since the 
lining of the digestive tract undergoes constant replacement. Although they 
are not critical for health, hair follicles also undergo continual cell 
division resulting in radiation sickness' most famous symptom - hair loss. The 
tissues least sensitive to radiation are those that never undergo cell 
division (i.e. the nervous system).

This also means that children and infants are more sensitive to injury than 
adults, and that fetuses are most sensitive of all.

If the individual survives, most chromosome damage is eventually repaired and 
the symptoms of radiation illness disappear. The repair is not perfect 
however. Latent defects can show up years or decades later in their effects on 
reproductive cells, and in the form of cancer. These latent injuries are a 
very serious concern and can shorten life by many years. They are the sole 
form of harm from low level radiation exposure.

5.6.3.1   Units of Measurement for Radiation Exposure
Three units of measurement have been commonly used for expressing radiation 
exposure: roentgens (R), rads, rems, the "three r's" of radiation measurement. 
In the scientific literature these are dropping out of use in favor of the SI 
(System Internationale) units grays (Gy) and sieverts (Sv). Each of the "three 
r's" measures something different. A rad is a measure of the amount of 
ionizing . A roentgen measures the amount of ionizing energy, in the form of 
energetic photons (gamma rays and x-rays) energy to which an organism is 
exposed. This unit is the oldest of the three and is defined more the 
convenience of radiation measurement, than for interpreting the effects of 
radiation on living organisms. Of more interest is the rad, since it includes 
all forms of ionizing radiation, and in addition measures the dose that is 
*actually absorbed* by the organism. A rad is defined as the absorption of 100 
ergs per gram of tissue (or 0.01 J/kg).  The gray measures absorbed doses as 
well, one gray equals 100 rads. The rem is also concerned with all absorbed 
ionizing radiations, and also takes into account the *relative effect* that 
different types of radiation produce. The measure of effect for a given 
radiation is its Radiation Biological Effect (RBE). A rem dose is calculated 
by multiplying the dose in rads for each type of radiation by the appropriate 
RBE, then adding them all up. The sievert is similar to the rem, but is 
derived from the gray instead of the rad. Sieverts use a somewhat simplified 
system of measuring biological potency - the quality factor (Q). One sievert 
is roughly equal to 100 rems. The rem and the sievert are the most meaningful 
unit for measuring and discussing the effects of radiation injury.

Type Of Radiation   RBE      Q
Gamma rays/X-rays   1        1
Beta Particles      1        1

5.6.3.2   Types of Radiation Exposure
An important concept to understand is the distinction between _whole body 
doses_ and radiation exposures concentrated in particular organs.  The 
radiation dose units described above are defined per unit weight of tissue. An 
exposure of 1000 rems can thus refer to an exposure of this intensity for the 
whole body, or for only a small part of it. The total absorbed radiation 
energy will be much less if only a small part of the body is affected, and the 
overall injury will be reduced.

Not all tissues are exposed equally even in whole body exposures. The body 
provides significant shielding to internal organs, so tissues located in the 
center of the body may receive doses that are only 30-50% of the nominal total 
body dose rate. For example there is a 50% chance of permanent female 
sterility if ovaries are exposed to 200 rems, but this internal exposure is 
only encountered with whole body doses of 400-600 rems.

Radiation exposures from nuclear weapons occur on three time scales:

*  The shortest is exposure from the prompt radiation emitted by the fireball 
which lasts about one minute. This can cause very intense exposures for 
individuals close to the burst point. Neutron bombs rely on prompt radiation 
as the primary damage mechanism, in this case the prompt radiation arrives in 
a fraction of a second.

*  The second scale is due to early (tropospheric) fallout from ground bursts. 
Fallout particles begin settling to the ground within an hour to a few hours 
after an explosion, most of the fallout descend within a day or two. At any 
particular site, the fallout deposition will last no more than several hours. 
Radiation exposure is accumulated as long as an individual remains within the 
fallout deposit zone, but due to the rapid initial decay most of the radiation 
exposure is incurred within the first few days. Exposures can be very large 
during the first few days.

*  The third scale is long term exposure to low levels of radiation, lasting 
months or years. This may be due to any of several causes:
* prolonged residence in areas contaminated by early fallout;
* exposure to delayed (stratospheric) fallout;
* exposure to radioisotopes absorbed by the body.
Long term exposures are not intense, but large total doses can accumulate over 
long periods of time.

The effects of radiation exposure of usually divided into acute and latent 
effects. Acute effects typically result from rapid exposures, the effects show 
up within hours to weeks after a sufficient dose is absorbed. Latent effects 
take years to appear, even after exposure is complete. 

Since the latent effects of radiation exposure are cumulative, and there does 
not appear to be any threshold exposure below which no risk is incurred, 
radiation safety standards have been set to minimize radiation exposure over 
time. Current standards are:

Occupational Exposure
0.3 rem/wk (whole body exposure)
1.5 rem/yr (whole body exposure for pregnant women)
5  rem/yr  (whole body exposure)
15 rem/yr  (eye tissue exposure)
50 rem/yr  (limit for any tissue)
200 rem lifetime limit (whole body exposure)

Public Exposure
0.5 rem/yr (whole body exposure)
5   rem/yr (limit for any tissue)

The occupational exposure limits are likely to be reduced soon (if they have 
not been already).

The normal human annual radiation exposure varies considerably with location 
(elevation and surface mineral composition), and medical treatment. Typical 
values are 0.1 rems from natural radiation and 0.08 rems from medical x-rays, 
for a total of 0.18 rem/yr. In the US, Colorado has one of the highest natural 
backgrounds (0.25 rem) since high altitudes cause greater cosmic ray 
exposures, and granite rock formations contain uranium series radioisotopes. 
If natural radioisotopes are unusually concentrated, levels as high as 0.5-12 
rems/yr have been recorded (some areas of Sri Lanka, Kerala India, and 
Brazil). This does not count indoor radon exposure which depends heavily on 
building design, but can easily exceed all other exposure sources combined in 
regions with high soil radon levels. This source has been known to cause lung 
exposures in the home of 100 rem/yr (a risk factor comparable to heavy 
smoking)! 

5.6.3.3   Prompt Radiation Emission From Nuclear Explosions
Although the subject is complex, a simplified guide to estimating the prompt 
radiation exposure from nuclear explosions is given here. The following 
scaling law can be used to determine the lethal radius with yield:
     r_radiation = Y^0.19 * constant_rad
If Y is in kilotons, range is in meters, and the dose standard is 1000 rads 
then:
    constant_rad_1000  = 700 m

This can then be scaled for distance by adjusting for attenuation with range 
using the table below. The table lists tenth-ranges, the distance over which 
the dose decreases (for greater distance) or increases (for shorter distance) 
by a factor of 10.
1   Kt   330 m
10  Kt   440 m
100 Kt   490 m
1   Mt   560 m
10  Mt   670 m
20  Mt   700 m
So, for example to calculate the radiation dose for a 10 Mt bomb at 5000 m, we 
calculate:
dose = (1000 rads) / 10^[(5000-[10000^0.19]*700)/670] = 35 rads

This guide assumes 100% fission yield for bombs <100 Kt, and 50/50 
fission/fusion for higher yields. Due to the enhanced radiation output of low-
yield neutron bombs different factors need to be used:

    constant_rad_1000  = 620 m
    tenth-range 385 m

5.6.3.4   Acute Radiation Sickness
This results from exposure to a large radiation dose to the whole body within 
a short period of time (no more than a few weeks). There is no sharp cutoff to 
distinguish acute exposures from chronic (extended) ones. In general, higher 
total doses are required to produce a given level of acute sickness for longer 
exposure times. Exposures received over a few days do not differ substantially 
from instantaneous ones, except that the onset of symptoms is correspondingly 
delayed or stretched out. Nuclear weapons can cause acute radiation sickness 
either from prompt exposure at the time of detonation, or from the intense 
radiation emitted by early fallout in the first few days afterward. 

The effects of increasing exposures are described below. A notable 
characteristic of increasing doses is the non-linear nature of the effects. 
That is to say, a threshold exists below which observable effects are slight 
and reversible (about 300 rems), but as exposures rise above this level the 
possibility of mortality (death) begins and increases rapidly with dose. This 
is believed to be due in part to the saturation of cellular repair mechanisms.

The total energy absorbed by a 75 kg individual with a whole body exposure of 
600 rads (fatal in most cases) is 450 joules. It is interesting to compare 
this to the kinetic energy of a .45 caliber bullet, which is about 900 joules.

A power law for scaling radiation effects for longer term exposures has been 
proposed in which the dose required for a given effect increases by t^0.26, 
where time is in weeks. For exposures of one week or less the effect of rem of 
radiation is assumed to be constant. Thus an exposure capable of causing 50% 
mortality is 450 rems if absorbed in a week or less, but is 1260 rems if it 
occurs over a year.

5.6.3.4.1 Acute Whole Body Exposure Effects
Below 100 REMS
In this dose range no obvious sickness occurs. Detectable changes in blood 
cells begin to occur at 25 rems, but occur consistently only above 50 rems. 
These changes involve fluctuations in the overall white blood cell count (with 
drops in lymphocytes), drops in platelet counts, and less severe drops in red 
blood cell counts. These changes set in over a period of days and may require 
months to disappear.  They are detectable only by lab tests. At 50 rems 
atrophy of lymph glands becomes noticeable. Impairment to the immune system 
could increase the susceptibility to disease. Depression of sperm production 
becomes noticeable at 20 rems, an exposure of 80 rems has a 50% chance of 
causing temporary sterility in males.

100-200 REMS
Mild acute symptoms occur in this range. Tissues primarily affected are the 
hematopoietic (blood forming) tissues, sperm forming tissues are also 
vulnerable. Symptoms begin to appear at 100 rems, and become common at 200 
rems. Typical effects are mild to moderate nausea (50% probability at 200 
rems) , with occasional vomiting, setting in within 3-6 hours after exposure, 
and lasting several hours to a day. This is followed by a latent period during 
which symptoms disappear. Blood changes set in and increase steadily during 
the latency period as blood cells die naturally and are not replaced. Mild 
clinical symptoms return in 10-14 days. These symptoms include loss of 
appetite (50% probability at 150 rems), malaise, and fatigue (50% probability 
at 200 rems), and last up to 4 weeks. Recovery from other injuries is impaired 
and there is enhanced risk of infection. Temporary male sterility is 
universal. The higher the dosage in this range, the more likely the effects, 
the faster symptoms appear, the shorter the latency period, and the longer the 
duration of illness.

200-400 REMS
Illness becomes increasingly severe, and significant mortality sets in. 
Hematopoietic tissues are still the major affected organ system. Nausea 
becomes universal (100% at 300 rems), the incidence of vomiting reaches 50% at 
280 rems. The onset of initial symptoms occurs within 1-6 hours, and last 1-2 
days. After this a 7-14 day latency period sets in. When symptoms recur, the 
may include epilation (hair loss, 50% probability at 300 rems), malaise, 
fatigue, diarrhea (50% prob. at 350 rems), and hemorrhage (uncontrolled 
bleeding) of the mouth, subcutaneous tissue and kidney (50% prob. at 400 
rems). Suppression of white blood cells is severe, susceptibility to infection 
becomes serious. At 300 rems the mortality rate without medical treatment 
becomes substantial (about 10%). The possibility of permanent sterility in 
females begins to appear. Recovery takes 1 to several months.

400-600 REMS
Mortality rises steeply in this dose range, from around 50% at 450 rems to 90% 
at 600 (unless heroic medical intervention takes place). Hematopoietic tissues 
remain the major affected organ system. Initial symptoms appear in 0.5-2 
hours, and last up to 2 days. The latency period remains 7-14 days. The 
symptoms listed for 200-400 rems increase in prevalence and severity, reaching 
100% occurrence at 600 rems. When death occurs, it is usually 2-12 weeks after 
exposure and results from infection and hemorrhage. Recovery takes several 
months to a year, blood cell counts may take even longer to return to normal. 
Female sterility becomes probable.

600-1000 REMS
Survival depends on stringent medical intervention. Bone marrow is nearly or 
completely destroyed, requiring marrow transfusions. Gastrointestinal tissues 
are increasingly affected. Onset of initial symptoms is 15-30 minutes, last a 
day or two, and are followed by a latency period of 5-10 days. The final phase 
lasts 1 to 4 weeks, ending in death from infection and internal bleeding. 
Recovery, if it occurs, takes years and may never be complete.

Above 1000 REMS
Very high exposures can sufficient metabolic disruption to cause immediate 
symptoms. Above 1000 rems rapid cell death in the gastrointestinal system 
causes severe diarrhea, intestinal bleeding, and loss of fluids, and 
disturbance of electrolyte balance. These effects can cause death within hours 
of onset from circulatory collapse. Immediate nausea occurs due to direct 
activation of the chemoreceptive nausea center in the brain. 

In the range 1000-5000 rems the onset time drops from 30 minutes to 5 minutes. 
Following an initial bout of severe nausea and weakness, a period of apparent 
well-being lasting a few hours to a few days may follow (called the "walking 
ghost" phase). This is followed by the terminal phase which lasts 2-10 days. 
In rapid succession prostration, diarrhea, anorexia, and fever follow. Death 
is certain, often preceded by delirium and coma. Therapy is only to relieve 
suffering. 

Above 5000 rems metabolic disruption is severe enough to interfere with the 
nervous system. Immediate disorientation and coma will result, onset is within 
seconds to minutes. Convulsions occur which may be controlled with sedation. 
Victim may linger for up to 48 hours before dying.

The U.S. military assumes that 8000 rads of fast neutron radiation (from a 
neutron bomb) will immediately and permanently incapacitate a soldier.

It should be noted that people exposed to radiation doses in the 400-1000 rem 
range following the Chernobyl disaster had much higher rates of survival than 
indicated above. This was made possible by advances in bone marrow 
transfusions and intensive medical care, provided in part by Dr. Robert Gale. 
However two caveats apply:
* Such care is only available if the number of cases is relatively small, and 
the infrastructure for providing it is not disrupted. In the case of even a 
limited nuclear attack it would be impossible to provide more than basic first 
aid to most people and the fatality rates might actually be higher than given 
here.
* Many of the highly exposed Chernobyl survivors have since died from latent 
radiation effects.

5.6.3.4.2 Acute Localized Tissue Exposure
Localized acute exposure is important for two organs: the skin, and the 
thyroid gland.

Beta Burns
Beta particles have a limited range in tissue. Depending on their energy, 
betas are completely absorbed by 1 mm to 1 cm of tissue. External exposures to 
beta particles from fallout thus primarily affect the skin, causing "beta 
burns". Due to the poor penetrating power of betas, these injuries only occur 
if there is direct skin exposure to fallout particles, or if an individual 
remains outdoors in a strong radiation field. Remaining indoors, wearing 
substantial clothing, and decontamination by washing can prevent this type of 
exposure. Beta burns were encountered in Marshall Islanders, and the crew of a 
Japanese fishing vessel, following the Castle Bravo test which unexpectedly 
dumped high fallout levels over a large area. 

The initial symptom for beta burns are an itching or burning sensation during 
the first 24-48 hours. These symptoms are marked only if the exposure is 
intense, and do not occur reliably.  Within 1-2 days all symptoms disappear, 
but after 2-3 weeks the burn symptoms appear. The first evidence is increased 
pigmentation, or possibly erythema (reddening). Epilation and skin lesions 
follow.

In mild to moderate cases damage is largely confined to the epidermis (outer 
skin layers). After forming a dry scab, the superficial lesions heal rapidly 
leaving a central depigmented area, surrounded by an irregular zone of 
increased pigmentation. Normal pigmentation returns over a few weeks.

In more serious cases deeper ulcerated lesions form. These lesions ooze before 
becoming covered with a hard dry scab. Healing occurs with routine first aid 
care. Normal pigmentation may take months to return.

Hair regrowth begins 9 weeks after exposure and is complete in 6 months.

Thyroid Exposure
The short-lived radioisotope iodine-131 (half-life 8 days) presents a special 
risk due to the tendency for ingested iodine to be concentrated in the thyroid 
gland. This risk is mitigated by the fact that direct ingestion of fallout is 
rare, and easily avoided. Iodine-131 typically enters the body through the 
consumption of contaminated milk, which in turn results from milk cows 
consuming contaminated fodder. 

The short half-life means that the initial radiation intensity of I-131 is 
high, but it disappears quickly. If uncontaminated fodder can be provided for 
a month or two, or if dry or canned milk can be consumed for the same period, 
there is little risk of exposure. 

If I-131 contaminated food is consumed, about one-third of the ingested iodine 
is deposited in the thyroid gland which weighs some 20 g in adults, and 2 g in 
infants. This can result in very high dose rates to the gland, with negligible 
exposures to the rest of the body.  Due to the smaller glands of infants and 
children, and their high dairy consumption, they are particularly vulnerable 
to thyroid injury. Some Marshallese children received thyroid doses as high as 
1150 rems. Most of the children receiving doses over 500 rems developed 
thyroid abnormalities within 10 years, including hypothyroidism and 
malignancies.

I-131 exposure can be prevented by prompt consumption of potassium iodide 
supplements. Large doses of potassium iodide saturate the body with iodine and 
prevent any subsequent retention of radioiodine that is consumed.

5.6.3.4.3 Fetal Injury
Acute radiation exposure during pregnancy can cause significant harm to the 
fetus. At Hiroshima and Nagasaki adverse effects were seen when pregnant women 
who were exposed to 200 rems of radiation or more. When exposure occurred 
during the first trimester a significant increase in mentally impaired 
children were noted. When exposure occurred during the last trimester, there 
was a marked increase in stillbirths and in elevated infant mortality during 
the first year of life.

5.6.3.5   Chronic Radiation Exposure
Long term radiation exposure results from residing in a fallout contaminated 
area for an extended period (external exposure), consuming food produced in a 
contaminated area (internal exposure), or both. If the exposure rate is low 
enough, no symptoms of radiation sickness will appear even though a very large 
total radiation dose may be absorbed over time. Latent radiation effects (i.e. 
cancer, genetic damage) depend on total dosage, not dose rate, so serious 
effects can result. An exposure of 0.25 rem/day over 5 years would accumulate 
450 rems with little chance of overt sickness, but it would have a high 
mortality rate if the exposure were acute.

The exposure time scaling law given above also indicates that a slow onset of 
symptoms characteristic of acute radiation sickness can occur.  As an example, 
the most heavily contaminated location of the Rongelap atoll (160 km downwind 
of the March 1, 1954 15 Mt Castle Bravo test), received a total accumulated 
exposure of 3300 rads. Of this, 1100 rads was accumulated during the interval 
from 1 month to 1 year following the test. If the site had been occupied 
during this period, the effective exposure for radiation sickness effects 
would be 1100/(48 weeks)^0.26 = 403 rads.

5.6.3.5.1 External Exposure
When an area is contaminated by gamma emitting isotopes, a radiation field is 
created that exposes all organisms that are not shielded from it. Only gamma 
rays have the necessary range and penetration to create a significant hazard.
The principal source of long-term external exposure is cesium-137 (30 year 
half-life, 0.6 MeV gamma energy).

A megaton of fission yield produces enough Cs-137 to contaminate 100 km^2 with 
a radiation field of 200 rad/year. A megaton-range ground burst can 
contaminate an area of thousands of square kilometers with concentrations that 
would exceed occupational safety guidelines. 3,000 megatons of fission yield, 
if distributed globally by stratospheric fallout, would double the world's 
background radiation level from external exposure to this isotope alone.

It is possible to substantially reduce external exposure in contaminated areas 
by remaining indoors as much as possible. Exposure can be reduced by a factor 
of 2-3 for a frame house, or 10-100 for a multi-story building, and adding 
additional shielding to areas where much time is spent (like the bedroom) can 
increase these factors substantially. Since the half-life of Cs-137 is long, 
these would be permanent lifestyle adjustments. Such measures have been 
necessary (especially for children) in areas of Belarus that were heavily 
contaminated by Chernobyl.

5.6.3.5.2 Internal Exposure
Internal exposure to radiation is the most serious chronic risk from fallout 
if food grown in contaminated areas is consumed. Widespread contamination from 
a nuclear war, or a major radiation accident (like the Kyshtym and Chernobyl 
disasters), may leave no other practical choice. Alternatively, people 
residing in contaminated areas may come to disregard safety instructions about 
locally produced food (as has happened in the Marshall Islands and Ukraine).

Radioisotopes may be taken up into plants through the root system, or they may 
be contaminated by fallout descending on the leaves. Gross contamination of 
food plants or fodder from the fallout plume of a ground burst is an obvious 
hazard, but the gradual descent of worldwide fallout is also a problem.  

The primary risks for internal exposure are cesium-137 and strontium-90. 
Strontium-89, transuranics alpha emitters, and carbon-14 are also significant 
sources of concern.

Only a few curies of radioisotopes per km^2 are sufficient to render land 
unsuitable for cultivation under current radiation safety standards. A megaton 
of fission yield can thus make some 200,000 km^2 useless for food production 
for decades. Depression of leukocyte levels have been observed in people in 
Belarus living in areas that were contaminated with only 0.2 curies/km^2.

Cesium-137
This alkali metal has chemistry resembling that of potassium. As a result, it 
is readily absorbed by food plants, and by animal tissues. Once consumed 
cesium distributes itself fairly evenly through the body, which means that Cs-
137 absorption causes whole body exposure (a fact further aided by the 
penetrating nature of its gamma emissions). Cesium has a moderate residence 
time in the body, the residence half-life ranging from 50-100 days, so that 
the body will be cleared of the isotope once consumption of contaminated 
material ceases in a matter of several months, to a few years.

Strontium 90 and 89
Strontium is chemically similar to calcium, and is deposited in bone along 
with calcium. Most of the strontium ingested does not end up in bone, it has a 
biological half-life only 40 days. Somewhat less than 10% of the Sr is 
retained in the bone, but it has a biological half-life of 50 years. Since the 
bone marrow is among the most sensitive tissue in the body to radiation, this 
creates a very serious hazard. 

Sr-90 (28.1 yr half-life) thus can cause long term damage, while Sr-89 (52 
days) can cause significant short term injury. Safety exposure standards 
impose a Sr-90 body burden limit of 2 microcuries (14 nanograms) for 
occupational exposure, 0.2 microcuries for individual members of the general 
population, and 0.067 microCi averaged over the whole population. It is 
estimated that 10 microCi per person would cause a substantial rise in the 
incidence of bone cancer. The explosion of several thousands of fission 
megatons in the atmosphere could raise the average body burden of the entire 
human race to above the occupational exposure limit for Sr-90 for a couple of 
generations. Contamination of 2 curies of Sr-90 per km^2 is the U.S. limit for 
food cultivation.

Alpha emitting heavy elements can be serious health risks also. The isotopes 
of primary concern here are those present in substantial quantities in nuclear 
weapons: short lived uranium isotopes (U-232 and U-233) and transuranic 
elements (primarily Pu-239, Pu-240, and Americium-241). These elements are 
hazardous if ingested due to radiotoxicity from the highly damaging alpha 
particles. The quantities of these isotopes present after a nuclear explosion 
are negligible compared to the amount of fission product radioisotopes. They 
represent a hazard when nuclear weapons are involved in "broken arrow" 
incidents, that is, accidents where the fissile isotopes inside are released. 
The exposure areas are of course small, compared to the areas threatened by 
fallout from a nuclear detonation. A typical nuclear weapon will contain some 
300-600 curies of alpha emitter (assuming 5 kg plutonium). The isotope 
breakdown is approximately: 300 curies Pu-239, 60 curies Pu-240, and up to 250 
curies of Am-241.

If small particles of alpha emitters are inhaled, they can take up permanent 
residence in the lung and form a serious source of radiation exposure to the 
lung tissue. A microcurie of alpha emitter deposited in the lungs produce an 
exposure of 3700 rems/yr to lung tissue, an extremely serious cancer risk.

Uranium and the transuranic elements are all bone-seekers (with the exception 
of neptunium). If absorbed, they are deposited in the bone and present a 
serious exposure risk to bone tissue and marrow. Plutonium has a biological 
half-life of 80-100 years when deposited in bone, it is also concentrated in 
the liver with a biological half-life of 40 years. The maximum permissible 
occupational body burden for plutonium-239 is 0.6 micrograms (.0375 
microcuries) and 0.26 micrograms for lung burden (0.016 microCi).

Carbon-14 is a weak beta particle emitter, with a low level of activity due to 
its long half-life. It presents a unique hazard however since, unlike other 
isotopes, it is incorporated directly into genetic material as a permanent 
part throughout the body. This means that it presents a hazard out of 
proportion to the received radiation dose as normally calculated.

5.6.3.5.3 Cancer
The most serious long term consequence of radiation exposure is the elevation 
of cancer risk. Estimates of the carcinogenicity of radiation, especially of 
low exposures, have tended to increase over the years as epidemiological data 
has accumulated.

The current state-of-the-art in low level risk estimation is the 1990 report 
issued by the National Academy of Sciences Committee on Biological Effects of 
Ionizing Radiation (BEIR) entitled _Health Effects of Exposure to Low Levels 
of Ionizing Radiation_, also known as BEIR V.

As a general rule of thumb, it appears that cancer risk is more or less 
proportional to total radiation exposure, regardless of the quantity, rate or 
duration. 500 rems received over a decade is thus as serious a risk as 500 
rems received all at once, and 50 rems is one-tenth as bad as 500. There is no 
evidence of a threshold effect or "safe dose". Safety standards are 
established primarily to keep the increased incidence of cancer below 
detectable levels.

Significant deviations from the above rule of proportionality for total 
exposure do occur. In particular, low doses (for which the risk is small 
anyway) received over an extended period of time are significantly less 
carcinogenic (by about a factor of 2) than the same dose received all at once.

Cancer risk to radiation exposure can be expressed as the increase in the 
lifetime probability of contracting fatal cancer per unit of radiation. The 
current estimate of overall risk is about a 0.8% chance of cancer per 10 rems 
for both men and women, averaged over the age distribution of the U.S. 
population. Thus a 1000 rem lifetime whole body radiation exposure would bring 
about a 80% chance of contracting fatal cancer, in addition to the normal 
incidence of cancer (about 20%). The risk for children appears to be about 
twice as great (due at least partly to the fact that they will live longer 
after exposure, and thus have greater opportunity to contract cancer).

There are also risk coefficient for specific tissue exposures. These are 
(approximately):

Female Breast  1.0%/100 rems
Bone Marrow    0.2%/100 rems (0.4% for children)
Bone Tissue    0.05%/100 rems
Lung           0.2%/100 rems

5.6.3.5.4 Genetic Effects 
Radiation damage to the germ cells of the reproductive organs can cause 
mutations that are passed on to subsequent generations. Although this is very 
important, it can nonetheless be overplayed. It may seem surprising, but no 
elevated mutation rate from radiation has ever been detected in the human 
population, not even in the substantial population of atomic bomb survivors 
and descendants. One reason for this is that humans are wild animals, that is, 
they have not been subjected to controlled breeding and thus have a high 
incidence of natural genetic variability and disorders, compared to laboratory 
and domestic animals. About 10% of the human population has detectable genetic 
disorders (most are not serious). This makes it difficult to detect additional 
mutations unless the rate is also high.

Two factors act to limit the effective radiation exposure for genetic effects, 
one for acute exposures, the other for chronic exposures. High acute exposures 
to the reproductive organs can cause permanent sterility, which prevents 
transmission of genetic effects. The cumulative effect of chronic exposure is 
limited by the fact that only exposures prior to reproduction count. Since 
most reproduction occurs before the age of 30, exposures after that age have 
little effect on the population.

It is estimated that the dose to reproductive tissue required to double the 
natural incidence of genetic disorders is 100-200 rems. The initial rate of 
observable disorders (the first generation) is only about 1/3 of the eventual 
rate once genetic equilibrium is established. Of course increases in the rate 
of genetic disorders (especially in a large population) is a _permanent_ 
alteration of the human species.

5.6.3.5.5 Cataracts
Eye tissue exposed to radiation shows an increased incidence of cataracts at 
dose levels below which most tissues show increased cancer rates. This makes 
cataract risk the most important tissue dose criterion for establishing safety 
standards.

6.1     Production of Isotopes</h3><pre>
The most critical materials required for nuclear weapons are special isotopes 
of particular elements. Some of these isotopes exist in nature, but are highly 
diluted by other isotopes of the same element (e.g. deuterium, Li-6, U-235). 
These isotopes must be enriched (concentrated) to be useful. Other isotopes 
naturally exist only in minuscule quantities, if at all, and must be 
manufactured through nuclear reactions (e.g. tritium and Pu-239). An overview 
of these two classes of techniques are given below.

6.1.1   Isotopic Enrichment
All isotopes of the same element have nearly identical chemical properties, 
consequently separating these isotopes must rely on subtle effects created by 
the differences in mass of the atoms. Some of these techniques are physical -  
they rely on physical processes that have mass dependent effects. Others are 
chemical - isotopic mass differences can affect the rate of chemical 
reactions. 

Since small effects are being used to achieve separation, the achievable 
concentration increase for any enrichment process tends to be small. This can 
be overcome by applying the enrichment process many, many times in a series of 
enrichment steps or "stages". Each step takes the enriched product of the 
previous step and enriches it further. This creates a sequential enriching 
system called a cascade. 

There are two important factors that affect the performance of a cascade. 
First is the separation factor, which is a number greater than one, that 
measures the inherent enrichment capability of a single stage. The lower the 
separation factor, the more stages required to achieve the desired degree of 
concentration. The second factor is the allowable loss of the desired isotope 
in the waste stream.

To understand this second factor, note that at each stage the material flow 
feeding the process is split into two parts: the enriched product, and the 
depleted waste. Since the enrichment in the product is small, so is the 
depletion in the waste. The amount of desirable isotope in the waste stream 
can easily exceed the amount in the enriched product. If the isotope being 
concentrated is rare, this is very undesirable. Also if the feed stock is 
already significantly enriched, then the waste stream is also enriched and too 
valuable to simply throw away.

These considerations demand that the cascade be constructed so that the waste 
from downstream (later) enrichment stages be fed back to earlier stages. Each 
stage then receives feed stock consisting of the enriched product from the 
next upstream stage, and the waste from the next downstream cascade. 

The starting material usually does not enter at the beginning of the cascade 
(that is, the stage that is farthest upstream), it enters farther down. The 
stages that are upstream from the starting feed (called the tail of the 
cascade) strip the waste stream of the desired isotope so that the waste that 
actually leaves the cascade is greatly depleted. The stages making up the head 
of the cascade produce progressively more enriched product until the most 
highly enriched product exists the last stage.

For any particular cascade the actual amount of enriched product produced 
depends on the degree of enrichment desired AND on the degree of depletion in 
the waste stream. If it is okay to reject as waste most of desired isotope 
that enters the cascade, then the output of the cascade can be increased by 
producing a large waste stream of slightly depleted material (this can be done 
if the starting material is cheap). If the starting material is precious, then 
a high percentage of the desired isotope can be stripped - which produces 
highly depleted waste. Examples of these two extremes are deuterium enrichment 
where the starting material is water and the feedstock cost is essentially 
zero, and uranium enrichment where the feedstock cost is substantial.

There is quite an assortment of isotope enrichment processes that have been 
used (or proposed) to produce substantial amounts of enriched isotopes. A 
sampling of important ones are:
* Electromagnetic separation
* Gaseous diffusion
* Thermal liquid diffusion
* Gas Centrifuge Separation
* Aerodynamic separation
* AVLIS (atomic vapor laser isotope separation)
* Chemical exchange 
* Distillation
* Electrolysis
The effectiveness of any technique varies from element to element. Some of the 
techniques listed above can be applied to almost any element (e.g. 
electromagnetic separation), others are useful for only a small number of 
isotopes (e.g. electrolysis).

The separation factor for many of these processes (diffusion, chemical 
exchange, distillation) depends on the mass ratio between the isotopes. These 
techniques work best for light elements since each unit of atomic weight 
difference has a bigger effect. The largest isotope mass ratio (for naturally 
occurring isotopes) is 2, for deuterium and hydrogen-1.

Other processes depend on the absolute mass difference, or are otherwise 
insensitive to mass ratios (electromagnetic, centrifuge, aerodynamic, and 
AVLIS separation techniques). These work well for heavy elements, and are the 
methods of choice for uranium enrichment.

The cost of an enrichment process is mostly dependent on two factors: the 
capital cost of the plant, and the energy consumption for operation. Low 
separation factors require more cascade stages and thus both larger capital 
and operating costs. The capital cost is roughly proportional to 1/(s - 1)^2 
where s is the separation factor. Different separation techniques differ 
dramatically in the amount of energy required for a single stage, so a low 
energy cost technique can offset a larger number of stages, or a higher cost 
per stage.

Another factor of some interest is the cascade equilibrium time. Due to 
limitations in the output rate of each cascade unit, the amount of material 
that is passed back to earlier stages by each unit, and the fact that each 
unit holds a certain amount of material, it takes a significant amount of time 
when a cascade is started for the final product to emerge and reach a steady 
output rate. Some types of cascades can take a year to reach equilibrium. 

6.1.1.1  Electromagnetic Separation
This technique uses magnetic fields to separate a stream of ionized atoms in a 
device called a calutron. This is basically a scaled up mass spectrometer. The 
different masses of the isotopes give each a different radius of curvature in 
the magnetic field, causing the stream to separate into two (or more). The 
streams are then captured by target cells. Electromagnetic separation is the 
most versatile technique and can be used with any combination of isotopes. It 
also has an extremely large separation factor. Typically two passes are 
sufficient to produce high purity isotopes (>80%) from low concentration 
starting material (<1%), and will also efficiently strip the desired isotope 
from the waste stream. However it is an inefficient production process, since 
most of the feed is lost inside the calutron and must be recovered during 
periodic maintenance work. Other shortcomings of electromagnetic separation 
are the enormous energy consumption, the difficult and costly equipment 
maintenance, and the limited production rate given the capital cost. It is 
mainly used for producing small quantities of pure isotopes for research.

6.1.1.2  Gaseous Diffusion
This technique is practical for isotopes that have a substantial mass 
difference, and can be converted to gaseous form (and important caveat, the 
mass difference of the gas molecules should be due only to the mass difference 
of the isotopes to be separated). The technique works by allowing the gas to 
diffuse through a porous barrier. Lighter, faster molecules diffuse slightly 
quicker. The quality of the barrier material is critical. It must have even 
pore size, have no leaks at all, and be able to withstand substantial pressure 
differences, and chemical attack by the gaseous isotope. Aside from the 
barrier material problem, gaseous diffusion requires rather ordinary chemical 
plant technology (by today's standards). For some light elements the 
separation factor can be fairly large, but for most it is small (1.00429 for 
uranium). A large number of cascade stages can still achieve high purity, 
although the plant size must be large, and the cost of construction and 
operation is high. This technique has been the dominant enrichment process for 
uranium since the first plant was built in 1945. Although gas diffusion has 
been displaced by gas centrifuges for new plants since the late 70s, the large 
previously installed base makes this still the largest enrichment process 
worldwide.

6.1.1.3  Thermal Liquid Diffusion
This method makes use of the fact that different molecular velocities cause 
lighter molecules to concentrate in hotter regions when a temperature gradient 
exists. The separation factor is determined by the ratio of the mass 
difference and the total masses, so it is larger for light elements. In 
general the separation factor is small (around 1.01), so many cascade stages 
are needed. Although the equipment required is simple, the power requirement 
(for heat) is extremely large, although this can be reduced if waste heat is 
available from other industrial processes. This prevents it from being 
practical on a large scale.

6.1.1.4  Gas Centrifuge Separation
Although Germany developed this technology during W.W.II, it did not see 
application until the fifties and sixties. This technique works by passing 
gaseous isotope mixture through high speed centrifuges. Centrifugal force 
causes the isotopes to concentrate in lighter and heavier gas layers which are 
then bled off. The major advantage of gas centrifuges is that the separation 
factor is due to absolute mass differences, not to mass ratios. It works as 
well with heavy elements as light ones. Separation factors are proportional to 
the square of the ratio between the rotational speed and the molecular 
velocity in the gas. The highest speeds possible are thus very desirable. 
Rotational speeds above the speed of sound (>330 m/sec) are typical, advanced 
designs using carbon fiber rotors can exceed 600 m/sec (in principal Kevlar  
rotors could reach speeds as high as 1100 m/sec). Typical separation factors 
can range from 1.01 to over 1.10. Separation factors depend on the absolute 
mass difference between isotopes (not the mass ratio) and the square of the 
peripheral speed. Thus compared with gaseous diffusion, each centrifuge 
produces a much larger separation factor for heavy elements. A series of 
separation stages are still needed, but there can be many fewer. Gas 
centrifuges consume much less energy than gaseous diffusion, and it is much 
easier to adjust the scale of production plants. Gas centrifuges are the 
dominant uranium enrichment process for new plants in the world today.  A high 
level of technical proficiency is required to build efficient centrifuges, 
which delayed their commercial introduction (along with competition from 
government-subsidized gaseous diffusion plants).

6.1.1.5  Aerodynamic Separation
This can be thought of as a variant on the gas centrifuge approach, except 
that instead of spinning a chamber through which a gas is passed, the gas is 
spun inside a nozzle or vortex tube by injecting it under high pressure. It is 
considerably more energy intensive than centrifuge separation and appears at 
least as intensive as gaseous diffusion. This technology has been developed by 
South Africa and Germany for uranium enrichment.

6.1.1.6  AVLIS (atomic vapor laser isotope separation)
This technology makes use of the fact that isotopes of different masses absorb 
slightly different wavelengths of light (an indirect consequence of the 
nucleus mass difference). Precisely tuned lasers would excite only the isotope 
atoms desired in a stream of atomic vapor. The ionized atoms would then be 
separated from the neutral ones electromagnetically or by chemical reaction. 
AVLIS has not been used on an industrial scale yet. This technique promises to 
allow high efficiency production of high-purity U-235 and Pu-239, although its 
true useful is difficult to judge without an operating plant to observe. AVLIS 
technology, if available, could make it possible for a country to produce 
substantial batches of weapon-grade uranium or plutonium (from commercial 
reactor waste) without being detected. The energy required for separation 
itself is very low, only enough to break the molecular bond or ionize the 
atom. Energy consumption is mostly determined by the efficiency of the laser 
used, which is generally on the order of 0.1%.

6.1.1.7  Chemical Exchange 
This technique makes use of different chemical reaction rates between 
isotopes. It works best for light elements where the reaction rate differences 
are large. Practical plants use reactions that allow the two reactants to be 
in different phases (gas/liquid, solid/liquid, immiscible liquids). This 
permits convenient separation of the enriched and depleted materials, and 
allows continuous countercurrent operation. By also including temperature 
differences between the phases, the separation factor can be considerably 
enhanced. This is the most important process today for producing heavy water, 
for which it is by far the most energy-efficient method. Chemical exchange 
techniques for uranium have also been developed by Japan and France, but have 
never been used for production work. Chemical exchange is also used for 
lithium-6 enrichment.

6.1.1.8  Distillation
This is another thermal concentration technique, light isotopes evaporate more 
rapidly than heavier ones. Again, it works best for light elements with large 
mass ratios. It also helps if the heat of vaporization of the material being 
distilled is low. This has been applied successfully to heavy water 
production.

6.1.1.9  Electrolysis
This technique is unique to the production of heavy water. For reasons that 
are not entirely understood, when water is electrolyzed deuterium is 
concentrated with the remarkable separation factor of 7 or even more. However, 
electrolysis is so energy intensive it is only practical for processing 
enriched water in the later stages of heavy water production.

Representative Separation Factors
                        H/D    C-12/13    U-235/238
Chemical Exchange     1.2-3     1.02       1.0015

Centrifuge (600 m/sec)                     1.233
Electrolysis            7

The total number of stages in cascade is given by:

Ln[R[N_p]/R[N_w]]/Ln[s] - 1

where N_p and N_w are the isotope concentrations in the feed and waste, s is 
the separation factor, and R[N] = N/(1 - N).

6.1.2    Transmutation
The transmutation of one isotope or element into another requires an 
extraordinary type of reagent: sub-atomic particles. Large nuclear weapon 
programs consume some of these artificial isotopes in ton quantities. Only one 
sub-atomic particle is available in the necessary kilogram amounts: neutrons. 
A 1 gigawatt nuclear reactor will produce about 3.75 kg of neutrons during the 
course of a year (assuming constant operation). The fact that neutrons have no 
electrical charge is very important since it allows them to easily penetrate 
the charged electron shells and nucleus of an atom.

Nuclear reactors produce copious quantities of neutrons by their very nature. 
Each fission produces roughly 2.5 neutrons, one of these is required to keep 
the reaction going, the others are available for transmuting other materials 
although some portion of these are unavoidably captured by materials making up 
the reactor structure. Reactors were the first source, and so far remain the 
only source, of large amounts of neutrons. They are not the only conceivable 
source though. At least two others have been proposed.

The first of these was simply to use a nuclear bomb to provide large amounts 
of neutrons. By incorporating the starting material into the bomb structure, 
or packing it around the bomb, substantial quantities of material could be 
transmuted in an instant. The shortcomings of this scheme are collecting the 
product, and avoiding undesirable side effects. Exploding the bomb underground 
could overcome these problems, the product would be removed from the rubble 
filled cavern left behind by mining. The difficulties with this process are 
formidable however, and nuclear explosions are themselves very unpopular no 
matter how well contained so this approach will probably never be used.

An alternative seriously proposed recently is to use particle accelerators to 
produce neutrons without reactors. Recent advances in accelerator technology 
make it possible to produce very intense beams of protons relatively 
efficiently. The protons, upon striking a target material of moderate atomic 
number with energies of a few hundred MeV, would knock loose some 50 neutrons 
each. Considerable time and money would be required to make this practical of 
course.

The principal isotopes produced by neutron transmutation are plutonium 
(produced from U-238) and tritium (from lithium-6). U-233 from thorium is also 
of considerable interest. Plutonium is produced as a byproduct by most nuclear 
reactors. Practical tritium production on the other hand requires special 
isotope production reactors. This is because most reactors use low-enriched 
uranium as fuel, which is mostly U-238 (96-97%). U-238 is thus normally 
present in the reactor in large amounts, and it absorbs most of the excess 
neutrons leaving few available for other purposes. Any natural or low-enriched 
uranium reactor could be considered a plutonium breeder, although the quality 
of the plutonium produced varies considerably depending on how the fuel and 
reactor are managed (this is discussed in greater detail in the section below 
on plutonium). Normally the term "plutonium breeder" in reserved for reactors 
specially designed and operated to produce high quality bomb-grade Pu.

Isotope production reactors use more highly enriched fuel, and heavy water as 
the moderator to minimize neutron losses. These reactors produce substantial 
excesses of neutrons that are absorbed by breeding materials inserted into the 
reactor. These reactors generally produce no power, but they are flexible for 
producing different isotopes. Lithium, depleted or natural uranium, or thorium 
can all be used. Since producing one atom of any isotope requires one neutron, 
the production rate for plutonium or U-233 in an isotope production reactor is 
80 times higher than that of tritium.

The production in a breeder reactor is determined by the reactor operating 
power. Typically these reactors produce somewhat less than one atom of product 
for every atom consumed by fission. The breeding ratio (number of product 
atoms/number of fuel atoms) is usually 0.8-0.9. US isotope reactors at 
Savannah, GA have a ratio of 0.86. A reactor consumes about one gram of fuel 
for every megawatt-day of operation,. A 100 megawatt reactor can thus produce 
about 85 g of Pu a day, or 1 g of tritium. Natural uranium fueled breeder 
reactors may have a higher breeding ratio than this for plutonium, but they 
have limited capacity for producing other isotopes.

The rate of isotope production can also be thought of as the product of the 
neutron flux intensity, the concentration of raw material in the reactor core, 
and the volume of the core. This view point helps explain another important 
factor, the build up of contaminating isotopes, which is a problem with 
plutonium and U-233 production.

Taking Pu-239 as an example, we note that initially there is no Pu-239 present 
in a freshly loaded reactor. Its concentration builds up at a rate 
proportional to: (neutron flux)*(U-238 concentration). This Pu-239 is 
essentially pure. The plutonium is exposed to the same flux as the U-238, so 
it also participates in neutron reactions. The rate of these reactions is 
proportional to the Pu concentration, so the rates are initially very small. 
Mostly these reactions are simply fission, partially offsetting the Pu 
production but also releasing more neutrons for breeding. 

Pu-239 has a larger fission cross section than U-235, but it also has a much 
larger neutron absorption (non-fission capture) cross section. Absorption 
results in the following reaction:
     Pu-239 + n -> Pu-240
As the concentration of Pu-239 grows, so too does the rate of Pu-240 
production. Since the ratio of these two isotopes in the plutonium present in 
the reactor ultimately depends on the ratio of their respective production 
rates, the percentage of the plutonium consisting of Pu-240 grows steadily as 
more Pu accumulates.

Pu-240 in turn breeds Pu-241, which leads to Pu-242. The longer the 
irradiation of the U-238 continues (either in fuel rods, or in a Pu production 
blanket), the lower the percentage of the most desirable isotope (Pu-239) in 
the plutonium. Other plutonium isotopes are also produced (see below under 
Plutonium). Similar processes lead to contamination of reactor-produced U-233 
as well.

6.2     Fissionable Materials</h3><pre>
There are three isotopes known which are practical for use as fission 
explosives. These are U-235, Pu-239, and U-233. Of these only U-235 occurs in 
nature. Pu-239 and U-233 must be produced by bombarding other isotopes with 
neutrons. A third element, thorium (Th-232), can only undergo fast fission, 
but can also be used for breeding U-233. There are other elements that are 
also fissile but they have no practical significance for a variety of reasons. 
These elements are summarized in subsection 6.2.4.

6.2.1   Uranium (U)
Uranium, element 92, named after the planet Uranus, is usually given credit 
for being the last element on the periodic table to have survived from the 
time that the Earth formed (but see section 6.2.2 Plutonium below). It has 
fourteen isotopes, all radioactive. In nature only three are found. The 
approximate isotopic composition of natural uranium, with half-lifes is:
          Mass %   Atomic %     Half Life
 U-234   0.0054%   0.0055%  247 thousand years (alpha emitter)
 U-235   0.7110%   0.7202%  710 million years  (alpha emitter)
 U-238  99.2836%  99.2742%  4.51 billion years (alpha emitter)
Although the U-235 content of uranium is in general constant, occasional 
variations do occur on the order of 0.1% of the U-235 content (that is in the 
range of 0.7195-0.7209% as atomic %) due to depletion from ancient fission 
reactions that took place when U-235 existed in much higher concentrations 
than today. The 1.9 billion year old reactor centers discovered in 1972 at the 
Oklo mine in Gabon are the most famous. When the Oklo reactors were active 
natural uranium was about 3% U-235, the same as commercial power reactor fuel 
today. In the most highly depleted core at Oklo the U-235 content was only 
0.44%. 

The U-234 content can also vary significantly. It is an indirect decay product 
of U-238 and is produced by the decay chain:
U-238 -> (4.51 billion years, alpha) -> Th-234
Th-234 -> (24.1 day, beta) -> Pa-234
Pa-234 -> (6.75 hr, beta) -> U-234
Normally the U-234 exists in equilibrium with U-238, with the U-234 decaying 
away as fast as it is formed. Since the decaying atoms exist briefly as 
thorium and protactinium isotopes prior to the formation of U-234, they can 
become separated from the uranium bearing ore through chemical or physical 
processes. Ground water can preferentially leach one or both isotopes from 
uranium bearing soil, giving rise to ground water uranium with an isotopic 
composition enriched as much as 13 fold in U-234. Due to the short half-life, 
essentially all of the U-234 present in uranium has been formed in the last 
few million years. In equilibrium it accounts for about half of natural 
uranium's radioactivity.

U-236, with a half-life of 23.9 million years, is not found in nature in 
significant quantities. It accumulates when uranium is exposed to neutrons in 
reactors and can thus be used as a tracer for identifying uranium containing 
reprocessed fuel.

Before World War II uranium was thought to be a rare metal, it is now known to 
be more common than mercury or silver, and about as abundant as arsenic and 
molybdenum (as a mineable ore). The discovery of large supplies has driven the 
price down to several dollars a pound. In the lithosphere (earth's crust) it 
is actually more common than such inexpensive elements as boron and zinc, 
existing in average quantities of 4 g/tonne. It is abundant enough in granitic 
rock to make radon gas (a decay product) a serious health hazard where 
outcrops are common. It is found in seawater at a concentration of 150 
micrograms/tonne (cubic meter).

Its properties have been exploited at least since AD 79 (it has been found in 
yellow ceramic glazes dating from this time). It was discovered in 1789 by 
Klaproth in the mineral pitchblende, and was first isolated as a metal in 1841 
by Peligot.

During the Manhattan Project natural uranium was code named "tuballoy", after 
the code named Tube Alloy Division of the project. This name is still 
encountered occasionally to refer to natural or depleted uranium. The code 
name for highly enriched uranium (specifically weapon-grade uranium) was 
"oralloy", which is also still encountered. The names "Q-metal", 
"depletalloy", and "D-38", once applied to depleted uranium, have fallen into 
disuse.

Uranium is a very heavy, silvery white lustrous metal. It is the eighth 
densest element. When pure it is a little softer than steel; is malleable, and 
ductile. It is chemically reactive. It oxidizes readily, a piece of metal 
progressively turns different colors as a thin oxide layer builds up (the same 
optical phenomenon that makes oil films colorful). It ignites in air at 150- 
175 deg. C forming U3O8. Powdered uranium is pyrophoric, spontaneously 
bursting into flame. Water attacks the metal. It is attacked by acids, but not 
alkalis.

The basic properties of pure uranium are:
melting point 1132.2 degrees C (+/- 0.8); similar to that of copper
boiling point 3818 degrees C
density 18.95 (alpha form, stable to 667.8 deg. C)
specific heat 6.65 cal/mole/Deg. C (25 deg. C)
tensile strength 450 MPa

The specific activity of natural uranium is 0.67 microCi/g (split almost 50/50 
between the rare U-234 isotope, and U-238; U-235 is a minor contributor).

The metal is usually prepared by reducing uranium halides (commonly the 
tetrafluoride) with magnesium by an exothermic reaction in a steel "bomb" 
(Thermite process).

A particularly important uranium compound is uranium hexafluoride (UF6). This 
is the only uranium compound that is stable and volatile near room 
temperature, and is used for gas phase uranium enrichment processes (diffusion 
and centrifugation). In this application it has the additional advantage that 
fluorine has only a single isotope, thus adding no complicating mass 
differences. It forms colorless crystals at room temperature, but sublimes 
(evaporates without melting) at 56 deg. C. Its melting point is 64 deg. C. It 
has a density of 4.87 (solid) and 3.86 (liquid). It is a powerful fluorinating 
agent, attacking most metals and oxides. It does not attack aluminum oxide 
(alumina). Aluminum metal resists attack (due to the thin alumina coating the 
metal possesses) as does nickel (due to the formation of a nickel fluoride 
layer). Most equipment for handling UF6 are made of aluminum or nickel alloys, 
or are nickel plated. Fluorinated hydrocarbons (e.g. Teflon) are excellent. It 
reacts instantly with water. Reactions with trace contaminants produce non-
volatile lower fluorides that clog equipment.

As a footnote to uranium's role in weapons research, the compound uranium 
hydride, UH3, deserves mention. It was extensively studied at Los Alamos 
during the Manhattan Project as a possible bomb material. The theory was that 
the presence of hydrogen would moderate the neutrons, slowing the down to a 
region where U-235 has a much higher fission cross section. Although this 
would make the bomb less efficient, it was hoped that much smaller amounts of 
fissionable material might be needed. Further research showed that the 
unexpectedly low density (8), and the actual capture cross section of U-235 
made this scheme unworkable. Implosion tests in the 1950s with (U-235)H3 cores 
verified this by producing negligible yields.

Reserves and commercial uranium transactions are expressed in U3O8 equivalent 
masses. The largest estimated reserves (May 1995, excluding Russia and 
Uzbekistan) are: Australia (27%), Kazakhstan (18%), Canada (14%), South 
Africa(9%), Namibia (9%), Brazil (8%), and the US (4%). Russia and Uzbekistan 
also have large supplies, and commercial supplies have also been found in 
Gabon, Zaire, Kyrgyzstan, Czech Republic, Ukraine, and the UK (Cornwall). 
Worldwide reserves of inexpensive uranium ore (defined as uranium recoverable 
at a cost of US$80/kg or less) is estimated at 3386 million kg U3O8 (again 
excluding Russia and Uzbekistan).

As of the end of 1994, known US uranium reserves U3O8 were 133 million kg 
U3O8, and 432 million kg U3O8 at US$110/kg.  Approximately 73 percent of these 
reserves are located in deposits in New Mexico, Texas, and Wyoming. The 
average 1994 spot price for natural uranium in the United States in was 
$20.50/kg, a record low. Between 1985 and 1994 US uranium prices averaged 
US$69.51/kg U3O8 (US suppliers) and US$42.27/kg (foreign suppliers). World 
unrestricted prices were at US$18.16 in October 1994, and are now (June 1996)  
at US$38.90.

It has been observed that the energy contained in coal in the form of trace 
uranium exceeds the energy content derived by combustion. 

6.2.1.1 U-235
This relatively scarce isotope is the only naturally occurring material 
suitable for the production of energy through fission. For use in a fission 
weapon, or for convenient power production, it needs to be concentrated to 
levels higher than that found in nature. Although civilian power plants 
require uranium with a concentration of 2-4.5% U-235, weapons require a 
minimum of 80% U-235, and preferably more than 90%. US weapon grade uranium is 
at least 93.5% U-235, US enrichment plants are capable of producing a 97.65% 
"top product" (this is used in naval reactors). Uranium enriched to 80% or 
more is known generically as HEU, "highly enriched uranium" (a cut-off of 20% 
is also used). US weapons grade uranium is called "oralloy", a wartime code-
name derived from "Oak Ridge Alloy" that has remained in use. 

Since it is lighter still, U-234 is proportionately enriched even more than U-
235. Highly enriched U-235 typically contains 1.5-2.0% U-234.

U-235 has a spontaneous fission rate of 0.16 fissions/sec-kg. A pure mass of 
U-235 weighing 60 kg would thus emit only 9.6 fissions/sec, making gun 
assembly quite easy. U-238 produces 35 times as many neutrons per kg, so even 
a small percentage percent of U-238 contaminant multiples this rate several 
fold. The U-234 contaminant with a fission rate 22 times higher has a similar 
effect. The specific activity for U-235 is 2.1 microCi/g (for the pure 
isotope); 0.8% of U-234 would increase this to 51 microCi/g.

6.2.1.1.1 U-235 Isotope Enrichment 
Five technologies have been used for the large scale concentration of U-235:
* Electromagnetic separation
* Gaseous diffusion
* Thermal liquid diffusion
* Gas Centrifuge Separation
* Aerodynamic Separation

In addition serious attention continues to be paid to the following 
techniques:
* AVLIS 
* Chemical separation

The first three technologies listed (electromagnetic, gaseous diffusion, and 
thermal liquid diffusion) were used during World War II by the US to separate 
significant amounts of U-235.

The separative capacity of a plant (or a single stage) is measured in mass 
separative work units (SWU) per unit time, for example kg-SWU/yr of ton-
SWU/yr. The output of enriched product from a plant of a given capacity is 
determined also by the concentration of isotope in the product, feed, and 
waste. The concentration in the feed is usually fixed by nature, but the feed 
and waste concentrations can be varied. Allowing a higher concentration in the 
waste (or "tails") boosts product output, but at the expense of more feed per 
unit of product. The relationship is:

P = U/[V(N_p) + [(N_p-N_f)/(N_f-N_w)]V(N_w) - (1+[(N_p-N_f)/(N_f-N_w)])V(N_f)]

where P is the product output rate, U is the separative capacity; N_p, N_f, 
N_w are the molar concentrations of isotope in the product, feed, and waste 
(measured in fractions, not percent); and V(N_p), V(N_w), V(N_f)are the 
separative potential functions for each concentration. The separative 
potential function is defined as:

V(N) = (2N-1)Ln(N/1-N)  where Ln is the natural logarithm

Assuming tails of 0.25%, a plant with a capacity of 3100 kg-SWU/yr will 
produce 15 kg of 90% U-235 annually (enough for one implosion-type bomb) from 
natural uranium. It should be observed that if 3% U-235 is used as feed 
(commercial pressurized water reactor fuel), and natural concentration uranium 
is the waste, then only 886 kg-SWU/yr are required for this same output rate. 
Even low-enriched uranium could greatly assist a weapon production program if 
it was diverted.

Worldwide enrichment capacity is currently at 49 million separative work units 
(SWU). An annual demand of 26 to 38 million SWU is projected over the next 20
years.

Electromagnetic Separation
This was the first technique capable of producing bomb grade uranium to be 
perfected, and is probably the easiest for a low technology country to 
acquire. It was used in the Y-12 plant built at Oak Ridge by the US during 
W.W.II. Y-12 used two separation stages to produce material of 80-90% purity. 
Low enrichment uranium tetrachloride feed produced by the other two processes 
was used to boost output compared to using natural uranium. All of the U-235 
in the Hiroshima bomb was purified by this technique. This method was 
abandoned in 1946 due to its cost. Apparently the only country to pursue this 
method seriously since has been Iraq.

Gaseous Diffusion
This was the first practical industrial scale uranium isotope separation 
technique. This method uses the different molecular speeds of molecules in 
uranium hexafluoride vapor to achieve separation. Due to the fact that 
thousands of stages are needed for high enrichment, a diffusion plant 
producing weapon-grade U-235 must be enormous and to be practical have a large 
production capacity as well. Developing suitable diffusion barriers that can 
resist UF6 corrosion is difficult. Barriers are of two general types, thin 
film tubes and aggregated particle tubes. Thin films use a thin barrier with 
diffusion pores formed by etching. Nitric acid leaching of 40/60 Au/Ag alloy 
or Ag/Zn alloy have been studied. Electrolytic etching of aluminum foil forms 
a brittle porous alumina barrier. Teflon films have also been studied. 
Aggregate barriers are made of small particles that are sintered or compacted 
to form relatively thick porous walls. The barrier material suitable for large 
scale production appears to have been sintered nickel powder. Diffusion 
barrier technology has been kept classified by all countries that have 
developed it.

A 3024 stage plant called K-25 was built at Oak Ridge by the US during W.W.II, 
and continued operating until the 1970s. Developing suitable barrier materials 
was difficult and held up completion of the plant until after the end of the 
war, although the partially completed plant contributed to the production of 
Little Boy. The barriers in use at this time were tubes made from sintered 
nickel powder, efforts to get a promising film barrier (probably 
electrolytically etched aluminum) into production in time failed. K-25 
originally had 162,000 m^2 of barrier surface. This plant, with expansions, 
produced the majority of the fissionable material for US weapons into the 
sixties. Improvements in barrier technology allowed performance enhancement by 
a factor of 23 by 1974. 

Although basic plant construction is within the capabilities of standard 
chemical engineering technology today, developing barriers is a problem that 
must be overcome. Diffusion plants consume much less energy than 
electromagnetic plants, but the consumption is still quite large. Capital 
costs still dominate the cost of operation however. After an efficiency 
upgrade program, US plants in 1981 had a specific power consumption of 2370 
KWhr/kgSWU. Although low enriched uranium is valuable as feed to a plant 
intended to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU), a gaseous diffusion plant 
built specifically for low enriched uranium production cannot be easily 
diverted to produce HEU. High enrichment calls for diffusion stages much 
smaller than the large units used for low enriched material, both because the 
feed rate is dramatically lower, and because of criticality problems if a 
stage hold too much material. A commercial gaseous diffusion plant typically 
takes 1-2 months to reach equilibrium after start-up (an HEU plant would take 
longer, due to the greater number of successive stages). 

A number of countries have used this technology, including Argentina which 
successfully developed gaseous diffusion technology and operated a plant in a 
secret weapon program (now terminated). In 1979 more than 98% of all uranium 
separation capacity in the world used this process. By the mid 80s, this had 
dropped to 95% as new gas centrifuge plants came on line.

Thermal Liquid Diffusion
The first technology to produce substantial amounts of (slightly) enriched 
uranium. This technology was used by the US during W.W.II to boost the output 
of the Y-12 plant by providing slightly enriched feedstock. The thermal 
diffusion technology is the simplest of all these techniques, but is capable 
of enriching U-235 only to around 1% (the S-50 plant at Oak Ridge produced 
0.85-0.89% U-235). Immense amounts of heat are required.

Gas Centrifuge Separation
Although Germany developed this technology during W.W.II, it did not see 
application until the sixties. It is the dominant U-235 separation technique 
for new plant construction today, although existing capacity is still mostly 
gaseous diffusion. By passing uranium hexafluoride vapor through high speed 
centrifuges, the isotopes concentrate in lighter and heavier gas layers which 
are bled off. Each centrifuge produces a much larger separation factor than a 
gaseous diffusion barrier. Fewer separation stages are needed, on the order of 
a thousand, but the cost of each stage is much higher than for a gaseous 
diffusion plant. Gas centrifuge separation requires <10% of the power required 
by gaseous diffusion, and it is easier to adjust the scale of production 
plants. A modern gas centrifuge provides at least 6 kg-SWU/yr of separative 
capacity. The specific power consumption is 100-250 kWhr/kgSWU. A high level 
of technical proficiency is required to build efficient centrifuges. This 
technology was successfully acquired by Pakistan and India, and was avidly 
pursued by Iraq and Brazil.

Aerodynamic Separation
This technology was developed by South Africa (UCOR process, using vortex 
tubes operating at a pressure of 6 bar) and Germany (using curved nozzles 
operating below atmospheric pressure, 0.25-0.5 bar). South Africa has been the 
only country to use it on a large scale. It produced about 400 kg of bomb-
grade uranium at a plant at Valindaba, which was shut down in the late 
eighties. Separation factors of at least 1.015 have been achieved. It requires 
as much or more energy as gaseous diffusion, a typical figure is 3300 
kWhr/kgSWU.

AVLIS (atomic vapor laser isotope separation)
Never used in practice, this technology was being developed in the US during 
the 70s and 80s until it was killed due to a world-wide glut of isotope 
separation capacity and reductions in the strategic arsenal. A billion dollar 
AVLIS plant was planned for Idaho Falls, Idaho during the eighties but was 
never constructed.

Chemical Separation
Chemical exchange techniques for uranium have also been developed by Japan and 
France, but have never been used for a production plant. The French Chemex 
method involves a countercurrent of two immiscible liquids, each containing 
dissolved uranium, in a tall column. The Japanese Asahi process uses an 
exchange reaction between an aqueous solution and a finely powdered resin 
through which the solution percolates slowly. Both require special catalysts 
to accelerate the concentration process. The Chemex process has demonstrated a 
power consumption of 600 kWhr/kgSWU. Iraq pursued this technology (in the form 
of a combined Chemex/Asahi plant) as a means to partially enrich U-235 to 6-8% 
for use as a calutron feedstock. By cutting the amount of feed to be 
processed, output would have been boosted 8-11 times.

given below, with typical relative power consumptions (gaseous diffusion = 1):

6.2.1.2 U-238
Although it can't be used as a primary fissile material due to the high 
threshold energy required for neutrons to cause fission, U-238 is still a very 
important nuclear material.

Due to its high density and atomic weight it is useful in bomb construction as 
a tamper/reflector for both fission and fusion assemblies. The fact that it 
*is* fissioned by fast neutrons means that it can boost weapon yield 
indirectly by multiplying reflected neutrons, or directly by the fast fission 
of the tamper. About 40% of fission neutrons, and all fusion neutrons, are 
energetic enough to fission U-238.

U-238 has a spontaneous fission rate some 35 times that of U-235, 5.51 
fissions/sec-kg. This prevents its use as a tamper/reflector in bombs using 
gun assembly since a reasonable amount (200-300 kg)would emit too many 
neutrons. Pure U-238 has a specific activity of 0.333 microCi/g.

It is also the raw material for breeding plutonium-239, a very valuable 
primary fissile isotope. Any reactor that uses natural or partially enriched 
uranium (i.e. nearly every reactor in the world) contains U-238 and thus 
breeds plutonium.

6.2.1.3 U-233
This fissile uranium isotope (half-life 162,000 years) is not found in nature. 
It is instead bred from thorium-232 in a manner similar to the production of 
Pu-239:

Th-232 + n -> Th-233
Th-233 -> (22.2 min, beta) -> Pa-233
Pa-233 -> (27.0 day, beta) -> U-233

A side reaction chain also occurs during breeding:
Th-232 + n -> Th-231 + 2n
Th-231 -> (25.5 hr, beta) -> Pa-231
Pa-231 + n -> Pa-232
Pa-232 -> (1.31 day, beta) -> U-232

The presence of U-232 is important because of its decay chain:
U-232 -> (76 yr, alpha) -> Th-228
Th-228 -> (1.913 yr, alpha) -> Ra-224
Ra-224 -> (3.64 day, alpha & gamma) -> Rn-220
Rn-220 -> (55.6 sec, alpha) -> Po-216
Po-216 -> (0.155 sec, alpha) -> Pb-212
Pb-212 -> (10.64 hr, beta & gamma) -> Bi-212
Bi-212 -> (60.6 min, beta & gamma) -> Po-212
                     alpha & gamma) -> Tl-208
Po-212 -> (3x10^-7 sec, alpha) -> Pb-208 (stable)
Tl-208 -> (3.06 min, beta & gamma) -> Pb-208

The rapid decay sequence beginning with Ra-224 produces a large amount of 
energetic gamma rays. About 85% of this total gamma energy output is due to 
the last isotope in the sequence, thallium-208 which produces the most 
energetic gamma rays (up to 2.6 MeV). The amount of gamma radiation emitted is 
proportional to the amount of Th-228 present.  

The buildup of U-232 as a contaminant is unavoidable during the production of 
U-233 (this is similar to the plutonium isotope contamination problem 
discussed below in plutonium production). U-232 levels could be expected in 
the range of 0.5-1.0% for weapon grade U-233. Over the first couple years 
after U-233 containing U-232 is processed, Th-228 builds up to a nearly 
constant level, balanced by its own decay. During this time the gamma 
emissions build up and then stabilize. Thus over a few years a fabricated mass 
of U-233 will build up very strong gamma emissions. This is a major safety 
problem in handling weapons that do not have heavy tampers to absorb the 
gammas. It has been calculated that gamma emissions from a 10 kg sphere of U-
233 could be expected to reach 11 rem/hr at 1 meter after 1 month, 110 rem/hr 
after 1 year, and 200 rem/hr after 2 years. Even if a factor of 1000 
attenuation is assumed, close contact of no more than 25 hours/year with such 
a weapon would be possible and remain within safety standards. Thus even 
weapons with heavy tampers, which may attenuate 99% of the emissions, remain 
relatively hazardous from an occupational exposure viewpoint.

The gammas cause the neutron background level to rise in weapons containing 
beryllium, due to the Be-9 + gamma -> Be-8 + neutron reaction. The gammas also 
provide a distinctive signature that can be used to detect and track the 
weapons from a distance.

The short half-life of U-232 also gives it very high alpha activity. A 1% U-
232 content gives U-233 three times the alpha activity of weapon-grade 
plutonium, and a correspondingly higher radiotoxicity.

This high alpha activity also gives rise to an even more serious neutron 
emission problem than the gamma/beryllium reaction mentioned above. Alpha 
particles interact with light element contaminants in the fissile material to 
produce neutrons. This process is a much less prolific generator of neutrons 
in uranium metal than the spontaneous fission of the Pu-240 contaminant in 
plutonium though. 

To minimize this problem the presence of light elements (especially, 
beryllium, boron, fluorine, and lithium) must be kept low. This not an 
especially difficult problem for U-233 intended for implosion systems since 
the neutron background constraint is not too severe. For gun-type bombs the 
required purity level for these elements is on the order of 1 part per 
million. Although achieving such purity is not a trivial task, it is certainly 
achievable with standard chemical purification techniques. The ability of the 
semiconductor industry to prepare silicon in bulk with a purity of parts per 
billion (or better) raises the possibility of virtually eliminating neutron 
emissions by sufficient purification.

U-233 has a spontaneous fission rate of 0.47 fissions/sec-kg. U-232 has a 
spontaneous fission rate of 720 fissions-sec/kg.

Despite the gamma and neutron emission drawbacks, U-233 is otherwise an 
excellent primary fissile material. It has a much smaller critical mass than 
U-235, and its nuclear characteristics are similar to plutonium. The US has 
conducted quite a number of bomb tests using this isotope, although the 
purpose of these tests is not clear. India is believed to have produced U-233 
as part of its weapons research and development, and officially includes U-233 
breeding as part of its nuclear power program.

Its specific activity (not counting U-232 contamination) is 9.5 milliCi/g. 1% 
U-232 content raises this to 212 milliCi/g.

6.2.1.4  Depleted Uranium
When U-235 has been extracted from natural uranium, the remaining uranium is 
called "depleted uranium" because it has been depleted of U-235. Typically it 
still contains 0.25-0.4% U-235 since it is not economical to strip U-235 in 
concentrations this low (it is cheaper just to buy more natural uranium with 
higher concentrations). The US tails concentration was 0.2531% in 1963, rising 
to 0.30% in the 70s. Due to the recent low cost of uranium, the trend has been 
toward higher tails concentrations in recent years.

The US has some 560,000 tonnes of depleted uranium hexafluoride (UF6) 
currently stored in cylinders at DOE's three gaseous diffusion plant sites:
Paducah, Kentucky; Portsmouth, Ohio; and Oak Ridge, Tennessee. (This is 
probably not the complete US DU inventory.)

Depleted uranium is about half as radioactive as natural uranium, almost 
entirely due to the removal of U-234, but its bulk properties are otherwise 
identical. Because the major use of uranium is for power production, depleted 
uranium is a waste product with little economic value. Finding uses for 
depleted uranium stockpiles has been a problem for enrichment plants.

The uses it has found have generally been related to its great density and 
comparatively low cost. It two most important uses are as a radiation 
shielding material, and as balance weights in aerospace applications such as 
aircraft control surfaces, each Boeing 747 contains 1500 kg of DU for this 
purpose. It is used extensively in oil-well drilling in the form of sinker 
bars, weights used to lower instruments into mud-filled well holes. It has 
also been used in high-performance gyroscope rotors, large inertial energy-
storage flywheels, and as ballast in ballastic missile reentry vehicles and 
racing yachts.

Most famously, it is used in armor-piercing ammunition by the US. When 
suitably alloyed and heat treated (alloyed with 2% Mo or 0.75% Ti; rapid 
quenching for 850 deg. C in oil or water, followed by aging at 450 deg. for 5 
hrs) uranium is as hard and strong as hardened tool steel (tensile strength 
>1600 MPa). Combined with its great density this makes it very effective at 
punching through armor, consistently superior to the much more expensive 
moncrystalline tungsten, it nearest competitor. The penetration process 
pulverizes much of the uranium, which explodes into burning fragments when it 
hits the air on the other side, adding to the destruction. Some 300 tonnes of 
depleted uranium were fired on the battlefield during Desert Storm (mostly 
from the GAU-8 30-mm guns of A-10 attack planes, each round contains 272 grams 
of DU alloy). It is also used in advanced armor, like that used on the M-1 
Abrams tank.

6.2.2    Plutonium (Pu)
Plutonium, element 94, named after the planet Pluto, was discovered by 
artificial production by Seaborg, McMillan, Kennedy, and Wahl in 1940 at 
Berkeley. The isotope Pu-239 exists naturally in trace amounts in uranium ore 
(several parts per quadrillion) produced by the capture of spontaneous fission 
neutrons by U-238. Extremely small amounts of Pu-244 (the longest lived 
plutonium isotope, with a half-life of 80 million years) have been reportedly 
detected in cerium ore, apparently surviving remnants of plutonium present at 
the formation of the earth.

Plutonium is produced by bombarding U-238 with slow neutrons, in a nuclear 
reactor for large amounts (a process called breeding). If a slow neutron is 
captured, then U-239 is produced which quickly decays into neptunium-239 and 
then plutonium:
  U-238 + n -> U-239 
  U-239  -> (23.5 min., beta) -> Np-239
  Np-239 -> (2.35 days, beta) -> Pu-239

Fifteen isotopes of plutonium are known, all are radioactive. The principle 
ones of interest to the design of nuclear weapons, and their half-lifes, are:
Pu-238 -> (86 years, alpha) ->     U-234
Pu-239 -> (24360 years, alpha) ->  U-235 
Pu-240 -> (6580 years, alpha) ->   U-236
Pu-241 -> (14.0 years, beta) ->    Am-241
Pu-242 -> (370000 years, alpha) -> U-238

Plutonium is a very heavy silvery metal, bright like nickel when freshly 
cleaned. It is a highly electronegative, chemically reactive element, 
considerably more so than uranium. It quickly tarnishes, forming  a succession 
of interference colors (like an oil film), eventually becoming dark purple-
black. If corrosion is sufficiently severe, a loose olive-green powder (PuO2) 
forms on the surface.

Plutonium oxidizes readily, and corrodes very quickly in the presence of even 
traces of moisture. Oddly, it corrodes much faster in an inert atmosphere if 
moisture is present, than it does in ordianry air or pure oxygen. The reason 
is that direct attack by oxygen forms an adherent plutonium oxide layer that 
retards further corrosion, attack by moisture produces a loose oxide and 
hydride mixture.  efficient desiccator is necessary to preve and oxidizes and 
corrodes readily, and is attacked by moisture.

It is brittle in the alpha phase, which exists at room temperature in pure 
plutonium, but ductile alloys exist. 

Plutonium has a large number of very peculiar properties. It has the lowest 
thermal conductivity of any metal, its electrical conductivity is lower than 
any metal but manganese (other reports claim flatly that it is the lowest). It 
is the most viscous liquid metal known. And it undergoes the most extreme and 
bizarre density changes with temperature of any element.

It has significant solubility only in very acidic solutions, such as nitric 
and hydrochloric acid (as the nitrate and chloride). Plutonium salts hydrolyze 
readily in contact with neutral of basic solution, forming insoluble plutonium 
hydroxide. Concentrated plutonium solutions are unstable due to radiolytic 
decomposition, resulting in precipitation.

The basic properties of plutonium are:
melting point 641 degrees C; similar to that of aluminum
boiling point 3232 degrees C
density 19.84 (alpha phase)

Plutonium has six distinct phases (crystal structures) in solid form, more 
than any other element (actually there is a seventh that exists under certain 
conditions). Some of the phase changes involve dramatic changes in volume. In 
two of these phases (delta and delta prime) plutonium has the unique property 
of shrinking with increasing temperature, in the others it has an extremely 
large thermal expansion coefficient. Plutonium also contracts upon melting, 
allowing unmelted plutonium to float. In its densest form, the alpha phase, 
plutonium is the sixth densest element (only osmium, iridium, platinum, 
rhenium, and neptunium are denser). 

The densities and temperature ranges of these phases are:
Phase            Density       Stability Range (degrees C)
alpha            19.84  (20 C)   stable below 122
beta             17.8  (122 C)   122 - 206
gamma            17.2  (206 C)   224 - 300
delta/
delta prime      15.9  (319 C)   319 - 476
epsilon          17.0  (476 C)   476 - 641 (melting point)
liquid           16.65 (641 C)   641 - to boiling point

By the end of 1995 about 1270 tonnes of plutonium had been produced world 
wide, 257 tonnes for weapon use, the rest as a by-product of commercial power 
production. Due to the rapid recent growth of the world wide nuclear power 
industry, reactor grade uranium is currently being generated by commerical 
operations at a rate of 75 tonnes/yr. About 210 tonnes of the commercial 
plutonium has been separated from nuclear fuel (and all of the military 
plutonium, of course) so far. Reprocessing is producing about 18 tonnes a year 
right now (only the UK, France, Russia, Japan, and India engage in 
reprocessing).

Besides its use in nuclear weapons, plutonium has potential utility as a 
source of commercial power. Japan currently has the only major program for 
using plutonium for power. It appears that plutonium will not be economically 
competitive with uranium for decades to come for several reasons. The cost of 
reprocessing reactor fuel to extract plutonium is more expensive than the 
current commercial cost of low enriched uranium. Most current fuel fabrication 
plants are not equipped to handle the more hazardous plutonium oxide. The 
costs of safeguarding plutonium to prevent its theft or diversion for weapons 
use is quite substantial. Existing power reactors can only use fuel containing 
fairly small amounts of plutonium, which makes its use of little value, and 
the costs of designing and building new reactors for this purpose also 
adversely affects its cost. The current abundant supplies of uranium, excess 
enrichment capacity, and the large stockpiles of US and Russian weapons grade 
uranium now being mixed down for commercial use guarantee rock bottom uranium 
prices for the next 20-30 years.

Plutonium has few other uses. The most widespread is its use as a smoke 
detector radioisotope in Europe (US smoke detectors use americium due to its 
shorter half-life). Plutonium-beryllium alloy is used as a laboratory neutron 
source. The isotope Pu-238 is useful for radioisotope-powered thermoelectric 
generators to power long duration deep space probes due to its high heat 
output and long lifetime.

Although extremely scarce naturally, about 5000 kg of plutonium has been 
released into the atmosphere by nuclear weapons tests. The soil of the U.S. 
contains an average of about 2 millicuries (28 milligrams) per km^2 from 
fallout.

6.2.2.1  Plutonium Metallurgy
At room temperature pure plutonium exhibits a crystal structure that is termed 
the "alpha phase". In this form plutonium is at its maximum density, some 
19.84 at 20 deg. C. The atoms in the alpha phase are essentially covalently 
bonded (as opposed to metallically bonded), giving it physical properties more 
nearly like a mineral than a metal. It is hard, strong, brittle, and fractures 
in a highly directional manner. The alpha phase is unworkable using normal 
metal fabrication techniques.

In its lowest density phase (density of about 15.9), the delta phase, it is 
quite malleable. Plutonium is also quite malleable in the gamma phase. 

Delta phase plutonium has normal metallic properties, including excellent 
ductility. The delta phase has strength and malleability similar to aluminum, 
which makes forming and machining straightforward. Although the delta phase 
exhibits the anomalous property of shrinking when heated, this negative 
coefficient of expansion is not large. 

The delta phase is only marginally stable. It tends to collapse into the 
dense alpha phase under very low pressures (as these things go), causing a 
25% density increase. The delta phase does not exist in pure plutonium above 
a pressure of about 1 kilobar. For comparision, a density increase of 25% in 
uranium (or alpha phase plutonium) requires pressures of 450 kilobars. Above 
30 kilobars only the alpha and beta phases of plutonium exist.

Plutonium can be stabilized in the delta phase at room temperature by 
alloying it with certain trivalent atoms such as gallium, aluminum, cerium, 
indium, scandium, and americium at concentrations of a few molar% (% of 
atoms that are the alloying agent).

Even when stabilized, the delta phase still collapses easily, a pressure of 
a few kilobars is sufficient to make it revert to the alpha phase. Of 
special interest is the fact that in gallium stabilized plutonium, the delta 
phase is actually metastable when the gallium content is below 4.0 molar%. 
This means that the pressure induced phase change to the alpha form is 
irreversible.

For use in weapons plutonium is normally stabilized in the delta phase by 
alloying it with 3-3.5 molar% gallium (0.9-1.0% by weight). This alloy is 
stable from at least -75 to 475 degrees C. The stabilization prevents low 
temperature phase changes from occurring after fabrication that would ruin the 
precisely made components of a weapon. It has an almost zero coefficient of 
expansion. It also makes casting easier since only the epsilon -> delta phase 
change occurs during cooling. Finally, the gallium reduces the susceptibility 
to corrosion of plutonium.

The 3% gallium alloy was used in the Gadget and Fatman bombs. Aside from this 
alloying agent the plutonium was otherwise highly pure.

Alpha phase plutonium is known to have been used as weapon components however.

Aluminum is a good alloying agent, but it is not used in weapons due to the 
existence of neutron producing alpha->n reactions (see below). Cerium is not 
used since (among other reasons) it does not confer corrosion resistance.

Plutonium pits are plated with metal (usually nickel) to protect them from 
corrosion, as well as reducing the radiological hazard. The hemispheres for 
Gadget were electroplated with nickel (also reported as being silver), a 
process that was not very successful and led to blistering. The Fatman pit was 
plated with nickel, as was the pit for Joe 1/RDS-1. Evaporation coating with 
aluminum and electroplating with zinc do not work.

A potentially serious problem with using plutonium in weapons is the existence 
of a high spontaneous neutron emission rate. The presence of neutrons during 
the assembly of a supercritical mass leads to a premature nuclear reaction, an 
inefficient release of energy, even a near total weapon failure. There are two 
sources for this neutron background. The most important is the presence of the 
isotope Pu-240, which spontaneously fissions fast enough to release some 10^6 
n/sec/kg. This isotope inevitably forms during Pu-239 production. The second 
source is from the interaction of the strong alpha emissions with light 
element contaminants in the plutonium. Although this problem aroused great 
concern on the Manhattan Project when the use gun assembly was originally 
planned, the discovery of the Pu-240 problem rendered it moot. To minimize 
(but not eliminate) this problem the presence of light elements (especially 
beryllium, fluorine, and boron) must be kept to parts-per-million levels, a 
task of substantial difficulty. Aluminum also undergoes the alpha -> n 
reaction to some extent, making it unsuitable as an alloying agent in weapons.

The original techniques for preparing plutonium metal involved pyrochemical 
reduction of plutonium halides with alkali metals. Typically PuF4 was reduced 
with calcium and iodine, this was the standard method in the US at least into 
the 1970s. Higher purity can be achieved by electrorefining of the 
pyrochemically produced metal (a step not necessary for weapons use). This 
makes use of an electrolytic cell at 700 C, with a sodium, potassium, and 
plutonium chloride electrolyte, and a tungsten or tantalum cathode, and 
produces 99.99% pure plutonium. More recent techniques are based on direct 
pyrochemical reduction an delectrorefining of plutonium oxides.

Handling of molten plutonium, and plutonium casting, is performed today using 
equipment made of slightly oxidized tantalum. Casting molds can also be made 
of machined graphite, mild steel, or cast iron if they are lined with calcium 
fluoride or the oxides of zirconium or yttrium. It has also been discovered 
that pure plutonium can be successfully cast in chilled aluminum molds. The 
cooling is so fast that the intermediate phase transformations, which occur 
relatively slowly, are almost entirely bypassed.

6.2.2.2  Plutonium Toxicity
Although plutonium presumably exhibits chemical toxicity like other heavy 
metals, this effect is insignificant (in fact, unobservable) compared to its 
radiotoxicity. Plutonium's toxic properties are due to the fact that it is an 
active alpha emitter. Alpha particles are hazardous only if they are emitted 
inside the body (i.e. the plutonium has been ingested). Although plutonium 
emits gammas and neutrons that penetrate the body from outside, the emission 
rate is too small to be a significant hazard. Since the toxicity of plutonium 
is determined by its alpha activity, the isotopic composition is a significant 
influence. Weapon grade plutonium, free of americium, is assumed below 
(activity approx. 0.071 Ci/g).

Alpha particles affect only tissues that contain plutonium or are in direct 
contact with it. Two types of effects are significant: acute and chronic 
toxicity. If the exposure rate is high enough, tissues can suffer acute 
radiation poisioning with toxic effects appearing quickly. If the rate is low, 
then the cumulative carcinogenic effect occurs.

It is very poorly absorbed through the GI tract, even when ingested as a 
soluble salt since it tends to bind with the contents of the stomache and 
intestines. Given its tendency to precipitate from aqueous solution, and to 
form insoluble complexes with other materials, plutonium contamination of 
water tends to be a self-limiting phenomenon.

Swallowing 500 mg (7 curies) of plutonium as a finely divided or soluble 
material can cause death from the acute exposure of the GI tract in several 
days to a few weeks. Inhalation of 100 mg (1.4 Ci) of plutonium as particles 
of optimal size for lung retention can cause death from lung edema in 1 to 10 
days. An inhaled dose of 20 mg (0.28 Ci) will cause death by fibrosis in about 
1 month. In doses much below these values, the chronic carcinogenic effects 
become the important ones.

The exert chronic effects, the plutonium must be continuosly present in the 
body. Inhaled insoluble particles of the appropriate size range for lung 
retention (1-3 microns) will most likely be permanently deposited in the lungs 
(a high explosive detonation, like a non-nuclear weapons accident, can convert 
20-50% of the plutonium present to this form). The most likely chemical form 
to which a person might be exposed is plutonium oxide. The oxide is used in 
reactor fuel, and metallic plutonium particles are rapidly oxidized. The oxide 
is nearly insoluble in water.

The lifetime risk of lung cancer from deposited plutonium particles for an 
adult is roughly proportional to the amount ingested. The ingestion of 1 
microgram of Pu (0.07 microCi) represents a risk of 1% of developing cancer 
(the normal rate of cancer incidence is 20%). Thus ingesting 10 micrograms 
boosts the lifetime risk of cancer from 20% to 30%. Ingesting 100 micrograms 
(7.1 microCi) or more virtually guarantees eventual development of lung cancer 
(usually after several decades)although evidence of lung damage may surface 
within several months.

Plutonium normally exists in biological systems in the +4 oxidation state 
which chemically resembles Fe 3+. If it is absorbed into the circulatory 
system it thus a high probability of being concentrated in tissues that 
contain iron: bone marrow (which is highly sensitive to radiation), liver, and 
spleen. Plutonium has a biological half-life of 80-100 years when deposited in 
bone tissue, essentially permanent. Its biological half-life in the liver is 
40 years. Chelating agents may help accelerate plutonium removal. If 1.4 
micrograms (0.1 microCi) is deposited in an adult's bones, immune system 
impairment will result, and bone cancer is likely to develop within several 
years.

The International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) specifies an 
Annual Limit on Intake (ALI) of 20 nanoCi/yr (280 nanograms). This translates 
into an air concentration of 7 picroCi/M^3 for occupational exposure. The 
maximum allowable body burden of Pu-239 (occupational exposure) is 40 nanoCi 
(0.56 micrograms) and 16 nanoCi for lung burden (0.23 micrograms). Due to the 
problems of contamination, skin contact with plutonium is strictly forbidden 
in US laboratories.

6.2.2.3 Plutonium Production
Plutonium-239 is the preferred isotope for weapons use. As I have discussed 
above in the section on transmutation, it is produced in nuclear reactors 
where U-238 is exposed to a flux of slow neutrons. This occurs automatically 
in the vast majority of the world's reactors since they use low-enriched or 
natural uranium as fuel, which consists mostly of U-238. It can also be 
produced in special reactors that use highly enriched uranium or plutonium as 
fuel, but include a blanket of natural or depleted uranium for plutonium 
breeding.

Non-fission capture of neutrons by Pu-239 causes Pu-240 to form as irradiation 
proceeds. In turn, Pu-241 and Pu-242 also accumulate though in diminishing 
quantities.
     Pu-239 + n -> Pu-240
     Pu-240 + n -> Pu-241
     Pu-241 + n -> Pu-242

A side reaction chain also produces Pu-238:
     U-238 + n -> U-237 + 2n
     U-237 -> (6.75 days, beta) -> Np-237
     Np-237 + n -> Np-238
     Np-238 -> (2.1 days, beta) -> Pu-238

The total irradiation that a fuel element or blanket element receives is 
measured in megawatt-days/tonne. When fuel elements are being discussed, this 
is referred to as the fuel's "burn-up". Better quality plutonium (for weapons) 
comes from elements with low MWD/tonne exposures since there are lower 
concentrations of the other isotopes. The fuel elements in a modern enriched 
uranium light water reactor can reach 33000 MWD/tonne. Typical exposures in 
weapon breeder reactors are around 1000 MWD/tonne. Weapons grade plutonium in 
the Hanford graphite piles is produced with exposures of some 600 MWD/tonne, 
the Savannah River heavy water piles produce equivalent compositions with 1000 
MWD/tonne (presumably because part of the neutron flux is being absorbed by 
tritium production). During the Manhattan Project, the natural uranium fuel in 
the Hanford production reactors received only 100 MWD/tonne exposures, due to 
the urgency of wartime production, producing super-grade weapons plutonium 
(0.9-1.0% Pu-240, and negligible amounts of other isotopes).

6.2.2.4 Pu-238
This isotope has a spontaneous fission rate, 1.1x10^6 fission/sec-kg (2.6 
times that of Pu-240) and a very high heat output (567 W/kg!). Its very high 
alpha activity (283 times higher than Pu-239) makes it a much more serious 
source of neutron emission from the alpha -> n reaction. It rarely makes up 
more than a small fraction of one percent of plutonium composition, but the 
neutron production and heating can make it very troublesome even so. Its 
specific activity is 17.5 Ci/g.

6.2.2.5 Pu-239
Pu-239 is the only desired isotope for weapons use, other isotopes are 
important through their adverse effects. Pu-239 has higher fission and 
scattering cross sections than U-235, and a larger number of neutrons produced 
per fission, and consequently a smaller critical mass.

Pure Pu-239 has a moderate rate of neutron emission from spontaneous fission, 
about 10 fission/sec-kg (some 30 neutrons/sec-kg). Considering the small 
critical mass required, 6 kg or less, gun assembly could be used if pure Pu-
239 were available (although, due to its high alpha activity, light element 
impurities would have to be kept to a few ppm to avoid alpha -> n reactions).

The relatively short half-life of Pu-239 (compared with U-235) means that a 
significant amount of energy is emitted through radioactive decay. In fact Pu-
239 produces 1.92 watt/kg. This is higher than the average metabolic rate of 
an adult human by weight, and the output is concentrated in one-twentieth the 
volume. Pieces of Pu-239 are consequently quite warm. If a piece were 
thoroughly insulated, its temperature would rise from room temperature to the 
boiling point of water in less than two hours, and to the alpha-beta 
transition point soon after. This presents a problem in weapon design since 
elevated temperatures can be reached from self-heating, even if environmental 
heating is avoided. It is this concern about an alpha phase pit reaching the 
alpha->beta transition temperature that prevents this phase from being used in 
weapons. The specific activity of Pu-239 is 61.5 milliCi/g.

The plutonium used in the US weapons program was produced at Hanford, 
Washington and Savannah River, Georgia. Soviet/Russian plutonium production is 
located at Kyshtym, near Chelyabinsk.

6.2.2.6 Pu-240
Pu-240 is the major contaminant of concern in plutonium intended for weapons 
use. The level of isotopic contamination by Pu-240 is important primarily for 
its high spontaneous fission rate. It has a spontaneous fission rate of 
415,000 fission/sec-kg, but emits about 1,000,000 neutrons/sec-kg since each 
fission produces about 2.2 neutrons. This rate is over 30,000 times that of 
Pu-239. A contamination of only 1% produces so many neutrons that implosion 
systems are required to produce efficient bombs. Standard weapon grade 
plutonium requires a Pu-240 content of no more than 6.5%. Higher levels 
guarantee that pre-detonation (and reduced yields) will occur even with high 
performance implosion. 

Pu-240 is actually fairly fissile, somewhat more so than U-235. Nonetheless, 
high concentrations of Pu-240 raise the required critical mass thus 
aggravating the neutron background problem. Due to its relatively short half-
life (1/4 that of Pu-239) Pu-240 produces a correspondingly higher decay heat 
output (7.1 watts/kg) thus increasing cooling problems in bomb design. Its 
specific activity is 0.227 Ci/g.

6.2.2.7 Pu-241
This isotope is about as fissile as Pu-239, has a low neutron emission rate, 
and a moderate heat production rate, and thus does not adversely affect weapon 
usability of plutonium directly. It decays with a short 14.1 year half-life 
though, into americium-241 which is non-fissile and does produce a great deal 
of heat: 106 W/kg. If a weapon thus does include Pu-241 initially over several 
years or decades its reactivity will decline somewhat, which must be taken 
into account when the weapon is designed to avoid reduced yield, and its self-
heating will increase. The reason that Pu-241 does not emit much heat (3.4 
W/kg) despite its very short half-life is its weak beta emission decay mode. 
Its specific activity is 106 Ci/g.

6.2.2.8 Pu-242
This isotope has a high neutron emission rate, 8.4x10^5 fissions/sec-kg (twice 
that of Pu-240), and is non-fissile. A substantial concentration thus has the 
serious adverse effect of driving up the critical mass, while also adding a 
high neutron background. It has a long half-life, and has a relatively low 
neutron capture cross section, so it tends to accumulate in recycled reactor 
plutonium. Its specific activity is 4.0 milliCi/g.

6.2.2.9   Weapon Grade Plutonium
This term is used by the US for plutonium with a Pu-240 content of less than 
7%. Typical assays of weapon grade plutonium are given below. The first two 
are average assays of weapons grade plutonium produced at Hanford, and 
Savannah River in June 1968. The third is based on soil samples taken outside 
the Rocky Flats Plant in the 1970s, and is adjusted for the americium-241 also 
present (the decay product of Pu-241).

TYPICAL WEAPONS GRADE PLUTONIUM COMPOSITIONS
         Hanford    Savannah   Rocky Flats Soil
       (avg. 6/68) (avg. 6/68)    avg. 1970s
Pu-238   <0.05%      <0.05%         trace
Pu-239   93.17%      92.99%         93.6%
Pu-240    6.28%       6.13%          5.8%
Pu-241    0.54%       0.86%          0.6%
Pu-242   <0.05%      <0.05%         trace

The US has also produced supergrade plutonium with Pu-240 content of 3%, for 
use as an enricher for lower grade plutonium, and perhaps as an ingredient in 
special weapon designs. Some US designs have required plutonium with a Pu-240 
content as low as 1.5%.

An important question is what the designation as "weapons grade" actually 
means. The prevalent interpretation has been that this indicates that 
plutonium with a Pu-240 content less that 7% is actually required for 
successful weapon construction, or at least, there is a serious compromise of 
weapon performance above this level.

The Pu-240 content definitely does have weapon design consequences, since it 
determines the neutron background level and has secondary effects in 
increasing critical mass (slightly) and thermal output. The neutron background 
constrains the design by limiting the amount of plutonium included, and 
requiring implosion speeds above some specified threshold. As noted above, 
some US weapons designs (presumably older ones) required low Pu-240 contents 
for these reasons. 

However, it is now clear that these issues are unimportant in advanced weapons 
designs used by the US since at least the early 1960s. Recently declassified 
government documents (WASH-1037 Revised, _An Introduction to Nuclear Weapons_, 
June 1972) make it clear that the designation "weapons grade" is purely an 
economic one. The cost of plutonium goes down the higher the Pu-240 content. 
On the other hand, the critical mass goes up with higher Pu-240 contents. 
Around the 6-7% Pu-240 level, the total cost of the plutonium in the weapon is 
at a minimum. 

This does not mean that plutonium with higher levels of Pu-240 can be used in 
EXISTING weapon designs. These have been optimized for the use of a specific 
material and would probably suffer in performance if a different plutonium 
composition were used.

Assuming an average composition of 93.4% Pu-239, 6.0% Pu-240, and 0.6% Pu-241 
(with negligible amounts of other isotopes), the following properties of WG 
plutonium can be calculated. The initial heat output of freshly prepared WG-Pu 
would be 2.2 W/Kg, and the spontaneous fission rate would be 27,100 
fissions/sec. This fission rate permits a weapon using 4-5 kg of plutonium to 
be assembled with a very small probability of predetonation by a good 
implosion system. Over the course of a couple of decades, most of the Pu-241 
will decay into Am-241, eventually raising the heat output to 2.8 W/kg. Since 
Pu-241 is highly fissile, but Am-241 is not, this reduces the reactivity 
margin in the weapon slightly and must be taken into account in weapon design.

The neutron emission for a 5 kg of WG-Pu, 3x10^5/sec, represents an exposure 
of some 0.003 rad/hr at 1 m. This is reduced by the reflector and explosive 
surrounding it, a light-weight weapon might attenuate it by a factor of 5-10. 
The high RBE for neutrons on the other hand, enhances the risk. Constant close 
contact with a weapon during a normal work schedule would result in radiation 
exposures close to the annual occupational limit. Weapon plant employees who 
handle plutonium cores directly or in glove boxes have limited shielding and 
may need to be rotated to other tasks to keep exposures down.

Due to the small mass difference between Pu-239 and Pu-240, it has not been 
considered practical to strip Pu-240 by the common enrichment schemes used 
with uranium. This has been done for small quantities of plutonium using 
electromagnetic separation for research purposes. There is no major reason for 
a sophisticated nation to reduce the Pu-240 content below 6% since it still 
allows the construction of efficient, reliable fusion bomb triggers. Very low 
Pu-240 content would allow some additional flexibility in weapon design, which 
may be desirable for specialized or exotic designs.

6.2.2.10  Reactor Grade Plutonium
For reasons of economics, power production reactor fuel has very high fuel 
burn-ups. The plutonium from discharged power reactor fuel has a high level of 
contaminating isotopes. Compositions vary with reactor design, and the exact 
operating history, but typical ones are:

Isotope  Light Water Reactors  CANDU Reactor  MAGNOX Reactor
           Typical 33000 MWD     7500 MWD      3000 MWD
Pu-238       2%       1.5%          low           0.1%
Pu-239      61%      56.2%         66.6%         80.0%
Pu-240      24%      23.6%         26.6%         16.9%
Pu-241      10%      14.3%          5.3%          2.7%
Pu-242       3%       4.9%          1.5%          0.3%

The 33000 MWD burnup figure is based on the 3% enrichment commonly used in the 
1970s and 80s. With the current cheapness of enriched uranium (based on a 
world wide post-arms race glut of enrichment capacity), higher enrichment fuel 
is now being used (4-4.5%), allowing burnups of 45000 MWD or even higher. This 
results in higher concentrations of Pu-238, 240, 241, and 242.

Using the light water average as the basis, we can calculate a heat output of 
14.5 W/kg rising to 19.6 W/kg in 14 years as the Pu-241 decays, reaching an 
eventual maximum near 24 watts. The neutron emission rate is 350,000 
neutrons/kg. The specific activity is 11.0 Ci/g (0.442 Ci/g alpha activity).

Taking into account the effect of isotopic dilution on critical mass (both Pu-
239 and Pu-241 are fissile, the others are less so) a bomb fashioned from 8 kg 
of this material would put out 116 watts (a light bulb of similar size and 
power is too hot to hold), and 2.8 million neutrons/sec. Using this material 
in a bomb would be a challenge. Continual active cooling would be needed to 
prevent deterioration and damage to the core, explosives, and other 
components. The high rate of neutron emission means that predetonation is 
inevitable, even with a very efficient implosion system. However, even the 
relatively primitive Fatman design would have produced a 0.5 Kt or so yield 
with this material. With optimal implosion design yields in the range of at 
least several kilotons are possible. If fusion boosting is used, then the 
adverse effects properties of reactor grade plutonium can be completely 
overcome, allowing its use in efficient high-yield designs although the 
material would be less convenient to use.

While reactor grade plutonium would probably be of no interest to a nation 
with access to better grade material, it could be effectively used by a nation 
capable of good weapon design, but without access to better fissile material. 
Even a low technology nation could fashion powerful wepaons from it, after all 
even a 1 kt device greatly exceeds the destruction of any conventional weapon.

Over long periods of time, several decades or centuries, the heat output of 
reactor grade fuel diminishes greatly from the decay of Pu-238 and Am-241. 
This has little effect on the neutron background however. Currently, used 
reactor fuel is commonly stored indefinitely in containment pools near the 
reactor site. It will remain a proliferation risk until otherwise disposed of, 
in fact as the fission product radiation levels and plutonium heat output 
declines, the proliferation risk increases.

Storage for 40 years allows 30% of the Pu-238 and 88% of the Pu-241 to decay. 
The plutonium composition would then be: 1.5% Pu-238, 67.3% Pu-239, 26.4% Pu-
240, 1.3% Pu-241, and 3.3% Pu-242. This would decrease the heat output to 11.7 
W/kg and largely stabilize it from post-fabrication increase (maxing out at 
13.8 W/kg). Storage for 150 years would result in a composition of 0.66% Pu-
238, 69.06% Pu-239, 26.86% Pu-240, 0.01% Pu-241, and 3.41% Pu-242; for a 
stable heat output of 7.5 W/Kg.

Using uranium enrichment technology to strip out undesirable isotopes is a 
real possibility. It is complicated by the presence of multiple isotopes, each 
separated by one atomic mass unit, compared to the 3 amu difference in 
uranium. In general this reduces the separation parameter (s - 1) by a factor 
of 3, and the separation capacity of a stage or plant by a factor of 9. Also a 
double enrichment process might be necessary. After separating Pu-240 and 
higher isotopes, a second enrichment might be needed to strip out Pu-238 
(depending on the content of the starting material, and how objectionable the 
heating effect is). The toxicity, neutron emission, and self-heating of the 
feed, waste, and product would also complicate enrichment operations, compared 
to uranium.

On the other hand the amount of feed that must be processed to produce a bomb 
is more than two orders of magnitude smaller than natural uranium. This is due 
both to the high Pu-239 content (60-70% compared to 0.72%), and the smaller 
critical mass required (6 kg vs 15 kg). Even with the complications mentioned 
above, an enrichment plant for upgrading reactor plutonium would be much 
smaller than a natural uranium plant regardless of the technology used. This 
material must thus be considered a serious proliferation risk on the national 
level.

It should be fairly straightforward to produce weapon grade plutonium from 
reactor grade by electromagnetic separation. Due to the extremely high 
enrichment factor of this process only one stage of enrichment is needed, and 
plant output is proportional to the concentration of desired isotope in the 
feedstock. An electromagnetic separation facility of capable of producing 0.5 
bombs a year (similar to the facility that Iraq was planning) could produce 
over 100 bombs a year if reactor grade plutonium were available. 

Gas diffusion and centrifuges are also viable candidates. The properties of 
plutonium hexafluoride are similar to uranium hexafluoride, and requires only 
small changes in diffuser or centrifuge design. If 60% Pu-239/25% Pu-240 
material were used as feed, with a product of 94% Pu-239 and tails of 50% Pu-
239 (product contains half of the feed Pu-239), then only 2 kg-SWU would be 
required to produce 1 kg of weapon grade plutonium. This is 1% of the effort 
required to produce 1 kg of 90% U-235 from natural uranium. Taking into 
account to the smaller number of SWUs, and the offsetting smaller critical 
mass of plutonium, a plutonium enrichment plant could produce 29 times as many 
bombs as an equivalent U-235 plant. A centrifuge plant might need only few 
dozen stages for a cascade.

The AVLIS technology offers the possibility of inexpensive separation and 
could have used commercial reactor grade fuel as a feed. This was perhaps the 
real motivation for pursuing AVLIS research during the eighties. 

6.2.2.11  Denatured Plutonium
If plutonium is extracted from reactor fuel and reused in power reactors, its 
composition becomes progressively less desirable for weapons use. After 
several fueling cycles the buildup of Pu-238, Pu-240, and Pu-242 makes it 
difficult to use in weapons. It has been suggested that blending such recycled 
fuel is a useful means to "denature", or render proliferation-resistant, 
supplies of retired weapons-grade plutonium.

This is mainly a deterrent against the use in low technology designs. The 
elevated thermal output and radiation levels merely have nuisance value, and 
are not serious deterrents although they create significant design constraints 
and handling problems. Advanced designs and adequate handling facilities can 
completely overcome these obstacles. Even at low technology levels destructive 
devices could be constructed with this material.

6.2.3     Thorium (Th)
Named after Thor, the Scandinavian god of war, element 90 was discovered in 
1828 by Berzelius.

Thorium is a silvery-white metal that resists oxidation when pure, but 
typically tarnishes slowly to black over time. It is pyrophoric when finely 
powdered. When ignited, thorium scraps burn with a brilliant white light. It 
is slowly attacked by water. Pure thorium is soft, very ductile, and can be 
readily worked.

Its principal physical properties are:
Density 11.72
Undergoes cubic->body centered cubic crystal change at 1400 deg. C
Melting point 1750 deg. C
Boiling Point 4790 deg. C

Thorium oxide has an extremely high melting point, 3300 deg. C, the highest of 
all oxides and higher than the melting points of all but a few substances. 
This creates its major commercial use today, as a refractory ceramic. It is 
used for example in the Welsbach mantle used in propane lanterns which produce 
a dazzling light when heated to very high temperatures. The oxide is also used 
as an additive to special optical glasses. Thorium is also important as an 
alloying agent for magnesium. It is also useful in certain kinds of vacuum 
tubes as an electron emitter.

Twelve isotopes of thorium are known, but the natural element consists 
entirely of a single isotope - Th-232. This isotope has a half-life of 
1.41x10^10 years and is an alpha emitter. Its specific activity is 0.109 
microCi/g, about one-sixth of natural uranium.

Thorium is of interest for nuclear purposes due to its ability to breed 
fissionable U-233 through the chain:
Th-232 + n -> Th-233
Th-233 -> (22.2 min, beta) -> Pa-233
Pa-233 -> (27.0 day, beta) -> U-233

Thorium is rather abundant. It is three times more abundant than uranium, 
about equal to lead. It is estimated that the potential energy represented by 
accessible thorium deposits exceeds that of uranium and fossil fuels combined 
by a wide margin. The major deposits of thorium are usually in the form of 
monazite sands. Large deposits of thorium are found in several parts of the 
world including the US (New England and North Carolina) and India, which has 
the largest reserves. It is found in the lithosphere at an average 
concentration of 12 g/tonne. 

It also undergoes fast fission, but it has a lower cross section for this than 
does U-238.

A major problem with using thorium breeding to obtain fissile material is that 
it is not naturally present in economical reactor fuels, unlike U-238. To use 
thorium breeding, a highly enriched fissile material (U-235, U-233, Pu-239) 
must be used as a fuel with thorium included in the reactor solely for its 
breeding potential (i.e. it contributes little or nothing to power production 
itself). On the other hand thermal breeder reactors are possible using a U-
233/thorium breeding cycle, especially for it heavy water is used as a 
moderator. This potential fuel cycle has a number of attractive features.

No use of thorium for fissionable material production has been made public, 
outside of research programs. India is interested in developing an indigenous 
thorium breeding fuel cycle due to its vast thorium deposits. It is believed 
that India has included U-233 breeding as part of its weapons related 
activities.

6.2.4   Other Fissile Elements
U-233, U-235 and the various isotopes of plutonium are not the only known 
elements and isotopes with the necessary nuclear properties to be usable in 
fission bombs. Several other candidates are described here, of varying degrees 
of practicality. None of them have properties that are sufficiently attractive 
to merit serious consideration in favor of the other "big three".

The list below is not exhaustive. In particular it is likely that other 
fissile isotopes of transuranic elements exist (curium, berkeleyium, 
californium , etc.).

6.2.4.1 Protactinium-231
Protactinium-231 is found in nature in small amounts. It is a decay product of 
U-235 and exists in decay equilibrium with it in uranium ores. The creation 
and destruction is governed by the reaction chain:
U-235 -> (7.1 x 10^8 yr, alpha) -> Th-231
Th-231 -> (25.52 hr, beta) -> Pa-231
Pa-231 -> (32,500 yr, alpha) -> Ac-227

From the half-life ratio of U-235 and Pa-231 we can calculate that they exist 
in the ratio of (3.25 x 10^4)/(7.1 x 10^8) = 4.6 x 10^-5. Since 0.72% of 
natural uranium is U-235, the ratio for Pa-231 to all uranium atoms is 3.3 x 
10-7 (3.2 x 10-7 by mass).

Based on theoretical considerations Pa-231 is a potential weapon-usable 
material, the only such material with an atomic number lower than that of 
uranium. It is also the only fissile material that could in principle be 
obtained from natural sources through chemical separation techniques alone. 
Pa-231 could be concentrated from uranium ores as part of the normal process 
of ore refining. If Canada, the world's largest uranium producer, had done 
this with its 1994 uranium production (9700 tonnes) it would have obtained 3.1 
kg of Pa-231. 

Although Pa-231 has been produced in gram quantities, its fissile properties 
are not well studied (at least in public sources), and its critical mass is 
uncertain. It was considered as a candidate fissile material during the early 
stages of atomic research in the 1940s.

It can also be produced from natural thorium in a reactor by the following 
reactions:
Th-232 + n -> Th-231 + 2n
Th-231 -> (25.52 hr, beta) -> Pa-231

6.2.4.2 Neptunium-237
This isotope of neptunium is most easily produced by the following reactions:
U-235 + n -> U-236
U-236 + n -> U-237
U-237 -> (6.8 days, beta) -> Np-237
It is also produced by the decay of Am-241, but the 433 year half-life of this 
latter isotope makes the production rate very small.

With a density of 20.02, neptunium is the fifth densest element. Neptunium-237 
has a half-life of 2.14 x 10^6 years. It has an estimate bare critical mass of 
90 kg, and a very low spontaneous fission rate (<5x10^-2 F/sec-kg). The high 
critical mass value (almost double that of HEU) and the high cost of 
manufacture makes it unattractive for weapons use.

6.2.4.3 Americium-241
This isotope is produced by the decay of Pu-241:
Pu-241 -> (13.2 yr, beta) -> Am-241

It has a half-life of 433 years, and a bare critical mass of 114 kg. It has a 
moderate spontaneous fission rate (2.4x10^2 F/sec-kg). Am-241 plays a 
significant role in weapons issues due to its normal occurrence in plutonium. 
Freshly made "weapons-grade" plutonium normally contains 0.5 - 1.0% Pu-241, 
reactor grade plutonium typically contains 5-15% Pu-241 to as much as 25%. In 
the course of a few decades, most of this Pu-241 will decay into Am-241. 

Am-241's energetic alpha decay and relatively short half-life give it a high 
specific activity and heat output. Much of the alpha activity and heat 
produced in older weapon grade plutonium is due to Am-241. 

This high critical mass (double that of HEU) and relatively high cost make it 
unattractive for use as a weapon fissile material. It is made even more 
unattractive by the fact that a bare critical mass of Am-241 produces 12 kw of 
heat! It would be challenging to say the least to make a storable weapon that 
can tolerate this kind of heat output.

Am-241 is used in very small amounts in smoke detectors (0.26 micrograms per 
detector).

6.3      Fusionable Materials</h3><pre>
Fusion fuels are all light elements, which are enormously more abundant than 
the heavy elements relevant to fission. Isotopic separation is fairly easy in 
light elements since low masses mean relatively large mass ratios (Li-7 is 
only one atomic mass unit heavier than Li-6, but it is 17% heavier; U-238 is 3 
amu heavier than U-235, but it is only 1.3% heavier).

6.3.1	   Hydrogen Isotopes
Hydrogen was identified as a distinct substance by Cavendish in 1766, and was 
named by Lavoisier. Natural hydrogen consists of two isotopes: H-1 (light 
hydrogen or protium), and deuterium (D, H-2, heavy hydrogen) which occurs in 
nature in a concentration of 0.015%. Light hydrogen participates in fusion 
reactions extremely slowly (that's why the sun is still around). Deuterium 
fuses much more readily. In the smallest stars, known as brown dwarfs, only 
deuterium fusion can occur and once this is exhausted the star becomes inert 
and planet-like. All of the deuterium in the universe today was created in the 
first three minutes of the Big Bang, it has been slowly depleted by stellar 
burning. The unstable super heavy isotope tritium rapidly decays and thus 
exists in nature only in minute quantities.

In elemental form all hydrogen isotopes are gases with very low densities and 
boiling points. This often makes them inconvenient to incorporate into 
practical weapons, so lithium deuteride/tritide compounds are frequently used.

6.3.1.1 Deuterium (D)
This natural isotope was discovered by Harold Urey in 1931, he was awarded the 
Nobel for this achievement in 1934.

Deuterium is twice as heavy as hydrogen-1, a fact that is very noticeable in 
the elemental state. D2O is commonly called "heavy water".

Comparison Between Natural Hydrogen and Deuterium
                 H              D             H2O          D2O
density (liq.) 0.07 (20.4 K)  0.169 (20.4 K)  1.0 (4.0 C)  1.106 (11.2 C)
melting point                                 0 C          3.79 C
boiling point  20.39 K        23.57 K         100 C        101.41 C

Deuterium is primarily manufactured for use as a nuclear reactor moderator. It 
is the best moderating material known. For reactor use it is enriched to 
99.75% purity or higher. The US has not manufactured heavy water since 1982. 
Its cumulative production is estimated at 7300 tonnes. The US produced heavy 
water at Dana Indiana (discontinued in 1957) and at the Savannah River 
Facility in South Carolina (discontinued 1982). Reactor grade heavy water 
costs about $500/kg.

Heavy water is toxic only when enough has been consumed to replace a 
substantial percentage of light water from the body (several liters).

Enrichment Methods
The normal procedure is for a heavy water plant to use a combination of 
separation techniques in series to achieve maximum economy. Dual temperature 
chemical separation is the method of choice for early stages of enrichment 
when the concentration is very low. This is because huge volumes of water are 
handled, and techniques that have very low energy consumption per unit of 
feedstock are essential. More energy intensive, but faster, methods may be 
used to achieve high purity.

Chemical Separation of Deuterium
The most economical method uses the fact that D concentrates to varying 
(small) degrees in hydrogen sulfide (H2S) gas at different temperatures. By 
sending liquid water and H2S mixtures through alternating hot and cold towers, 
D progressively builds up, alternating between the gas and liquid phases. This 
method, called the Girdler-Sulfide (GS) process, is usually employed until a 
concentration of 15% or so (13.5% at Savannah River) is reached. Since the 
1950s the dual temperature H2S process has been the only process used on a 
large scale anywhere in the world, except for the final concentration stages. 

The first process used for deuterium production in association with the US 
weapons program was fractional distillation of water. The world's first heavy 
water reactor was loaded with D20 produced by this process. Water distillation 
was used as the second and final enrichment stage of the Savannah River Plant 
before shutdown, bringing the concentration to 99.8%. It is widely used around 
the world as a final stage.

During the 1950s the US used and liquid hydrogen distillation to produce 
deuterium for the hydrogen bomb program since it could be scaled up for 
production rapidly and has a high separation factor.

Electrolysis has been popular for the final stages of enrichment since it has 
a very high separation factor (D remains behind as water is electrolyzed), and 
when the volumes of liquid are small, the high energy cost is unimportant. 
Deuterium can be concentrated rapidly to 99.8% purity. The US once used it as 
the final stage at Savannah River, taking 90% enriched feed from the water 
distillation cascade.

Two deuterium enrichment techniques, electrolysis and liquid hydrogen 
distillation, can produce substantial quantities of deuterium as a byproduct 
of industrial chemical processes or other endeavors. 

6.3.1.2 Tritium (T)
Discovered in 1934 by bombarding deuterium with accelerated deuterons (thus 
causing a fusion reaction), tritium (T, H-3) is radioactive with a half-life 
of 12.355 (+/- 0.010) yr. It exists in minute amounts naturally but 
significant quantities must be made artificially.

It is usually produced by the Li-6 + n -> T + He-4 reaction in nuclear 
reactors designed for isotope production. The lithium is enriched in Li-6 
prior to irradiation, and is usually loaded in the form of aluminum canned 
lithium fluoride slugs or aluminum-lithium alloy rods. The latter type of 
target has been used at Savannah River. Tritium was been purified by heating 
the rods in a vacuum to release hydrogen and helium gases, followed by 
purification by palladium diffusion (to produce pure hydrogen) and cryogenic 
distillation (to produce pure tritium from the hydrogen isotopic mixture). 
These same refinement processes has been used in reclaiming tritium from 
recycled weapons reservoirs. Currently this is done using a new hydride 
process.

Substantial quantities are also generated in nuclear reactors moderated by 
heavy water through deuterium capture: D + n -> T. The Canadian CANDU 
(Canadian Deuterium) commercial power reactors collectively produce 250-500g 
of tritium annually.

Since it currently has no operating tritium production plant, the US is 
exploring the possibility of producing tritium using a high energy 
(approximately 1 GeV) proton accelerator to be built at Savannah River (a 
scheme known as APT - Accelerator Production of Tritium). The APT approach 
uses the proton beam to generate neutrons through spallation from heavy nuclei 
- probably lead or tungsten. Each proton-nucleus collision produces about 30 
neutrons, and leaves a single radioactive nucleus behind. At present the 
favored design for tritium production surrounds the heavy element target with 
a moderating blanket of heavy water, through which is tubes circulate helium-3 
gas. He-3 (itself produced by tritium decay) has a very high cross section for 
thermal neutrons (5000 barns) and forms tritium upon neutron capture. This 
system effectively recycles the existing tritium inventory. As an alternate 
approach a matrix of lead and lithium-6/alluminum alloy rods can be used for 
the target. Planned capacity is 3 kg/tritium a year, upgradable to 5 kg/yr.

T emits very weak radiation, 18.6 KeV betas with no gamma emissions. These are 
easy halted by thin layers of material (plastic, skin, etc.), which is why 
tritium is now used for glow-in-the-dark watches instead of radium. Tritium 
can only be a health hazard if taken internally. Inhaled tritium gas is not 
hazardous since the body does not absorb hydrogen gas. Tritiated water (HTO) 
in liquid or vapor form is quite hazardous however. Tritium's specific 
activity is 9649 Ci/g. The heat output from tritium decay is 0.324 W/g.

The estimated LD50 (quantity that will kill half of the people absorbing it) 
is 10 Ci, given the high specific activity this makes the lethal dose about 1 
mg. This is comparable to the toxicity of the nerve gas sarin. When in the 
form of elemental hydrogen, only about 0.004% of inhaled tritium is absorbed. 
In the form of tritiated water (HTO) nearly all inhaled tritium is absorbed. 
There is also significant absorption of HTO vapor through the skin.

6.3.2   Lithium (Li)
Lithium, element 3, is named after the Greek word for stone - lithos. Lithium 
is one of only three elements to have existed since the beginning of the 
Universe, having been synthesized during the Big Bang (the other two are 
hydrogen and helium). It is the lightest metal, both by density and by atomic 
weight. It was discovered in 1817 by Arfvedson, and is distributed widely 
throughout nature, being slightly less abundant than copper, but more abundant 
than lead. It is abundant and is mined commercially in many places including 
North America, and has wide commercial application. Natural lithium consists 
of two isotopes Li-6 (7.42%) and Li-7 (92.58%).

Principal physical characteristics:
Density 0.534
Melting Point 180.54 degrees C
Boiling Point 1347 degrees C

Lithium is chemically very reactive, igniting readily in air and burning with 
a brilliant white flame. It has many uses in the chemical industry. The metal 
is useful as an alloying agent with magnesium and aluminum to produce very 
light alloys. It has recently found extensive use in high energy batteries.

Lithium can be used in weapons simply as a convenient means of storing 
deuterium (lithium hydride contains more hydrogen per unit volume than liquid 
hydrogen does), or it can serve as an essential fusion fuel in its own right. 
For weapons use it is often desirable to enrich lithium in Li-6. This has been 
done using electromagnetic separation in the US and Russia, but large scale 
production uses chemical enrichment methods.

The Y-12 Plant at Oak Ridge has been the major enrichment site in the US, 
using an electrochemical exchange process. This process relies on  
electromotive exchange, a differential affinity of mercury for Li-6. A 
lithium-mercury amalgam is agitated with an aqueous lithium hydroxide 
solution. Li-6 concentrates in the lithium-mercury amalgam phase, Li-7 in the 
hydroxide solution. Counterflow through a cascade of stages produces highly 
enriched Li-6 in the amalgam. Chemical reaction between the lithium amalgam 
and the water is prevented by placing anodes in the hydroxide solution, and 
using the amalgam as a cathode. The depleted lithium is removed from the 
aqueous solution through electrolysis. The enriched lithium is recovered from 
the amalgam by decomposing it with water in the presence of a graphite 
catalyst, producing an aqueous lithium hydroxide solution and regenerated 
mercury ready for amalgamation with fresh lithium feed material. 

Originally the exchange was done using large shallow pans in the Elex 
(Electro-Exchange) Plant at Y-12, which operated from 1953-1956. The Elex 
plant began construction in autumn 1952 for use in weapons tests conducted in 
1954. The plant reached initial operating capacity on 14 August 1953, with 
production expanding rapidly a few months later. The Elex process required 
repeated mixing of the amalgam and aqueous solution in the pans, followed by 
settling, and was thus not truly continuous.

The vast majority of enriched lithium was prepared at the Y-12 Colex (Column 
Exchange) plant which operated from 1955 through 1961. This plant substituted 
packed columns for the pans, and operated by continuous counter-current flow. 
Enrichment operations ceased entirely in 1963 when a large stockpile had 
accumulated.

Three enrichment levels were produced: 95.5% Li-6, 60% Li-6, and 40% Li-6. The 
depleted lithium contained 1-4% Li-6. Lithium enriched to 95% Li-6 was used in 
the Castle Union test on 25 April 1954 that produced a 6.9 Mt yield (1.9 Mt 
from fusion). 40% Li-6 was used in the 15 Mt Castle Bravo test on 28 February 
1954 (5 Mt fusion). But natural lithium was used in Castle Romeo (26 March 
1954), giving a 11 Mt yield (4 Mt fusion).

The US produced 442.2 tonnes of enriched lithium (of various grades) between 
1954 and 1963, with 30,917 tonnes of depleted lithium hydroxide monohydrate as 
tails (this is a lithium content of 5152 tonnes). Much of this depleted 
lithium has been offered for sale as surplus since 1968. 10,467 tonnes of 
natural LiOH.H2O remain in inventory.

Lithium hydrides are white crystalline solids (m.p. 620 deg C), of generally 
salt-like physical character. The term "lithium hydride" may refer 
specifically to a compound of light hydrogen or may be used generically to 
refer any lithium-hydrogen compound regardless of hydrogen isotope. They are 
usually prepared by direct reaction between hydrogen and metallic lithium at 
elevated temperature. Lithium hydrides have low density (0.82 for LiH, 0.92 
for LiD). Lithium hydrides have no known solvent. LiH reacts violently with 
water, producing hydrogen gas (a fact that makes it useful for special purpose 
hydrogen gas generators). Pure lithium hydride quickly turns grey on exposure 
to light or air due to the formation of hydroxides and carbonates.

It can be formed into ceramic-like pieces for use in weapons, but extreme care 
is required to keep it dry to avoid deterioration. It is fabricated and 
handled in special "dry rooms" at Y-12, with workers wearing sealed suits to 
prevent body moisture from escaping. Fabrication of LiH weapon components has 
been performed by hot isostatic pressing. The LiH powder is first packed into 
a sealed plastic jacket. The jacketed LiH is then placed in an oil filled 
pressurized autoclave where pressures of 10,000 psi or greater and high 
temperatures compact it into a solid mass. This mass is later machined to its 
final shape. Thin film hydriding techniques to form thin lithium hydride 
layers may be used in some modern weapons.

In addition to its use as a thermonuclear fuel, lithium-6 has been used to 
harden nuclear weapons against outside neutron fluxes (from other nuclear 
weapons for example). Lithium-6 hydride has been used for this, the light 
hydrogen isotope presumably for its very strong moderating effect, and Li-6 
for its low mass and high neutron absorption cross-section in the 0.1-1.0 MeV 
range.

6.4   Other Materials</h3><pre>
Some other materials of special interest for nuclear weapons use are listed 
below. 

6.4.1    Beryllium (Be)
Beryllium, element 4, is named after the mineral beryl, which is a natural ore 
(beryllium aluminum silicate). It was discovered by Vauquelin in 1798, and was 
isolated as the metal by Wohler and Bussy in 1828. Commercial production began 
in the 1950s as a result of the nuclear weapons program in the US

Beryllium is a steel gray metal. It is one of the lightest metals, being 
lighter than aluminum and only slightly heavier than magnesium. Nonetheless  
is still surprisingly dense considering its very low atomic weight. This is 
due to its having one of the densest packing of atoms per unit volume of any 
element (only the diamond form of carbon is higher). It has many outstanding 
structural properties. Its modulus of elasticity exceeds that of steel (i.e. 
it is very stiff). It has the highest melting point of the light metals, and 
it has excellent thermal conductivity. It is also nonmagnetic. These factors 
combine to make it a superb material for heat shielding in ICBM reentry 
vehicles, and for inertial guidance system gyroscopes. It has good resistance 
to chemical attack (it does not oxidize at ordinary temperatures, and it 
resists nitric acid). It is very valuable as an alloying agent with copper.

Beryllium has only one natural isotope with an atomic weight of 9.

Beryllium's principal properties are:
Density 1.848 (20 deg. C)
Melting point 1278 deg. C (+/- 5 deg.)
Boiling point 2970 deg. C (at 5mm pressure)

Beryllium has the unusual property of that many of its salts have a sweet 
taste. It is also the most chemically toxic element. The OSHA permissible 
working exposure is limited to 2 micrograms/m^3 of air for an 8 hour shift, 
and about 100 micrograms/month. NIOSH recommendeds that airborne exposure 
never exceed 0.5 micrograms/m3. Its oxide has a very high melting point, 
making it useful in high temperature ceramics. 

Beryl remains the most important beryllium ore. Emerald, one of the rarest and 
most valuable gemstones, is a form of beryl. The major US source has been low-
grade bertrandite deposits in Utah. US beryllium production is exclusively 
handled by Brush-Wellman Inc's Delta Utah plant. It processes bertrandite and 
imported beryl. Beryllium metal is usually prepared by reducing the fluoride 
with magnesium.

It has many application in nuclear technology. It has high transparency to x-
rays. It also has a remarkable range of desirable qualities for neutron-
related applications. It generates neutrons when bombarded with gamma rays or 
alpha particles (about 30 neutrons/million alphas), through the He-4 + Be-9 -> 
C-12 + n reaction, which made it the first known source of free neutrons for 
laboratory study (the neutron energy is also a remarkably high 5.7 MeV). It 
has a very low absorption cross section for thermal neutrons. Due its low 
atomic weight it is an excellent neutron moderator, and has the largest 
macroscopic neutron scattering cross section of any material (due in part to 
its packing density). It also undergoes Be-9 + n -> Be-8 + 2n reactions, thus 
acting as a neutron multiplier; although this endothermic reaction (- 2.4 MeV) 
only becomes significant around 3 MeV. 

These characteristics have made it a reflector/moderator of choice for 
extremely small, light nuclear reactors; and a neutron reflector of choice for 
low yield, very light nuclear weapons.

The production of high quality beryllium forgings suitable for use as a weapon 
reflector requires the use of hot vacuum isostatic pressing. 

6.4.2 Polonium (Po)
Element 84 was discovered by Mme. Curie, in 1898, and is named after her 
native country Poland. It was extracted from the uranium ore pitchblende, 
where it is found in the concentration 0.1 ppm. It is naturally formed from 
the decay of radium. Radium samples more than 30 yr old contain 0.013%:

Ra-226 -> (1600 y, alpha) -> Rn-222
Rn-222 -> (3.823 day, alpha) -> Po-218
Po-218 -> (3.05 min, alpha) -> Pb-214
Pb-214 -> (26.8 min, beta) -> Bi-214 
Bi-214 -> (19.7 min, alpha) -> Tl-210
Tl-210 -> (1.3 min, beta) -> Pb-210 ("Radium D")
Pb-210 -> (21 yr, beta) -> Bi-210 ("Radium-E")
Bi-210 -> (5.01 day, beta) -> Po-210 ("Radium F")

Lead extracted from uranium ores contains Pb-210, from which Po-210 can be 
periodically harvested. In 1934 it was discovered that it could be 
manufactured by bombarding natural bismuth (Bi-209) with neutrons to form Bi-
210. 

Its physical properties are:
Density 9.32
Melting point 254 degrees C
Boiling point 962 degrees C

Chemically polonium resembles bismuth and tellurium.

Despite its fairly high boiling point, polonium is rather volatile - 50%  of a 
sample will vaporize in 45 hrs at 55 deg. C. Part of its volatility can be 
attributed to its radioactivity. When an atom decays, the recoil from the 
energetic alpha emission dislodges many atoms. Since 0.50% of it decays each 
day, a significant fraction of the atoms are ejected on a daily basis.

Po-210 is an alpha emitter with a half-life of 138.39 days. It is notable in 
that it emits almost no gamma rays, a property that made it important to the 
Manhattan Project and the early post-war weapon program of the US By 
encapsulating Po-210 in a specially shaped capsule with beryllium, separated 
by a thin metal foil, a neutron initiator for fission bombs could be made. 
Sudden compression would cause the Po-210 and beryllium to mix, and produce 
neutrons by the Be-9 + alpha -> Be-8 + n + alpha reaction. The foil prevented 
the poorly penetrating alpha particles from creating neutrons prematurely. 
Other alpha emitters produce gamma rays in addition, which easily penetrate 
the foil and knock neutrons loose prematurely.

Po-210 is highly toxic and dangerous to handle. Its short half-life gives it 
an extremely intense radioactivity of 4490 Ci/g (4500 times as intense as 
radium-226, 65000 times as intense as Pu-239), its volatility makes it easy to 
ingest. The maximum allowable body burden is 0.03 microcuries (6.7x10^12 g).

The Manhattan Project found it impossible to prevent people who handled 
polonium from absorbing it. Fortunately absorbed polonium is not deposited in 
bone, but is excreted rather rapidly. Monitoring polonium content in urine, 
and frequent staff rotation, minimized the hazard. On the other hand, polonium 
deposited on inhaled particles is retained by the lung like plutonium, and can 
be extremely hazardous in this form. Much of the lung cancer hazard of tobacco 
smoking actually comes from polonium deposited on smoke particles, not 
chemical carcinogens.

Po-210 produces heat at a rate of 140 w/g. A capsule containing 500 mg will 
reach 500 deg. C. A milligram or so makes an easily visible blue glow from 
excitation of the air.

Polonium has more known isotopes than any other element with 27. Po-210 is the 
third longest lived (the maximum is Po-209 with 109 yr).

<h2>7.0    Nuclear Weapon Nations and Arsenals</h2>
There are currently five nations considered to be "nuclear weapons nations". 
In order of acquisition of nuclear weapons these are: the United States of 
America, Soviet Union/Russia, United Kingdom, France, and China. In actual 
fact, several more nations have developed nuclear weapons but do not publicly 
admit to having deployed them (in particular India, Israel, and Pakistan). The 
three smaller Soviet successor states that inherited nuclear arsenals 
(Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus) have now relinquished all nuclear warheads 
which have been removed to Russia.

<HR><a name=nfaq7.1></a><h3>
7.1    Nuclear Weapon Treaties</h3><pre>
The five nation nuclear "club" is codified in international law by the Nuclear 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) signed in 1970. This treaty declares that only 
the five nations mentioned above may lawfully possess nuclear weapons, but 
that all other nations may not be prohibited from acquiring peaceful nuclear 
technology. It also specifies that the five nuclear powers must seek to reduce 
and eliminate their arsenals as quickly as possible. No nation has admitted 
deploying a nuclear arsenal since this date, indicating that it has 
successfully stigmatized nuclear weapons acquisition. Also no signatory to the 
pact has yet successfully acquired nuclear weapons after joining NPT. It has 
not however dissuaded several nations from pursuing these weapons, in some 
cases successfully. At present, about 178 of the 185 member nations of the UN 
have signed the treaty. Holdouts include: India, Israel, and Pakistan; all of 
whom are believed to have nuclear weapons capability, if not actual weapons. 
Some nations who are parties to the treaty have pursued, or believed to be 
pursuing weapons are: Iraq, North Korea, Libya, and Iran. South Africa, which 
recently admitted to having developed an arsenal in the 1980s, has destroyed 
the arsenal and has since signed the pact.

It should be noted that although Iraq made substantial progress in pursuing 
nuclear weapons while a member of NPT, no NPT safeguarded facilities 
contributed to this effort. In fact, no safeguarded facility has ever been 
shown to contribute to a nuclear weapon effort after having been placed under 
safeguards (other than to simply increase the technical experience of the 
operating nation). It is only through secret programs, conducted entirely 
outside NPT, that nations have been able to pursue nuclear weapons. While the 
NPT regime is scarcely foolproof, it has been effective in preventing the 
diversion of civilian nuclear technology and facilities placed under 
safeguards.

Four nations that came into existence with the breakup of the Soviet Union 
inherited nuclear weapons: Russia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus. It was 
agreed by these nations that Russia would be the designated successor to the 
Soviet Union under NPT. All have now signed the NPT, and all nuclear warheads 
have been removed to Russian soil.

The NPT was originally of limited duration, its initial 25 year period expired 
in 1995. The NPT Review and Extension Conference was held in New York from 17 
April to 12 May, 1995. Of the 178 signatories, 175 attended. More than half of 
the signatories (111) sponsored renewal, this time indefinitely instead of a 
limited duration. As a result of majority sponsorship, the treaty extension 
was enacted without a formal vote. Three resolutions were also adopted that 
reaffirmed, clarified, and strengthened the basic NPT approach. Three 
signatories to the original pact, such as Iran, opposed extending the pact at 
all and boycotted the proceedings.

There is a non-treaty alliance called the Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG) to 
which most industrialized countries belong. This organization restricts the 
access of dual-use technology to countries suspected of pursuing nuclear arms.

Other treaties restricting nuclear arms include:

destroyed. 

START I (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks)
Signatories: US, USSR
Date:        1991 (went into effect 5 December 1994)
Reduces arsenals by about 30%. The original signatory USSR has since 
dissolved, and the states of Russia, Belarus, Kazkhstan, and recently Ukraine 
have endorsed the treaty by signing the START I Protocol. As a result of 
Ukraine's joining NPT, the treaty went into effect in December 1994.

START II (Strategic Arms Reduction Talks)
Signatories: US, Russia
Date:        1993; US Senate ratification 1996, unratified by Russian Duma
Reduces arsenals of both the US and Russia to 3000-3500 warheads by 2003 and 
bans MIRVed missiles. This treaty was finally ratified by the US Senate on 26 
Jan. 1996 by a vote of 87-4. It now requires only the approval of the Russian 
Duma to go into effect. Although compliance with START II has been assumed in 
US planning, a rider attached by the Senate prohibits compliance with treaty 
terms unless it formally goes into effect.

Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty (CTBT)
Signatories: 111 (as of 6 November 1996)
Date:        10 September 1996
This treaty was intended to ban all nuclear tests (based on a negotiated 
definition of "nuclear test") by all nuclear weapon possessing states 
(declared or undeclared). Tests by current non-weapons states is already 
banned by the NNPT. After several years of work, treaty negotiations conducted 
under the auspices of the 61-nation Conference on Disarmament in Geneva
earlier this year sucessfully enlisted support by all five declared nuclear 
powers. The final draft, proposed by Dutch negotiatior Ramaker in June, 
required signature by the non-declared weapon states: India, Pakistan, and 
Israel, for the treaty to go into effect. India, a supporter of the CTBT 
concept for many years, came out in open opposition to the final draft - 
declaring that it could not sign the treaty unless it contained a time table 
for all nuclear powers to destroy their arsenals (a requirement not directly 
connected with the purpose of the treaty - banning tests). It quickly became 
apparent that India's 11th-hour opposition was total - that it proposed to use 
all available means to obstruct the treaty. Since the ground rules for the 
Conference required unanimous support for treaty approval, India's opposition 
led to the abandonment of treaty negotiations on 22 August.

The other states however cast about to find an alternate avenue of treaty 
approval, and Australia offered to submit the treaty directly to the UN 
General Assembly for approval. On 9 September a resolution calling for 
approval was introduced into the UN General Assembly by Australia, and it was 
approved by voice vote the next day. It was opened for signature Tuesday, 24 
September when President Clinton followed by the foreign ministers of the four 
other declared nuclear powers -- Russia, China, Britain and 
France -- all signed.

The CTBT will not enter into force, though, 
until all 44 countries with nuclear reactors have signed and 
ratified it. Of these sdtates, 38 have signed. The six remaining 
states were Algeria, Bangladesh, Egypt, India, North Korea, and 
Pakistan. India has stated definitely that it will not sign the 
pact, and Pakistan has stated that it would not agree to the 
pact until India does so. The treaty requires a conference in three to four 
years for  members to decide how to accelerate the ratification process 
should India and others still refuse to join the pact. 
Clinton is expected to ask the U.S. Senate to ratify the treaty 
early in 1997, according to U.S. officials. But the United 
States will not deposit the ratification papers until all the 
nuclear powers as well as those suspected of having or close to 
having a bomb -- India, Pakistan and Israel -- are ready to do so.</pre>

In the game of comparing nuclear arsenal sizes a number of different methods 
of measurement can be used. The most popular are the number of warheads, and 
the total megatonnage of the arsenal. Number of warheads is meaningful when 
each warhead is large enough to destroy the target it is used against. Targets 
large enough to require many warheads are relatively few in number, even if 
the warheads are small (as nuclear weapons go), so warhead number is a fairly 
good indicator of the effective arsenal size. Megatonage provides a more 
direct measure of the gross destructive power of the arsenal, and is 
especially important for estimating long range effects (like fallout). Since 
the destructive potential of a nuclear weapon is not necessarily proportional 
to its size, an alternative to total megatonnage has beed proposed called 
equivalent megatonnage. The equivalent megatonnage of a warhead is its yield 
in megatons raised to the two-thirds power: Y^(2/3). This metric assumes that 
blast is the important destructive effect, as it is against most structures. 
The area affected by the thermal flash is directly proportional to size 
however, and this casualty producing effect thus dominates in large weapons.

An additional complication in discussing arsenal sizes with respect to the 
United States and Russia is that these nations are currently "building down" 
from their bloated Cold War arsenals. Both nations thus have large numbers of 
superfluous weapons that have yet to be dismantled, but are not part of their 
official arsenals. I have not included inventories of these retired weapons 
(mainly because data is unavailable), but these weapons do still exist and 
could be put back into service on short notice if the decision to do so were 
made. Even after dismantlement, the expensive nuclear materials will still 
exist, often in the form of fabricated weapons components, and manufacturing 
new weapons from them could be undertaken relatively rapidly.

7.2.1  United States of America
Since the invention of nuclear weapons, the US has built about 70,000 
warheads, and dismantled about 58,000 of them with most of the nuclear 
materials being recycled into new weapons. The US currently has about 12,200 
weapons in existence, but only 9250 (approx.) are in active service. The 
remaining 2950 or so are retired weapons either awaiting dismantlement, making 
up part of the inactive reserve, or both. At its numeric peak in 1967, the US 
arsenal had some 32,500 warheads.

The US has produced no new nuclear warheads in the past five years (the last 
fissile bomb core was fabricated in December 1989). The US is currently 
dismantling a large part of its existing nuclear arsenal, and has no plans at 
present for building any more nuclear weapons, or any new strategic delivery 
systems. If START II is implemented, by 2003 the US plans to have about 4450 
warheads in service (the last time there were fewer than this was in 1957 when 
5828 warheads existed) with a combined hedge stockpile and inactive reserve of 
5000. The hedge stockpile will contain fully operational weapons that are kept 
in storage away from their delivery systems (so that they are not immediately 
available), there are currently no weapons assigned to this category. The 
inactive reserve contains weapons that are intact but not in operational 
condition. Extensive work may be required to return an inactive weapon to 
service (e.g. expansion of tritium production facilities, followed by 
stockpiling of additional tritium; modification of inactive warheads to mate 
with current delivery systems, etc.). 350 W-84 warheads are currently assigned 
to the inactive reserve.

On 1 March 1995, President Clinton declared 212.5 tonnes of highly enriched 
uranium (HEU) and plutonium to be excess to national security needs. Since 
that time additional information about the amount, locations, and forms of 
this material has been released. The excess plutonium (38.2 tonnes) is stored 
at 10 locations in Washington, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico (two locations), 
Texas, Ohio, New York, Tennessee and South Carolina. The HEU (174.3 tonnes) is 
stored at six locations in Washington, Idaho, Colorado, New Mexico, Texas and 
South Carolina. It is expected that the HEU will be blended with natural 
uranium to produce some 7000 tonnes of civilian power plant fuel over 8-10 
years. About 10 tonnes of HEU has already been placed under international 
safeguards at the Oak Ridge Y-12 site.

The excess HEU consists of 33 tonnes of >92% enrichment material, and 142 
tonnes of 20-92% enrichment material. No HEU for weapons use has been produced 
since 1964, and production of HEU for use in naval reactors ended in 1991 with 
future needs to be met from the stockpile.

On 6 February 1996 US Dept. of Energy declassified significant additional 
information about plutonium stocks and their location. It was disclosed that 
since 1944 the U.S. produced or acquired 111.4 tonnes of plutonium, 
principally for weapons programs. 93.5% was produced in government reactors, 
5% was imported from 14 countries and 1.5% arose from commercial reactors.

89.3% of the 111.4 tonnes produced or acquired remains in the DOE/Department 
of Defense inventory (99.5 tonnes). The balance consists of plutonium used in 
the Nagasaki bomb and in weapons tests (3.4 tonnes, 3.1%), waste (3.1%), 
inventory differences (2.5%), fission and transmutation (1.1%), transfer to 
foreign countries (0.6%), decay (0.4%) and distribution to the civilian 
nuclear industry (0.1%).

Of the 99.5 tonnes in current inventory, 85 tonnes is weapons-grade plutonium 
(less than 7% Pu-240), 13.2 tonnes is "fuel-grade" (7-19% Pu-240) and 1.3 
tonnes is reactor-grade (over 19% Pu-240) material. 38.2 tonnes of weapons-
grade plutonium has been declared excess inventory, and will be disposed by 
(method of disposal currently undefined). The remaining 46.8 tonnes of 
weapons-grade plutonium appears to include plutonium contained in weapons 
still in the US stockpile, as well as an unspecified weapons material reserve. 
Of the excess inventory: 55.8% is located Pantex - presumably all in the form 
of fabricated weapon pits; 31.2% is located at Rocky Flats, and is thus 
inaccessible for weapons use at present since the facility has been shut down; 
most of the remaining 13% is distributed between Hanford, Los Alamos, and 
Savannah River.

A total of 90.5 tonnes of weapon grade plutonium was produced by the US. 54.5 
tonnes of this was produced at Hanford, 36 tonnes was produced at Savannah 
River.

Three countries provided the bulk of the foreign-derived material: United 
Kingdom (5,384 kilograms), Canada (254.5 kg) and Taiwan (79.1 kg). 749 
kilograms of plutonium that was transferred to 39 foreign countries between 
1959 and 1991 under the U.S. "Atoms for Peace" program. The plutonium was used 
for a variety of civilian purposes, primarily power reactor development under 
International Atomic Energy Agency supervision.

7.2.1.1  Current Nuclear Forces
The U.S. is currently reducing and consolidating its strategic forces in 
keeping with the 1994 Nuclear Posture Review (NPR). This plan envisions 
complying with the START II treaty (not yet in force) no later than 2003.

The U.S. will be deactivating the 50 Peacekeeper missiles, and will rely 
solely on the Minuteman III as a land-based ICBM. Since the average age of the 
MM III inventory is already more than 20 years (last one assembled 11/30/78), 
a US$5.2 billion program will refurbish them and extend their life to 2020. 
This program will remanufacture the solid fuel boosters, upgrading the 
electronics, and upgrade accuracy to a CEP of 100 m after the turn of the 
century. Between 1998 and 2002 a total of 652 new guidance units will be 
produced for the MM III fleet. The MM III force will be based at Malmstrom 
AFB, Montana (200 missiles), Minot AFB, North Dakota (150 missiles), and F.E. 
Warren AFB, Wyoming (150 missiles). This redeployment will be completed by the 
fall of 1998 (at the end of 1996 about 65 missiles remained to be moved from 
Grand Forks AFB in North Dakota). Inactivated silos are being destroyed by 
explosive demolition as required by START I. On 13 September the 149th silo 
was blown up at Ellsworth AFB, South Dakota. The 150th and last silo at 
Ellsworth has been nominated as a National Historic Landmark.

The Ohio class SSBNs are the only ballistic missile submarines still in the US 
arsenal, all subs belonging to older classes have been decommissioned or 
converted to other uses. Ohio class is still being procured. Of the 18 planned 
boats, 17 have been commissioned, and the last one is under construction. The 
final boat, the Louisiana, will be commissioned in August 1997. The first 8 
Ohio class subs were equipped with the Trident I missile. Starting with the 
9th boat, the Tennessee, commissioned in March 1990, subsequent subs have been 
equipped with the D-5 Trident (Trident II).  Under NPR the oldest 4 subs will 
be retired around 2003 for a fleet of 14, the remaining 4 Trident I boats will 
be converted to use the Trident II, allowing the Trident I to be retired. The 
Ohio fleet is based at Bangor, Washington and Kings Bay, Georgia with 8 subs 
each. Currently only Kings Bay supports the Trident II, it will reach its full 
strength of 10 boats when the Louisiana is commissioned. Eventually both bases 
will support 7 boats each. Trident II procurement continues, now the only US 
strategic missile program. Under Start I, the Trident II is limited to 8 
warheads (its design capability is 14). This lower loading extends its range 
to over 11000 km. START II will lower the loading to five each, further 
extending the range. The patrol rate (proportion of fleet on patrol at any 
time) is unchanged from the Cold War: two-thirds of the fleet is on patrol at 
any time.

The B-1B is being converted to a conventional bombing role. By the end of 1997 
B-1B will have been phased out as part of the U.S. strategic nuclear forces 
(it will still be possible for them to carry nuclear weapons however). The B-
52H force is has been scaled back to a total fleet of 71 planes, although only 
44 are on active duty at any one time. Despite its age (the last was delivered 
in Oct. 1962) the B-52H airframe is estimated to be good for service at least 
to 2030 (this is 83 years after the B-52 program's inception). Plans for 
retrofits and upgrades (including reengining) of the B-52H are underway. The 
B-52H force will be split between Minot AFB, North Dakota, and Barksdale AFB, 
Louisiana. The Northrop Grumman B-2 continues to slowly enter service, with 
some delivered aircraft being sent back for upgrades as deployment proceeds. 
Two planes have not yet been delivered, the last one should be delivered by 31 
January 1998. But six test planes will still need to be converted to 
operational configuration so that the full fleet of 21 that will not be 
operational until 2000. The first B-2 squadron, the 509th Bombardment Wing at 
Whiteman AFB, Missouri, will become operational in 1997 with 8 planes

"HEDGE" AND INACTIVE RESERVE STOCKPILE
Any functional nuclear weapon that is not in active service is available for 
use in principal. Most or all of the weapons now awaiting dismantlement are 
probably functional so any of them could be reactivated on short notice. Ther 
are two defined classes of warheads that are not active duty, but will be 
retained indefinitely as part of the U.S. Enduring Stockpile - the hedge 
stockpile and the inactive reserve. The hedge stockpile will begin receiving 
B-53 bombs as the B-61 Mod-11 begins to enter service. This inactive reserve 
reserve currently contains 50 W-84 ground launched cruise missile (GLCM) 
warheads.

7.2.1.2  Existing Weapon Infrastructure
Most of the weapons production infrastructure that was constructed during the 
Cold War has been (or will soon be) shut down, much of it is being dismantled. 
Plans are now being formulated to transfer various production and maintenance 
functions to other facilities as needed, mostly to the US national 
laboratories: Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL), Lawrence Livermore 
Natational Laboratory (LLNL), and Sandia National Laboratory (SNL). With the 
termination of weapons tests and production the role of the laboratories have 
been redefined to be "stockpile stewardship" - maintaining the safety and 
reliability of the existing stockpile. 

All manufacture of nuclear materials for weapons has been halted. There is now 
a stockpile surplus of U-235, Pu-239, and lithium deuteride. Weapon 
retirements will offset tritium decay in stockpile weapons so that no new 
tritium production will be needed to support the NPR defined post-START II 
arsenal until 2011 (allowing a 5 year reserve). Preliminary planning is 
underway to develop a new tritium production capability at Savannah River by 
this date.

There are two nuclear weapon design labs - LANL and LLNL. Each lab is 
responsible for supervising and maintaining the weapons it designs. Currently 
the labs are responsible respectively for the following weapons:
LANL - B53, B61, W76, W80, W88
LLNL - B83, W87, W84

Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL)
This weapon design lab competes with Los Alamos. It was established June 1952 
near Livermore California and has always operated under a contract with the 
University of California Board of Regents. The 12.2 square mile facility 
employed 7,800 people on 11/25/95.

LANL conducts R&D activities associated with all phases of the nuclear weapons 
life-cycle, as well as research on non-proliferation, arms control and treaty 
verification technology. Facilities include the High Explosive Application 
Facility (HEAF), a tritium facility, the NOVA laser used for Inertial 
Confinement Fusion (ICF) research, and the Atomic Vapor Laser Isotope 
Separation (AVLIS) plant. It currently planned to be the site for the National 
Ignition Facility (NIF), a new ICF laser facility 

Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL)
Opened in 1943 to design atomic bombs as part of the Manhattan Project, Los 
Alamos has always been operated under a contract with the University of 
California Board of Regents. This 43.0 square mile facility employed 7,987 
people on 11/25/95.

Los Alamos National Laboratory originally manufactured pits in small numbers 
for weapons tests at its TA-55 (Technical Area-55) plant. This four acre 
facility is currently the only full-function plutonium handling facility in 
the US. It opened in April 1978 at a cost of $70 million, and houses 400 
scientists and engineers. The 150,000 square foot PF-4 (Plutonium Facility-4) 
is the actual plutonium processing area of TA-55.

Plans are now for it to begin production for weapon stockpile use in 1997 
(with one W88 pit), increasing to 50 pits/yr by 2000. Los Alamos will support 
stockpile maintenance by requalifying 100 pits a year (this implies a 
remanufacturing lifecycle of nearly 100 years for all active weapons, and 
nearly 50 years for requalification).

Until FY 1984 Los Alamos had the capability to fabricate and assembly nuclear 
weapon test devices. This function was terminated due to persistent security 
problems, and is now handled by the Nevada Test Site.

Nevada Test Site (NTS)
Located 65 miles from Las Vegas, NTS was established as a nuclear weapon test 
range in 1951 with its first nuclear test (January 27, 1951). The last nuclear 
test was on September 23, 1992. A total of 928 total tests (100 atmospheric, 
828 underground) are known to have been conducted there. The 1,350 square 
miles facility employed 4,901 people on 11/25/95.

NTS is currently the only US facility capable of manufacturing nuclear 
explosive devices. With US nuclear explosion tests permanently terminated, its 
function has shifted to sub-critical tests with high explosives and fissile 
material in enclosed test chambers. In mid-1993, construction was completed on 
the $100 million Combined Device Assembly Facility, a 100,000 square foot 
building within a highly secured 22 acre portion of the test site. The 
facility includes five high explosives containment cells, called "Gravel 
Gerties," three weapon assembly bays, two radiographic areas and storage 
bunkers.

Pantex Plant
This 16.6 square miles facility, located near Amarillo, Texas, has long been 
the sole facility for the assembly/disassembly of nuclear warhead and bombs. 
It has not produced any weapons for five years, the last new nuclear weapon (a 
W88 warhead) was assembled on July 31, 1990. It is now performing 
dismantlement operations only. By 2000, when the current backlog of weapons 
has been dismantled, Pantex will reestablish a modest manufacturing 
capability.

In operation since May 1952, it is run by the Mason and Hanger-Silas Mason 
Company. It employed 3,348 people on 11/25/95.

Pantex stores pits from disassembled weapons. On 8 May 1995 it had 7239 in 
storage. It currently is upgrading its pit storage capability of 12000, but 
even this will be exceeded by 1999.

On 6 Feb. 1996, the DOE declared that Pantex holds 21.3 tonnes of weapon-grade 
plutonium (and 16.7 tonnes of highly enriched uranium) considered excess 
inventory *including planned dismantlements*. Even though a substantial 
portion of the pits in storage or planned for dismantlement may be HEU or 
plutonium/HEU composites, since this quantity of excess plutonium comes to 
only 1.7 kg per pit, it appears that much of the plutonium in storage at 
Pantex will be retained as a weapons material stockpile.

Sandia National Laboratory (SNL)
Sandia was established to provide engineering services for the development of 
nuclear weapons at the end of WWII. Its 11.9 square mile main facility is 
located inside Kirtland Air Force Base near Albuquerque, New Mexico; it has a  
413 acre branch laboratory near Livermore. It is operated by the Lockheed 
Martin Sandia Corp. and employed 8,527 people on 11/25/95.

SNL has taken over responsibility for neutron initiators from the Pinellas 
Plant where they were originally manufactured. In five years Sandia expects to 
be able to produce 500/yr.

Savannah River Site (SRS)
Located near Aiken, South Carolina, Savannah River was established to be the 
primary production site of nuclear materials for weapons in 1952 at the height 
of the Cold War. This capability has now been completely shut down. The 300 
square mile facility contains deactivated production facilities occupying 16 
square miles. It employed 16,655 people on 11/25/95. Its current weapon-
related work focuses on tritium handling, and managing the radioactive waste 
left over from the production of plutonium and tritium.

Other Facilities
Nearly all non-nuclear bomb components are manufactured at the the Kansas City 
Plant operated by the Bendix Kansas City Division of Allied-Signal. This 136 
acre facility (containing 3.2 million square feet of process building space) 
was opened in 1949 and employed 3,291 on 11/25/95.

The existing US gaseous diffusion enrichment facilities at Paducah, Kentucky, 
and Portsmouth, Ohio are operated by the United States Enrichment Corporation 
(established by the Energy Policy Act of 1992). These plants only produce low-
enriched uranium. In January 1991, the NRC received an application to 
construct and operate the nation's first privately owned uranium enrichment 
facility in Homer, Louisiana. The only facility for producing uranium 
hexafluoride is the Allied-Signal plant in Metropolis, Illinois.

WEAPON DEPLOYMENT/STORAGE SITES
As of mid-1995 the US had nuclear weapons stored at 20 sites in 17 states, and 
at 13 sites in 7 foreign countries (this does not count ballistic missile 
submarines on patrol in the open ocean). The 1995 figure is a significant 
decline from a few years ago, and a dramatic one over the last decade when 
hundreds of sites existed around the world. Several more of these sites are 
being closed now, or due to be closed over the next few years.

In 1995 the Pantex Plant in Texas had more US nuclear wepaons than any other 
site in the world, over 5000, although none of them were part of the active 
stockpile. Noneteheless, until these weapons are actually dismantled they 
continue to be functional and available for reactivation. Barksdale Air Force 
Base in Louisiana has more active US nuclear warheads than any other site in 
the world (1010 bombs and cruise missile warheads for the B-52H). North Dakota 
has more active warheads than any other state (1710 Minuteman III warheads at 
two air force bases). Tied for third place are Georgia (Kings Bay) and 
Washington (Bangor) as the principal deployment sites for the US Navy with 768 
warheads each (not counting an additional 768 warheads assigned to the base 
that are expected to be at sea on patrol at any given time).

All warheads deployed oversea (not counting ballistic missile submarines on 
patrol) are B-61 tactical thermonuclear bombs.

7.2.1.3  Planned Nuclear Forces
As a result of the START II Treaty, the US Department of Defense prepared a  
Nuclear Policy Review, issued on 22 September 1994, which projected US nuclear 
forces in the year 2003 after the treaty provision go into effect. Current 
plans are to have 3500 strategic warheads, 950 non-strategic warheads, and 550 
spares counted as part of the active inventory.

7.2.2  Russia
Although under Start II Russia is permitted 3500 warheads, it is very unlikely 
that the actual number of warheads will exceed 2500 due to the serious 
deterioration of Russian nuclear forces, and may be no more than 1500.

Under the 'swords for plowshares' deal signed in January 1994, the US 
Government will purchase 500 tonnes of HEU from Russia for dilution, for 
US$11.9 billion. Under the Russian-US agreement the United States Enrichment 
Corporation will purchase a minimum of 500 tonnes of military HEU over 20 
years, commencing with 10 tonnes for the first five years and not less than 30 
tonnes per year thereafter. The weapons-grade is to be blended down to 4.4% U-
235 in Russia and the Russians intend to use 1.5% U-235 for this, to minimize 
the levels of U-234 in the product. In the short term the military uranium is 
likely to be blended down to 20% U235, then stored. In this form it is not 
useable for weapons.

The blending down of 500 tonnes of military HEU will result in about 15,000 
tonnes of low-enriched uranium over 20 years. This is equivalent to about 
150 000 tonnes of natural uranium, or approximately three times western world 
demand in 1993. The dilution of 10 tonnes of military HEU per year for the 
first five years will displace approximately 3,700 tonnes of uranium oxide 
production per year, equivalent to output from a medium to large uranium mine. 
By 2000 the dilution of 30 tonnes of military HEU will displace about 11,200 
tonnes of uranium oxide mine production per year which represents 
approximately 20% of the western world's uranium requirements. 

In 1995 the US Enrichment Corporation received its first shipments of low-
enriched uranium from Russia (186 tonnes), derived from six tonnes of weapons-
grade material. The first shipment of this to a customer, valued
at US$145 million, was made in November, and is presumably now generating 
electricity.

Russia currently produces a single ICBM, the RT-2PM Topol single warhead 
missile (designated the SS-25 by NATO), built by the Moscow Institute of 
Thermal Technology and assembled at Votkinsk. First test flight of this 
missile version was 20 December 1994. It differs from the earlier SS-25 in 
that all of the missile is now made in Russia. The current version is road-
mobile, but a silo-based version (the Topol M) is being developed. The Topol 
is the only ICBM currently in production in the world, the Topol M is the only 
ICBM under development.

Current strategic plans are to continue the manufacture of the SS-25 to 
replace most of the ICBMs currently in service (currently at the low 
production rate of about 1 per month). Russia will probably retain 105 SS-19s 
in service under START-II. No new SLBMs, or ballistic missile subs are 
expected to enter service before 2003. The Blackjack and Bear production lines 
have been shut down. There are currently slightly fewer than 100 nuclear 
weapon storage sites in Russia.

Due to the disordered state of Russian affairs in general, and military 
affairs in particular, it is difficult to estimate the actual available 
nuclear forces. The figures given below are the maximum available forces. The 
actual effective SLBM and aircraft forces are likely to be a fraction of those 
indicated. At one point during the summer of 1995 only one Typhoon SLBM boat 
was deployed. Few, if any, Blackjacks are currently operational. Some of the 
forces that have become unavailable due to maintenance and support problems 
may eventually be reactivated.

Russia now has nine power stations operating 29 nuclear reactors, with 22
gigawatts of electrical capacity; this represents  12% of total electricity 
generated in Russia. The Minatom ministry plans to increase total capacity to 
28 or 30 gigawatts before 2005.

Russia has four uranium enrichment facilities, in Ekaterinburg, Tomsk, 
Krasnoyarsk and Angarsk, with a total annual enrichment capacity 20 million 
SWU. Isotope separation has gone through several stages of development: 
gaseous dynamic nozzle technology, gaseous diffusion, and gas centrifuge. 
Russia is currently using 50% of her enrichment capacity for domestic and 
export production, and is thus aggressively marketing her high technology 
centrifuge separation capacity. 

7.2.3    Britain

7.2.3.1  History of British Nuclear Weapons
Britain was the first country to seriously study the feasibility of nuclear 
weapons, and made a number of critical conceptual breakthroughs. The first 
theoretically sound critical mass calculation was made in England by Frisch 
and Peierls in Feb. 1940; and from 10 April 1940 to 15 July 1941 the MAUD 
Committee headed by Tizard worked out the basic principles of fission bomb 
design and uranium enrichment by gaseous diffusion. The work done by the MAUD 
Committee was instrumental in alerting the US (and through espionage, the 
USSR) to the feasibility of fission weapons in WWII. A high level of 
cooperation between Britain, the US, and Canada continued through the war, 
formalized by the 1943 Quebec Agreement. Britain sent "the British Mission", a 
team of first rank scientists to work at Los Alamos. The mission made major 
contributions to the Manhattan Project, and provided the nucleus for British 
post-war atomic weapons development effort. Among the mission members was 
William G. Penney who later led the British atomic bomb project. 

Immediately after the war, in August 1945, the new Labor government in Britain 
organized a secret Cabinet committee to establish nuclear policy. Initial 
decisions focused on establishing nuclear infrastructure and research. In 
August 1946 the U.K. Air Chief of Staff issued a formal requirement for an 
atomic bomb. On 6 November 1946 the Atomic Energy Act (McMahon Act) severed 
close nuclear ties between the US and Britain. On 8 January 1947, a secret 
committee of six Ministers (headed by P.M. Attlee) decided to proceed with 
development and acquisition of atomic weapons. This fact was not disclosed at 
all until 12 May 1948, when an oblique reference was made to atomic weapon 
development in parliamentary discussions.

The initial sites for Britain's nuclear program were selected in 1946. 
Harwell, on the Berkshire Downs 12 miles south of Oxford, was selected for the 
Atomic Energy Research Establishment. This research center was headed by 
physicist Sir John Crockcroft. Construction began there for Britain's first 
nuclear reactor, Bepo (Britain Experimental Pile Zero). Bepo went critical on 
3 July 1948.

The fissile material production facilities were the responsibility of 
Christopher Hinton. A site for the first plutonium production reactors and 
plutonium processing plant was selected at Sellafield on the Irish Sea coast 
in Cumberland. The site was renamed Windscale, and construction began in 
September 1947. In October 1950 the first production reactor went critical. 
The plutonium plant began operation on 25 February 1952, and produced the 
first plutonium metal 35 days later.

A gaseous diffusion plant was also planned, and the site eventually chosen in 
Early 1950 was Capenhurst, near Chester. This plant finally began operation in 
1953. An extension boosted its annual production capacity to 125 kg of HEU at 
the end of 1957. 

In May 1947 William Penney learned of the decision to build an atomic bomb, 
and the following month began assembling a team to work on it. The effort 
suffered initially from disorganization - it was spread over several sites, 
and lines of authority with other research sites were not clear. By mid 1948 
the responsibilities had been settled, and on 1 April 1950 a single site was 
selected for atomic weapons development at Aldermaston in Berkshire. 

Due to the small size and high population density of Britain no suitable sites 
for atmospheric weapons tests existed. Britain thus sought sites in other 
countries to test its weapons, finally settling on the Monte Bello Islands in 
Australia. On 15 September 1952 the plutonium pit for the first British 
nuclear device, code named Hurricane, left England. On 3 October 1952 
Hurricane was detonated in a lagoon off the western shore of Trimouille 
Island. The bomb was suspended 90 ft underwater beneath the HMS Plym, and 
yielded 25 Kt.

The British arsenal acquired its first deployed weapon, the Blue Danube 
plutonium bomb, in November 1953. This weapon was based on the Hurricane 
device. Plans at this point called for building up an arsenal of 200 weapons 
by 1957 so plutonium production was expanded by adding two new dual use 
(plutonium and electricity) MAGNOX reactors at Calder Hall.

The US had already demonstrated the feasibility of megaton size fission and 
thermonuclear bombs in October 1952, and by February 1954 the British had 
drafted requirements to add megaton weapons to their stockpile. The Teller-
Ulam design had not been rediscovered by them at this point, and only pure 
fission designs were initially considered. 

From March through May 1954 the UK was permitted by the US to observe the 
Castle test series at Bikini atoll and use sampling aircraft in the mushroom 
clouds. This would have provided the British with clear, direct evidence of 
the high compression produced in the secondary stages by radiation implosion.

Possibly as a direct result of this data, on 16 June 1954 Winston Churchill 
decided that Britain should go ahead with H-bomb development, that is, to 
replicate the US achievement (the USSR had not tested a staged thermonuclear 
bomb at this time).

Due to technical uncertainties a program of parallel development of alternate 
approaches was undertaken. The primary objectives were to acquire warheads 
with yields of approximately 1 megaton suitable for both an air dropped bomb, 
and a lighter one for the Blue Streak medium range ballistic missile 
(eventually cancelled). Secondary objectives were to minimize the use of 
scarce and expensive fissile material in the designs. To achieve these ends a 
low-risk pure fission design, multiple boosted fission (Alarm Clock/Layer Cake 
like) designs, and staged thermonuclear designs were pursued. Since the pure 
fission bomb would have required 120 kg of U-235 (the entire annual production 
of Capenhurst, once expansion was complete in 3 years), and was too heavy for 
missile use, this was an option of last resort. 

By mid-December 1955 the increasing international pressure for a halt to 
atmospheric testing gave further impetus to the parallel programs. It appeared 
quite possible that the UK might have only a very short window in which it 
could test megaton class weapons (and demonstrate this capability to the 
world). The requirement for a multi-megaton weapon had been added by this 
time, which only a two-stage thermonuclear device could provide. This decision 
was largely based on political considerations, since the Soviet Union had 
tested such a device on 22 November 1955.

By this time Britain had developed a pure fission design for the Mark 1 bomb 
case, and two boosted fission designs using U-235 surrounded by lithium 
deuteride: Green Bamboo and a smaller and lighter (but less efficient) device 
called Orange Herald. All were estimated to produce 1 megaton yields. They 
also had a large two-stage thermonuclear weapon design called Green Granite 
expected to produce multi-megaton yields (1-4 Mt). Green Bamboo and Green 
Granite were suitable for the heavy air-dropped bomb, only Orange Herald was 
suitable for the missile warhead. The Green Bamboo and Orange Herald devices 
were both quite expensive in fissile material. Green Bamboo required 87 kg of 
U-235, Orange Herald required 117 kg. Considering annual production was only 
120 kg, neither of these devices could be deployed in very large numbers.

Fusion reactions using lithium deuteride fuel were ignited in the Mosaic test 
series conducted at the Monte Bello test site in the spring of 1956. Mosaic G1 
(16 May 1956) produced a 15-20 Kt yield and was apparently a failure. Mosaic 
G2 (19 June 1956), which produced an unexpectedly high 98 Kt yield, provided 
data about fast fission of a U-238 tamper by fusion neutrons.

By January 1957 two variant designs had been developed for both Green Granite 
and Orange Herald. These were a light weight version of Green Granite 
(suitable for the missile), and a heavy weight version of Orange Herald using 
the Mark 1 case (too heavy for the missile, but more likely to be successful). 
Both Green Granite Large and Small (or Short) were expected at this time to 
produce a yield of about 1 Mt. A modified version of the Red Beard bomb 
(evidently to produce a higher yield) called Tom was used as the trigger for 
both Green Granite designs.

The Green Granite Small, Orange Herald Small, and a device called Purple 
Granite which was substituted for Green Granite Large at the last minute 
(possibly a modified version of it) were ultimately tested in the 1957 Grapple 
test series at Malden Island in the Pacific. Green Granite Small was detonated 
in the Grapple 1/Short Granite test on 15 May 1957. Its yield was a 
disappointing 200-300 Kt, but most of this was from the secondary stage 
providing proof of principle. Orange Herald Small was tested in Grapple 
2/Orange Herald on 31 May 1957 producing 720 Kt (the largest yield from this 
type of device on record). Surprisingly, Purple Granite produced an even 
smaller yield in the Grapple 3/Purple Granite test on 19 June 1957, about 150 
Kt. 

All in all, the series was a mixed success. The rediscovered Teller-Ulam 
design, and a deployable megaton-class weapon design had both been proven. On 
the other hand, the H-bomb yields were far below those predicted. 

The next test, Grapple X, was held on 7 November 1957. The bomber squadron was 
only notified about the test in September, followed by four weeks of intensive 
training in preparation. Only one device, designated Round C, was tested with 
a yield of 1.8 Mt. This indicates that Grapple X was a hurriedly prepared and 
planned operation, intended to test a redesigned Teller-Ulam device following 
analysis of the disappointing results of the first and third Grapple tests. 
The high yield shows that the British had achieved mastery of H-bomb design.

7.2.3.2  Stockpiled British Nuclear Weapons
Blue Danube (Mark 1)
This free fall bomb was the first nuclear weapon stockpiled by Britain, going 
into service in November 1953. It was a pure fission bomb initially using 
plutonium, but later modified to use a composite plutonium/U-235 core. Tests 
were also conducted with a uranium only core. It had a nominal yield of 15 Kt. 
Based on Hurricane, the first UK tested device, it was essentially a lab-
built, limited production weapon. It was continuously modified, so it existed 
in a number of "variants", some with yields up to at least 40 Kt. It was 
tested in Buffalo Round 2 (4 October 1956) and 3 (11 October 1956) with low 
yield cores providing yields of 1.5 and 3 Kt. Only about 20 were manufactured 
by early 1958 when production terminated. It remained in service until 1962.

Red Beard
Second generation fission weapon. Light weight tactical fission bomb using a 
tritium boosted plutonium/U-235 composite core. Tested in Buffalo Rounds 1 (27 
September 1956) and 4 (22 October 1956) with yields of 15 and 10 Kt 
respectively.

Violet Club
This interim air dropped bomb had an estimated yield of 500 Kt. The case was 
very similar to the Mark 1, its weight was 9000 lb. Deployed in early 1958, 
only five were planned for deployment. The deployed bombs were subsequently 
converted to Yellow Sun Mk 1 bombs.

The device used in Violet Club was called Green Grass. This device had not 
been previously tested, and was based on a design prepared for Grapple (but 
also apparently not tested), although its yield was predicted from devices 
that were tested in Grapple. Based on this, and the similarity in names, it 
may be surmised that Green Grass is based on Green Bamboo (bamboo is a type of 
grass after all). The probable alteration was to reduce the fissile content 
(to perhaps 75 kg or so) thus making better use of Britains scant U-235 
stockpile. The severe safety problems of this design clearly indicate a high 
fissile content. The intent would have been to provide a high yield weapon 
that could be quickly deployed in reasonable numbers (impossible for Orange 
Herald).

7.2.4  France
France completed its sixth and last test in its 1995-96 Pacific test series on 
27 January 1996. This 120 Kt explosion, the largest of the series was declared 
to be the last France would ever conduct by Chirac two days later.

On 23 February 1996 Jacques Chirac announced a major restructuring of Frances 
nuclear posture. As part of dramatic overall reduction in French military 
structure (the largest in Europe), Chirac announced the elimination of all 
land-based nuclear missiles, and a halt in production of all fissile material 
for weapons. The 18 SSBS S3D MRBMs based in the Massif Central will be 
retired, as will the Hades tactical missile (now in storage). Plans are going 
forward though to upgrade the air and sea-based legs of the French nuclear 
arsenal. The submarine fleet will be re-equipped with the M51 long range 
ballistic missile, and the ASMP nuclear missile carried by the Mirage 2000N 
(and the Rafale after the turn of the century) will be upgraded.

On 4 June 1996, France and the U.S. signed an agrremetn to share data on 
nuclear weapons design. The agreement builds on 1961 and 1985 accords to share 
information on the "safety, security and reliability" of nuclear installations 
and weapons systems. Under the agreement, the United States will share 
computer data drawn from simulated explosions, information considered so 
sensitive that it has previously only been shared with the UK. The agreement 
aims to facilitate work on eight different scientific challenges posed by the 
looming global test ban, including ensuring that existing warheads remain 
potent as their components age, and preventing accidental detonation of these 
warheads or their seizure by extremists. To avoid handing over information 
that could be used to design new weapons, the U.S. decided to release the 
classified results of computer simulations that describe the workings of 
fission devices, but not the fusion stages. Since fusion energy cannot be 
released without detonating a fission trigger, safety and security issues for 
thermonuclear weapons can be adeqyuately addressed by only conisdering the 
fission primary.

Recently, for the first time, the French government has published figures on 
civilian plutonium in France. A total of 206 tonnes was held. This consists of 
55 tonnes of separated plutonium (as isolated plutonium or in fresh MOX fuel), 
nearly half of which belonged to foreign customers, and the balance in spent 
fuel. Of the latter, 64 tonnes was in spent fuel at reactors and 87 tonnes at 
reprocessing plants.

7.2.5  China
Given China's size in terms of geography (third in the world, only slightly 
behind Canada), population (number one), and economy (second largest in the 
world by current CIA equivalent purchasing power estimates, with current 
growth rates in the double digits), it is inevitable that China will become 
the dominant power in the world within a few decades. China's leaders are 
acutely aware of this fact, and are also acutely aware that except for the 
last few centuries, China has consistently been the most powerful and advanced 
country in the world for 3500 years. They undoubtedly intend that China will 
have military capabilities commensurate with this future and historic status.

To date China has conducted many fewer nuclear tests than the United States or 
the Soviet Union/Russia (less than 5% as many as either) and this discrepancy 
accounts for China's relunctance to sign on to a permanent ban on all nuclear 
tests at the CTBT negotiations. 

According to Japanese government sources (reported in Nihon Keizai Shimbun), 
the most recent underground Chinese nuclear test on 8 June 1996 was actually a 
simultaneous detonation of multiple warheads (a common practice by both the US 
and USSR). It was said to be part of a program to produce smaller warheads for 
submarine-launched and multiple-targeted missiles. The total yield of the test 
was several tens of kilotons. Nihon Keizai also said China has recently bought 
computer simulation technology for nuclear warheads from Russia.

7.2.6   Other Former Soviet States
On 26 December 1991, the day the Soviet Union broke up, three successor states 
- Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and Belarus - became the third, fourth, and eighth 
largest nuclear powers in the world. On paper anyway. None of these states had 
control of the strategic arsenals deployed on their territory, and wresting 
control from Moscow would have been quite difficult. They could have seized 
and made use of part of the tactical nuclear weapons stockpiled within their 
borders, but fortunately these were quickly relinquished by all three nations 
and shipped back to Russia. 

The negotiations regarding the strategic arsenals present in these states, and 
their dismantlement, has been a slower and more difficult process. All three 
states have now signed the NPT, and endorsed START I, and have abandoned 
claims to these weapons. As of 23 November 1996, the last nuclear warheads 
outside of Russian were removed (from Belarus) thus completing the transition 
to Russia being the sole inheritor of the Soviet nuclear arsenal. Note that 
all of the strategic weapons mentioned below are counted as part of the 
*Russian* arsenal in 7.1.2.
  
7.2.6.1 Ukraine
Nationalist sentiment in Ukraine initially inhibited the surrender of claims 
to the strategic weapons present at the time of dissolution of the Soviet 
Union. The first president, Leonid Kravchuk, variously used these weapons as a 
populist rallying point, and a bargaining tool with the West. Following his 
replacement by Pres. Kuchma, and after obtaining commitments of aid from the 
US and Europe, the Ukrainian parliament voted 301 to 8 to sign NPT on 16 
November 1994. On 5 December 1994 Ukraine became the 167th member of NPT, as a 
consequence, on this same day the START I treaty entered force.

Ukraine began transferring nuclear warheads on its territory to Russia in 
March 1994, with a shipment of 60 ICBM warheads. About 540 were shipped to 
Russia in 1994, and 720 in 1995. The last nuclear weapon was transferred to 
Russia in May 1996, rendering Ukraine a non-nuclear nation. 

32 SS-19 missiles will be returned to Russia, the remaining SS-19s will be 
placed in storage by Ukraine after removal from their silos. The silos 
themselves are slated for destruction, the first having been blown up 5 
January 1996 at Pervomaysk.

Reportedly 19 Tu-160 Blackjack bombers are located at Priluki Air Base, and 25 
TU-95 Bear-H bombers are located at Uzin Air Base. Ukraine had previously 
agreed on principle to return all of the bombers to Russia, and on 3 December 
1996 an agreement was announced for Russia to purchase 10 Blackjacks and 15 
Bears. According to Ukraine these planes are supposedly operational, but they 
have not flown since the collapse of the Soviet Union and Russia estimates 
that only one third are flyable. The planes will be paid for in cash ($320-
$350 million according to Russia), spare parts and debt relief.

In 1995, the 15 operating nuclear reactors generated 70.5 trillion watt-hours 
of electricity, equivalent to 37% of the nation's electrical production (up 
from 34.2% in 1994, and 24.5% in 1990).

Accelerated development of nuclear energy is planned in Ukraine. Zaporozhe-6 
was scheduled for commissioning in 1995, Khmelnitsky-2 in 1998, Rovno-4 in 
1999, and Khmelnitsky-3 and -4 in 1999-2000. Installed nuclear capacity will 
exceed 30% of overall generating capacity, generating more than 40% of total 
electricity production. In December 1995, a deal was arranged at the G-7 
summit to pay US$2.5 billion to arrange the closure of the Chernobyl facility 
by 2000, by providing replacement nuclear generating capacity.

Ukraine is moving quickly to expand its nuclear industry to provide maximum 
self-sufficiency. This includes expanding uranium ore production, fuel 
enrichment and fabrication plants, and fuel and waste reprocessing facilities.

7.2.6.2 Kazakhstan
On the day of independence, Kazakhstan had 104 SS-18 Satan (RS-20) missiles 
deployed at Derzhavik and Zhangiz-Tobe. By the end of 1994, 44 of the SS-18s 
had been removed from their silos. The remaining SS-18s were taken out of 
operation during 1995. By April 1995 all SS-18 warheads had been removed from 
Kazakhstan.

The last of 40 Bear-H bombers (27 Bear-H6, and 13 Bear-H16) were withdrawn 
from their base in Semipalatinsk in Feb. 1994, along with 370 AS-15 air-
launched cruise missile warheads.

In a secret operation code named "Project Sapphire" in November 1994 the 
United States acquired approximately 600 kg of weapon grade uranium stored in 
Kazakhstan and flew it to the U.S. This uranium is currently being 
demilitarized by blending down into low enriched uranium, a process expected 
to be completed by May 1996.

30 kg of plutonium has also been purchased by the US from Kazakhstan (1994).

7.2.6.3 Belarus
On the day of independence, Belarus had 81 SS-25 Sickle (RS-12M) missiles at 
two sites: Lida and Mozyr. At the end of 1994 Belarus still had 36 SS-25s, 18 
at each site. In 1995 this decreased to 18, 9 in each site (one regiment per 
site). Although Belarus has been unhappy however with the refusal by Russia to 
pay compensation for the weapon fissile material removed from its territory, 
the last nuclear warheads were reportedly removed on 23 November 1996. Some of 
the SS-25 missiles still remain (now unarmed), but the removal of the last of 
these is expected by early 1997.

7.3	 Suspected States</h3><pre>
It is arguable whether India, Pakistan, and Israel should be classed as 
"suspected states" at this point. Although none of them is a declared weapon 
possessing state, in the sense that they officially admit to having deployed 
nuclear weapons, enough is known about their capabilities to state 
unequivocally that any of these states can employ nuclear weapons at will.

7.3.1  India
That India can build nuclear weapons has been an established fact since 18 May 
1974, when India exploded a 12-15 Kt plutonium bomb in an underground test at 
Pokhra in the Rajasthan Desert (26.99 deg N, 071.80 E). India maintains that 
this test was for peaceful purposes, and that it possesses no nuclear arsenal. 

A key motivation for India's nuclear program is undoubtedly its concern about 
nuclear-armed China, which faces India along much of its northern border. 
Disputes about this border exist: China currently occupies the Aksai Chin 
plateau adjacent to Ladakh, Kashmir in Northwest India; India occupies the 
North-East Frontier Agency claimed by China. In October 1962 China invaded 
India, an attack that India was powerless to respond to. China eventually 
withdrew voluntarily later in the year. India has also fought repeatedly with 
Pakistan since 1947, and holds Kashmir - Muslim territory claimed by Pakistan. 
Pakistan's own nuclear program now serves as justification for perpetuating 
India's own program, although Pakistan did not begin acquiring weapon 
technology until after India's nuclear test. India also has aspirations to 
being the dominant power in southern Asia, and may view nuclear weapons as a 
necessary component of acquiring this status.

The center piece of India's nuclear weapons program is the Bhabha Atomic 
Research Center (BARC) near Bombay. The plutonium for this bomb was produced 
by irradiating uranium samples at BARC in the Canadian-supplied 40 MW CIR 
(Canadian-Indian Reactor) heavy water research reactor (also called Cirus). 
This reactor began operating in 1960 and can produce 9-10 kg of plutonium a 
year. The reactor is not under IAEA safeguards, although Canada stipulated 
that it only be used for peaceful purposes. India argues that this allows its 
use in producing nuclear explosives.
 
India probably began its development of a nuclear device shortly after China 
tested its first nuclear weapon in the mid-60s. A design had been developed by 
1971, when Indira Gandhi decided to proceed with the manufacture and test of 
the device. According to Raj Ramanna, the director of BARC at the time, it 
took another two years to separate, purify, and fabricate the plutonium metal, 
and to manufacture the implosion lens systems and associated electronics. Most 
of the work was done at BARC, but the explosive lenses were made by the 
Defense Research and Development Organization. Apparently the precise 
implosion electronics gather considerable trouble. It is rumored that an 
initial test of the device failed, probably due to a failure of the 
electronics. The neutron initiator was a Po-210/Be type code-named "Flower", 
which took a long time to design and assemble. Although the assertion that the 
test was for peaceful purposes can be viewed with legitimate skepticism, the 
device was almost certainly a laboratory device not a test of a deployable 
weapon.

The plutonium for the 1974 test was produced at the separation plant in 
Trombay, near to Bombay, capable of processing 30 tonnes of heavy metal 
fuel/yr. Construction on the first facility there began in the 1950s, and 
began operating in 1964. In 1974 it was shut down for repair and expansion and 
reopened in the early 1980s.

India has developed indigenous plutonium production reactors. On 8 August 1985 
the 100 MW Dhruva was commissioned, it is based on the Cirus design and can 
produce 20-25 kg of plutonium a year. Startup problems plagued Dhruva, but it 
began full operation by the late 80s.

An additional possible source of plutonium are the unsafeguarded Madras Atomic 
Power Stations (MAPS), known as Madras I and II. Like CIR and Dhruva, the MAPS 
are heavy-water moderated natural uranium reactors that can be used 
effectively for weapon-grade plutonium production. The possible production by 
MAPS is much larger than CIR and Dhruva combined, although the fuel burnup in 
power reactors of this type normally produces plutonium considered unsuitable 
for weapons. It is uncertain how practical it is to operate MAPS for weapons 
grade plutonium production, although even the reactor-grade output has weapons 
potential. If supergrade plutonium were produced at BARC by short irradiation 
periods, it could be mixed with MAPS plutonium to extend the plutonium supply. 
In 1989 India had a total of 8 power reactors operating, producing 1478 MW 
(electrical), but with 13 more planned or under construction that would boost 
electrical output by another 5100 MW. 

Given its immense thorium resources, India is actively interested in 
developing the thorium/U-233 fuel cycle. India is known to have produced 
kilogram quantities of U-233 by irradiating thorium in CIR, Dhruva, and MAPS 
reactors. Substantial production of U-233 is not practical though with natural 
uranium fueled reactors. The thorium cycle requires more highly enriched fuel 
to have an acceptable breeding ratio with the non-fissile thorium blanket. 
Reactor-grade plutonium from MAPS could serve as start-up fuel for U-233 
plants in the future. If available U-233 is as effective a weapon material as 
plutonium.

India has been developing the capability to produce heavy water domestically 
to provide the moderator load for future reactors. The heavy water for the 
existing reactors was imported however. Canada provided the heavy water for 
CIR. The 110 tonnes of unsafeguarded moderator for Dhruva and Madras I and II 
were ironically provided by China.

A second plutonium separation plant has been built at Tarapur, north of 
Bombay, which began operating in late 1985 or early 1986. The plant has 
encountered operating problems, but India reports having overcome these by 
1990. A much larger plant is now under construction at Kalpakkam sufficient to 
handle all existing reactors.

Taken together, India has developed an extensive plutonium production and 
reprocessing capability. It is estimated India had produced 300 Kg of weapons-
grade plutonium through the end of 1991 By mid-1995 this had increased to over 
400 kg (65-80 bombs worth). These estimates are based solely on CIR and Dhruva 
production. Approximately 1000 kg of unsafeguarded reactor-grade plutonium 
exists.

India has acquired and developed centrifuge technology and built centrifuge 
enrichment plants in Trombay and Mysore in the 1980s. These enrichment plants 
appear to have no role in India's power reactor development plans, so they may 
be intended to offset the prestige of Pakistan's enrichment capability, or to 
provide additional standby weapons production capability.

India has developed short and medium-range missiles (the Prithvi, range 250 
km, and the Agni, range 2500 km) capable of carrying light nuclear weapons 
(500-1000 kg). India has an active space program which could provide the 
technology for eve longer range weapons. India reportedly has investigated 
development of an ICBM-class missile called Suriya. 

India denies having produced additional plutonium pits for nuclear weapons. 
India's interest in light weight weapon design can be surmised from BARC's 
acquisition in the 1980s of a vacuum hot pressing machine, suitable for 
forming large high-quality beryllium forgings, as well as large amounts of 
high purity beryllium metal. India is known to manufacture tritium, and may 
have developed designs for fusion-boosted weapons.

India is not a signatory to NPT and has opposed the treaty as discriminatory 
to non-weapons states. India has previously taken the position that a world-
wide ban on nuclear testing, and the production of fissionable material for 
weapons is called for. Except for China, which continues testing, there is now 
a de facto halt to testing worldwide, as well as the production of weapons 
grade plutonium and uranium by the US and Russia. India has shown no interest 
so far in restricting its own activities despite these changes in the world 
situation. India has also rejected offers at bilateral negotiation with 
Pakistan, but in December 1988 the two nations signed an agreement prohibiting 
attacks on each other's nuclear installations and informing each other of 
their locations (though not their purposes).

During the fall of 1995 India changed its position on the CTBT from supporting 
to opposing it on the grounds that while the five nuclear states possessed 
weapons, a ban on nuclear tests was discriminatory. On 15 December 1995, the 
New York Times reported that India might be preparing for a second nuclear 
test. The newspaper quoted (unnamed) U.S. government officials as saying spy 
satellites have recorded activity at the Pokaran test site in the Rajasthan 
desert in recent weeks. It said, however, that intelligence experts could not 
tell whether preparations were being made to explode a nuclear bomb or whether 
they involved some other experiments connected with India's nuclear weapons 
program. The Indian government called the New York Times report "highly 
speculative" but stopped short of an outright denial. Strong domestic support 
for such a move was shown in an India Today survey of 2000 adults on 5 
December (*before* the Times story). It showed 62 percent of the respondents 
would approve if India exploded an atom bomb to develop its nuclear weapons 
capability. Pakistan indicated that such a move might cause it to conduct its 
first test.

7.3.2  Iran
Iran is actively pursuing a nuclear power program, and US intelligence 
believes that is pursuing nuclear weapons as well. Reports that are unsourced 
and/or undocumented have surfaced that allege that Iran has attempted to 
obtain weapons related materials and technology outside of NPT supervision. 
These include a suspected attempt to purchase weapons-grade uranium from the 
Ulba Metallurgical Plant in Kazakhstan, and efforts to obtain uranium 
enrichment, and plutonium separation technology. Little solid information 
about this is publicly available however. Iran has not been officially accused 
of violating NPT. The concerns appear to due to general patterns of behavior 
in acquiring dual use technology, and suspected intentions, rather than any 
concrete violation. There has apparently been much interest by Iran in 
acquiring technology and materials applicable to early-generation gas 
centrifuges - such as maraging steel, high strength aluminium alloys, and a 
variety of numerically controlled machine tools - from Western Europe and 
Russia. Given the similarity to the weapons efforts of Pakistan and Iraq, this 
is cause for special concern.

Claims widely circulated last year that Iran had stolen two nuclear weapons 
from the post-Soviet stockpile in Kazakhstan have been completely discredited.

Russia has agreed to construct two 1000 MW (electric) light water power 
reactors, and a 30-50 MW (thermal) light water research reactor in Iran that 
would be built and operated under NPT safeguards. The deal also includes the 
sale of 2000 tons of natural uranium, assistance in the development of a 
uranium mine, and originally included the sale of a gas centrifuge uranium 
enrichment plant as well. Although Iran is a signatory to NPT, and safeguarded 
power reactors have would contribute little to any weapons program, the US has 
protested this sale out of general concerns about enhancing Iran's access to 
any nuclear technology. At the US-Russian summit on 10 May 1995 between 
Presidents Clinton and Yeltsin in April 1995, Russia agreed to drop the 
uranium enrichment component of this deal, but the other parts remain intact.

As a signatory to NPT Iran has a right to safeguarded civilian nuclear 
technology. On the other hand, if it is trying to circumvent NPT then it 
abrogates that right. It is argued by some that Iran must be after nuclear 
weapons in its deal with Russia, since it has vast amounts of fossil fuels and 
has no reason to want power reactors. This is not necessarily true. Iran might 
want to conserve its oil and gas for export, which would be profitable if it 
could produce electricity from reactors more cheaply. Given the severely 
depressed ruble this might well be the case. On the other hand, purchasing 
enrichment technology does not make economic sense. There is a world wide glut 
of both enriched reactor grade uranium, and enrichment capacity. Iran 
reportedly has substantial domestic uranium reserves, but even using domestic 
uranium Iran could not develop and operate enrichment plants for civilian 
purposes more cheaply than it could buy reactor fuel overseas. It could even 
ship domestic uranium to outside countries (like Russia) for bargain basement 
enrichment. Similarly the sale of 2000 tonnes of natural uranium to Iran makes 
no sense for a domestic power program since it must be enriched to be used in 
a light water reactor. This amount of uranium is substantially more than was 
available in the either the US or the Soviet Union when those countries 
developed their first atomic bombs. Iran opposed the renewal of the NPT pact 
in the spring of 1995.

Iran possesses a 5 MW thermal reactor under IAEA safeguards at the Tehran 
Research Center. It has a nuclear research center at Isfahan, and has 
safeguarded hot cells that can be used to develop plutonium processing 
techniques on a laboratory scale. Iran also has a partially completed two 
reactor nuclear power plant at Bushehr on which more than $1 billion was 
spent. This plant was abandoned after Western technology was withdrawn 
following the 1979 Iranian Revolution. Finishing these reactors are part of 
the Russian nuclear project, but may not be technically practical. Iran has 
received a small electromagnetic isotope separation machine from China which, 
while inadequate for a weapon program, will provide experience with the 
technology and could be reverse engineered to allow domestic manufacture. 
China apparently also has deals for uranium processing and fabrication 
facilities.

If Iran indeed has an active nuclear weapons program, it is in a very 
preliminary state. Iran appears to lack the basic technologies and materials 
to initiate an actual development program. Iran clearly has legitimate 
security concerns, in light of the Iraqi attack on Iran that precipitated the 
8-year Iran-Iraq war, and Iraq's own nuclear program. Its hostility to 
nuclear-capable Israel, and being located near the nuclear-capable states of 
Pakistan and India provide additional motivations.

7.3.3  Israel
The genesis of the Israeli nuclear program can be traced to a secret meeting 
on 7 November 1956 between foreign minister Golda Meir, Shimon Peres, and 
French foreign and defense ministers Mssrs. Christian Pineau and Maurice 
Bourges-Manoury. It was held to address an implied nuclear threat made against 
Israel by Soviet premier Bulganin following the joint British, French, and 
Israeli Suez-Sinai operation in October 1956. In this meeting Peres secured 
agreements to assist Israel in developing a nuclear deterrent. After some 
further months of negotiation assistance took the form of a graphite-natural 
uranium plutonium production reactor similar to the French G-1 reactor at 
Marcoule, along with plutonium separation technology. Although nominally given 
a power rating of 24 MW (thermal), it was apparently capable of operation at 
70 MW.

The reactor was built underground at Dimona, in the Negev desert of southern 
Israel. In 1960, before the reactor was operating, France, now under the 
leadership of de Gaulle, reconsidered the deal and decided to suspend the 
project. After several months of negotiation, an agreement was reached in Nov. 
that allowed it to proceed if Israel promised not the make weapons and 
announced the project to the world. 

On 2 December 1960, before Israel could make the announcement, the US State 
Department issued a determination that Israel had a secret nuclear 
installation. By 16 December this was public knowledge. Over the next year the 
relationship between the US and Israel was strained over the issue. Although 
Israel did allow an inspection by physicists Eugene Wigner and I.I. Rabi, PM 
Ben Gurion consistently refused to allow international inspections. The final 
resolution was a commitment from Israel to use the facility for peaceful 
purposes. This pledge has been apparently interpreted by Israel to mean that 
nuclear weapon development is not excluded if the are used strictly for 
defensive, and not aggressive purposes. 

The acquisition of this reactor and related technologies was clearly intended 
for military purposes from the outset (not "dual use"). There is little doubt 
then, that some time in the late sixties Israel became the sixth nation to 
manufacture nuclear weapons. It is believed that the first extraction of 
plutonium occurred in 1965, and that enough plutonium was on hand for one 
weapon during the Six Day War in 1967 (it has also been claimed that a 
plutonium separation plant was not built until 1967). It should be remembered 
that Israel's security position in the late fifties and early sixties when the 
nuclear program was taking shape was far more precarious than it subsequently 
became after the Six Day War, the establishment of a robust domestic arms 
industry, and a reliable defense supply line from the US.  

The principal uncertainty in evaluating Israel's weapon production capability 
is the actual power level of the Dimona reactor. It has long been believed 
that Israel has upgraded the reactor repeatedly to increase its plutonium 
production. The only inside account of the program from a publically named 
source is that of Mordecai Vanunu, whose story was published by the London 
Sunday Times on 5 October 1986. Vanunu was a mid-level technician at Dimona 
for 9 years, who claimed that Israel possessed 100-200 nuclear weapons 
(implying some 400-800 kg of plutonium) and can produce 40 kg of plutonium a 
year. This production figure indicates an average operating power of 150 MW 
thermal. A study by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute 
(SIPRI) produced a somewhat lower range of estimates, concluding that Israel 
has produced 240-415 Kg of plutonium through 1991, enough for a stockpile of 
60-100 efficient weapons. 

Vanunu also claimed that Israel possessed fusion boosted weapons, and has 
developed hydrogen bomb technology. The Israeli production of tritium has been 
confirmed by South Africa, which received a shipment of 30 g of tritium in the 
late 1970s. This clearly indicates tritium production on a scale sufficient 
for a weapon boosting program. In fact, it is difficult to find any other 
rationale for such a large tritium production capability.

Israel produces uranium domestically as a by-product of phosphate mining near 
the Dead Sea. It is also known to have purchased natural uranium on the world 
market under an alias.

Israel can undoubtedly deploy nuclear weapons using its capable air force. 
Israel also possesses medium-range ballistic missiles: the Jericho-I (Ya-1) 
with a 500 kg payload, and a range of 480-650 km; and the Jericho II (Ya-2) 
with a 1000 kg payload and a range of over 1500 km (operational since 1990). 
Under development is the Jericho-IIB with a range of 2,500 km. These missiles 
were almost certainly developed specifically as nuclear delivery systems. The 
Jericho I and II are deployed in the central Judean highland (and have imaged 
in recent years by commercial satellites). According to a recent issue of 
Jane's World Air Force, Israel has three Jericho-equipped missile squadrons 
based near Sderot Micha, 45 kilometers southeast of Tel Aviv. From this 
location the Jericho-I missile can reach such targets as Damascus, Aleppo, and 
Cairo. The Jericho-II can reach any part of Syria or Iraq, and as far as 
Tehran, and Benghazi, Libya. The Jericho-IIB will be able to reach any part of 
Libya or Iran, and as far as southern Russia.

Israel has taken active steps to prevent nations that are officially at war 
with it from acquiring nuclear capabilities. The bombing of the Osiraq reactor 
in Iraq in 1981 is the most famous case, but an earlier sabotage of the 
reactor core in France prior to shipment is probably attributable to Mossad.

Israel's official policy is that it will not be the first nation to introduce 
nuclear weapons into the Middle East. In contrast to the coy hinting of some 
undeclared weapon's states, Israel thus actively denies possessing nuclear 
weapons. Its obvious capability in this regard has thus established de facto 
deterrence, while minimizing (but not eliminating) domestic and international 
controversy. 

7.3.4  Libya
Despite having signed the NPT in 1975, Col. Qaddafi has openly declared an 
intention to develop nuclear weapons. There is little evidence of progress in 
this quest however.

Libya operates a 10 MW thermal research reactor at the Tajoura Research 
Center. This is a Soviet supplied light water/highly enriched uranium type 
that is subject to IAEA safeguards.

7.3.5  North Korea
North Korea appears to have begun an active program of weapon development in 
1980, when the construction of a small natural uranium-graphite power reactor 
began at Yongbyon, 100 km north of Pyongyang. Intelligence revealed the 
project in 1984, prior to its operation in 1986. The reactor is based on 1950s 
MAGNOX technology (graphite moderator, aluminum-magnesium clad natural uranium 
fuel, CO2 gas cooling) which is very good for producing weapon grade plutonium 
as a byproduct. After startup problems, it was operating at 20-30 MW by 1990.

A larger 50 MW MAGNOX-type reactor is under construction at Yongbyon with a 
completion date in 1995. A 200 MW of the same design is under construction at 
Taechon, 60 miles north of Pyongyang (completion is possible as early as the 
beginning of 1996), and a 600-800 MW reactor is also underway at Taechon 
(completion possible by 1997). The largest of these reactors could produce 
180-230 Kg of plutonium a year, enough for 30-40 weapons. It is almost 
certainly intended for power production, but the potential for dual use 
exists. 

A large secret plutonium separation facility was built at Yongbyon early in 
the 1980s capable of handling several hundreds of tons of fuel a year, enough 
to handle fuel from all of the reactors. The existence of this plant was 
discovered through intelligence in 1989. 

A small radiochemical laboratory in located in Pyongyang, built with Soviet 
aid in the 1970s. Small quantities of plutonium were separated there in 1975 
from Soviet-supplied irradiated fuel.

Under pressure from the Soviet Union, North Korea joined Non-Proliferation 
Treaty on 12/12/85, and told the IAEA of the existence of the Yongbyon 
facility. On 5/4/92 North Korea made its initial declaration of its holdings 
of nuclear material. During an inspection by the IAEA soon after to verify 
this declaration, North Korea revealed that it had separated 100 g of 
plutonium in March 1990. Subsequent analysis of the composition of samples 
allowed the IAEA to determine that more plutonium had been separated than the 
North Korean had admitted. The plutonium samples examined by the IAEA had a 
composition of 97.5% Pu-239, and 2.5% Pu-240. This indicates a fuel burnup of 
330 MW/days at the time of removal, indicating 16 kg of plutonium existed in 
the reactor core at the time. This implies that it had operated about 45% of 
the time (assuming a 25 MW operating level) since fuel was first loaded. 
Requests for additional inspections led North Korea to announce its withdrawal 
from the NPT on 3/12/93. 

North Korea did not actually withdraw from NPT, but tense negotiations 
continued over the next year during which N. Korea refused to comply with the 
treaty. On 4/8/94 N. Korea shut down its reactor in preparation for refueling. 
Up to this time N. Korea had kept the original load of fuel in the reactor (it 
said), the earlier separations were allegedly from damaged fuel rods that had 
been replaced. On 5/12/94 North Korea finally began unloading the 50 tonnes of 
irradiated fuel from its reactor. If the earlier operating regime had been 
followed, the fuel contains some 32 kg of weapon-grade plutonium (5-6 bombs 
worth), although 25 kg is considered more probable. The range of plausible 
estimates is 17-33 Kg. The maximum possible amount (assuming unrealistic 
operating conditions: full power for 80% of the time) is 53 Kg. So far this 
fuel has not been reprocessed.

The CIA believes that North Korea removed up to half of the fuel during a 1989 
shutdown. Assuming 55% operation up to this time, this implies 7-14 Kg of 
plutonium was removed. This fuel may have been reprocessed, and would supply 
sufficient plutonium for 1 or possibly 2 bombs. 

The economy of North Korea had begun collapsing in the early 1990s following 
the cut off of Soviet and Chinese aid. In the spring of 1994, elderly and 
ailing Great Leader Kim Il Sung revised long standing policy and signalled 
increasing accomodation with the West. As a result of a diplomatic mission by 
Jimmy Carter, Kim agreed to compromise on the North Korean nuclear program. 
Kim died soon after this meeting, but North Korea generally continues to 
adhere to his policies.

In the fall of 1994 North Korea agreed to suspend its nuclear program in 
exchange for a $4.5 billion assistance program to build two safeguarded light 
water power reactors (1000 Mwe each), after complex negotiations with the US. 
Most of the funding would be supplied by Japan, the reactors themselves would 
be built by South Korea. This agreement required that all reactor and 
reprocessing plant work be halted, that all irradiated fuel remain under 
safeguards, and that North Korea's domestic reactors eventually be dismantled. 
The situation remained tense over the next several months with North Korea 
refusing to implement this agreement, and Dear Leader Kim Jong Il making 
ambivalent statements. It did not resume its nuclear activities however, and 
as the economic situation grew increasingly desperate agreed to allow foreign 
rice in to the country to relieve famine. On 13 June 1995, North Korea 
officially endorsed the nuclear pact with the US.

7.3.6  Pakistan
On Feb. 7, 1992 Pakistani Foreign Minister Shahryrar Khan stated in an 
interview with the Washington Post that Pakistan had the components to 
assemble one or more nuclear weapons. This goes farther than statements from 
any other "non-weapon state" in admitting to the existence of a nuclear 
arsenal. Pakistan had previously admitted to having fabricated pits for 
fission weapons. In July 1993 General (retired) Mirza Aslam Beg, former army 
chief of staff, claimed that Pakistan had tested a nuclear device. Since no 
information about an actual nuclear explosion has come to light, this 
presumably refers to a hydronuclear (zero-yield) test of a design.

The Pakistani program is based on an indigenously constructed centrifuge 
uranium enrichment plant, using technology misappropriated from the European 
uranium centrifuge consortium URENCO (Britain, Germany, and the Netherlands 
are the participants). The program began in great secrecy the 1970s after the 
Indian test of a nuclear device in 1974. Serious work commencing in 1976 with 
the establishment of the Engineering Research Laboratories (ERL).

The intelligence gathering at URENCO was apparently conducted by Dr. Abdul 
Qader Khan, a Pakistani metallurgist. He was employed from 1972 to 1975 by 
Ultra-Centrifuge Nederland (UCN) the Dutch partner in the URENCO consortium 
where he worked with two early centrifuge designs, the CNOR and SNOR machines. 
In 1974 UCN asked Khan to translate classified design documents for two 
advanced German machines, the G-1 and G-2. He left Europe before his espionage 
was detected and assumed technical leadership of the program at ERL. Due to 
his efforts, the slow recognition of the program by western intelligence, and 
the weak export controls at the time, Pakistan made relatively rapid progress 
in developing U-235 production capability. In recognition of Khan's 
contributions the ERL was renamed the A.Q. Khan Research Laboratories by Pres. 
Zia ul-Haq in 1981. He was convicted of espionage in the Netherlands in 1983 
in absentia and sentenced to four years in prison. The conviction was later 
overturned in 1985 for failure to properly deliver a summons to him.

During the late 70s and early 80s, a number of Pakistani agents were arrested 
trying to violate export control laws in the west. In 1984 three Pakistani 
nationals were indicted in the US for attempting to smuggle out 50 krytrons 
(high speed switches suitable for implosion detonation systems), and in 1987 
the purchase of US maraging steel was attempted. Large quantities of materials 
were successfully purchased without being detected, including a German uranium 
hexafluoride manufacturing plant.

By 1980 a number of centrifuges were believed to be operating in Pakistan. By 
the late 1980s Pakistan was publishing technical articles about centrifuge 
design, flaunting their capability and placing design details, previously 
secret, in the public domain. This includes an 1987 article co-authored by A. 
Q. Khan on balancing sophisticated ultracentrifuge rotors.

The uranium enrichment facility is the Kahuta gas centrifuge plant near 
Islamabad. This facility began operating in the early 1980s, but suffered 
serious start up problems. It is believed that China offered significant 
technical assistance in exchange for URENCO technology, but the exact form of 
assistance is unknown. Dr. Khan announced that Kahuta was producing low 
enriched uranium in 1984. US intelligence believes that uranium enrichment 
exceeded 5% in 1985, and that production of highly enriched uranium was 
achieved in 1986. At that time Pakistan had reportedly manufactured 14000 
centrifuges, but had only 1000 operating. By 1991 about 3000 machines were 
operating according to US intelligence. This implies a production capacity of 
45-100 kg U-235/year depending on the tails concentration and production 
efficiency, enough for 3-7 implosion weapons. Shahryar Khan has said that the 
cost of Kahuta was relatively modest, less than $150 million.

Pakistan has operated its plant intermittently. PM Benazir Bhutto halted 
production in June 1989 prior to a trip the US. Production was resumed in 
early 1990 following border clashes with India, and continued until sometime 
in 1991. SIPRI estimates that Pakistan had acquired 120-220 Kg of enriched 
uranium by the end of 1991 (8-15 weapons).

Pakistan has built a second enrichment plant at Golra, 6 miles from Islamabad. 
It is expected to be even larger than Kahuta, with more advanced centrifuges. 
It may not yet have begun production though due to difficulty in obtaining the 
necessary parts now. In March 1996 the New York Times reported that last year 
China had sold Pakistan 5000 ring magnets suitable for use in gas centrifuges.

Pakistan is developing weapons-related nuclear technology in other areas as 
well. It has a pilot plutonium reprocessing plant called "New Labs" at the 
Pinstech complex near Rawalpindi. Currently Pakistan's known reactors are all 
safeguarded by the IAEA, and thus unavailable for use in a weapons program. 
Pakistan is known to have been developing a "swimming pool" reactor in the 
late 80s using domestically produced enriched uranium fuel, which may already 
be in operation. Pakistan is also manufacturing reactor-grade graphite, 
presumably for a natural uranium plutonium production reactor. It currently 
possesses one power reactor with an output of 137 MW electrical. A 300 MWe 
pressurized water reactor for electricity which is under construction by the 
China National Nuclear Corporation at Chashma.

It has been reported recently that a 50 MWe "multi purpose" heavy-water 
reactor, entirely constructed by Pakistani engineers, has been completed near 
Khusab, in Punjab.It is said to be used for isotope production for export and 
for doping silica for use in solar energy applications. This has since been 
dismissed as "inaccurate and baseless" by Pakistani sources, but a "small 
experimental reactor" at Khusab was reportedly acknowledged by PM Bhutto
last year as being "tied into our nuclear power plant from China".

Pakistan probably has not produced Po-210, required for Po/Be neutron 
initiators, since this would require illegal use of its IAEA safeguarded 
reactors. It is known to have smuggled 0.8 g of tritium gas from Germany in 
1987. This would allow the manufacture of several tritium initiators. During 
the trial of Rudolf Ortmayer 1n 1990, the source of much of the recent data on 
Pakistan's nuclear program, it was revealed that Pakistan was acquiring 
technology for tritium production. It is likely that they are pursuing fusion 
boosting designs for their weapons.

They are believed to possess implosion weapon designs. Reportedly Pakistan 
received from China the design used in its fourth tested weapon, exploded in 
1966. This is said to be a low weight (200 kg class) solid-core bomb design. 
Pakistan is known to have conducted a large number of explosive tests related 
to it nuclear weapons program. Undoubtedly a tested implosion system has been 
developed, and cold implosion testing (i.e. without nuclear yield) using 
uranium cores has probably been conducted. Zero-yield testing using enriched 
uranium (with a small nuclear yield equal to several Kg) is also possible (see 
Gen Beg's remarks above). Pakistan probably acquired the ability to build a 
nuclear weapon soon in 1986, or soon after.

Pakistan has missiles capable of carrying nuclear weapons. Currently the HATF 
2 (500 kg payload) and the M-11/DF-11 (800 kg payload) are in service - both 
with ranges of 300 km. The M-11 was acquired from China. The HATF-3 is under 
development with a range of 600 km and a payload of 500 kg. On 13 June 1996 
the Washington Post quoted a leaked CIA draft document as saying Pakistan had 
"probably finished developing nuclear warheads" for Chinese-supplied M-11 
missiles. If true, it may indicate Chinese assistance minaturizing the warhead 
design.

7.4	States Formerly Possessing or Pursuing Nuclear Weapons</h3><pre>
These are nations known to have initiated serious nuclear weapons programs, 
with varying degrees of success. All of them now would be regarded as 
currently no longer actively developing, or possessing, nuclear arms. 

7.4.1   Argentina
Argentina began a serious program to acquire nuclear weapons under military 
rule in 1978 when it was not a signatory to NPT. The centerpiece of this 
effort was a successful secret program to develop domestic gaseous diffusion 
technology. The existence of this technology, and the enrichment plant built 
at Pilcaniyeu, were successfully concealed until it was revealed by the 
Alfonsin government, shortly after the restoration of civilian rule in 1983. 
Though designed to produce highly enriched uranium, the plant has reportedly 
only been used to produce low enriched uranium and remains uncompleted.

Argentina has significant plutonium production capabilities as well. It 
operates the pressurized heavy water reactor Atucha I. It has built a 
plutonium separation pilot plant at Ezeiza, also begun by the Galtieri 
military government in 1978. It was designed to produce 15 kg of plutonium a 
year, and has been recently commissioned to process 5 tonnes of heavy metal 
fuel/yr. Argentina operates 3 power reactors with a combined output of 1750 MW 
electrical (about 14% of total production capacity in 1994), and has plans for 
a large scale civilian reactor program over the next 20-30 years. 

Historically Argentina has had rivalries with both Chile and Brazil. 
Skirmishes have been fought with Chile over territorial disputes, although 
Brazil has usually been viewed as the greater potential threat. Argentina and 
Brazil have recently reached agreement on opening and demilitarizing much of 
their nuclear programs, and on joint nuclear technology development. Argentina 
has now placed its nuclear technology program under international safeguards 
although it has not signed NPT or the Treaty of Tlatelolco.

7.4.2   Brazil
Brazil began a program to acquire nuclear weapons in 1978 under military rule. 
Although civilian government was restored in 1985, the military remains a 
powerful and largely autonomous force (unlike the discredited military of 
Argentina). Substantial military nuclear development has thus continued. 

Brazil has a two track nuclear program, an open civilian program and a secret 
military program (which undoubtedly draws on the technology and expertise of 
the civilian component). The civilian program is under IAEA safeguards and is 
managed by the state-owned Brazilian Nuclear Corporation (Nuclebras). In 1989 
Brazil had one power reactor with an output of 657 MW electrical, and was 
building or planning to build 4 more with a combined electrical output of 5236 
MW.

Nuclebras began participating in uranium enrichment technology development 
with URENCO, and German companies developing nozzle separation techniques. 
Throughout most of the 1980s Brazil attempted to develop indigenous centrifuge 
technology, and announced in 1987 that it had succeeded in constructing a 
pilot facility at IPEN near Sao Paulo. A much larger plant has since been 
constructed at the Aramar Research Center near Ipero. Brazil apparently 
possesses the capability of enriching uranium to weapon-grade levels but it is 
not known to have done so.

A laboratory scale plutonium separation plant has been built at IPEN, and a 
heavy water production plant has been built.

Like Argentina, it has not signed NPT or the Treaty of Tlatelolco.

7.4.3   Iraq
Iraq's status as a "former weapons developing state" is of course purely 
involuntary. The international inspections and pressure put on Iraq after its 
crushing defeat in Desert Storm have allowed much of its previous nuclear 
program to be revealed and dismantled. The discoveries made after the war 
surprised intelligence agencies and analysts around the world, and called into 
question how effective monitoring of nuclear programs has been. Iraq has 
continued to conceal information and technology whenever possible. It has 
never released the sources of its illegally imported nuclear technology, and 
significant pieces of equipment are known to be missing. Presumably Iraq 
continues to pursue nuclear ambitions, but under the continuing UN 
import/export restrictions, its ability to pursue them are limited.

Iraqi equivalent of the Los Alamos laboratory was its nuclear development 
complex at Al Atheer, 40 km south of Baghdad. This facility and the adjacent 
Al Hateen high-explosive facility, was blown up under UN supervision on 
4/14/92. Documents show that it was the intended center for nuclear weapons 
development. This state-of-the-art research facility included a 15000 m^2 
uranium metallurgy plant, a HE test firing bunker, internal explosion test 
chambers, a tungsten carbide production facility (usable perhaps for a weapon 
tamper material), and large amounts of dual use test, measuring, and 
fabrication equipment.

The principal component of Iraq's nuclear program was a uranium enrichment 
program based on electromagnetic separation technology using calutrons. That 
this technology was being developed was unknown prior to the international 
inspections following Desert Storm, and was a major surprise.

Calutron technology was acquired and developed during the early to mid 1980s. 
Calutrons were built and operated at Tuwaitha and Tarmiya. A plan was underway 
to build a large enrichment facility at Tarmiya sufficient to produce 0.5 
weapons a year, using natural uranium feed, but this program was progressing 
more slowly than planned. A captured 1987 report shows that Iraq had planned 
to install 70 alpha (first stage) calutrons, and 20 beta (final stage) 
calutrons during 8/89-12/92. Actually just 8 alpha machines had been installed 
during 2/90-9/90. This was about 10 months behind schedule. Iraq was preparing 
to install another 17 alpha machines in January 1991, a process that would 
have taken months, but the installation was halted by the initiation of 
hostilities. No beta machines were ready for installation although 4 were due 
to have been installed by 10/90. 

According to the original plan, the calutrons would have begun operating as 
they were installed. Using natural uranium as the feedstock these would have 
produced the first 15 kg of 93% uranium, enough for one bomb, by the time the 
installation of the last machine was complete. Alternatively, if 2.5% low 
enriched uranium was used as feedstock, the first 15 kg would have been ready 
in 24 months.  The annual production rate for the completed facility would 
have been 7 kg/yr using natural uranium feed. In fact, the installed calutrons 
had not yet begun operation. Given an approximate one year delay for the 
calutron production program, and assuming Iraq would have no further 
difficulties in reaching full production capability, Iraq could have produced 
15 kg of weapon-grade uranium as early as the beginning of 1994. Using the 
1763 kg of IAEA safeguarded 2.6% uranium that Iraq possessed, this could have 
been advanced by a year but would have almost certainly alerted the 
international community before the material was ready. In all likelihood 
though, these estimates are too optimistic. Iraq had operated calutrons on an 
experimental basis, and had no experience with a large scale production 
operation. Additional time would have been necessary to work out problems, and 
build up operating capacity. Recent reports indicate tha Iraq regards the 
calutron program as a disappointing failure and is unlikely to pursue this 
technology further.

Centrifuge technology was also actively pursued. While unable to aquire 
centrifuge design Pakistan-style through intelligence activity, Iraq appears 
to have been able to purchase them on a clandestine "gray market". A German 
formerly employed by URENCO was hired to improve the purchased design. 

Iraq is now known to possess both centrifuge designs and significant 
centrifuge technology. Information about Iraqi centrifuge designs and 
knowledge is due primarily to Bruno Stemmler, a German ex-employee of MAN 
Technologie of Munich, which is an important partner in URENCO. In 1988 he was 
recruited by Walter Busse, another German centrifuge expert, and in 1988 and 
1989 he travelled to Iraq and provided technology and consultation services to 
the Iraqi centrifuge program (both were arrested in 1989 in Germany). While in 
Iraq he saw designs based on the German G-1 centrifuge which may have been 
obtained from Pakistan or Busse. Stemmler provided help in many areas of 
centrifuge design and manufacturing, including oil bearings, various aspects 
of rotor tube and baffle design, and oxidation treatment of steel rotors, 
although he denies providing classified information and has not been charged.

Centrifuge test stands were constructed and operated at Tuwaitha, Rashidiya, 
and Al Furat using maraging steel rotors. Poor quality rotors were 
manufactured at Factory 10, near Baghdad. A better plant was under 
construction at Al Furat, which also was planned to receive a 100 centrifuge 
pilot enrichment cascade. Iraq is believed to have imported 400 tonnes of 
maraging steel for rotor construction, although only 100 tonnes were located 
by inspectors. Iraq was found to have carbon fiber rotors, an even more 
advanced material. Later investigation showed that 20 carbon fiber rotors had 
been supplied to Iraq by the German company RO-SCH Verbundwerstoff GmbH. 
Several years of work would have been required before Iraq could have begun 
constructing centrifuges suitable for an enrichment program.

Plutonium separation technology was developed at Tuwaitha during the 1970s. 
This portion of the program was abandoned after the Israeli bombing in 1981. 
Iraq has declared that 5 g of plutonium was separated at Tuwaitha.

Iraq also investigated chemical enrichment technology to partially enrich 
uranium to serve as calutron feed. A combination of the French Chemex and the 
Japanese Ashi methods were expected to produce 6-8% enriched U-235.

In 1990 Iraqi agents were detected attempting to obtain krytrons in the US.

After the 8 August 1995 defection of Lt. Gen. Hussein Kamel Majid, son-in-law 
to Saddam Hussein, and former director of weapon procurement, Iraq revealed 
that during the Gulf conflict in 1990-91, it had initiated a crash development 
program to manufacture a single nuclear weapon using highly enriched uranium 
fuel intended for its internationally safeguarded Tammuz test reactor. The 
plan was to complete the atomic bomb during the spring of 1991. Unirradiated 
and low-irradiated fuel was actually unloaded and some fuel elements later 
turned over to UN inspectors show signs of tampering. Iraq had 12.3 kg or 93% 
U-235, and 33.1 kg of 80% U-235 available that was unirradiated or had low 
radiation levels and could have been easily processed. With the start of 
hostilities in January these plans were aborted.

Early in 1996, the former Lt. Gen. Majid returned to Iraq under a personal 
guarantee of safety from Saddam Hussein. He was murdered two days later.

7.4.4 South Africa
This is the only nation known to have developed nuclear weapons, and then 
voluntarily relinquished that capability. On 24 March 1993 Pres. F. W. De 
Klerk announced that South Africa had produced nuclear weapons, but had 
destroyed their arsenal before 10 July 1991, when South Africa joined the NPT. 
He subsequently released other details about the program.

The South African program began in the mid-1970s, after large scale 
intervention in central and southern Africa by the Cuban military began. The 
apparent motivation was as a hedge against Soviet-sponsored aggression. The 
strategy was to use these weapons as leverage with Western powers - 
demonstrating their existence, and then threatening to resort to nuclear 
attack if assistance was not provided. The decision to abandon its nuclear 
arsenal was motivated by the end of Cold War intervention, and the prospect of 
reintegrating with the world if and when Apartheid was abandoned. The decision 
to completely destroy weapons related technology and information may have been 
made in part to keep nuclear weapons out of the hands any future black-lead 
government.

South Africa developed a unique technology for enriching U-235 called UCOR 
during the 1960s and 70s based on aerodynamic forces produced by vortex tubes. 
Research on weapons began in 1971, and in 1974 the decision was made to 
develop and manufacture nuclear weapons. The design adopted was a gun-assembly 
bomb using U-235.

The first bomb, an experimental device loaded with 80% enriched U-235, named 
"Melba" was completed in 1980. This device was used in one zero-yield test, 
the only nuclear test of the entire program.

The first "deliverable" device ("it could be kicked out he back of a plane"), 
and the second device built, was ready in April 1982. This was considered a 
"pre-qualification device".

The final weapon design was a 65 cm by 1.8 m air-deliverable bomb weighing 
about 1000 kg. It used 55 kg of 90% enriched U-235 and had an estimated yield 
of 10-18 Kt (this is 1.0-1.8% efficient). This implies a very conservative and 
reliable, but inefficient, design. It used tungsten as a reflector. If it were 
loaded with 80% U-235, this would have been 5-9 Kt. This weapon had stringent 
safety and reliability standards, and a large proportion of the program's 
effort went into this aspect. The first was built in August 1987, and was the 
first truly weaponized device made. Only four devices of this type were built. 
When the program was terminated in 1990, a seventh was under construction 
(non-nuclear components only). This is really a deliverable inventory of only 
4-5 bombs.

The enrichment plant, the Y Plant at Valindaba, had an effective capacity of 
around 60 kg of 90% U-235 a year, 120 kg/yr by design (12,000-24,000 
separative work units or SWUs, assuming 0.3% tails assay), and was shut down 
in Feb. 1990. Part of this capacity was used for low enriched uranium for the 
two reactors of the Koeberg power plant (capacity 1930 MW electrical), and to 
supply 45% enriched material to the Safari 1 experimental reactor. The 
enrichment plant was commissioned in 1974, began producing highly enriched 
uranium in 1978, and by late 1979 had made enough 80% U-235 (55 kg) for Melba. 
It had initial production problems, and was closed from 8/79 to 7/81, but 
operated successfully thereafter. The total production of enriched uranium 
(above 80%) was 400 kg, it is believed that about 150-200 kg of 45% enriched 
uranium exists. The equipment for the final stages of separation was 
subsequently dismantled. 

The bomb program was managed by the national armament company Armscor, now 
privatized and called Denel. The bombs were developed at the Advena Central 
Laboratory, 15 km east of the Pelindaba facility operated by the South African 
Atomic Energy Commission.

In the early 1980s, the program employed about 100 people, of which only about 
40 were directly involved in the weapons program and only about 20 actually 
built the devices. The rest were involved in administrative support and 
security. By the time the program was canceled in 1989, the work force had 
risen to 300, with about half directly involved in weapons work.

By the end of the program they could produce two to three weapons a year. At 
that point, the annual operating expenditures were about 20-25 million rand, 
or about $5.9-7.4 million at today's exchange rate. In the early 1980s, the 
annual budget was about 10 million rand, or about $2.9 million.

The facilities and level of technology available at Advena appear much more 
sophisticated than a gun-type design would require. By the end of the program 
South Africa was investigating implosion designs, starting in the mid 80s. 
They considered a cost of a cold implosion test facility (natural uranium 
core, no nuclear reaction) to be essential for proving the implosion design. 
It was estimated at $3.5 million and was never built. Implosion designs would 
have halved the amount of material needed per bomb, and thus doubled their 
arsenal, while increasing the yield.

Advena had also investigated using tritium to boost its existing weapons, but 
no plans to do so were ever approved. The yield would have been increased to 
100 Kt (10% efficiency). Since it now offers custom explosive lens products 
for commercial and military use, it is apparent that South Africa has mastered 
the necessary technologies for producing efficient implosion bombs. 

South Africa has large indigenous uranium reserves, currently estimated at 
some 144,000 tonnes of U3O8 (at a production cost less than US$66/kg). South 
Africa's nuclear power plants provide about 6% of electricity consumed.

7.4.5   South Korea
South Korea began a nuclear weapons program in the early 1970s, which was 
believed abandoned after signing NPT in 1975. It may have been continued by 
the military government until 1978 however. In 1984-5 South Korea attempted to 
participate in a plutonium extraction program with Canada, as part of its own 
civilian nuclear power program. This participation was halted under US 
pressure. South Korea builds its own civilian nuclear power plants, and is 
planning on supplying them to North Korea. In 1989 it operated 9 power 
reactors producing 7700 MW electrical (50% of national needs), with plans for 
5 more with a capacity of 4500 MWe. By 1995 this had increased to 10 reactors 
operating.

7.4.6   Sweden
During the 50s and 60s Sweden developed considerable nuclear expertise - 
developing reactor technology and building nuclear power plants. Sweden 
seriously investigated nuclear weapons from the mid 1950s into the 1960s. A 
very substantial research effort into the fundamental technical issues of 
weapon design and manufacture was conducted. By the mid-1960s this effort had 
supplied sufficient knowledge to allow Sweden to begin immediate manufacture 
of fairly sophisticated weapons. Faced with this decision, Sweden decided not 
to pursue a weapon production program. 

In 1989 Sweden operated 12 power reactors producing 10130 MW electrical (45% 
of its total electricity), by 1994 this had risen to 51%. A previous 
referendum that voted to eliminate nuclear power by 2010 seems to have become 
moot in the face of economic reality.

7.4.7   Switzerland
In 1995 previously secret studies into nuclear weapons and plans for 
deployment came to light. A scientific group had been formed in 1946 with the 
objective of studying the civil use of atomic energy and (secret order) to 
also study the scientific and technical bases for building nuclear weapons. 
The activity of this group was rather low and only slow progress was made. In 
1960 the first nuclear reactor (a heavy water test reactor) was built.

In the early sixties the military joint staff planned to have about 100 bombs 
(60-100 Kt), 50 artillery shells (5 Kt) and 100 rockets (100 Kt) within the 
next 15 years, at costs of about 750 million Swiss francs. There were plans 
for 7 underground nuclear tests in 'uninhabited regions' of Switzerland. These 
plans were blocked by the government and the activities remained at a very low 
level. After 1970, many of the planning generals were no longer in their 
positions and the planning ceased more or less. In the fall of 1995, the group 
formed in 1946 was officially dismissed. 

Switzerland has five power reactors with a combined capacity of 3049 MW 
(electrical), providing 40% of the nation's power.

7.4.8   Taiwan
Taiwan ratified the NPT in 1970, but apparently began a preliminary nuclear 
weapon program in the mid-80s. It began constructing a laboratory scale 
plutonium separation facility in 1987. Work was halted in 1988 under US 
pressure. Taiwan also agreed to stop operating a 40 MW (electrical) Canadian 
heavy water research reactor. Weapons-related work appears to have been 
discontinued. By 1988 Taiwan had accumulated 85 tonnes of irradiated fuel from 
this reactor containing 85 kg of plutonium, enough for 20 bombs. This material 
is under IAEA safeguards. In 1989 Taiwan had 6 power reactors producing 5144 
MW electrical (35% of national needs), with plans for 2 more for an additional 
2000 MW.

<HR><a name=nfaq7.5></a><h3>
7.5      Other Nuclear Capable States</h3><pre>
In August 1996 there were 439 nuclear power plants in 32 countries, supplying 
17% of the world's electricity (347,000 MW electrical capacity; 2228 trillion 
watt-hours total in 1995). There are 32 power reactors under construction in 
12 countries (adding about 7 percent to existing capacity), and those ordered 
or planned would add a further 19 percent. Currently the growth rate in 
nuclear power production is about 4.5% a year (mostly due to improved 
operations of existing reactors). The continuing industrialization of Asia 
(and China in particular), coupled with the basically flat supply of petroleum 
and pressure to restrict fossil fuel burning in general, seems to assure 
continued strong expansion of worldwide nuclear power over the next few 
decades. Some fifteen countries derive 30% or more than of their electricity 
from nuclear power. There are also more than 310 research reactors operating 
worldwide in 54 countries, with more under construction. 

The worlds power reactors consume the equivalent of require 60,000 tonnes of 
uranium each year. The total amount of plutonium produced worldwide is about 
1270 tonnes at present (mostly unseparated), and is accumulating at 70 tonnes 
per year. It is estimated that civilian plutonium separation programs will 
produce 190,000 Kg of plutonium during the 1990s.

Virtually any industrialized nation today has the technical capability to 
develop nuclear weapons within several years if the decision to do so were 
made. Nations already possessing substantial nuclear technology and arms 
industries could do so in no more than a year or two. The larger industrial 
nations (Japan and Germany for example) could, within several years of 
deciding to do so, build arsenals rivaling those planned by Russia and the US 
for the turn of the millennium following the implementation of START II.

It is also very likely that most any country with advanced military 
capabilities system will have undertaken design work in nuclear weapons to 
some extent. This is almost mandatory for national security reasons, if only 
to provide indigenous expertise in evaluating intelligence and projecting the 
capabilities of possible foes.

Accordingly I will only briefly mention below some notable capabilities of 
possessed by certain states that could potentially be turned to the 
development of nuclear arsenals if they chose.

Australia
From the 1950s to 1971 Australia produced uranium, primarily for the US and UK 
weapons programs. When the deposits being mined were exhausted, production and 
exports ceased.

Large new deposits were opened for production in the late 1970s, this time 
only for civilian use under international safeguards. However since uranium is 
being exported to France, which does not separate its civilian and military 
nuclear programs, the exports are still supporting at least one nuclear 
weapons program.

Actual production began in 1981 and during the last decade Australia has 
become one of the world's largest producers of uranium. From mid-1985 to mid-
1995 it exported 43,000 tonnes of U3O8 (uranium content 36,000 tonnes) worth 
almost A$3 billion, an average of 10% of world production (currently 7%). 
Australia has the worlds largest low cost uranium reserves, about 27% of the 
world's estimated reserves, with 928,000 tonnes of U3O8 at a production cost 
of US less than $80/kg U (May 1995).

Curiously for an industrialized nation that is also a major uranium supplier, 
Australia has no nuclear power plants. It has one 10 MW (thermal) research 
reactor.

Canada
Canada has a well developed nuclear technology base, centered around its 
domestically developed civilian CANDU (CANadian Deuterium Uranium) power 
reactor technology and large uranium reserves. CANDU reactors are heavy water 
designs that are fueled by natural uranium dioxide. The fuel is typically 
subjected to 7500 MWD/tonne burnup, which makes the plutonium produced reactor 
grade although they could be operated to produce weapon grade Pu. These 
reactors also produce 250-500 g of tritium a year as a byproduct. In 1995 
Canada operated 21 power reactors. 19 of these are at three locations in 
Ontario with a combined capacity of 13300 MW electrical, and a further reactor 
each in Quebec and New Brunswick. Canada produces 19% of its electricity from 
nuclear power.

Canada was the first nation in the western hemisphere to build a heavy water 
plant (the Trail Plant during WWII, which was only the second heavy water 
plant ever built). It has produced all of the heavy water used in its 
reactors. Since demand and production has declined in recent years, currently 
only one D2O production facility remains in operation. Canada exports heavy 
water under IAEA safeguards. 

A total of 13 CANDU reactors have been sold to Pakistan, India, Argentina, 
South Korea and Romania, along with the engineering expertise to build and 
operate them. 

Canada has one conversion facility that produces UF6 for export, with a 
capacity of 10,500 tonnes U per year. Two fuel fabrication plants produce 1700 
tonnes U per year for the country's own reactors.

The Canadian nuclear industry is responsible for providing 30,000 direct jobs 
(2000 of these in mining) and a further 10,000 indirect jobs.

Canada is currently the world's largest producer of uranium, accounting for 
32% of world production (1995). In 1995 it produced 12,351 tonnes of U3O8 
(10,473 tonnes U). About 20 per cent of Canada's uranium production is 
domestically consumed. Based on new explorations, reserves are now estimated 
(January 1996) at 484,000 tonnes of uranium at a production cost of under 
US$72.70/kg (14% of world reserves, third largest after Australia and 
Kazakhstan).

Germany
Germany has a robust nuclear industry capable of manufacturing reactors, 
enriching uranium, fuel fabrication, and fuel reprocessing. During the 1980s 
Germany was a leading exporter of nuclear technology, sometimes with 
unfortunate results as its sales to Iraq demonstrated.

It operates 23 power reactors producing 24000 MW electrical, 35% of its total 
electrical needs. The reactors in the former East Germany have all been shut 
down.

Germany has recently abandoned plans for fuel reprocessing and the use of 
plutonium in domestic reactors. A planned commerical reprocessing plant has 
been cancelled, and its existing breeder reactors are being reconfigured as 
plutonium burners. Due to reprocessing done elsewhere, Germany will own 48 
tonnes of separated reactor grade plutonium by the year 2000.

Several German companies are key participants in the tri-national URENCO 
uranium enrichment consortium that developed gas centrifuge technology. 
Germany also holds exclusive control of domestically developed nozzle 
enrichment technology. 

As is true of Japan, Germany has an advanced science and technology base 
capable of supporting an aggressive nuclear program should it be deemed 
necessary to do so. Although hard information about this is lacking, it is 
likely that Germany has undertaken advanced design work on a full range of 
nuclear weapon types. As noted at the beginning of this sub-section, this 
would be almost mandatory for national security reasons if only to create a 
base of expertise for conducting intelligence assessments of the nuclear 
programs of other nations.

Japan
Japan has a very aggressive nuclear power program, and is developing plutonium 
as a reactor fuel in a big way. Japan is maintains an active breeder reactor 
program and expects to institute a plutonium energy economy with full 
reprocessing after the year 2000.

Overall Japan has an extremely advanced civilian scientific and engineering 
infrastructure capable of supporting nuclear weapons development and 
production. Japan has indigenously developed some uranium enrichment processes 
(e.g. the Ashi chemical exchange process), and has the technical means to 
deploy other processes if it chooses to do so. As one of the two leading 
manufacturing nations for computers (especially supercomputers), and has the 
second most advanced inertial confinement fusion program in the world, Japan 
is well positioned to quickly develop thermonuclear weapons.

In 1989 Japan produced 28% of its electricity (30500 MW) from 39 nuclear power 
plants, but had 26 more plants under construction or on the planning board. 
This would bring its nuclear power production to 57000 MW, over 50% of its 
total. In 1995 it had 50 reactors operating, providing 31% of its electricity. 
Japan plans eventually to generate all of its base load electricity from 
nuclear power. 

Japan has an active breeder reactor development program, and operates the 
Monju fast breeder reactor. Japan has a limited plutonium reprocessing pilot 
plant at Tokai, and has contracts with Britain and France for several tons of 
reprocessed plutonium, although tens of tons are expected in the future. 

The Rokkasho separation plant, under construction by Japan Nuclear Fuels Ltd 
since 1993, will have a capacity of 800 tonnes/yr of heavy metal. Safety 
upgrades have delayed its completion until 2003, at a cost of US$15 billion. 
Reprocessing costs are expected to be 40% higher than currently incurred for 
reprocessing in Europe.

At the end of 1994 Japan possessed 13 tonnes of separated plutonium. Of this, 
4352 kg was held domestically:
 at reprocessing plants 836 kg,
 at fuel fabrication facilities 3018 kg,
 at reactors and R&D facilities 498 kg;
and 8720 kg was held overseas:
 in UK 1412 kg
 in France 7308 kg.

Japan has used plutonium in mixed oxide fuel for light water reactors and for 
fast neutron reactors over some 15 years. In 1994, 323 kg of plutonium was 
used in Monju, Joyo and Fugen reactors, and 111 kg was recovered from 
reprocessing spent fuel in Japan. 

By the year 2000 Japan will have an inventory of about 55 tonnes of separated 
reactor grade plutonium. It should be noted that this is enough plutonium to 
manufacture ~10,000 warheads, more than the combined nominal arsenals of the 
U.S. and Russia combined under START II.

Although hard information about this is lacking, it is likely that Japan has 
undertaken advanced design work on a full range of nuclear weapon types. As 
noted at the beginning of this sub-section, this would be almost mandatory for 
national security reasons if only to create a base of expertise for conducting 
intelligence assessments of the nuclear programs of other nations. In contrast 
with Germany, Japan is in a relatively exposed position to potential threats 
with a long-term trend that is decidely negative due to the rapid growth of 
China's strength. It may also be argued that the lack of NATO memebership for 
Japan makes the U.S. nuclear umbrella somewhat more tenuous. These factors 
give Japan greater incentive to maintain a latent nuclear weapons capability. 
Should Japan decide to do so, it is likely that emergency capability nuclear 
weapons could be deployed by Japan within a few months of a decision to 
produce them.

According to proliferation assessments made by the U.S. government, no non-
nuclear country is as well positioned to "break-out" and develop advanced 
nuclear weapons than Japan.

Netherlands
Operates two power reactors producing 539 MW electrical, 5% of it electrical 
needs. Several Dutch companies are key participants in the tri-national URENCO 
uranium enrichment consortium. By the year 2000 the Netherlands will own about 
2 tonnes of separated reactor grade plutonium.

<h2>8.0    The First Nuclear Weapons</h2>
This section describes the first fission and fusion bombs that were 
developed and tested. The purpose is three-fold. First, these devices are of 
considerable historical and public interest, the "first" of anything garners 
special attention. Second, these devices serve as archetypal examples of 
basic designs, and more information is available about these devices than 
later ones. Third, the effort and technology that was required to develop 
these devices provide indications of how easily primitive nuclear weapons 
can be developed by others.

8.1  The First Atomic Bombs</h3><pre>
This subsection describes the three atomic bombs, which were constructed and 
detonated in 1945. Although diagrams would be extremely useful in describing 
these devices, I have not included any ASCII graphics due to the 
unsatisfactory resolution they offer. I may create GIFs at some future time.

8.1.1 The Design of Gadget, Fatman, and "Joe 1" (RDS-1)</h3><pre>
The design of the Gadget and Fatman devices are discussed together since 
they are basically the same. Gadget was an experimental test version of the 
implosion system used in Fatman. A test of the implosion bomb was considered 
essential due to the newness of the explosive wave shaping technology, and 
the complexity of the system.

Although the data given below is based on the US made Gadget/Fatman, it also 
applies to the first Soviet atomic bomb, code named RDS-1 (Reaktivnyi 
Dvigatel Stalina; Stalin's Rocket Engine) by the Soviet Union and designated 
Joe-1 by US intelligence. This is because detailed descriptions of the 
design were given to Soviet intelligence by spies who worked at Los Alamos; 
and Lavrenti Beria, who was the Communist Party official heading the 
project, insisted that the first bomb copy the proven American design as 
closely as possible. The principal spy was Klaus Fuchs, who actually had a 
very important role in bomb development. Significant information was also 
passed on by David Greenglass, and possibly also an unidentified scientist 
code named Perseus. In fact some key information about Gadget given below 
was made public as an indirect result of Soviet spying: post-Soviet Russia 
has released records on espionage that reveal information still classified 
in the US, and many FBI records relating to the Fuchs and Rosenberg 
investigations have recently been released that contain design data given to 
FBI interrogators by Fuchs and Greenglass.

The basic structure of this design was based on a series of concentric 
nested spheres (each discussed in detail in the paragraphs below) Starting 
from the outside (listing by outside radius) these were:
Explosive lens system          65   cm
Pusher/neutron absorber shell  23   cm
Uranium tamper/reflector shell 11.5 cm
Plutonium pit                   4.5 cm
Beryllium neutron initiator     1.0 cm

<B>The Pit</B>
The pit of these devices contained 6.2 kg of a delta-phase plutonium alloy. 
The mass was provided in a declassified memorandum written by Gen. Groves to 
the Sec. of War two days after the Trinity test. He describes the device and 
the results of the test and states that the explosion was created by "13 and 
a half pounds of plutonium".

The pit was a 9.0 cm sphere, solid except for an approximately 2.5 cm cavity 
in the center for the modulated neutron initiator. The solid design was a 
conservative one suggested by Robert Christy to minimize asymmetry and 
instability problems during implosion. The sphere had a 2.5 cm hole and 
plutonium plug to allow initiator insertion after assembly of the sphere.

The plutonium was produced by the nuclear reactors at Hanford, Washington; 
although it is possible that about 200 g of plutonium produced by the 
experimental X-Reactor at Oak Ridge was also used. Due to the very short 100 
day irradiation periods used during the war (wartime production meant that 
the plutonium had to be separated as quickly as feasible after being bred), 
this was super-grade weapon plutonium containing only about 0.9% Pu-240.

The plutonium was stabilized in the low density delta phase (density 16.9) 
by alloying it with 3% gallium (by molar content, 0.8% by weight), but was 
otherwise of high purity. The advantages of using delta phase plutonium over 
the high density alpha phase (density 19.2), which is stable in pure 
plutonium below 115 degrees C, are that the delta phase is malleable while 
the alpha phase is brittle, and that delta phase stabilization prevents the 
dramatic shrinkage during cooling that distorts cast or hot-worked pure 
plutonium. In addition stabilization eliminates any possibility of phase 
transition expansion due to inadvertent overheating of the pit after 
manufacture, which would distort and ruin it for weapon's use. 

It would seem that the lower density delta phase has offsetting 
disadvantages in a bomb, where high density translates into improved 
efficiency and reduced material requirements, but this turns out not to be 
so. Delta stabilized plutonium undergoes a phase transition to the alpha 
state at relatively low pressures (tens of kilobars, i.e. tens of thousands 
of atmospheres). The multi-megabar pressures generated by the implosive 
shock wave cause this transition to occur, in addition to the normal effects 
of shock compression. Thus a greater density increase and larger reactivity 
insertion occurs with delta phase plutonium than would have been the case 
with the denser alpha phase.

The pit was formed in two hemispheres, probably by first casting a blank, 
followed by hot pressing in a nickel carbonyl atmosphere. Since plutonium is 
a chemically very reactive metal, as well as a significant health hazard, 
each half-sphere was electroplated with nickel (or silver, as has been 
reported for the Gadget core). This created a problem with the Gadget pit 
since hasty electroplating had left plating solution trapped under the 
nickel (or silver), resulting in blistering that ruined the fit. Careful 
grinding and layering with gold leaf restored the necessary smooth finish. 
However a thin gold gasket (about 0.1 mm thick) between the hemispheres was 
a necessary feature of the design in any case to prevent premature 
penetration of shock wave jets between the hemispheres that could have 
prematurely activated the initiator.

<B>The Neutron Initiator</B>
The beryllium initiator used was called the "Urchin" or "screwball" design. 
It was a sphere consisting of a hollow beryllium shell, with a solid 
beryllium pellet inside, the whole initiator weighing about 7 grams. The 
outer shell was 2 cm wide and 0.6 cm thick, the solid inner sphere was 0.8 
cm wide. 15 parallel wedge-shaped grooves, each 2.09 mm deep, were cut into 
the inner surface of the shell. Like the pit, the shell was formed in two 
halves by hot pressing in a nickel carbonyl atmosphere. The surfaces of the 
shell and central sphere were coated with 0.1 mm of gold, and also a nickel 
layer deposited by the nickel carbonyl atmosphere. 50 curies polonium-210 
(11 mg) was deposited on the grooves inside the shell and on the central 
sphere. The gold and nickel layers protected the beryllium from alpha 
particles emitted by the polonium or surrounding plutonium. The Urchin was 
attached to a mounting bracket inside the central cavity of the pit, which 
was probably 2.5 cm wide. 

The Urchin was activated by the arrival of the implosion shock wave at the 
center of the pit. When the shock wave reached the walls of the cavity, they 
vaporized and the plutonium gas shock wave then struck the initiator, 
collapsing the grooves and creating Munroe-effect jets that rapidly mixed 
the polonium and beryllium of the inner and outer spheres together. The 
alpha particles emitted by the Po-210 then struck beryllium atoms, 
periodically knocking loose neutrons, perhaps one every 5-10 nanoseconds.

<B>The Reflector/Tamper</B>
The pit was surrounded by a natural uranium tamper weighing 120 kg, with a 
diameter of 23 cm. The tamper formed a 7 cm thick layer around the pit. The 
thickness of this layer was determined by neutron conservation 
considerations, since a few cm is sufficient to provide inertial 
confinement. Thicker natural uranium reflectors (exceeding 10 cm) provide 
significant additional savings to ordinary critical assemblies. But the 
"time absorption" effect inherent to fast exponential chain reactions 
reduced the benefits of a thicker reflector. About 20% of the bomb yield was 
from fast fission of this tamper.

The pit and the tamper together made a marginally subcritical system. When 
compressed by the implosion to about 2.5 times its original density, the pit 
became an assembly of some 5-6 critical masses. Before use, the bomb was 
safed by use of a cadmium wire in the pit.

<B>The Pusher/Neutron Absorber Shell</B>
Surrounding the tamper was an 11.5 cm thick aluminum sphere also weighing 
120 kg. The primary purpose of this sphere, called the "pusher", seems to 
have been to reduce the effect of the Taylor wave, the rapid drop in 
pressure the occurs behind a detonation front. The Taylor wave tends to 
steepen in an implosion, causing pressure to drop more and more rapidly as 
the wave converges. A shock reflection occurs at the Composition B/aluminum 
interface (due to the 1.65/2.71 density ratio) sending a higher pressure 
second shock back into the explosive and suppressing the Taylor wave. This 
also increases the pressure of the transmitted wave, enhancing the pressure 
reached at the center of core.

Surrounding the tamper was a layer containing boron. Since boron itself is a 
brittle non-metal that is difficult to fabricate, this was most likely in 
the form of a malleable boron/aluminum alloy called boral (the composition 
is typically 35-50% boron). It is possible that the entire aluminum sphere 
might have been boral with a relatively low boron content. The presence of 
boron was intended to prevent spontaneous fission neutrons generated in the 
tamper from being scattered back into the tamper/pit assembly by the 
explosive and aluminum layers as thermal neutrons.

<B>The High Explosive Lens System</B>
The entire high explosive implosion system made a layer some 47 cm thick 
weighing at least 2500 kg. This system consisted of 32 explosive lenses; 20 
of them hexagonal, and 12 pentagonal. The lenses fitted together in the same 
pattern as a soccer ball, forming a complete spherical explosive assembly 
that was 140 cm wide. Each lens had three pieces: two made of high velocity 
explosive, and one of low velocity explosive. The outermost piece of high 
velocity explosive had a conical cavity in its inner surface into which 
fitted an appropriately shaped piece of slow explosive. These mated pieces 
formed the actual lens that shaped a convex, expanding  shock wave into a 
convex converging one. An inner piece of high velocity explosive lay next to 
the aluminum sphere to amplify the convergent shock. The lenses were made by 
precision casting, so explosives that could be melted were used. The main 
high explosive was Composition B, a mixture of 60% RDX - a very high 
velocity but unmeltable explosive, 39% TNT - a good explosive that is easy 
to melt, and 1% wax. The slower second explosive was Baratol, it is a 
mixture of TNT and barium nitrate of variable composition (TNT is typically 
25-33% of the mixture) with 1% wax as a binder. The high density of barium 
nitrate gives baratol a density of at least 2.5.

The lens system had to be made to very precise tolerances. The composition 
and densities of the explosives had to be accurately controlled and 
extremely uniform. The pieces had to fit together with an accuracy of less 
than 1 mm to prevent irregularities in the shock wave. Accurate alignment of 
the lens surfaces was even more important than a close fit. A great deal of 
tissue paper and scotch tape was also used to make everything fit snugly 
together.

Each of the components of the bomb, from the lenses to the pit itself, were 
made as accurately as possible to insure accurate implosion, and the highest 
densities possible.

To achieve the most precise detonation synchronization possible, 
conventional detonators consisting of an electrically heated wire, and a 
sequence of primary and secondary explosives were not used. Instead newly 
invented exploding wire detonators were used. This detonator consists of a 
thin wire that is explosively vaporized by a surge of current generated by a 
powerful capacitor. The shock wave of the exploding wire initiates the 
secondary explosive of the detonator (PETN). The discharge of the capacitor, 
and the generation of initiating shock waves by the exploding wires can be 
synchronized to +/- 10 nanoseconds. A disadvantage of this system is that 
large batteries, a high voltage power supply, and a very powerful capacitor 
bank (known as the X-Unit, the system weighed 400 lb) was needed to explode 
all 32 detonators simultaneously. A cascade of spark gap switches was used 
to trigger the capacitor bank.

The whole explosive assembly was held together by a shell made of a strong 
aluminum alloy called dural (or duraluminum). A number of other shell 
designs had been tried and discarded. This shell design, designated model 
1561, was made of an equatorial band bolted together from 5 segments of 
machined dural castings, with domed caps bolted to the top and bottom to 
make a complete sphere.

The final bomb design allowed "trap door" assembly. The entire bomb could be 
assembled ahead of time, except for the pit/initiator. To complete the bomb, 
one of the domed caps was removed, along with one of the explosive lenses. 
The initiator was inserted between the plutonium hemispheres, and the 
assembled pit was inserted in a 40 kg uranium cylinder that slid into the 
tamper to make the complete core. The explosive lens was replaced, its 
detonator wires attached, and the cap bolted back into place.

Safety was a serious problem for Fatman, though in a comaprison of worst 
case accidents, not as serious a problem as it was for Little Boy. The 
critical mass of the uranium reflected core in the delta phase was 7.5 kg, 
but only 5.5 kg in the alpha phase. Any accidental detonation of the high 
explosive (in a fire or plane crash for example) would be certain to 
collapse the 6.2 kg delta phase core to the supercritical alpha phase state. 
The expected yield from the explosion would be on the order of tens of tons, 
roughly a factor of ten higher than the energy of the high explosive itself. 
The main hazard would be from gamma radiation however, which would be deadly 
well outside the main area of blast effects. A 20 ton explosion would 
produce a lethal 640 rem prompt gamma radiation exposure 250 m from the 
bomb!

For transportation feasibility, as well as safety reasons, the implosion 
bombs were not transported in assembled form but were put together shortly 
before use. Due to the complexity of the weapon, this was a process that 
took at least 2 days (including checkout procedures). Weapons of this design 
could only be left in the assembled state for a few days due to 
deterioration of the X-Unit batteries.

8.1.2  TRINITY - The Gadget Test</h3><pre>
The test of the first atomic explosion in history was conducted at the 
Jornada del Muerto trail (Journey of Death) at the Alamagordo Bombing Range 
in New Mexico at 33 deg. 40' 31" North latitude, 106 deg. 28' 29" West 
longitude (33.675 deg. N, 106.475 deg W). The device was called Gadget, the 
whole test operation was code-named TRINITY.

Gadget was a 150 cm sphere consisting of the basic explosive assembly 
described above with its dural shell, the firing electronics and equipment 
were mounted externally on the test platform which was atop a 100 foot steel 
tower, giving Gadget an elevation of 4624 ft above sea level.

The assembly of Gadget took five days and began on July 11, 1945. By July 
13, the assembly of Gadget's explosive lens, uranium reflector, and 
plutonium core were completed at Ground Zero. On July 14, Gadget was hoisted 
to the top of the 100 foot test tower, and the detonators were connected, 
after which final test preparations began. On July 16, 1945, 5:29:45 a.m. 
(Mountain War Time) Gadget was detonated. The explosive yield was 20-22 Kt 
(by latest estimates), vaporizing the steel tower. Since the bomb was 
exploded above the ground it produced only a very shallow crater (mainly 
created by compression of the soil) - 2 meters deep with an 80 m radius. The 
crater was surrounded by fused (melted) sand dubbed "trinitite" (or 
"atomsite"). The exact yield was originally placed at 18.6 Kt on the basis 
of radiochemical tests. Since the projected yield was only 5-10 Kt, many of 
the experiments were damaged or destroyed by the test and failed to yield 
useful (or any) data.

Gadget was exploded close enough to the ground that considerable local 
fallout was generated (along with significant induced radioactivity at 
ground zero from the emitted neutrons). The most intense induced radiation 
was in an irregular circle, about 10 m in radius around ground zero. The 
cloud rose to 11,000 m. The wind was blowing to the northeast, but 
significant fallout did not descend for about 20 km downwind.

The heaviest fallout was detected about 20 miles northeast of ground zero. 
In this area radiation levels recorded along U.S. Highway 380 for a distance 
of ten miles reached "approximately 50 R total." Also in this area was a 
site dubbed "Hot Canyon". The canyon was 5 miles east of the town of 
Bingham, 1.1 miles east of a road junction. This is a summary of radiation 
levels:
 15.0 R/hr at 0300 hours after zero
 14.0 R/hr at 0330 hours
  6.0 R/hr at 0830 hours
  0.6 R/hr at 3600 hours
The total exposure as this site was 212-230 R.

Some evacuations were conducted the path of the fallout plume out to 30 km. 
At Bingham, New Mexico gamma intensities of 1.5 R/hr were recorded between 2 
and 4 hours after the test. South of Bingham readings reached 15 R/hr, but 
declined to 3.8 R/hr 5 hours after the detonation, and had decreased to less 
than 0.032 R/hr one month later. 

0.9 miles east of "Hot Canyon", was a house containing the Raitliff family, 
consisting of two adults and a child. Levels at this location were "0.4 R/hr 
at 3600 hours after zero & after a rain. Accumulated total dose 57-60 R." 
Also nearby was another house with a couple named Wilson. None of these 
people were evacuated.

Radiation (beta) burns were later observed on cattle in the general vicinity 
of the test. The main fallout pattern extended about 160 km from ground 
zero, and was about 50 km wide.

8.1.3   Little Boy</h3><pre>
The design of Little Boy was completely different from Gadget/Fatman. It 
used the gun assembly method that had originally been proposed for the 
plutonium bomb. The development of the uranium gun weapon was somewhat 
erratic. Early design and experimental work directed towards developing a 
gun system for uranium assembly was conducted during the summer and fall of 
1943, after Los Alamos began operating. It was soon discontinued as 
attention shifted to the technically more demanding plutonium gun. It was 
felt that once the plutonium gun was successfully developed, the uranium gun 
would be almost an afterthought since the necessary speed of assembly was 
much lower.

When the very high neutron emission rate of reactor-produced plutonium was 
discovered in April-July 1944, the gun method was abandoned for plutonium 
and serious attention returned to the uranium gun. The uranium gun program 
(the O-1 group of the Ordnance Division) was lead by A. Francis Birch. He 
faced an odd combination of considerations in directing the work. The system 
was straightforward to develop, and sufficient U-235 to build the bomb 
obviously wouldn't be available until mid 1945, if then. Birch was 
nonetheless under a great deal of pressure to complete development as 
quickly as possible so that all of the laboratory's assets could be directed 
to the risky implosion bomb. Furthermore since the feasibility of the 
plutonium bomb was now in doubt, he had to make absolutely sure that the 
uranium bomb would work. Thus although it was a comparatively easy project 
technically, it still required extraordinary attention to detail.

The design arrived at was a very conservative one, that was as certain to 
work as any untested device can be. The design was complete by February 1945 
(the final version was designated the Model 1850), only preparations for 
field use were required after that. The actual bomb was ready for combat use 
by early May, 1945 - except for the U-235 pit. 

All of the uranium used in Little Boy had gone through its final stages of 
enrichment in the Calutron electromagnetic isotope separators at Oak Ridge, 
Tenn. Other isotope enrichment systems, also at Oak Ridge, contributed as 
they became available. Most of the uranium went through a three stage 
enrichment process: the thermal diffusion enriched the feed uranium from the 
natural concentration (0.72%) to the range of 1-1.5%; gaseous diffusion 
plant took this as feed and enriched it to increasing concentrations as 
enrichment stages came on-line.

The pit contained 64.1 kg of highly enriched uranium. By the time Little Boy 
was assembled, 50 kg of uranium enriched to 89% had been produced by Oak 
Ridge, and an additional 14 kg of 50% enrichment uranium was on hand. All of 
it was used in the bomb, giving an average enrichment of 80%, or 
approximately 2.4 critical masses. This is less than the 5 or so critical 
masses achieved by Gadget/Fatman, and is the principal reason for Little 
Boy's lower efficiency. It is interesting to compare this to the published 
data on the South African gun-assembly bomb, which used 55 kg of enriched 
uranium (probably at >90% enrichment) and an inferior reflector, but a 
superior tamper (tungsten carbide gives a 15% lower critical mass, compared 
to tungsten metal, but is 25% less dense).

The U-235 mass of Little boy was divided into two pieces: the bullet and the 
target. The "bullet": a cylindrical stack of U-235 rings about 10 cm wide 
and 16 cm long, containing 40% of the mass (25.6 kg). It was constructed 
from six rings, the stack backed by a tungsten carbide disk and a steel 
backplate, all within a 1/16 inch thick steel can to make the complete 
projectile. The "target": a hollow cylinder 16 cm long and wide, weighing 
38.4 kg, embedded in the tamper assembly. The target was fabricated as two 
separate rings that were inserted in the bomb separately. Note that even an 
unreflected sphere of U-235 weighing 64 kg would be supercritical. Almost 
certainly the bullet was made entirely of 89% enrichment uranium since 
placing the most fissile material at the center of the core is a basic 
principle of efficient bomb design. 

The bullet was sheathed in a boron "safety sabot" that absorbed neutrons and 
reduced the chance of a criticality accident. The target also contained a 
boron safety plug. When the projectile reached the target, the boron sabot 
would be stripped off, and then the plug would be ejected into a recess in 
the nose.

The tamper assembly for Little Boy consisted of a thick tungsten carbide 
tamper/reflector, surrounded by a steel tamper forging about 60 cm wide. The 
combined tungsten carbide/steel tamper weighed 2300 kg. U-238 is a superior 
tamper and reflector, but tungsten carbide and steel were used instead due 
to the spontaneous fission rate of U-238. U-238 undergoes spontaneous 
fission 100 times more frequently than U-235, and a piece large enough to be 
useful as a tamper (200 kg) would generate 3400 neutrons a second - too many 
for gun assembly to be feasible.

A hole was bored into the steel forging, and the carbide tamper was 
inserted. The target was inserted in the form of several rings. The hole 
above the target was threaded and the gun barrel was screwed in to attach it 
securely (otherwise recoil from the bullet's acceleration would pull the 
target/tamper and barrel apart). At the bottom of the hole one or more 
beryllium/polonium initiator (different from the implosion initiators; 
simpler in design, with less polonium) could be mounted. 

Although it only took some 0.5 milliseconds for the fissile material in the 
bullet to traverse the length of the target, the reactivity insertion time 
for Little Boy was 1.35 milliseconds, indicating that a critical 
configuration was achieved well before the bullet reached the target. The 
uranium/steel assembly was designed as a "blind target", one that would stop 
and hold the bullet upon impact due to expansion of the bullet rings. Even 
if the neutron initiator failed to work, the bomb would have exploded from 
spontaneous fission in a fraction of a second. The decision to include 
initiators in the final weapon wasn't even finalized by Oppenheimer until 
March 15, 1945. In the end, 4 ABNER initiators out of a batch of 16 shipped 
to Tinian were used in Little Boy. These were fastened radially to the front 
end of the target assembly.

The gun was a 3" (inside diameter) anti-aircraft barrel, 6.5" wide, and six 
feet long that had been bored out to 4" to accommodate the bullet. It 
weighed about 450 kg, and had a breech block weighing 34 kg. Cordite, a 
conventional artillery smokeless powder, was used as the propellant, and the 
velocity achieved by the bullet was 300 m/sec.

To reduce the possibility of the bullet being driven into the target by a 
crash, the fit was intentionally made very tight. The bullet had to be 
rammed into the breech to assemble the weapon, and about 300,000 newtons of 
force (70,000 lb) were required to drive it forward. The weapon striking a 
hard surface in a crash could concievably produce the 500 Gs of acceleration 
required however.

Little Boy was a terribly unsafe weapon design. Once the propellant was 
loaded, anything that ignited it would cause a full yield explosion. For 
this reason "Deke" Parsons, acting as weaponeer, decided to place the 
cordite in the gun after take-off in case a crash and fire occurred. It is 
possible that a violent crash (or accidental drop) could have driven the 
bullet into the target even without the propellant causing anything from a 
fizzle (a few tons yield) to a full yield explosion. Little Boy also 
presented a hazard if it fell into water. Since it contained nearly three 
critical masses with only air space separating them, water entering the 
weapon would have acted as a moderator, possibly making the weapon critical. 
A high yield explosion would not have occurred, but a rapid melt-down or 
explosive fizzle and possible violent dispersal of radioactive material 
could have resulted.

The complete weapon was 126 inches long, was 28 inches in diameter and 
weighed 8900 lb. Little Boy used the same air burst detonator system as 
Fatman (see below).

No other weapon of this design was ever detonated. Ony five other Little Boy 
units were built, but no others entered the US arsenal. It appears that not 
even one additional complete set of components required to assemble a 
combat-ready weapon were ever procured.
 
The first U-235 projectile component was completed at Los Alamos on June 15, 
1945. Casting of the U-235 projectile for Little Boy was completed on July 
3. On July 14 Little Boy bomb units, accompanied by the U-235 projectile, 
were shipped out of San Francisco. They were picked up by the USS 
Indianapolis (CA-35) at the U.S. Navy's Hunter's Point shipyard at San 
Francisco on July 16, bound for Tinian Island in the Mariana Islands. On 
July 24 the last component for Little Boy, the U-235 target insert, was 
completed and was tested the next day. The Indianapolis delivered Little Boy 
bomb units, and the U-235 projectile to Tinian on July 26. On the same day 
the target assembly, divided into three parts flew out of Kirtland Air Force 
Base, Albuquerque on three C-54 transport planes, which arrived July 28 at 
Tinian.

Bomb unit L11 was selected for combat use and on July 31 the U-235 
projectile and target were installed, along with 4 initiators - making 
Little Boy ready for use the next day. An approaching typhoon required 
postponing the planned attack of Hiroshima on Aug. 1. Several days are 
required for weather to clear, and on Aug. 4 the date was set for 2 days 
later. On August 5 Tibbets named B-29 No. 82 the "Enola Gay" after his 
mother, over the objections of its pilot Robert Lewis. Little Boy was loaded 
on the plane the same day.

August 6, 1945 - 
*  0000, final briefing, the target of choice is Hiroshima. Tibbets is 
pilot, Lewis is co-pilot.
*  0245, Enola Gay begins takeoff roll.
*  0730, the bomb is armed.
*  0850, Flying at 31,000 ft Enola Gay crosses Shikoku due east of 
Hiroshima.
*  Bombing conditions are good, the aimpoint is easily visible, no 
opposition is encountered.
*  0916:02 (8:16:02 Hiroshima time) Little Boy explodes at an altitude of 
1900 +/- 50 feet (580 m), 550 feet from the aim point, the Aioi Bridge, with 
a yield of 12-18 Kt (the yield is uncertain due partly from the absence of 
any instrumented test with this weapon design). A state-of-the-art, six year 
study  ending in 1987, which used all available evidence, set the yield at 
15 Kt (+/- 20%).

 The yield of Little Boy had been predicted before delivery at 13.4 Kt, and 
the burst height was set at 1850 ft. Using the 15 Kt figure, the actual 
burst height was optimum for a blast pressure of about 12 psi (i.e. it 
maximized the area subjected to a 12 psi or greater overpressure). To 
inflict damage on a city a blast pressure of 5 psi is sufficient, so greater 
damage would have resulted from an optimum burst height of 2700'. Due to the 
uncertainty in predicting yield, and the fact that bursting too high causes 
a rapid deterioration in effects, the burst height had been set 
conservatively low in case a low yield explosion occurred. The 1900 foot 
burst height is optimal for a 5 Kt weapon. The burst height was sufficient 
to prevent any significant fallout over Japan.

8.1.4   Fatman</h3><pre>
The combat configuration for the implosion bomb (the Model 1561) basically 
consisted of the Gadget device encapsulated in a steel armor egg. The two 
steel half-ellipsoids were bolted to the dural equatorial band of the 
explosive assembly, with the necessary X-Unit, batteries, and fuzing and 
firing electronics located in the front and aft shell. For use in combat, 
each Fatman bomb required assembly almost from scratch - a demanding and 
time consuming job. Assembly of a Fatman bomb was (and may still be) the 
most complex field preparation operation for any weapon ever made. 

Like Little Boy, Fatman was fuzed by four radar units called "Archies", the 
antennas for which were mounted on the tail of the bomb. Developed 
originally as fighter tail warning systems, these units measured the bomb's 
height above the ground and were set to detonate at a pre-calculated 
altitude (set to 1850 ft, +/- 100 ft). A barometric switch acted as a "fail-
safe", preventing detonation until the bomb had fallen below 7000'.

Fatman was 60 inches in diameter, was 12 feet long, and weighed 10,300 lb.

The Fat Man plutonium core, and its initiator, left Kirtland Air Force Base, 
for Tinian Island on July 26, 1945 in a C-54 transport plane. It arrived on 
Tinian on July 28. Also on July 28, three specially-modified B-29s flew from 
Kirtland Field carrying three Fat Man bomb assemblies, including units F-31 
and F-32, each encased in an outer ballistic shell. These arrived at Tinian 
on August 2, the first Fat Man units to do so. The bombing date was set for 
August 11 at this time, with Kokura as the target. Assembly of practice 
(non-nuclear) weapons began shortly afterward, with the first completed bomb 
(Fat Man unit F33) ready on Aug. 5. On August 7 a forecast of 5 days of bad 
weather around the 11th moved the bombing date up to August 10, then to 
August 9. This compressed the bomb assembly schedule so much that many 
check-out procedures had to be skipped during assembly. On August 8 the 
assembly of Fat Man unit F31, with the plutonium core, was completed in the 
early morning. At 2200, Fat Man was loaded on the B-29 "Bock's Car".

August 9, 1945 -
*  0347, Bock's Car takes off from Tinian, the target of choice is Kokura 
Arsenal. Charles Sweeney is pilot. Soon after takeoff he discovers that the 
fuel system will not pump from the 600 gallon reserve tank.
*  1044, Bock's Car arrives at Kokura but finds it covered by haze, the 
aimpoint cannot be seen. Flak and fighters appear, forcing the plane to stop 
searching. Sweeney turns toward Nagasaki, the only secondary target in 
range.
*  Upon arriving at Nagasaki, Bock's Car has enough fuel for only one pass 
over the city even with an emergency landing at Okinawa. Nagasaki is covered 
with clouds, but one gap allows a drop several miles from the intended 
aimpoint. 
*  11:02 (Nagasaki time) Fat Man explodes at 1650 +/- 33 feet (503 m) near 
the perimeter of the city with a yield of 22+/-2 Kt. Due to the hilly 
terrain around ground zero, five shock waves were felt in the aircraft (the 
initial shock, and four reflections).

Although Fat Man fell on the border of an uninhabited area, the eventual 
casualties still exceeded 70,000. Also ground zero turned out to be the 
Mitsubishi Arms Manufacturing Plant, the major military target in Nagasaki. 
It was utterly destroyed.

The 1987 reassessment of the Japanese bombings placed the yield at 21 Kt. At 
the extreme estimate ranges for Little Boy and Fat Man (low for Little Boy, 
high for Fat Man), a ratio of nearly 2-to-1 has been implied. The 1987 best 
estimate figures make Fat Man only about 40% larger than Little Boy (and 
possibly as little as 15% more).

Using the 21 Kt figure, the optimal burst height for Fat Man would have been 
about 3100 feet. The actual burst height was optimal for 15 psi overpressure  
The burst height was sufficient to prevent any fallout over Japan.

<HR><a name=nfaq8.1.5></a><h3>
8.1.5   Availability of Additional Bombs</h3><pre>
The date that a third weapon could have been used against Japan was no later 
than August 20. The core was prepared by August 13, and Fat Man assemblies 
were already on Tinian Island. It would have required less than a week to 
ship the core and prepare a bomb for combat.

By mid 1945 the production of atomic weapons was a problem for industrial 
engineering rather than scientific research, although scientific work 
continued - primarily toward improving the bomb designs. 

The three reactors (B and D which went started up for production in December 
1944, and F which started up February 1945) at Hanford had a combined design 
thermal output of 750 megawatts and were theoretically capable of producing 
19.4 kg of plutonium a month (6.5 kg/reactor), enough for over 3 Fatman 
bombs. Monthly or annual production figures are unavailable for 1945 and 
1946, but by the end of FY 1947 (30 June 1947) 493 kg of plutonium had been 
produced. Neglecting the startup month of each reactor, this indicates an 
average plutonium production 5.6 kg/reactor even though they were operated 
at reduced power or even shut down intermittently beginning in 1946.

Enriched uranium production is more difficult to summarize since there were 
three different enrichment processes in use that had interconnected 
production. The Y-12 plant calutrons also had reached maximum output early 
in 1945, but the amount of weapon-grade uranium this translates into varies 
depending on the enrichment of the feedstock. Initially this was natural 
uranium giving a production of weapon-grade uranium of some 6 kg/month. But 
soon the S-50 thermal diffusion plant began feeding 0.89% enriched uranium, 
followed by 1.1% enriched feed from the K-25 gaseous diffusion plant. The 
established production process was then: thermal diffusion (to 0.89%) -> 
gaseous diffusion (to 1.1%) -> alpha calutron (to 20%) -> beta calutron (up 
to 89%). Of these three plants, the K-25 plant had by far the greatest 
separation capacity and as it progressively came on line throughout 1945 the 
importance of the other plants decreased. When enough stages had been added 
to K-25 to allow 20% enrichment, the alpha calutrons were slated to be shut 
down even if the war continued.

After Japan's surrender in August 1945, S-50 was shut down; the alpha 
calutrons followed in September. But K-25 was complete on August 15, and 
these shutdowns would have occurred in any case. At this point gaseous 
diffusion was incapable of producing weapon grade uranium, a planned "top 
plant" had been cancelled in favor of more beta calutrons. An expansion of 
K-25, called K-27, to produce a larger flow of 20% enriched feed was under 
construction and due to go in full operation by 1 February 1946. In October 
production had increased to 32 kg of U-235 per month.

In November and December additional beta tracks went on line, and the 
percentage of downtime for all beta tracks fell, boosting production 
further. Between October 1945 and June 1946, these improvements led to a 
117% increase in output at Oak Ridge, to about 69 kg of U-235 per month.

It is very unlikely any more Little Boy-type bombs would have been used even 
if the war continued. Little Boy was very inefficient, and it required a 
large critical mass. If the U-235 were used in a Fat Man type bomb, the 
efficiency would have been increased by more than an order of magnitude. The 
smaller critical mass (15 kg) meant more bombs could be built. Oppenheimer 
suggested to Gen. Groves on July 19, 1945 (immediately after the Trinity 
test) that the U-235 from Little Boy be reworked into uranium/plutonium 
composite cores for making more implosion bombs (4 implosion bombs could be 
made from Little Boy's pit). Groves rejected the idea since it would delay 
combat use. 

The improved composite core weapon was in full development at Los Alamos 
when the war ended. It combined two innovations: a composite pit containing 
both U-235 and Pu-239, and core levitation which allowed the imploding 
tamper to accelerate across an air gap before striking the pit, creating 
shock waves that propagated inward and outward simultaneously for more rapid 
and even compression.

The composite pit had several advantages over using the materials 
separately:
*  A single design could be used employing both of the available weapon 
materials.
*  Using U-235 with plutonium reduced the amount of plutonium and thus the 
neutron background, while requiring a smaller critical mass than U-235 
alone.

The levitated pit design achieved greater compression densities. This 
permitted using 25% less than fissile material for the same yield, or a 
doubled yield with the same amount of material.

Production estimates given to Sec. Stimson in July 1945 projected a second 
plutonium bomb would be ready by Aug. 24, that 3 bombs should be available 
in September, and more each month - reaching 7 or more in December. 
Improvements in bomb design being prepared at the end of the war would have 
permitted one bomb to be produced for every 5 kg of plutonium or 12 kg of 
uranium in output. These improvements were apparently taken into account in 
this estimate. Assuming these bomb improvements were used, the October 
capacity would have permitted up to 6 bombs a month. Note that with the peak 
monthly plutonium and HEU production figures (19.4 kg and 69 kg 
respectively), production of close to 10 bombs a month was possible.

When the war ended on August 15 1945 there was an abrupt change in 
priorities, so a wartime development and production schedule did not 
continue. Development of the levitated pit/composite core bomb ground to a 
halt immediately. It did not enter the US arsenal until the late forties. 
Plans to increase initiator production to ten times the July 1945 level were 
abandoned.

Fissile material production continued unabated after the S-50 and alpha 
calutron shutdowns though the fall, but plutonium shipments from Hanford 
were halted, and plutonium nitrate concentrates were stockpiled there.

In early 1946, K-25 and K-27 were reconfigured to produce weapon grade 
uranium directly, but the extremely costly Y-12 beta tracks continued to 
operate until the end of 1946. By that time Y-12 had separated about 1000 kg 
of weapon grade uranium. From this point on gaseous diffusion enriched 
uranium was the mainstay of weapon grade fissile material production in the 
US, dwarfing plutonium production, until highly enriched uranium production 
for weapons use was halted in 1964. 

The Hanford reactors accumulated unexpected neutron irradiation damage (the 
Wigner effect) and in 1946 they were shut down or operated at reduced power. 
If war had continued they both would have been pushed to continue full 
production regardless of cost or risk. 

The effects of these priority changes can be seen in the post war stockpile. 
Although Los Alamos had 60 Fat Man units on hand in October 1945, the US 
arsenal after had only 9 actual Fat Man type bombs in July 1946, with 
initiators for only 7 of them. In July 1947 the arsenal had increased to 13 
bombs. There was probably sufficient fissile material on hand for over 100 
bombs though.

8.2    The First Hydrogen Bombs</h3><pre>
The discovery of fusion reactions arose early in the twentieth century out 
of the growing understanding of atomic physics. By the early 20s it was 
realized that hydrogen fusion was the source of the sun's power output, 
although the details were still obscure. This work culminated in the paper 
published by Hans Bethe in _Physical Review_ in 1939 describing the role of 
fusion reactions in the sun, for which he received the Nobel Prize in 
Physics in 1967.
</pre>

<HR><a name=nfaq8.2.1></a><h3>
8.2.1  Early Research on Fusion Weapons</h3><pre>
The possibility of creating weapons employing fusion reactions was not 
seriously considered until the discovery of fission. Almost immediately 
physicists around the world realized that fission explosions generating high 
temperatures might be possible, but a few years passed before the idea of 
using these temperatures to ignite fusion reactions was suggested. Tokutaro 
Hagiwara at the University of Kyoto proposed this idea in a speech in 
May 1941, apparently the first such mention.

While working on atomic bomb research a few months later, in September 1941, 
Enrico Fermi muses to Edward Teller ("out of the blue") whether a fission 
explosion could ignite a fusion reaction in deuterium. After some study 
Teller concluded that it is impossible and although no further work on the 
subject followed for awhile, this conversation began Teller's eventual 
obsession with fusion bombs.

[Historical footnote: During World War II, the idea occurred in Germany that 
convergent shock waves and collapsing shells might focus enough energy to 
allow conventional high explosives to ignite limited fusion reactions. This 
idea was probably inspired by Gudderly's work in converging shock waves, and 
certainly by the Allied attempts to destroy the heavy water plant at Vemork, 
Norway. Since German physicists considered fission weapons to be beyond 
reach during the current war, they concluded that the Allied interest in 
heavy water must be due its application in high explosive weapons. The 
Germans actually checked craters left by the British "Grand Slam", the 
largest conventional bomb dropped during the war, to discover whether its 
unusual power was due to fusion boosting. Polish researchers in the 60s and 
70s reported actually generating fusion neutrons through convergent shock 
waves. Although the theoretical possibility remains, no one has apparently 
ever released significant amounts of energy this way.]

Research into the possibility of fusion weapons took an irregular and 
halting journey from the time of Fermi and Teller's conversation until bombs 
were actually built in the early 1950s. During WW II there was an initial 
surge of interest once fission bomb physics was fairly well understood. 
After preliminary theoretical investigation it was realized that much better 
experimental data was needed, and a fusion research program was included in 
the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos. Continuing theoretical investigations 
took repeated turns towards optimism, then pessimism, and back again. As the 
difficulty of the enterprise came clear, its priority was steadily 
downgraded. Teller on the other hand grew so captivated by the problem that 
he became unable to fulfill his duties at Los Alamos, was relieved of all 
technical leadership responsibilities, and was eventually transferred to a 
separate study group to prevent him from interfering in the work of others 
on the atomic bomb.

During July-September 1942 Oppenheimer's theoretical study group 
(Oppenheimer, Bethe, Teller, John Van Vleck, Felix Bloch, Robert Serber, and 
Emil Konopinski) in Berkeley examined the principles of atomic bomb design, 
and also considered the feasibility of fusion bombs. Megaton range fusion 
bombs were considered highly likely.

April, 1943 - During the initial organization effort at Los Alamos, Bethe is 
selected over Teller to head the Theoretical Division. Teller is soon placed 
in charge of lower priority research on fusion weapon design (designated the 
Super), but remains responsible for much theoretical work on the fission 
weapon as well.

February, 1944 - The Los Alamos Governing Board reevaluates deuterium fusion 
research and determines that tritium would be necessary to make an explosive 
reaction. Priority of fusion bomb work is further downgraded.

May, 1944 - Teller is removed entirely from the Theoretical Division to 
prevent his interference with fission bomb work. He is placed in charge of a 
small independent group for fusion research.

At the end of the war most of Los Alamos' scientific and technical talent, 
and virtually all of its leadership, left for civilian careers. Teller was 
among those who left. For a period of time very little progress on weapon 
research of any kind occurred. A conference, chaired by Teller, was held in 
April 1946 to review the wartime progress on the Super.

The design at that time was for a gun-type uranium fission bomb to be 
surrounded by about a cubic meter of liquid deuterium, with the whole 
assembly being encased in a heavy tamper. A large but undetermined amount of 
tritium would be required to ignite the reaction. If the amount of tritium 
required was too large, then the bomb would be impractical. Since the fusion 
of one T atom releases 8% the energy of the fission of a Pu-239 atom, with 
which it competes for neutrons in production reactors, the energy boost from 
D+D fusion must be considerably more than a factor of 10 greater than that 
released by the tritium starter fuel before the Super could be worthwhile.

The assessment at the time of the conference was that the Super was 
basically sound, but that more detailed calculations would be required 
verify it. Also present at the conference was Klaus Fuchs, who was spying 
for the Soviet Union. The Soviets thus were well informed about American 
interest and optimism about fusion weapons.

In mid-1946 Teller developed an idea he called the Alarm Clock. This 
involved the use of fusion fuel, specifically lithium-6 deuteride inside a 
uranium tamper of an implosion fission bomb. The idea was that the fission 
neutrons would breed tritium form the lithium, and fission energy would 
compress and heat the fusion fuel and ignite a reaction. A fusion-fission 
chain reaction would then proceed between the fusion fuel and tamper until 
the bomb disassembled. 

By the end of 1946 Teller thought the Alarm Clock idea unpromising. In his  
September 1947 memorandum "On the Development of Thermonuclear Bombs" he was 
pessimistic about Alarm Clock's potential, but felt that it, like the Super 
were possible and required further study. Due to limitations in computing 
devices then available, he proposed delaying further work on both approaches 
for two years. If work had proceeded on the Alarm Clock design at this time 
the U.S. could probably have tested a device similar to Joe 4 (see below) 
before the end of 1949. 

In the four years following the end of the war about 50% of the Los Alamos 
Theoretical Division's effort went into studying the Super, although its 
size and talent were much reduced from wartime levels. The absence of good 
calculating machines hampered the massive numerical computations that were 
required and greatly slowed progress.

By 1949 the Cold War was in full swing, with the Berlin blockade and 
Communist governments seizing control throughout Eastern Europe. This 
included Teller's homeland of Hungary, where much of his family still lived. 
Early in the summer of 1949 he thus rejoined Los Alamos to pursue the Super. 
On August 29 the first Soviet atomic bomb, code named RDS-1 and called Joe 1 
by US intelligence, was exploded breaking the US nuclear weapon monopoly.

Up to this time the more detailed work on the classical Super design had 
showed that it was marginal at best. The large amounts of tritium required 
made it extremely expensive for the yield produced, and it was not even 
certain that the design would work at all. Teller remained optimistic 
however. During the next few months Robert Oppenheimer, as head of the 
Atomic Energy Commission's General Advisory Council (GAC) consistently 
opposed accelerating work on the Super due to its demonstrated shortcomings.

Despite this, on 31 January 1950, Pres. Truman announced that the US would 
proceed to develop hydrogen bombs. A couple of weeks after Truman's 
announcement, Teller issued a 72 page update of "On the Development of 
Thermonuclear Bombs". In this paper he again regarded both the Super and 
Alarm Clock as viable candidates for weapons development, but again proposed 
delaying decision on full scale development of either for another two years.

At this time Soviet research on the subject was already well underway, 
focusing on the Sakharov-Ginsberg version of the Alarm Clock concept which 
they called the Layer Cake. A special department was set up in March 1950 to 
proceed with actual Layer Cake weapon development.

By February 1950, immediately after Truman's decision, Stanislaw Ulam had 
discovered by hand calculation that even more immense amounts of tritium 
than previously believed would be necessary for the Super to have any chance 
of success. When Ulam and Cornelius Everett completed more detailed 
computations on June 16, the design even these huge amounts of tritium 
appeared to be inadequate. Additional analysis by Ulam and Enrico Fermi 
nailed the coffin shut on the classical Super. When John Von Neumann's newly 
invented ENIAC began doing extensive calculations on the problem later in 
the year, the negative results were simply piling more dirt on the grave. 
Until early 1951 real progress on hydrogen bomb development was impossible 
because no one knew how to proceed.

<HR><a name=nfaq8.2.2></a><h3>
8.2.2   Design and Testing of the First Fusion Weapons</h3><pre>
In January 1951, Ulam broke the barrier to progress by inventing the idea of 
staging: using the energy released by an atomic bomb primary to compress an 
external fuel capsule. He initially developed the idea as a means to create 
improved fission bombs, the second stage being a mass of fissionable 
material. By late in the month he realized that the powerful compression 
that was possible would overcome the obstacles to efficient large scale 
fusion reactions. By multiple staging, bombs of virtually unlimited size 
could be created.

This key idea was not sufficient by itself. Before a workable design could 
be developed a scheme was needed for generating efficient compression using 
this energy flux, as was a means for igniting the fuel once it was 
compressed. Ulam's idea was to use the neutron flux or the hydrodynamic 
shock wave of the expanding bomb core to achieve compression.

Working with Ulam, Teller added additional refinements to this insight 
during the month of February. Teller's principal contribution during this 
period was realizing that the thermal radiation flux from the primary was a 
more promising means of generating the necessary implosive forces. On 9 
March 1951, Ulam and Teller jointly wrote a report, _On Heterocatalytic 
Detonations I. Hydrodynamic Lenses and Radiation Mirrors_, that summarized 
these ideas.

From this point on Teller increasingly began to claim exclusive credit for 
the breakthrough, and eventually came to deny that Ulam had made any 
original or significant contribution.

Later in March Teller added an important additional element to the radiation 
implosion scheme. Adapting Ulam's idea to use staged implosion to trigger a 
fission reaction, Teller suggested placing a fissile mass in the center of 
the fusion fuel. The convergent shock wave would compress this to 
supercriticality upon arriving at the center, making it act as a "spark 
plug" to ignite the fusion reaction. This idea is perhaps not strictly 
necessary, the convergent shock wave will generate very high temperatures in 
the center any way and might suffice to initiate fusion as it does in modern 
laboratory inertial confinement fusion experiments. 

Since the continuing compression on the fusion fuel would act to confine the 
fission spark plug, this final combined design concept was termed the 
"equilibrium thermonuclear". Teller wrote this idea up in a report on 4 
April, 1951.

It was only in April 1951 that the necessary physical principles were in 
hand to allow the development and testing of an actual hydrogen bomb to go 
forward. More computations were required to design the device than for any 
other project in human history up to this point (made possible by the recent 
invention of the programmable computer). The elapsed time from this point 
until the detonation of the Mike device was less than 19 months, an 
achievement as remarkable in its own way as the Manhattan Project.

In April 1951 experiments with fusion reactions and atomic bombs were 
already being prepared by the US as part of the Greenhouse test series, 
including a test of the idea of fusion boosting. The Greenhouse George test 
in particular provided a valuable opportunity to evaluate the Teller-Ulam 
ideas by allowing the observation of radiation effects in heating and 
compressing (although not imploding) an external mass of fusion fuel.

Since there are several known designs for incorporating fusion reactions 
into weapons we come to a question that is largely a matter of definition: 
Which design qualifies as a *true* hydrogen bomb? I will not try to debate 
this issue here (see Section 11: Questions and Answers), instead I am 
including descriptions of all of the significant tests that lead to the 
development and deployment of early thermonuclear weapons. 

The tests are listed in chronological order. Each is followed by a brief 
discussion of its significance to weapons development.

Total yield: 225 Kt 
George was a test of a pure fission bomb, and the highest yield bomb tested 
up to that time. The bomb was a cylindrical implosion U-235 bomb, perhaps 
based on a design by physicist George Gamow. An experiment called the 
Cylinder device was piggy-backed on George to test the ignition of a 
thermonuclear reaction. The cylindrical implosion design allowed the fusion 
experiment to be heated directly by the pit without the shielding effects of 
a high explosive layer, and avoided disruption by expanding detonation 
gases. A deuterium-tritium mixture external to the large fission core was 
ignited by the thermal flux, and produced detectable fusion neutrons. This 
was the first ignition of a thermonuclear reaction by an atomic bomb. 
Rhodes, in _Dark Sun_, estimates the fusion energy yield as 25 Kt, although 
the mass of fuel given ("less than an ounce") is at a factor of 12 too small 
for this. Other sources simply give the fusion yield as "small". This 
approach provided no prospect for development into a high yield 
thermonuclear weapon. This test fortuitously provided useful data for 
evaluating the Teller-Ulam design which had been devised two months prior.

Greenhouse Item
Detonated 5/25/51 at 0617 (local time) on a 300 ft tower on Engebi/Janet 
island at Eniwetok atoll.
Total yield: 45.5 Kt 
First test of a boosted fission device. A deuterium-tritium mixture in the 
U-235 bomb core boosted fission yield by 100% over its expected unboosted 
yield. This innovation was eventually incorporated into most or all 
strategic weapons, but the fusion yield was negligible and overall yield was 
still limited by the capabilities of fission designs.

Ivy Mike
Detonated 11/1/52 at 0714:59.4 +/- 0.2 sec (local time) at ground level on 
Elugelab/Flora island at Eniwetok atoll.
Total yield: 10.4 megatons.
This was the first test of the Teller-Ulam (or Ulam-Teller) configuration.
The Mike device used liquid deuterium as the fusion fuel. It was a massive 
laboratory apparatus installed on Elugelab Island in the Eniwetok Atoll 
consisting of a cylinder about 20 feet high (more exactly 243.625 inches or 
6.19 m), 6 ft 8 in wide, and weighing 164,000 lb (including attached 
diagnostic instruments); also said to weigh 140,000 lb without "the 
cryogenic unit" (this may mean the casing by itself). It was housed in an 
open hanger-like structure 88 ft x 46 ft, and 61 ft high, where assembly 
started in September of 1952.

The Mike device consisted of a massive steel cylinder with rounded ends, a 
TX-5 implosion bomb at one end acted as the primary, and a giant stainless 
steel dewar (thermos) flask holding several hundred liters of liquid 
deuterium surrounded by a massive natural uranium pusher/tamper constituted 
the secondary fusion stage (know as the "Sausage").

The welded steel casing was lined with a layer of lead. A layer of 
polyethylene several centimeters thick was attached to the lead with copper 
nails. This layer of plastic generated plasma pressure during the implosion.

The Sausage consisted of a triple-walled stainless steel dewar. The inner 
most wall contained the liquid deuterium. Between this wall and the middle 
wall was a vacuum to prevent heat conduction. Between the middle wall and 
the outer wall was another vacuum, and a liquid nitrogen-cooled thermal 
radiation shield made of copper.

To reduce thermal radiation leakage even further, the uranium pusher (which 
was oxidized to a purple-black color, making it an excellent thermal 
radiator) was lined with gold leaf.

Down the axis of the dewar, suspended in the liquid deuterium was a 
plutonium rod that acted as the "spark plug" to ignite the fusion reaction 
once the compression shock wave arrived at the center. It did not run the 
entire length of the dewar, but was supported at each end by axial columns. 
The spark plug was a boosted fission device, it was hollow and was charged 
with a few grams of tritium/deuterium gas (which of course liquified once 
the dewar was charged with liquid deuterium).

The Mike device had a conservative design. The external casing was made of 
steel and was extraordinarily thick (usually described as "a foot thick", 
but more likely 10 inches to be consistent with the weight) to maximize the 
confinement of the radiation induced pressure inside. The interiro diameter 
was thus about 60 inches. A very wide radiation channel was provided around 
the secondary stage to minimize thermal gradients, and to make success less 
dependent on sophisticated analysis. Due to the low density of liquid 
deuterium, and the necessity of thermal insulation, the secondary itself was 
quite voluminous which, when combined with the wide channel between the 
secondary and the casing led to the 80 inch diameter. The massive casing 
accounted for most of Mike's weight (about 85%). 

The TX-5 device was an experimental version of the implosion system that was 
also deployed as the Mk-5 fission bomb. It used a 92 point ignition system, 
that is, 92 detonators and explosive lenses were used to make the spherical 
imploding shock wave. This allows the formation of the implosion shock wave 
with a thinner layer of explosive than earlier designs. The TX-5 was 
designed to use different fission pits to allow variable yields. The highest 
reported yield for a TX-5 test was Greenhouse Easy at 47 Kt on 20 April 
1951, with a 2700 lb device. The smaller mass compared with earlier designs 
kept the temperature higher and allowed thermal radiation to escape more 
quickly from the primary, thus enhancing the radiation implosion process. If 
the Easy configuration was used in Mike, then the secondary fusion/primary 
yield ratio was 50/1. The deployed Mk-5 had an external diameter of 43.75 
inches, the TX-5 would have been substantially smaller since it lacked the 
Mk-5 bomb casing. 

Three fuels were considered for Mike: liquid deuterium, deuterated ammonia 
(ND3), and lithium deuteride. The reason for choosing liquid deuterium for 
this test was primarily due to two factors: the physics was simpler to study 
and analyze, and extensive studies had already been conducted over the 
previous decade on pure deuterium fuel. The desirability of lithium-6 
deuteride as a fuel was known, but sufficient Li-6 could not be produced in 
time to make the November 1952 target date (in fact construction of the 
first lithium enrichment plant had just begun at the time of the test).

Liquid deuterium produces energy through four reactions:
1.  D + T -> He-4 + n + 17.588 MeV
2.  D + D -> He-3 + n + 3.268 MeV
3.  D + D -> T + p + 4.03 MeV
4.  He-3 + D -> He-4 + p + 18.34 MeV
For Mike to function successfully, densities and temperatures in the 
secondary sufficient to ignite reactions 2 and 3 were required. This 
requires densities hundreds of times normal, and temperatures in the tens of 
millions of degrees K (say, 75 g/cm^3 and 3x10^7 K).

Since the reaction cross section of 1 is some 100 times higher than the 
combined value of 2 and 3 the tritium is burned as fast as it is produced, 
contributing most of the energy early in the reaction. Reaction 4, on the 
other hand, requires temperatures exceeding 200 million K before its cross 
section becomes large enough to contribute significantly. Whether sufficient 
temperatures are reached and quantities of He-3 are produced to make 4 a 
major contributor depends on the combustion efficiency (percentage of fuel 
burned). 

If only reactions 1-3 contribute significantly, corresponding to the 
combustion of 25% of the deuterium fuel or less, then the energy output is 
57 Kt/kg. If reaction 4 contributes to the maximum extent, the output is 
82.4 Kt/kg. The maximum temperature generated by an efficient burn reaches 
350 million K.

The fission fraction for Mike was quite high - 77%. The total fusion yield 
was thus 2.4 megatons, which corresponds to the efficient thermonuclear 
combustion of 29.1 kg of deuterium (172 liters), or the inefficient 
combustion of 41.6 kg (249 liters). The total fission yield was 7.9 
megatons, the fission of 465 kg of uranium. All but some 50 Kt of this was 
due to fast fission of the uranium secondary stage tamper by fusion 
neutrons, a 3.3 fold boost.

The amount of deuterium actually present in Mike was no more than 1000 
liters, which is the amount of liquid deuterium handled by Operation Ivy. In 
fact, it was probably substantially less than this since excess LD2 was 
undoubtedly brought along in case leakage or other losses occurred.

Prior to test, Mike's yield was estimated at 1-10 megatons, with a most 
likely yield of 5 Mt, but with a remote possibility of yields in the range 
of 50-90 Mt. The principal uncertainties here would have been the efficiency 
of the fusion burn, and the efficiency with which the tamper captured 
neutrons. Both of these factors are strongly influenced by the success of 
the compression process. The fusion efficiency involved novel and complex 
physics which could not be calculated reliably even if the degree of 
compression were known. The physics for determining the efficiency of 
neutron capture on the other hand were well understood and could be 
calculated if the conditions could be predicted. 

The upper limit estimate provides some insight into the mass of the uranium 
fusion tamper. Presumably the 90 Mt figure was calculated by assuming 
complete fusion and fission of all materials in the secondary. If 1000 
liters of deuterium were burned with complete efficiency, the yield would be 
13.9 Mt. Fission must account for 76.1 Mt, corresponding to a uranium tamper 
mass of 4475 kg. Lower amounts of deuterium would lead to higher tamper 
estimates (a ratio of 0.82 kg of U for each liter of LD2).

The detonation of Mike completely obliterated Elugelab, leaving an 
underwater crater a 6240 feet wide and 164 ft deep in the atoll where an 
island had once been. Mike created a fireball 3 miles wide; the "mushroom" 
cloud rose to 57,000 ft in 90 seconds, and topped out in 5 minutes at 
135,000 ft - the top of the stratosphere- with a stem eight miles across. 
The cloud eventually spread to 1000 miles wide, with a stem 30 miles across. 
80 million tons of soil were lifted into the air by the blast.

The Mike design was actually converted into a deliverable weapon, 
demonstrating that lithium deuteride is not essential to making a usable 
weapon. The weaponized design, designated the TX-16, went into engineering 
development in June 1952 (5 months before the Ivy Mike test). The design 
eliminated the cryogenic refrigerator, reduced the weight of the tamper, 
drastically reduced the dimensions and mass of the casing, used a lighter 
and less powerful primary, and pared the weight in other areas. The expected 
yield was reduced to 7 Mt. The device was about 60 inches in diameter, 25 ft 
long, and weighed 30,000 lb. This weapon design would have been filled with 
liquid deuterium at a cryogenic filling station before take-off, a reservoir 
in the weapon held sufficient liquid hydrogen to replace boil-off losses 
during flight. Components for about five of these bombs were built in late 
1953, and had reached deplyment by the time of the Castle tests.

A unit of the TX-16, code named Jughead, was slated for proof test 
detonation on 22 March 1954 as part of the Castle series, prior to its 
expected deployment as the EC-16 (Emergency Capability) gravity bomb in May 
1954. The excellent results with the solid-fueled Shrimp device in the 
Castle Bravo test on 1 March(see below) resulted in the cancellation of this 
test, and then of the entire EC-16 program on 2 April 1954.

Soviet Test: Joe 4/RDS-6s
Detonated: 12 August 1953, on a tower at Semipalatinsk in Kazakhstan
Total yield: 400 kilotons
This was the fifth Soviet trest, and first Soviet test of a weapon with 
substantial yield enhancement from fusion reactions. This bomb (designated 
RDS-6s) did not employ the Teller-Ulam configuration, instead it used the 
"Sloika" design invented by Andrei Sakharov and Vitalii Ginzburg. A sloika 
is a layered Russian pastry, rather like a napoleon, and has thus been 
translated as "Layer Cake". The design was first invented in the United 
States by Edward Teller (who called it "Alarm Clock") but it was not 
developed into a weapon there.

This design is based on a combination of what Sakharov has called the "First 
and Second Ideas". The First Idea, developed by Sakharov, calls for using a 
layer of fusion fuel (deuterium and tritium in his original concept) around 
a fission primary, with an outermost layer of U-238 acting as a fusion 
tamper. The U-238 tamper confines the fusion fuel so that the radiation-
driven shock wave from the fission core can efficiently compress and heat 
the fusion fuel to the ignition point, while the low conductivity of the 
fusion tamper prevents heat loss and at the same time yields addition energy 
from fast fission by the fusion-generated neutrons. The Second Idea, 
contributed by Ginzburg used lithium-6 deuteride (with some tritium) as the 
fusion fuel. Being a solid, this is a convenient material for designing a 
bomb, and it also produces additional tritium from fission neutrons through 
the  Li-6 + n reaction. This establishes a coupled fission -> fusion -> 
fission chain reaction in the U-238 tamper, with the fusion fuel acting in 
effect as a neutron accelerator. Larger bombs can be created by placing 
additional successive layers of Li-6 D and U around the bomb. The device 
tested in 1953 probalby had two layers. 

 A small U-235 fission bomb acted as the trigger (about 40 Kt). The total 
yield was 400 Kt, and 15-20% of the energy was released by fusion, and 90% 
due directly or indirectly to the fusion reaction.

A few weeks before the test it was belatedly realized that despite the 
sparse population of the area around Semipalatinsk, a serious fallout hazard 
nonetheless existed for tens of thousands of people. The options were to 
carry out a mass evacuation or delay the test until an air-dropped system 
could be arranged, which would take at least six months. Rather than delay 
the test, a hasty evacuation was conducted. [Note: This implies that the 
Layer Cake was not available as a usable weapon until after Feb. 1954, a 
time at which the US had actually deployed the EC-14, a megaton-range 
lithium deuteride fueled Teller-Ulam design. See the Castle Union test 
below.] 

Castle Bravo 
Detonated: 1 March 1954 (0645 local time) on reef 2950 ft off of Nam/Charlie 
island, Bikini Atoll
Total yield: 15 megatons
The Shrimp device detonated in the Bravo test was the first test of a 
Teller-Ulam configuration bomb fueled with lithium deuteride. This became 
the standard design for all subsequent hydrogen bombs (including Soviet 
designs). Shrimp was a cylinder 179.5 in long, and 53.9 in wide, weighing 
23,500 lb. The lithium in Shrimp was enriched to a level of 40% Li-6. The 
predicted yield of this device was only 6 Mt (range 4-6 Mt), but the 
production of unexpectedly large amounts of tritium through the fast neutron 
fission of Li-7 boosted the yield to 250% of the predicted value, making it 
the largest bomb ever tested by the US (and destroying much of the measuring 
equipment). The fission yield was 10 Mt, the fusion yield was 5 Mt for a 
fusion fraction of 33%.

The explosion created a 6000 ft crater, 240 ft deep in the atoll reef. The 
cloud top rose to 114,000 ft.

The Bravo test created the worst radiological disaster in US history. Due to 
failure to postpone the test following unfavorable changes in the weather, 
combined with the unexpectedly high yield, the Marshallese Islanders on 
Rongerik, Rongelap, Ailinginae, and Utirik atolls were blanketed with the 
fallout plume. They were evacuated on March 3 but 64 Marshallese received 
doses of 175 R. In addition, the Japanese fishing vessel Daigo Fukuryu Maru 
(Fifth Lucky Dragon) was also heavily contaminated, with the 23 crewmen 
received exposures of 300 R (one later died from complications). The entire 
Bikini Atoll was contaminated to varying degrees, and many operation Castle 
personnel were subsequently over-exposed as a result. After this test the 
exclusion zone around the Castle tests was increased to 570,000 square 
miles, a circle 850 miles across (for comparison this is equal to about 1% 
of the entire Earth's land area).

The two stage device Shrimp design was used as the basis for the Mk-21 bomb. 
The weaponization effort began on 26 March, only three weeks after Bravo. By 
mid April the military characteristics were defined. On 1 July an expedited 
schedule for deployment was approved. The use of the final fast fission 
stage was apparently eliminated. After a number of efforts to reduce the 
weight, the design seems to have stabilized in mid-July 1955 with a 
projected yield of 4 megatons (subsequently tested at 4.5 megatons in 
Redwing Navajo, 95% fusion, 11 July 1956). Quantity production began in 
December 1955 and ended in July 1956 with 275 units being produced. The Mk 
21 weighed about 15,000 lb; it was 12.5 ft long, and 56 in. in diameter. 
During June-November 1957 it was converted to the Mk 36 design.

Castle Romeo
Detonated 27 March 1954 on barge in Bikini atoll lagoon near Bravo test site 
at 0630:00.4 (local time).
Total yield: 11 megatons
The Runt I device (the second in the Castle series) was another solid fueled 
two stage design. This device was 224.9 in. long, 61.4 in. in diameter, and 
weighed 39,600 lb. The fuel for Runt was natural lithium deuteride, a major 
advantage considering the high cost of lithium-6 enrichment. It exceeded its 
predicted yield by an even larger margin than Bravo, with a most probable 
yield of 4 Mt out of a 1.5-7 Mt range. This is consistent with the higher 
proportion of Li-7, compared to Bravo. The fission yield was 7 Mt, for a 
fusion fraction of 36%.

The Runt I and Runt II devices (seen Castle Yankee below) were design tests 
for the EC-17 and EC-24 bombs respectively. These two weapons were very 
similar (externally identical, similar internal configurations, but with 
different primaries). They were the most powerful weapons ever built by the 
US, with predicted yields of 15-20 megatons, and were also the largest and 
heaviest bombs ever deployed by the US The Mk 17/24 (as the deployed 
versions were eventually designated) was 24 ft. 8 in. long, with a 61.4 in. 
diameter, and a weight of 41,400-42,000 lb (30,000 lb of this was the 3.5 
in. steel casing). 

Although the initial work on these weapons dates at least to Feb. 1953, they 
went into development engineering in Oct. 1953. The EC-17 and EC-24 became 
the second and third models of hydrogen bomb to enter the US arsenal. From 
April to September in 1954 EC-17 and EC-24 bombs were stockpiled (5 EC-17, 
and 10 EC-24). These bombs were removed in October, modified for better 
safety features and with drogue parachutes for slower fall, and returned to 
duty as the Mk 17 Mod 0 and Mk 24 Mod 0 in November 1954. These weapons went 
through two subsequent modifications, and stockpiles reached 200 Mk 17s and 
105 Mk 24s during the October 1954 - November 1955 production run. The Mk 
24s were retired in Sept-Oct 1956; the Mk 17s were retired between Nov. 1956 
and Aug. 1957.

Castle Union
Detonated 26 March 1954 (0610:00.7 local time) on barge in Bikini atoll 
lagoon off Yurochi Island.
Total yield: 6.9 megatons
This was actually the fourth test in the Bravo series (the third test - Koon 
- failed when the fusion stage did not ignite). This was the test of the EC-
14 Alarm Clock bomb (unrelated to Teller's earlier Alarm Clock concept), 
which was the first hydrogen bomb actually to enter the US arsenal and the 
first Teller-Ulam bomb ever to be deployed anywhere. This was a solid fueled 
two stage device using 95% enriched lithium-6. It also exceeded 
expectations, the predicted yield was 3-4 Mt (range 1-6 Mt). The fission 
yield was 5 Mt for a fusion fraction of 28%. The tested device had a length 
of 151 in., a diameter of 61.4 in,. and weighed 27,700 lb.

The TX-14 Alarm Clock went into development engineering in August 1952, and 
procurement was approved in mid-September (some 6 weeks before Mike had even 
been tested). The first EC-14 weapons were produced in Feb. 1954, two months 
prior to test of the design. The design was simple but had very poor safety 
features. A total of 5 were deployed, this low figure can probably be 
attributed to scarcity of Li-6 at the time. Safety could presumably have 
been improved through retrofitting, but the high cost of these weapons 
probably led to their rapid retirement. They were removed from the arsenal 
in October with the deployment of the EC-17. The Mk 14 (its final deployed 
designation) had a diameter of 61.4 in., a length of 18 ft. 6 in., and 
weighed 28,954 lbs. After refitting with a drogue parachute its weight 
increased to 29,851 lbs.

Castle Yankee
Detonated 5 May 1954 (0610:00.1 local time) on barge in Bikini atoll lagoon, 
above the Union crater.
Total yield: 13.5 megatons
The Runt II device was very similar to Runt I, mostly differing in the 
design of the primaries. The fuel for Runt II was also natural lithium 
deuteride. It also exceeded its predicted yield, with a most probable yield 
of 8 Mt out of a 6-10 Mt range. See Castle Union for a discussion of weapons 
derived from this test. This device was 225 in. long, 61 in. in diameter, 
and weighed 39,600 lb. The fission yield was 7 Mt for a fusion fraction of 
48%.

Soviet Test No. 19 Test 11/22/55 (No common name)
Detonated   11/22/55
Total yield: 1.6 megatons
The first Soviet test of a Teller-Ulam/Sakharov Third Idea bomb. It used 
radiation implosion to detonate a lithium deuteride fueled capsule. This was 
the world's first air-dropped fusion bomb test. After this test the Soviet 
Union used radiation implosion bombs as the basis for their strategic 
arsenal. Exploded underneath an inversion layer, the refracted shock did 
unexpected collateral damage, killing three people.

<h2>10.0    Chronology For The Origin Of Atomic Weapons</h2>
A proper history of the Manhattan Project, and the development of the first 
atomic bombs, is beyond the scope of this FAQ. I have included here a 
chronological listing of events and milestones leading up to the use of 
atomic weapons against Japan. Brief explanatory notes are inserted to 
provide some context and interpretation. The interested reader is directed 
to several excellent books available (see bibliography), particularly the 
Pulitzer Prize winning book by Rhodes, and _Critical Assembly: A Technical 
History of Los Alamos During the Oppenheimer Years 1943-1945_,  from whom 
the bulk of the material for this timeline was extracted.

The timeline is divided into several epochs which seem to me to be naturally 
separated by critical events. Each epoch begins with a short summary of the 
key themes that characterize it. Although this is a strict chronology which 
list events that are more or less datable, occasional paragraphs are 
interspersed summarizing the thrust of events.

10.1   Early History of Nuclear Weapons</h3><pre>
*** From 1920 To December 1938 ***
During this epoch the basic physics upon which the discovery of fission 
would be based were worked out.

June 3, 1920 - Ernest Rutherford speculates on the possible existence and 
properties of the neutron in his second Bakerian Lecture, London.

December 28, 1931 - Irene Joliot-Curie reports studying penetrating 
particles produced by beryllium when bombarded by alpha rays. She believes 
the particles, which are actually neutrons, to be energetic gamma rays.

February 7 to 17, 1932 - In a series of experiments James Chadwick 
demonstrates the existence of the neutron.

September 12, 1932 - Leo Szilard conceives the idea of using a chain 
reaction of neutron collisions with atomic nuclei to release energy. He also 
considers the possibility of using this to make bombs. This predates the 
discovery of fission by more than six years.

May 10, 1934 - Enrico Fermi's research group publishes a report on 
experiments with neutron bombardment of uranium. Several radioactive 
products are detected.

July 4, 1934 - Leo Szilard files patent application describing the use of 
neutron induced chain reactions to create explosions, and the concept of the 
critical mass.

September, 1934 - Ida Noddack publishes a paper in _Zeitshrift fur 
Angewandte Chemie_ arguing that the anomalous radioactivities produced by 
neutron bombardment of uranium may be due to the atom splitting into smaller 
pieces.

October 22, 1934 - Enrico Fermi discovers the principle of neutron 
moderation, and the enhanced capture of slow neutrons.

October 8, 1935 - The British War Office rejects Szilard's offer to turn 
over to them his patents of nuclear energy for free, an offer made to bring 
them under British secrecy laws.

December, 1935 - Chadwick wins Nobel Prize for discovery of the neutron.

February, 1936 - The British Admiralty accepts Szilard's offer to turn over 
his patents.

10.2   The Discovery of Fission and Its Properties</h3><pre>
*** From December 1938 To September 1939 ***
This period, initiated by the discovery of fission by Hahn, was marked by 
preliminary investigation the properties and principles of fission. There 
was also substantial speculation about the possible uses of fission, but 
without firm experimental support for making projections.

December 21, 1938 - Otto Hahn submits paper to _Naturwissenschaften_ showing  
conclusive evidence of the production of radioactive barium from neutron 
irradiated uranium, i.e. evidence of fission.

January 13, 1939 - Otto Frisch observes fission directly by detecting 
fission fragments in an ionization chamber. With the assistance of William 
Arnold, he coins the term "fission".

Mid January, 1939 - Leo Szilard hears about the discovery of fission from 
Eugene Wigner. He immediately realizes that the fission fragments, due to 
their lower atomic weights, would have excess neutrons which would have to 
be shed.

January 26, 1939 - Niels Bohr publicly announces the discovery of fission at 
an annual theoretical physics conference at George Washington University in 
Washington, DC.

January 29, 1939 - Robert Oppenheimer hears about the discovery of fission, 
within a few minutes he realizes that excess neutrons must be emitted, and 
that it might be possible to build a bomb.

February 5, 1939 - Niels Bohr realizes that U-235 and U-238 must have 
different fission properties, that U-238 could be fissioned by fast neutrons 
but not slow ones, and that U-235 accounted for observed slow fission in 
uranium.

At this point there were too many uncertainties about fission to see clearly 
whether or how self-sustaining chain reactions could arise. Key 
uncertainties were 1) the number of neutrons emitted per fission, and 2) the 
cross sections for fission and absorption at different energies for the 
uranium isotopes. For a chain reaction there would need to be both a 
sufficient excess of neutrons produced, and the ratio between fission to 
absorption averaged over the neutron energies present would need to be 
sufficiently large.

The different properties of U-235 and U-238 were essential to understand in 
determining the feasibility of an atomic bomb, or of any atomic power at 
all. The only uranium available for study was the isotope mixture of natural 
uranium, in which U-235 comprised only 0.71%.

March, 1939 - Fermi and Herbert Anderson find that there are about two 
neutrons produced for every one consumed in fission.

June, 1939 - Fermi and Szilard submit paper to _Physical Review_ describing 
sub-critical neutron multiplication in a lattice of uranium oxide in water, 
but it is clear that natural uranium and water cannot make a self-sustaining 
reaction.

July 3, 1939 - Szilard writes to Fermi describing the idea of using a 
uranium lattice in carbon (graphite) to create a chain reaction.

August 31, 1939 - Bohr and John A. Wheeler publish a theoretical analysis of 
fission. This theory implies U-235 is more fissile than U-238, and that the 
undiscovered element 94-239 is also very fissile. These implications are not 
immediately recognized.

September 1, 1939 - Germany invades Poland, beginning World War 2.

10.3   Organizing to Investigate Atomic Weapons</h3><pre>
*** From September 1939 To September 1941 ***
The preliminary research into fission indicated that it was probable that 
power could be produced from fission. Two general approaches both seemed 
viable, the uranium-graphite and uranium-heavy water reactor. The 
possibility of a bomb was still controversial, but it hadn't been ruled out 
by experiments to date. With the growth in scale of the experiments 
additional sources of funds were increasingly necessary to continue work. 
The outbreak of war in Europe also created pressure on the scientists to 
resolve the bomb question quickly. Attempts to gain governmental attention 
and support became increasingly strident.

During this phase efforts to investigate the possibility of atomic bombs, 
and to support basic research, were pressed on the governments of both 
Britain and the US Considerably more success in this was made in Britain, 
although the larger research establishment in the US which was still at 
peace made more of the fundamental discoveries. The favorable results of 
Britain's MAUD committee in investigating the feasibility of atomic bombs 
was instrumental in eventually spurring the US to action.

October 11, 1939 - At Szilard's urging Alexander Sachs presents Pres. 
Franklin D. Roosevelt with the "Einstein Letter". The letter, signed by 
Einstein but drafted by Szilard in consultation with Einstein, warns the 
President of the possibility of nuclear weapons and urging him take action 
to prevent Germany from gaining an advantage with them.

October 21, 1939 - First meeting of the Advisory Committee on Uranium (the 
"Briggs Uranium Committee") in Washington, DC, created at Pres. Roosevelt's 
order. Lyman Briggs of the Bureau of Standards presides, attendees include 
Szilard, Wigner, Sachs, Edward Teller, Army Lt. Col. Adamson, and Navy Cmdr. 
Hoover. Physicists argue for urgent government attention, Adamson is 
hostile. Teller requests $6000 for research on preliminary uranium-graphite 
slow neutron experiments, which is grudgingly approved. A report of the 
meeting is sent to FDR on Nov. 1, but no action results.

From the outset it was clear to all of the physicists who thought about the 
problem seriously that fast fission was necessary to construct a bomb. Rapid 
multiplication is essential to develop significant explosive force, and the 
process of slowing down neutrons takes too long. But it was known that the 
average cross section for fast fission in U-238 was too small to support 
such a reaction. Up to this point U-235 had been considered only for its 
slow fission potential - leading to power plants, not bombs. No one had yet 
developed a plausible approach for building a bomb. The fact that a large 
cross section for slow fission implied a large fast fission cross section as 
well was not realized.

February 1940 - Frisch and Rudolf Peierls, living in the UK, consider the 
possibility of fast fission in U-235. Based on a theoretical estimate of the 
fast fission cross section they estimate the critical mass of pure U-235 at 
"a pound or two", and that a large percentage could be fissioned before 
explosive disassembly. They also estimate the likely effects of the bomb, 
and possible assembly methods, as well as estimates of the feasibility of 
isotope separation. After preparing a memorandum on this discovery, they 
give a copy to Mark Oliphant, who passes it along to Henry T. Tizard, 
chairman of the Committee on the Scientific Survey of Air Defense. At this 
point the "Tizard Committee" is the most important scientific committee for 
defense in Britain.

March, 1940 - After much prodding by Szilard, Briggs finally releases the 
promised $6000.

March 2, 1940 - The first direct measurements of the enormous slow fission 
cross section of U-235 are made by John Dunning at Columbia University.

April 9, 1949 - Germany invades Denmark and Norway.

April 10, 1940 - First meeting of the UK committee (later code-named the 
MAUD Committee) organized by Tizard to consider Britain's actions regarding 
the "uranium problem". Research into isotope separation and fast fission is 
agreed upon.

April 27, 1940 - Second meeting of the Briggs Uranium Committee. Briggs' 
decision is that neither research on fast fission, nor work on building a 
critical uranium-graphite assembly, should begin until the small scale lab 
experiments, just getting underway, are finished.

May, 1940 - George Kistiakowsky suggests gaseous diffusion as a possible 
means for producing U-235 to Vannevar Bush during a meeting at Carnegie 
Institution.

May 10, 1940 - Germany launches its assault on Western Europe, attacking 
Holland, Belgium and France.

May 27, 1940 - Louis Turner mails Szilard a manuscript arguing that element 
94-239 (not yet discovered) should be highly fissionable like U-235, and 
could be manufactured by bombarding U-238 with neutrons, to form U-239, 
which would undergo two beta-decays to form elements 93-239 and 94-239 in 
succession.

May 27, 1940 - Edwin McMillan and Philip Abelson submit a report 
"Radioactive Element 93" to _Physical Review_ describing their discovery of 
neptunium produced by bombarding uranium with neutrons. Britain subsequently 
protests the publication as a violation of wartime secrecy. 

June, 1940 - The MAUD Committee acquires its name. Franz Simon begins 
research on isotope separation through gaseous diffusion.

July 1, 1940 - The newly founded National Defense Research Council (NDRC), 
headed by Vannevar Bush, takes over responsibility for uranium research. In 
his final report Briggs requests $140,000 for further work: $40,000 for lab 
measurements, and $100,000 for large scale uranium-graphite studies. Bush 
approves only $40,000.

November, 1940 - Dunning and Nobel prize winner Harold Urey begin 
investigating isotope separation techniques without US government support.

November 1, 1940 - The $40,000 contract from the NDRC finally comes through 
and work begins at Columbia University to assemble a large sub-critical pile 
made of graphite and uranium oxide.

December, 1940 - The MAUD Committee issues report on isotope separation 
authored by Simon. Report concludes manufacturing U-235 by gaseous diffusion 
is feasible on a scale suitable for weapons production.

February, 1941 - Philip Abelson begins working on uranium enrichment at the 
Naval Research Laboratory. He selects liquid thermal diffusion as the 
technique to pursue.

February 26, 1941 - Glenn Seaborg and Arthur Wahl conclusively demonstrate 
the presence of element 94, which they later name plutonium.

March, 1941 - Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) at the Carnegie 
Institution measures the fast cross section of U-235. Using it Peierls, on 
the MAUD Committee, calculates a new critical mass for U-235 at 18 LB as a 
bare sphere, or 9-10 lb. when surrounded by a reflector. A memorandum is 
prepared by the MAUD Committee describing the importance of fast fission for 
bomb design and transmits it the US - Lyman Briggs locks up the document on 
arrival and shows it to no one.

March 6, 1941 - Seaborg and Wahl isolate the first pure neptunium-239 (0.25 
micrograms), in a matter of days it decays into a (barely) visible speck of 
pure plutonium.

March 28, 1941 - Joseph Kennedy, Seaborg and Emilio Segre show that the 
plutonium sample undergoes slow fission, which implies it is a potential 
bomb material.

May, 1941 - After months of growing pressure from scientists in Britain and 
the US (particularly Berkeley's Ernest Lawrence), Bush at the NDRC decides 
to review the prospects of nuclear energy further and engages Arthur Compton 
and the National Academy of Sciences for the task. The report is issued May 
17 and treats military prospects favorably for power production, but does 
not address the design or manufacture of a bomb in any detail.

At this same time, Bush creates the larger and more powerful Office of 
Scientific Research and Development (OSRD), which is empowered to engage in 
large engineering projects in addition to research, and becomes its 
director.

Also during this month Tokutaro Hagiwara at the University of Kyoto delivers 
a speech in which he discusses the possibility of a fusion explosion being 
ignited by an atomic bomb, apparently the first such mention.

May 18, 1941 - Segre and Seaborg determine that the slow cross section of 
Pu-239 is 170% of that of U-235, proving it to be an even better prospective 
nuclear explosive.

July 1941 - Segre and Seaborg measure the fast fission cross section of Pu-
239, finding a high value.

July 15, 1941 - The MAUD Committee approves its final report and disbands. 
The report describes atomic bombs in some technical detail, provides 
specific proposals for developing them, and includes cost estimates. 

Although the contents of the MAUD report reach Vannevar Bush at the OSRD 
immediately, he decides to wait for the report to be transmitted officially 
before taking any further action on fission development.

August-September, 1941 - Fermi and his team at Columbia begin assembling a 
sub-critical experimental pile containing 30 tons of graphite and 8 tons of 
uranium oxide. It gives a projected k value 0f 0.83, indicating purer 
materials are needed. 

September, 1941 - Fermi muses to Teller ("out of the blue") whether a 
fission explosion could ignite a fusion reaction in deuterium. After some 
study Teller concludes that it is impossible.

10.4   Organizing to Develop Atomic Weapons</h3><pre>
*** From September 1941 To September 1942 ***
Programs to conduct research and development of atomic bombs actually begin 
in Britain and the US The funding during this period is modest, much of the 
basic science remains sketchy. Split between the OSRD and the Army, the US 
program remains disorganized, bureaucratic and, under Compton, weakly lead. 
Theoretical work becomes more detailed, and large scale experiments leading 
toward self-supporting chain reactions begin. Efforts at developing the 
infrastructure to produce atomic weapons (buying materials, buying property, 
assembling a staff with the necessary skills, preparing preliminary 
engineering designs) make little headway.

September 3, 1941 - With PM Winston Churchill's endorsement, the British 
Chiefs of Staff agree to begin development of an atomic bomb.

October 3, 1941 - The MAUD Committee Final Report reaches the US through 
official channels.

October 9, 1941 - Bush brings the MAUD Report to Pres. Roosevelt. FDR 
approves a broader project to investigate the feasibility and to confirm the 
British estimates.

October 21, 1941 - Compton holds a meeting in Schenectady, NY with Lawrence, 
Oppenheimer, George Kistiakowsky, and James Conant (new head of the NDRC), 
reviewing the MAUD Committee report, and the latest US work. The meeting 
ends with a consensus of the likely feasibility of a bomb.

November 1, 1941 - Compton issues the final NAS report endorsing the 
importance of exploring the feasibility of a U-235 bomb. The report is 
delivered to the president by Bush on November 27.

November, 1941 - John Dunning and Eugene Booth at Columbia demonstrate the 
first measurable U-235 enrichment through gaseous diffusion.

December 6, 1941 - A meeting is held in Washington by Bush to organize an 
accelerated research project. Compton remains in charge. Urey is appointed 
to develop gaseous diffusion and heavy water production at Columbia; 
Lawrence will investigate electromagnetic separation at Berkeley; and Eger 
Murphree will develop centrifuge separation and oversee engineering issues. 
Conant advocates pursuing Pu-239, but no decision on this is made.

December 7, 1941 - Pearl Harbor is attacked by a Japanese Naval task force.
December 8, 1941 - The US declares war on Japan.
December 11, 1941 - The US declares war on Germany and Italy following their 
declaration of war on the US.
December 18, 1941 - The first meeting of the S-1 project is held, sponsored 
by the OSRD. S-1 is dedicated to the full scale research development of 
fission weapons.

January, 1942 - 
* Compton creates the Metallurgical Laboratory (Met Lab) at the University 
of Chicago to act as a consolidated research center. He transfers work on 
"uranium burners" - reactors - to it.
* Oppenheimer organizes a program on fast neutron theoretical physics at 
Berkeley.

February, 1942 - Compton asks Gregory Breit to coordinate physics research 
on fast neutron phenomena. At this time available experimental data on all 
aspects of fast neutron reactions and fission is extremely limited and 
imprecise. Theoretical techniques are also rudimentary.

It is essential to realize that in early 1942 fission physics, and fast 
neutron physics in general, was a realm that had been scarcely explored. The 
possibility that any number of undiscovered phenomena might disrupt the 
development of a weapon was quite real, and extensive research would be 
necessary to ensure that the program was not heading into a blind alley. The 
scarcity and poor quality of experimental data was a major problem even if 
no new problems were discovered.

March 23, 1942 - S-1 program leaders discuss priorities. Conant urges 
proceeding with *all* options for producing fissionable material 
simultaneously: gaseous diffusion, centrifuges, electromagnetic separation, 
and plutonium breeding using both graphite and heavy water reactors. He 
argues that redundant development will reduce the time to successful 
production to the shortest possible time, regardless of cost.

April, 1942 - 
* Fermi relocates to Chicago. He builds an experimental pile in the Stagg 
Field squash courts with a projected k value of 0.995, then begins planning 
the construction of the world's first man-made critical pile, to be called 
CP-1. Fermi's efforts now shifts from demonstrating feasibility to securing 
graphite and uranium of adequate purity and in sufficient quantity to build 
the reactor.
* Seaborg arrives in Chicago and starts work on developing an industrial-
scale plutonium separation and purification process.
* Percival Keith of the Kellog Co. begins designing a gaseous diffusion 
pilot plant.

May 18, 1942 - Breit quits, leaving the neutron physics effort without 
leadership. Compton asks Oppenheimer to take over in his place.

May 19, 1942 -  Oppenheimer write Lawrence that the atomic bomb problem was 
solved in principle and that six good physicists should have the details 
mostly worked out in six months. His optimism is based on the belief that 
gun assembly would suffice for both uranium and plutonium.

June, 1942 - 
* Oppenheimer joins the Met Lab to lead an effort on fast neutron physics, 
and prepares an outline for the entire neutron physics program.
* Production of plutonium through marathon irradiation by cyclotron begins.
* Met Lab engineering council begins developing plans for large scale 
plutonium production reactors. 
* Pres. Roosevelt approves a plan for spending $85 million for a weapon 
development program.

June 18, 1942 - Due to continuing, and increasing, organization problems 
Col. James Marshall is ordered by Brig. Gen. Steyr to organize an Army Corps 
of Engineers District to take over and consolidate atomic bomb development.

July to September, 1942 - Oppenheimer assembles theoretical study group in 
Berkeley to examine the principles of bomb design. Included are Oppenheimer, 
Hans Bethe, Teller, John Van Vleck, Felix Bloch, Robert Serber, and Emil 
Konopinski. During the summer the group develops the principles of atomic 
bomb design, and examines the feasibility of fusion bombs. Oppenheimer 
emerges as a natural leader. The group estimates the mass of U-235 required 
for a high yield detonation at 30 kg (estimated at 100 Kt), megaton range 
fusion bombs are also considered highly likely. 

During this period Richard C. Tolman and Serber discuss the idea of using 
explosives to collapse a shell of fissile material in place of the gun 
assembly method. Serber reports that they co-authored a short paper on the 
subject, although this paper has not been found.

At this time Fermi and his staff are busy arranging for the materials 
required for CP-1.

July 27, 1942 -  First shipment of irradiated uranium arrives at the Met Lab 
(300 lb.).
Mid August, 1942 - Fermi's group demonstrates an experimental pile with a 
projected k value of close to 1.04. Achieving a chain reaction is now 
certain.

August 20, 1942 - Seaborg isolates pure plutonium through a separation 
process suitable for industrial scale use.

10.5   The Manhattan Project - The Work Begins in Earnest</h3><pre>
*** From September 1942 To January 1945 ***
This phase is the crash program that continues through the end of the war 
with Japan, and leads to successful development of atomic bombs. Under the 
aggressive and savvy leadership of Brig. Gen. Groves the program shifts into 
high gear, and overtakes all other programs in priority. Virtually unlimited 
money is made available, the only real limitations are how quickly the 
program can absorb funds and find qualified personnel. Very soon after 
taking over three methods of producing fissionable material are chosen for 
full scale development: plutonium production in uranium-graphite reactors, 
and uranium enrichment using gaseous diffusion and electromagnetic 
separation. I have separated the early phase of the Manhattan Project, where 
immense scientific and technical problems had to be overcome to develop 
feasible designs and production methods, from the later phase where firm 
designs were translated into practical hardware and actual combat use was 
planned and executed.

August, 1942 - Col. Marshall of the Army Corps of Engineers creates a new 
District organization with the intentionally misleading name "Manhattan 
Engineer District" (MED).

August 29, 1942 - A status report by Conant is relayed to the Secretary of 
War by Bush indicating the very positive results of Oppenheimer's group. 
Bush adds his concerns about the organization and leadership of the project, 
requesting new leadership be appointed.

September 13, 1942 - A meeting of the S-1 Executive Committee discusses the 
need for a central fast neutron laboratory, to be code-named Project Y.

September 15, 1942 - Starting on this date, and continuing until November 
15, Fermi's group receives shipments of uranium and graphite for CP-1 and 
prepares them for assembly.

September 17, 1942 - Col. Leslie Richard Groves is notified at 10:30 a.m. by 
Gen. Brehon Somervell that his assignment overseas has been cancelled and 
that he will take another assignment - command of the Manhattan Engineer 
District. Groves' previous assignment had required overseeing ten billion 
dollars worth of construction projects, including the construction of the 
Pentagon.

September 18, 1942 - Groves buys 1250 tons of high quality Belgian Congo 
uranium ore stored on Staten Island.

September 19, 1942 - Groves buys Site X, 52000 acres of land on the Clinch 
River in Tennessee, the future site of Oak Ridge. Preliminary construction 
work begins soon after.

September 23, 1942 - Groves is promoted to Brigadier General.

September 26, 1942 -  At Groves' insistence the Manhattan Project is granted 
approval by the War Production Board to use the highest emergency 
procurement priority in existence (AAA) when needed.

September 29, 1942 - Oppenheimer proposes that a "fast-neutron lab" to study 
fast neutron physics and develop designs for an atomic bomb be created. The 
idea at this point is for the lab to be a small research institution, it 
would not be involved in the engineering and production of nuclear weapons.

October, 1942
* Groves puts Du Pont in charge of the plutonium production project.
* Conant recommends to Bush that information exchange with Britain, already 
largely one-way (UK -> US), be sharply restricted. Bush passes this 
recommendation to Roosevelt. As a result the US loses access to British work 
in gaseous diffusion, which seriously delays successful plant completion.
* Centrifuge separation is abandoned due to technical problems.

October 5, 1942 - Groves visits the Met Lab and meets the key scientists, 
including Oppenheimer. He orders key engineering decisions for plutonium 
production, under debate for months, be made in 5 days.

October 15, 1942 - Groves asks Oppenheimer to head Project Y, planned to be 
the new central laboratory for weapon physics research and design.

October 19, 1942 - Vannevar Bush approves Oppenheimer's appointment in 
meeting with Oppenheimer and Groves.

November 3, 1942 - Seaborg reports that due to plutonium's high alpha 
activity, slight amounts of light element impurities can cause a serious 
problem with neutron emission from alpha -> n reactions. This issue caused 
major concern with many project leaders, including Groves and Conant, not 
only due to its own significance, but because it raised apprehension about 
the impact of other unexplored phenomena. (This issue later became moot due 
to the problems with Pu-240 contamination.) Later in the month the Lewis 
Committee is formed to review progress and make recommendations.

November 16, 1942 - 
*   Fermi's group begins constructing CP-1 at Staggs Field using round-the-
clock shifts.
*   Groves and Oppenheimer visit the Los Alamos mesa in New Mexico and 
select it for "Site Y".

December, 1942 - 
* During this month the work on gaseous diffusion is reorganized. On the 
strength of the Lewis Committee's recommendation, gaseous diffusion is 
chosen as the principal enrichment approach. Kellex, a subsidiary of Kellog 
is created to build a plant, Keith is put in charge. Contracts are put in 
place, and hiring begins for plant construction. Kellex immediately begins 
work on a process for producing usable barrier material on an industrial 
scale.
* Bush provides Roosevelt with an estimate placing the total cost for the 
Manhattan Project at $400 million (almost 5 times the previous estimate). 
Roosevelt approves the expenditure.
* Plans and contracts are made for the construction of an experimental 
reactor, plutonium separation plant, and electromagnetic separation facility 
at Oak Ridge.

December 1, 1942 - After 17 days of work, Fermi's group completes CP-1. It 
contains 36.6 metric tons of uranium oxide, 5.6 metric tons of uranium 
metal, and 350 metric tons of graphite. Construction is halted sooner than 
planned when Fermi projects that a critical configuration has been reached.

December 2, 1942 - 3:49 p.m. CP-1 goes critical. It demonstrates a k value 
of 1.0006, and is allowed to reach a thermal output of 0.5 watts (ultimately 
it operates at 200 watts maximum)

December 6, 1943 - M. M. Sundt Company is appointed contractor to build Los 
Alamos Laboratory in a handshake deal. Sundt begins construction 
immediately, without plans or blueprints in order to finish as quickly as 
possible.

January, 1943 - Groves acquires the Hanford Engineer Works, 780 square miles 
of land on the Columbia River in Washington for plutonium production 
reactors and separation plants.

February 18, 1943 - Construction begins at Oak Ridge on buildings for Y-12, 
the electromagnetic U-235 separation plant.

March, 1943 - The original construction program nears completion, and staff 
begins arriving at Los Alamos to begin operations. From this point on the 
site grows non-stop through the end of the war.

March 27, 1943 - Tolman writes Oppenheimer about using explosives to 
collapse a shell into a critical mass. This is the earliest surviving 
reference to the idea of implosion (although this term was not used).

April, 1943 - At the beginning of the month the original building plan for 
Los Alamos is 96% complete. It is already apparent that the original 
construction program is inadequate to meet needs.

A series of staff conferences among the ~100 scientific staff members are 
held at Los Alamos. These include indoctrination lectures by Robert Serber 
(later published as _The Los Alamos Primer_) on April 5,7,9,12, and 14; and 
meetings to plan the laboratory's work from April 15 through May 6. The 
laboratory's initial organization and leadership is worked out.
*  Seth Neddermeyer begins research on implosion, seeking to compress hollow 
metal assemblies.
*  Bethe is selected over Teller to head the theoretical division. Teller is 
soon placed in charge of lower priority research on fusion weapons.
*  Oppenheimer projects that 100 g of 25% enriched U-235 will be produced by 
electromagnetic separation by 1 Jan. 1944.

From the outset the basic plan for developing nuclear weapons at Los Alamos 
was to use gun assembly for both uranium and plutonium bombs. This method 
was well understood from an engineering perspective, and was believed to 
have a high probability of success. Due to the deadline set by Groves, to 
have weapons ready to use by summer 1945 (some 26 months away), two 
important and unusual features for necessary for the program at Los Alamos. 
  First, the traditional division of scientific/industrial work into 
research, design engineering, and production engineering were impossible. 
They had to be conducted concurrently, with overlapping responsibilities and 
duties. Research had to be conducted specifically to produce reliable, 
manufacturable designs as quickly as possible. Scientific research that did 
not directly contribute to this could not be pursued.
 Second, the program had to be redundant. All (or several of the most) 
promising avenues had to pursued simultaneously for nearly every aspect of 
research and development. Unexpected roadblocks could not be permitted to 
delay the delivery of a usable weapon. The decision to pursue the rather 
speculative and initially unpromising implosion idea in addition to the gun 
technique is an example of this of later major significance.
  By the end of the March planning sessions, the necessity of including 
ordnance development activity at Los Alamos was apparent. This greatly 
expanded the scope of work undertaken at the laboratory to engineering 
development, and eventually acting as prime contractor for weapon 
production, and manufacturer of key weapon components (including all nuclear 
components, and the implosion system).

April 1, 1943 - 
* Fencing of the reservation completed, Oak Ridge is closed off to public 
access.
* Construction begins on plant for manufacturing gaseous diffusion barriers 
in Decatur, Ill. although no barrier materials of usable quality have yet 
been produced. 

April 20, 1943 - A contract is concluded with the University of California 
to manage Los Alamos, acting as paymaster, accountant, and procurement 
agency. This contract (back dated to Jan. 1 for work already performed) is 
still in existence and serves as the basis for University of California 
management of both the Los Alamos and Lawrence Livermore laboratories.

May 10, 1943 - The Los Alamos review committee approves the laboratory's 
research program.

May 31, 1943 - Surveying begins for K-25, the gaseous diffusion uranium 
enrichment plant at Oak Ridge.

June, 1943 - Navy Capt. William Parsons arrives at Los Alamos as Ordnance 
Division leader to begin directing gun assembly research.

June 24, 1943 - Working with cyclotron produced plutonium, Emilio Segre 
determines that the spontaneous fission rate is 5 fissions/kg-sec. This is 
well within the assembly speed capability of a high speed gun.

July 4, 1943 - Neddermeyer conducts first explosion in the implosion 
research program (currently consisting of Neddermeyer, and 3 informal 
assistants).

July 10-15, 1943 - The first nuclear physics experiment is conducted at Los 
Alamos (the measurement of Pu-239 fission neutron yield), inaugurating it as 
a functioning laboratory.

August, 1943 - 
*  Despite the efforts of more than 1000 researchers at Kellex and Columbia 
University, no suitable diffusion barrier material has yet been developed.
*  Due to lagging progress on gaseous diffusion, and continuing 
uncertainties about the required amount of U-235 for a bomb, Groves decides 
to double the size of the Y-12 plant.
*  The first Alpha electromagnetic uranium separation unit begins operation. 
Construction staff at Oak Ridge now exceeds 20,000.
*  Construction begins on the cooling systems for the production reactors at 
Hanford. Construction staff is about 5,000.

September 17, 1943 - First shot fired in gun assembly research program at 
Los Alamos. The focus at this point is on developing a high velocity gun for 
plutonium since a uranium gun would be much easier to make.

September 20, 1943 - Johann Von Neumann arrives on a visit to Los Alamos and 
points out the potential for high compression from implosion. This is a 
clear advantage for the technique which would make a bomb more efficient, 
and require a smaller critical mass. Teller and Bethe begin investigating 
the subject theoretically, Oppenheimer and Groves become very interested in 
its potential, and efforts to accelerate the program begin. John Von Neumann 
agrees to work on the physics of implosion in his spare time.

September 23, 1943 - Oppenheimer suggests recruiting George Kistiakowsky, 
the leading explosives research director at OSRD, to aid an expanded 
implosion effort.

October, 1943 - 
*  The first Alpha racetrack (containing 96 units) is completed. A work 
force of 4800 to run Y-12 has been assembled. Start up is unsuccessful due 
to unexplained shorts in the magnets.
*  Project Alberta, the full scale atomic bomb delivery program, begins. 
Norman Ramsey appointed to select and modify aircraft for delivering atomic 
bombs.

October 4, 1943 - Du Pont engineers release reactor design drawings for the 
first Hanford plutonium production pile, B-100, allowing construction to 
begin.

October 10, 1943 - Site preparation starts for the B-100 plutonium 
production reactor at Hanford.

October 21, 1943 - First concrete is poured for the K-25 building at Oak 
Ridge.

November, 1943 - 
*  The top experts in England on fission weapons, many former members of the 
MAUD committee, depart England for the US to assist the atomic bomb project. 
Included are Bohr, Frisch, Peierls, Chadwick, William Penney, George 
Placzek, P.B. Moon, James Tuck, Egon Bretscher, and Klaus Fuchs.
*  The Navy approves Abelson's plan to build a liquid thermal diffusion 
pilot plant for enriching uranium.
*  The world's first sample of plutonium in metal form is produced by 
reducing PuF4 with Ba at the Met Lab.

November 4, 1943 - 
*  The X-10 pile goes critical at Oak Ridge. This air-cooled experimental 
pile begins producing the first substantial (gram) amounts of plutonium to 
assist research into its properties. The world supply of plutonium at this 
time is 2.5 mg, produced by cyclotrons.

*  A Manhattan Project Governing Board meeting approves an ambitious 
implosion research program, intended to develop it to the point of usability 
in six months.

November 29, 1943 - The first B-29 modifications begin at Wright Field, Ohio 
to adapt it for carrying atomic bombs.

December, 1943 - After attempts to bring the first Alpha racetrack into 
operation fail, Y-12 is shut down for equipment rebuilding.
*  Segre measures the spontaneous fission rate of U-235 at Los Alamos, and 
finds it lower than expected. This allows a substantial reduction in 
performance of the planned gun assembly method for uranium.
*  Chemical separation of reactor-produced plutonium begins, using fuel from 
the X-10 pile.

January, 1944 - 
*  Kistiakowsky arrives at Los Alamos to assist Neddermeyer in implosion 
research. It becomes increasingly clear that Neddermeyer's academic research 
style is unsuited to directing a rapidly expanding research and engineering 
program.
*  Problems with developing suitable diffusion barriers leads Groves to 
switch planned production to a new type of barrier, creating months of 
delays in equipping K-25 for operation.
*  Abelson, at the Naval Research Laboratory, begins constructing a thermal 
diffusion uranium enrichment plant. Upon learning about the problems with 
the Manhattan Project's gaseous diffusion plant, he leaks information about 
his technology to Oppenheimer.
*  Groves and Oppenheimer decide to plan for a fission bomb test (none was 
envisioned before this). Groves stipulates that the active material must be 
recoverable if a fizzle occurs, so the construction of Jumbo, a 214 ton 
steel container (25 ft x 12 ft), is authorized.

January 11, 1944 -  An implosion theory group is set up with Teller as head.

February, 1944 - 
*  With the concrete building to house it complete, construction begins on 
the first reactor at Hanford, the B pile.
*  The Los Alamos Governing Board reevaluates deuterium fusion research and 
determines that tritium would be necessary to make an explosive reaction. 
Priority of fusion bomb work is further downgraded.

February 16, 1944 - Kistiakowsky becomes full-time Los Alamos staff member, 
replacing Neddermeyer as leader of implosion research.

March, 1944 - Segre has improved his spontaneous fission estimates in 
cyclotron plutonium (essentially pure Pu-239) to 11 fissions/kg-sec, this is 
still acceptable for gun assembly, but greatly narrows the margin of 
security.

March 3, 1944 - Drop tests of dummy atomic bombs begin from specially 
modified B-29s.

April, 1944 - IBM calculating equipment arrives at Los Alamos and is put to 
work on implosion research.
*  James Tuck suggests idea of using explosive lenses to create spherical 
converging implosion waves.
*  Monsanto begins delivering polonium for initiator research. The rate is 
initially 2.5 curies/month.
*  On April 5 the first sample of reactor produced plutonium arrives from 
Oak Ridge. Segre immediately begins monitoring its spontaneous fission rate. 
By April 15 he makes a preliminary estimate of a spontaneous fission rate of 
over 50 fissions/kg-sec (due to Pu-240 contamination), far too high for gun 
assembly. The report is kept quiet due to limited statistics, and 
observations continue.

May, 1944 - 
*  Los Alamos staff exceeds 1200 employees.
* Six months after the start of accelerated implosion research, little 
progress towards successful implosion has been made. Inadequate diagnostic 
equipment prevent accurate measurement of implosion process, no scheme to 
avoid asymmetry has yet shown promise. The current approach is to use many 
simultaneous detonation points over the surface of a sphere, and try 
different methods of inert spacers or gaps to suppress the shaped charge-
like jets that form when detonation waves from adjacent initiation points 
merge. Spalling (the ejection of fragments) from the interior surface of the 
hollow core is a serious problem, as is simply getting precise simultaneous 
detonation.
*  Teller is removed as head of the implosion theory group, and also from 
fission weapon research entirely, due to conflicts with Bethe and his 
increasing obsession with the idea of the Super (hydrogen bomb).
* Two British scientists join Los Alamos who have important impacts on the 
implosion program. Geoffrey Taylor (arrived May 24) points out implosion 
instability problems (especially the Rayleigh-Taylor instability), which 
ultimately leads to a very conservative design to minimize possible 
instability. James Tuck brings the idea of explosives lenses for detonation 
wave shaping (two-D lenses for plane wave generation originally proposed by 
M. J. Poole in England, 1942), but suggests developing 3-D lenses to create 
a spherical implosion.

May 9, 1944 -  The 50 milliWatt Water Boiler reactor goes critical at Los 
Alamos. Holding 565 g of U-235 (in the form of 14.7% enriched uranyl 
sulfate), dissolved in a 12" sphere of water, this is the world's first 
reactor to use enriched uranium, and the first critical assembly constructed 
at Los Alamos.

May 28, 1944 -  First test of the exploding wire detonator, used to achieve 
precise, reliable simultaneous detonation for implosion.

June, 1944 - 
*  Oppenheimer replaces Neddermeyer with Kistiakowsky as director of 
implosion research.
*  Bethe and Peierls work on developing explosive lens concept.
*  Von Neumann provides design breakthrough for the slow component for 
focusing.

June 3, 1944 - After visiting the uranium enrichment pilot plan at the Naval 
research Laboratory, a team of Manhattan Project experts recommends that a 
thermal diffusion plant be built to feed enriched material to the 
electromagnetic enrichment plant at Oak Ridge.

June 18, 1944 - 
*  Groves contracts to have S-50, a liquid thermal diffusion uranium 
enrichment plant, built at Oak Ridge in no more than three months.

July, 1944 - 
*  Experiments with explosive lens designs begin by mid-month when 2-D 
models are fired.
*  The design for the gun gadget neutron initiator is completed.

July 4, 1944 - Oppenheimer reveals Segre's spontaneous fission measurements 
to the Los Alamos staff. The neutron emission for reactor-produced plutonium 
is too high for gun assembly to work. The measured rate is 50 fissions/kg-
sec, the fission rate in Hanford plutonium is expected to be over 100 times 
higher still.

The discovery of the high spontaneous fission rate of reactor-produced 
plutonium was a turning point for Los Alamos, the Manhattan Project, and 
eventually for the practice of large scale science after the war. The 
planned plutonium gun had to be abandoned, and Oppenheimer was forced to 
make implosion research a top priority, using all available resources to 
attack it. A complete reorganization of Los Alamos Laboratory is required. 
With just 12 months to go before expected weapon delivery a new fundamental 
technology, explosive wave shaping, has to be invented, made reliable, and a 
enormous array of engineering problems had to be solved. During this crisis 
the many foundations for post-war science were laid. Scientist-
administrators (as opposed to academic or research scientists) came to the 
forefront for running large scale research efforts. Automated numerical 
techniques (as opposed to manual analytical ones) were applied to solve 
important scientific problems, not just engineering applications. The 
dispersal of key individuals after the end of the war later carried these 
insights, as well as the earlier organizational principles developed at Los 
Alamos throughout American academia and industry.

July 1, 1944 - The Manhattan Project is granted the highest project-wide 
procurement priority (AA-1).

July 20, 1944 - The Los Alamos Administrative Board decides on a 
reorganization plan to direct the laboratorys full resources on implosion. 
Instead of being organized around scientific and engineering areas of 
expertise, all work is organized around whether it applies to implosion, or 
the uranium gun weapon, with the former receiving most of the resources. The 
reorganization is completed in less than two weeks.

August, 1944 - 
*  The Air Force begins modifying 17 B-29s for combat delivery of atomic 
weapons at the Glenn L. Martin plant in Omaha.
*  Parsons assesses February 1945 as the earliest an implosion lens system 
can be ready for full scale test "with extremely good breaks", and most 
likely late 1945.
* A. Francis Birch takes over the uranium gun project.

September, 1944 - 
*  Air Force Lt. Col. Paul Tibbets begins organizing the 509th Composite 
Group, which will deliver atomic bombs in combat, at Wendover Field, Utah.
*	At this point K-25 is half built, but no usable diffusion barriers have been produced. The Y-12 plant is operating at only 0.05% efficiency. The total production of highly enriched 
uranium to date is a few grams.

Now, less than one year before the eventual use of atomic weapons, the 
prospects for developing atomic weapons in time to assist the war effort 
look grim despite enormous expenditures. The only workable bomb design at 
hand, the gun-type weapon, requires U-235 which has no practical production 
methods available. Plutonium production has not yet begun, but the 
production techniques appear to have a high probability of success. However 
plausible approaches to building a plutonium bomb do not exist.

A workable theory of explosive lenses does not exist (and is not solved 
before the end of the war), so trial and error techniques must be used for 
development. Unfortunately, observing implosions is extremely difficult and 
simply obtaining diagnostic data is a major barrier to success. 
Manufacturing test lenses is a serious problem. The explosives are difficult 
materials to work with and made delicate castings, mold making was a slowly 
developing art, and the lenses required very good quality control. During 
the last year of the project over 20,000 test lenses were actually used, 
many times this number were made and rejected. Developing a simultaneous 
initiation system is also a problem, as is supplying good detonators in 
sufficient numbers to support the test program. In light of these problems, 
research also continued on the non-lensed implosion approach.

During the fall Robert Christy suggests the "Christy gadget", the use of a 
solid core that is raised to supercriticality solely by compressing the 
metal to twice normal density. This conservative implosion design avoids 
instability and spalling problems, but the period of maximum compression is 
brief and requires a "modulated initiator" (a neutron generator that emits a 
burst at a precise moment). Earlier shell designs could have relied on 
spontaneous fission and still achieved reasonable efficiency.

September 16, 1944 - S-50 enrichment plant begins partial operation at Oak 
Ridge, but leaks prevent substantial output.

September 22, 1944 - The first RaLa implosion test shot is made. This 
diagnostic technique used 100 curies of radiolanthanum produced by the X-
Reactor at Oak Ridge to provide an intense gamma source for making 
observations of implosion (essentially an internal x-ray generator). This is 
the largest radioisotope source ever assembled in the world up to this time.

September 26, 1944 - Loading uranium into the first full scale plutonium 
reactor, the B pile, at Hanford is completed. This reactor contains 200 tons 
of uranium metal, 1200 tons of graphite, and is cooled by 5 m^3 of 
water/sec. It designed to operate at 250 megawatts, producing some 6 kg of 
plutonium a month. Fermi supervises reactor start-up.

September 27-30, 1944 - After several hours of operation at 100 megawatts, 
the B pile inexplicably shuts down, then starts up again by itself the next 
day. Within a few days this is determined to be due to poisoning by the 
highly efficient neutron absorber Xenon-135, a radioactive fission product. 
The reactor must be modified to add extra reactivity to overcome this effect 
before production can begin.

October 12, 1944 - The first B-29s arrive in the Mariana Islands to begin 
bombing Japan. Japan has so far remained free from air attacks (except for 
the symbolic Doolittle raid in 1942).

October 27, 1944 - Oppenheimer approves plans for a bomb test in the Jornada 
del Muerto valley at the Alamagordo Bombing Range. Groves approves 5 days 
later, provided that the test be conducted in Jumbo.

November, 1944 - Y-12 output has reached 40 grams of highly enriched uranium 
a day.

November 24, 1944 - The first B-29 raid on Japan begins. 100 planes are 
launched, only 16 bombs hit the target factory.

December, 1944 - 
*  Y-12 output climbs to 90 grams of highly enriched uranium a day.
*  Work begins on an implosion initiator for the solid core bomb, it is not 
clear at this point if one can be made.

Mid-December, 1944 - First successful explosive lens tests conducted at Los 
Alamos, establishing the feasibility of making an implosion bomb.

December 17, 1944 - The D pile goes critical with sufficient reactivity to 
overcome fission product poisoning effects. Large scale plutonium production 
begins.

December 22, 1944 - First Fat Man bomb assembly is completed as production 
gets underway. Explosive lenses and nuclear material are not yet available, 
the bomb assemblies are used for airdrop and ground handling practice.

December 26, 1944 - Processing of irradiated uranium slugs to separate 
plutonium begins at Hanford.

December 28, 1944 - The modified B pile is restarted.

10.6   Racing Against Victory - The Final Year</h3><pre>
*** From January 1, 1945 to VJ Day ***
At the start of 1945 the Manhattan Project has turned the corner'. The 
uranium bombs seem assured of success in a matter of months. The prospects 
for the plutonium bomb are looking up although meeting an August 1 deadline 
imposed by Groves is far from certain. However, allied military successes 
against Germany and Japan make it a horse race to see whether it will matter 
to the war effort.

January, 1945 - 
*  Y-12 output reaches an average of 204 grams of 80% U-235 a day; projected 
production of sufficient material for a bomb (~40 kg) is July 1.
*  Usable barrier tubes begin arriving at the K-25 plant.
*  160 g of plutonium from the X-Pile is on hand at Los Alamos. The first 
shipment from Hanford has not yet arrived.

January 18, 1945 - The Dragon experiment, conducted by Frisch in which a U-
235 hydride slug is dropped through a barely subcritical U-235 hydride 
assembly creates the world's first assembly critical through prompt neutrons 
alone (prompt critical). The largest energy production for a drop is 20 
megawatts for 3 milliseconds (the temperature rises 6 degrees C in that 
time).

January 20, 1945 - 
*  Curtis LeMay takes command of the Twentieth Air Force in Marianas. Fleet 
contains 345 aircraft, but in three months of bombing none of the nine top 
priority targets have been destroyed.
*  The first stage of the K-25 plant is charged with uranium hexafluoride 
and begins operation.

January 31, 1945 - Robert Bacher reports to Oppenheimer that a Po-210/Be-9 
implosion initiator (still to be designed) is possible.

February, 1945 - 
*  The F reactor goes on-line at Hanford, raising theoretical production 
capacity to 21 kg/month.
*  Uranium gun design is completed and frozen. Only planning for deployment 
and combat use once the U-235 is delivered is now required (although studies 
of an improved gun design, begun on Dec. 7 and later abandoned, are 
underway).
*  Planning for an implosion bomb test begins in earnest.
*  Initiator tests begin. Demand for polonium rises to 100 curies/month.
*  Plutonium begins arriving from Hanford.
*  Admiral Nimitz, Commander in Chief, Pacific Ocean Areas, is notified of 
the nature of the atomic bomb project. 
*  Tinian Island is selected as the base of operations for atomic attack.

February 13, 1945 - Dresden, Germany is burned down in an incendiary raid 
killing 50,000.

February 19, 1945 - Marines land on Iwo Jima, a Japanese observation post 
for the B-29 raids. Over the next two months 6,281 marines are killed, and 
21,865 are wounded in capturing the island from 20,000 defenders.

February 23, 1945 - A fire bomb test raid on Tokyo with 172 planes burns one 
square mile, the most destructive raid on Japan to date.

February 28, 1945 - A meeting between Oppenheimer, Groves, Kistiakowsky, 
Conant, Tolman, Bethe, and Charles Lauritsen is held to fix the design 
approach for the plutonium bomb. It is agreed that work will focus on the 
solid core Christy gadget, use explosive lenses, use a modulated initiator, 
and electric detonators. The use of Composition B and Baratol for the lenses 
was also decided, as was the multiple lens configuration and detonator 
arrangement. However none of these approaches or components have been proved 
yet. Solid core compression has not been demonstrated at this time. A 
schedule for completing research, development, engineering, and testing is 
also established. The (partial) goals are:
     15 April Solve detonator timing problem
     15 April Have detonators in full production
     15 April Begin large-scale lens production
     25 April Begin hemisphere shots to measure shock wave convergence 
     15 May   Demonstrate implosion compression in full scale test
      4 June  Begin lens fabrication for Trinity test
      4 July  Begin assembly of Trinity test gadget 

March, 1945 - S-50 thermal diffusion plant finally begins enriching uranium 
in quantity.

March 1, 1945 - The powerful Cowpuncher Committee is organized to "ride 
herd" on implosion bomb development.

March 5, 1945 - Oppenheimer officially freezes explosive lens design.

March 9-10, 1945 - LeMay launches an all-out low altitude fire bomb raid on 
Tokyo with 334 B-29s, stripped of guns for greater bomb load, carrying 2000 
tons of incendiaries. 15.8 square miles of Tokyo burn, killing at least 
100,000 people, injuring 1,000,000 (41,000 seriously).

March 11-18, 1945 - During these eight days fire raids with similar tactics 
are launched on Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe; the second, third, and fourth 
largest cities in Japan. An additional 16 square miles of city are burned, 
killing more than 50,000 people.

Mid-March, 1945 - The first evidence of solid compression from implosion is 
observed (5%).

April 3, 1945 - Preparations begin at Tinian Island to support the 509th 
Composite Group, and to assembly the atomic bombs.

April 11, 1945 - Oppenheimer reports that Kistiakowsky has achieved optimal 
performance with implosion compression in sub-scale tests.

April 12, 1945 - 
*  Otto Frisch completes criticality and "zero-yield" experiments with U-235 
at Los Alamos.
*  Pres. Roosevelt dies of a brain hemorrhage.

April 13, 1945 - Pres. Truman learns of the existence of atomic bomb 
development from Secretary of War Henry Stimson.

April 25, 1945 - Truman receives first in-depth briefing on the Manhattan 
Project from Stimson and Groves.

Although no atomic bombs yet exist, there is no longer any doubt about their 
imminent availability. Firm production schedules are in hand, and technical 
effort has already shifted to improving designs and production techniques. 
Producing reliable detonators in the required quantities (thousands each 
week) remains a problem. The dominant events in this final epoch of the war 
is the suspense of the first atomic test, and the political and military 
preparations for actual use. At this point, about 25 kg of U-235, and 6.5 kg 
of Pu-239 are on hand.

April 27, 1945 - The first meeting of the Target Committee to select targets 
for atomic bombing. Seventeen targets are selected for study: Tokyo Bay (for 
a non-lethal demonstration), Yokohama, Nagoya, Osaka, Kobe, Hiroshima, 
Kokura, Fukuoka, Nagasaki, and Sasebo (some of these are soon dropped 
because they had already been burned down).

April 30, 1945 - 
*  Initiator Committee (Bethe, Fermi and Christy) selects the most promising 
design for fission initiator (neutron generator) to be used in the implosion 
bomb. The "Urchin" design is favored, and work on initiator fabrication 
begins.
*  First batch of supplies for the atomic bomb deployment leaves for Tinian 
from Wendover Field, UT.

May 2, 1945 - The first Raytheon Mark II X-Unit arrives for detonation 
testing.

May 7, 1945 - The 100-ton test is conducted. 108 tons of TNT, laced with 
1000 curies of reactor fission products, are exploded 800 yards from Trinity 
ground zero to test instrumentation for Trinity. This is the largest 
instrumented explosion conducted up to this date.

May 8, 1945 - V-E Day. Germany formally capitulates to the allies.

May 9, 1945 - General procedures for atomic bombing are completed by D.M. 
Dennison, under Parsons.

May 10-11, 1945 - Target Committee reconvenes. On the committee now are 
Oppenheimer,  Von Neumann, Parsons, and Bethe. Meeting discusses issues 
combat employment of atomic bombs (e.g. proper burst height, etc.). Target 
list is shortened to Kyoto, Hiroshima, Yokohama, and Kokura Arsenal (Niigata 
is considered).

Mid-May, 1945 - Little Boy is ready for combat use, except for the U-235 
core. It is estimated sufficient material will be available by 1 August.

May 25, 1945 - 
*  464 B-29s raid Tokyo again, burning out nearly 16 square miles of the 
remaining city. Only a few thousand are killed, urban inhabitants have 
learned to flee fire bomb attacks quickly and escape the flames.
*  Operation OLYMPIC, the invasion of Kyushu (the southern Japanese island), 
is set for November 1.

May 28, 1945 - Target Committee meets with Lt. Col. Tibbets in attendance. 
The meeting reviews preparation for delivering atomic bombs, and status of 
conventional bombing of Japan. Tibbets estimates that by Jan. 1, 1946 all 
major cities of Japan will have been destroyed by fire bombing. The target 
list is now Kyoto, Hiroshima, and Niigata.

May 30, 1945 - Sec. of War Stimson rules out Kyoto, the ancient capital of 
Japan, as a target for atomic attack.

May 31, 1945 - Critical mass tests with plutonium begin at Los Alamos.

June 1, 1945 - The Interim Committee, organized to guide the final conduct 
of the war and the post-war reconstruction and lead by Secretary of State 
Designate James Byrnes, issues the recommendations that the atomic bomb be 
dropped as soon as possible, that a urban area be the target, and that no 
prior warning be given.

June 10, 1945 - 509th Composite Group crews begin arriving on Tinian with 
their modified B-29s.

June 21, 1945 - The first implosion initiator is ready.

June 24, 1945 - Frisch confirms that the implosion core design is 
satisfactory after criticality tests.

June 27, 1945 - Groves meets with Oppenheimer and Parsons to plan delivery 
of atomic bombs to the Pacific theater.

Late June, 1945 - 
*  LeMay estimates that the Twentieth Air Force will finish destroying the 
60 most important cities in Japan by Oct. 1.
*  The T-5 group in the Los Alamos T (Theory) Division estimates the Trinity 
explosion yield at 4-13 Kt.

July, 1945 - Final preparations begin at the New Mexico test site, the 
Jornada del Muerto at the Alamagordo Bombing Range, for the first atomic 
bomb test, code named Trinity. The date is set for July 16. Jumbo is not 
used in the test, since plutonium delivery schedules make recovery of active 
material (in the event of a fizzle) less important.

July 3, 1945 - Casting of the U-235 projectile for Little Boy is completed.

July 6, 1945 - Machining of the uranium reflector for the Trinity test 
completed.

July 7, 1945 - Explosives lens casting for Trinity completed.

July 10, 1945 - The best available lens castings are selected for Trinity.

July 11, 1945 - 
*  Assembly of Gadget, the first atomic bomb begins.
*  Japanese Foreign Minister Shigenori Togo cables Ambassador Naotake Sato 
in Moscow advising him to explore using the USSR as an intermediary in 
surrender negotiations.

July 12-13, 1945 - The plutonium core and the Gadget components leave Los 
Alamos for the test site separately. Assembly of Gadget begins at 1300 hours 
on July 13. Assembly of Gadget's explosive lens, uranium reflector, and 
plutonium core is completed at Ground Zero at 1745 hours. 

July 14, 1945 - 
*  Gadget is hoisted to the top of the 100 foot test tower, and the 
detonators are installed and connected. Final test preparations begin.
*  Little Boy bomb units, accompanied by the U-235 projectile, are shipped 
out of San Francisco on the USS. Indianapolis for Tinian. 
*  The only full scale test of the implosion lens system (before Gadget) is 
conducted. Initial analysis indicates failure. Bethe later corrects mistaken 
calculations and finds that the measurements are consistent with optimum 
performance.

July 16, 1945 - At 5:29:45 a.m. Gadget is detonated in the first atomic 
explosion in history. The explosive yield is 20-22 Kt (initially estimated 
at 18.9 Kt), vaporizing the steel tower.

July 19, 1945 - Oppenheimer suggest to Groves that the U-235 from Little Boy 
be reworked into uranium/plutonium composite cores for making more implosion 
bombs (4 implosion bombs could be made from Little Boy's pit). Groves 
rejects the idea since it would delay combat use.

July 20, 1945 - The 509th begins flying practice missions over Japan.

July 23, 1945 - Stimson, in Potsdam for meeting between Truman and Stalin, 
receives current target list. In order of choice it is: Hiroshima, Kokura, 
and Niigata. He also receives an estimate of atomic bomb availability: Fat 
Man should be ready for use on Aug. 6, second Fat Man-type by Aug. 24, 3 
should be available in September, and more each month - reaching 7 or more 
in December.
*  First A-bomb test unit dropped by 509th at Tinian.
*  Combat hemispheres for Fatman are fabricated.

July 24, 1945 - 
*  Truman discloses the existence of the atomic bomb to Stalin (who had 
already been informed about it by his spies).
*  Groves drafts the directive authorizing the use of the atomic bombs as 
soon as bomb availability and weather permit. It lists the following targets 
in order of priority: Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki. This 
directive constitutes final authorization for atomic attack, no further 
orders are issued.
*  The U-235 target for Little Boy is cast at Los Alamos.

July 25, 1945 - Peer de Silva, the official courier for the Fatman core, 
signs for 6.1 kg of plutonium at Los Alamos.

July 26, 1945 - 
*  Truman issues the Potsdam Declaration, requiring unconditional surrender 
of the Japanese armed forces.
*  The Indianapolis delivers Little Boy bomb units, and the U-235 projectile 
to Tinian.
*  Five C-54 transport planes leave Kirtland Air Force Base, Albuquerque 
with: the Little Boy U-235 target (its final component); the Fat Man 
plutonium core, and its initiator.

July 28, 1945 - 
*  The Japanese government rejects the Potsdam surrender demand.
*  The five C-54 transports arrive at Tinian. All components for Little Boy 
are now on site, but no Fat Man bomb assemblies have yet arrived.

July 30, 1945 - The nuclear components (target, projectile, and 4 
initiators) are inserted into bomb unit number L11.

July 31, 1945 - The assembly of Little Boy is completed. It is ready for use 
the next day.

August 1, 1945 - A typhoon approaching Japan prevents launching an attack 
with Little Boy. Several days are required for weather to clear.

August 2, 1945 - Fat Man bomb cases F-31 and F-32 arrive on Tinian. Fat Man 
assembly begins. Bombing date is set for August 11.

August 4, 1945 - Tibbets briefs the 509th Composite Group about the 
impending attack. He reveals that they will drop immensely powerful bombs, 
but the nature of the weapons are not revealed.

August 5, 1945 - 
*  At 1500 Gen. LeMay officially confirms the mission for the next day. 
Tibbets will take over as pilot, Parsons will fly as weaponeer. 
*  Tibbets names B-29 No. 82 the "Enola Gay" after his mother, over the 
objections of its pilot Robert Lewis.
*  Little Boy is loaded on the plane.
*  Dummy Fat Man unit F33 (complete except for plutonium core) is prepared 
for practice bombing run.

August 6, 1945 - 
*  0000, final briefing, the target of choice is Hiroshima. Tibbets is 
pilot, Lewis is co-pilot.
*  0245, Enola Gay begins takeoff roll.
*  0730, the bomb is armed.
*  0850, Flying at 31,000 ft Enola Gay crosses Shikoku due east of 
Hiroshima.
*  Bombing conditions are good, the aimpoint is easily visible, no 
opposition is encountered.
*  0915:17 Little Boy is released at 31060 feet.
*  0916:02 (8:16:02 Hiroshima time) Little Boy explodes at an altitude of 
1850 feet, 550 feet from the aim point, the Aioi Bridge, with a yield of 
12.5-18 Kt (best estimate 15 Kt).

August 7, 1945 - 
*  In the absence of an immediate surrender, a crash effort begins to print 
and distribute millions of leaflets to major Japanese cities warning of 
future atomic attacks.
*  The date for dropping Fat Man is moved up to August 10, then to August 9, 
to avoid a projected 5 days of bad weather. This requires skipping many 
check out procedures during assembly.

August 8, 1945 - 
* At Foreign Minister Togo's request Ambassador Sato tries to persuade the 
Soviets to mediate surrender negotiations. Molotov cancel's the meeting, 
then announces that the Soviet Union is at war with Japan effective the next 
day.
* Leaflet dropping, and warnings to Japan by Radio Saipan begin (Nagasaki 
does not receive warning leaflets until August 10).
*  Fat Man unit F33 is dropped in practice bomb run.
*  Assembly of Fat Man unit F31 with the plutonium core completed in the 
early morning.
*  2200, Fat Man is loaded on B-29 "Bock's Car".

August 9, 1945 -
*  0347, Bock's Car takes off from Tinian, the target of choice is Kokura 
Arsenal. Charles Sweeney is pilot. Soon after takeoff he discovers that the 
fuel system will not pump from the 600 gallon reserve tank.
*  1044, Bock's Car arrives at Kokura but finds it covered by haze, the 
aimpoint cannot be seen. Flak and fighters appear, forcing the plane to stop 
searching for it. Sweeney turns toward Nagasaki, the only secondary target 
in range.
*  Upon arriving at Nagasaki, Bock's Car has enough fuel for only one pass 
over the city even with an emergency landing at Okinawa. Nagasaki is covered 
with clouds, but one gap allows a drop several miles from the intended 
aimpoint. 
*  11:02 (Nagasaki time) Fat Man explodes at 1950 feet near the perimeter of 
the city, scoring a direct hit on the Mitsubishi Steel and Arms Works. Yield 
is 19-23 Kt (best estimate 21 Kt).
*  Oppenheimer cable Groves with the following shipping schedule: 11 Aug. 
first quality HE unit; 12 Aug. next plutonium core; 14 Aug. another first 
quality HE unit.

August 10, 1945 - Japanese civilian and military leaders are still unable to 
agree on accepting the Potsdam Decree's surrender terms. Emperor Hirohito 
instead breaks the tradition of imperial non-intervention in government and 
orders that surrender be accepted, provided that the Emperor be allowed to 
retain his position.

August 11, 1945 - 
*  Truman and Sec. of State Byrnes reply with an amended form of the Potsdam 
Decree that acknowledges the Emperor, but still refuses to guarantee his 
position.
*  Groves reports that the second plutonium core would be ready for shipment 
on August 12 or 13, with a bombing possible on August 17 or 18.
*  Truman orders a halt to further atomic bombing until further orders are 
issued.
*  Groves decides to delay shipping the second Pu core and contacts Bacher 
just after he had signed receipt for shipping the core to Tinian. The core 
is retrieved from car before it leaves Los Alamos. 
*  Strategic Air Forces Carl Spaatz halts area fire bombing.

August 13, 1945 - 
*  Stimson recommends shipping the second plutonium core to Tinian.
*  Truman orders area fire bombing resumed. Gen. Henry Arnold, US Army Air 
Force, launches the largest raid on Japan of the war with over 1000 B-29s 
and other aircraft, carrying 6000 tons of bombs.

August 14, 1945 -
*  Following leaflet bombing of Tokyo with surrender terms, Hirohito orders 
that an Imperial Edict accepting surrender be issued.
*  2:49 p.m. (1:49 a.m. Washington time), Japanese news agency announces 
surrender.

August 17, 1945 - Oppenheimer warns Stimson that:
1. atomic weapons would improve qualitatively and quantitatively over coming 
years;
2. adequate defenses against nuclear weapons would not be developed;
3. the US would not retain hegemony over nuclear weapons;
4. wars could not be prevented even if better nuclear weapons were 
developed.

October 16, 1945 - Oppenheimer resigns as director of Los Alamos, accepting 
a post at Caltech.

October 17, 1945 - Norris Bradbury takes over as director of Los Alamos (a 
position he would hold for 25 years).

10.7   Chronology of Atomic Weapons in the Soviet Union
1910 - 
* Mineralogist Vladimir I. Vernadski advocates exploring and developing 
radioactive mineral deposits in Russia because of their potential as sources 
of energy. 
* A pitchblende/vanadium deposit is discovered at Tiuia-Muiun in the Fergana 
Valley of Uzbekistan, and a mine is opened.

1921 -  Vitali Grigorievich Khlopin pioneers radiochemistry in the Soviet 
Union and extracts radium for medical use.

1922 -  Vernadski founds the State Radium Institute in Petrograd.

<h1>MILNET:  Indicators - Libya</h1>
</center>
<img src="/milnet/rainbar3.gif">
<p>
See <a href="/milnet/travwarn.htm">Travel Warnings</a> and specifically the
travel warning for <a href="http://travel.state.gov/libya.html">Libya</a>
, serve as an excellent real time indicator.
<p>
The following events have taken place in Libya:
<p>
<b>Libya</b>
<dl><dd>
<b>Events</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Libyan Prison Erupts in Violence, June 1996: Abu Saleem prison, guards were
seized as hostages, some 100 people killed in the fighting, including guards
and prisoners. 
<li>Libyan Soccor Crowd Riots, July 1996: 8 killed, 39 injured.  Rioters spilled into the streets around the Soccer stadium burning cars and throwing rocks.
<p>
</ul>
<b>Analysis</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Expenditures made by Libyan Government (essentially by Mohamar Khadaffi)
have really pissed the citzenery off.
<li>Khaddaffi has authorized the shooting on sight of dissedents in Libya
<li>Police burned down shops of suspected militants
<li>Four years of UN Sanctions have taken their tole (imposed after the
Libyan government refused to turn over men suspected of blowing up an 
airliner over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988 which
killed 270 people.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Possible Indications</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Wishful thinking might indicate nationwide rebellion is fulminating in
Libya.
<li>Clearly Khadaffi's rule is showing signs of strain, or more accurately, 
the people appear to be less afraid to show their true feelings.
<li>More political unrest is predicted.
<li>Western nations are likely to take advantage of this unrest and give 
aid to the dissidents in hopes of unseating Khadaffi.
<li>Khadaffi is posed to perform a horrible act of violence, much like
the Chinese government did in the Tinimin Square.
<li>Unfortunately, the government in exile is not thought to be strong 
enough to takeover if Khadaffi falls, so it will be up to Western powers to
bolster any new government.  
<li>Libya requires a strong leader by the nature of the tribal structure 
that Khadaffi has continue to foster despite the rest of the Islamic world's
forward movement.
<li>More indicators will follow before we see clear signs of Khadaffi's fall.

<h1>MILNET:  Indicators - Colombia</h1>
</center>
<img src="/milnet/rainbar3.gif">
<p>
See <a href="/milnet/travwarn.htm">Travel Warnings</a> and specifically the
travel warning for <a href="http://travel.state.gov/colombia_announce3.html">Colombia</a>
, serve as an excellent real time indicator.
<p>
The following events have taken place in Libya:
<p>
<b></b>
<dl><dd>
<b>Events</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>U.S. revokes travel visa for President Ernesto Samper, thus preventing a 
crucial meeting on drug control between U.S. and Colombian leaders.  Reasons 
given by the U.S. are that Samper is suspected of ties with drug cartels and
that the cartels funded his election campaign.
<li>Well respected Colombian newspaper calls for Samper's resignation.
<p>
</ul>
<b>Analysis</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>U.S. officials are putting heavy pressure to remove Samper
<li>Local pressure growing as well, as public knowlege of the possible
cartel links spreads.
<li>Despite all that has happened so far, it appears there are pockets of
good will for Samper, as several areas he has visited have come out in 
support of him.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Possible Indications</b>
<ul type=disc>
<li>Like Manual Noriega, Samper may face world court and possibly U.S. 
drug charges
<li>However, unless he loses more popular support there will be enough
support to ensure he has some power base left.
<li>Seems likely the pressure will be successful, and Samper will step 
down, but will probably avoid capture and extredition
<li>Western nations are likely to take advantage of this unrest and give 
aid to the dissidents in hopes of unseating Samper. 
<li>Khadaffi is posed to perform a horrible act of violence, much like
the Chinese government did in the Tinimin Square.
<li>Unfortunately, the government in exile is not thought to be strong 
enough to takeover if Khadaffi falls, so it will be up to Western powers to
bolster any new government.  
<li>Libya requires a strong leader by the nature of the tribal structure 
that Khadaffi has continue to foster despite the rest of the Islamic world's
forward movement.

       THE TERRORIST PROFILE WEEKLY FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS
      ---------------------------------------------------------


Written Saturday 11-5-94 in a beach house in Maryland.


By Chris DiBona  <a href="mailto:cdibona@mason1.gmu.edu"><i>cdibona@mason1.gmu.edu</i></a>

--------------------------------------------------------

Introduction:

First who I am......
                            
   My name is Chris, I just in October turned 23 years old, I
   work in Washington DC at the US Department of State in two
   different sections of Information Management. I work in both
   the foreign affairs data processing center (FADPC) and in the
   Modernization office. Note that this does not mean that I am
   anything but a slave gopher. 
        
   In my capacity as a wunderkind (I'm modest too.) I got to see
   a lot of the more up to date projects going on in the department.
   One I really liked was the cd rom projects that published the
   foriegn affairs manual (3000 pages at a paper cost of $2000 a 
   set, or a $2 cd-rom.) The same department that published them also
   puts out a foreign affairs CD-Rom with post reports, and annual 
   reports of the department. One of these annual reports is, you
   guessed it, The Profiles of Global Terrorism.

   So, I figured I'd been taking so much info from the net and gaining
   so much benefit from the internet and all its denizens, that I 
   should give something back to it. Thats' what the Terrorist
   Profile Weekly (TPW) is. 

   So I checked with Diplomatice Security and the Counter Terrorism
   folks and they all had no problem with me re-publishing, so
   I started this list up in january.

   By march I had only 150 or so subscribers, not counting the WELL
   who keeps it on its' gopher site. Then two things happened, normal
   growth , friends telling friends and such, and recognition, in
   the pages of The Montreal X-Press and Internet World. 

   So now, Early november, there are 750 subscribers world wide! I
   would like to thank you , my readers for some pretty cool additions
   to my vanity wall. 

   Past that, what follows are the FAQ posed to me. This faq will
   be sent out to all new subscribers. (If I spelled anything wrong,
   please email so I can stave off any furthur embarassment)

   Note also that this list and faq is dedicated to Alison Merrill.

        Your Editor -
                Chris DiBona

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

1)  Where can I get more info?

Not from me basically, I am as much a student of terrorism as all of
you (and probably less than most) In my position at the Department I
don't come in contact with terrorism info, and if I did, I probably
wouldn't be able to talk about it. Your best bet is to call the
state departments main number at (202)647-4000. Ask for the Public
Affairs division. The people there are employed to help you in your
pursuit of information.

2) Can I get in touch with the xxxxx terrorist group through you?

Ah, not quite. If a terrorist group wants contact , they're not
going to bother with me. But if you are a member of a terrorist
group, send me an anonymous email and I'll keep it in mind. I
will republish any opinions from a source, with clarifiers like
"This individual claims to be a member of...... I take no
responsibility for any falsehood therein... blah blah,"

3) Why are these out of date sometimes?

Cause I'm lazy, I'm working from 1992 info, I really am just a cut
and paste type guy from the Profiles. 

4) Do you have a logo for xxxxx terrorist group?

No. Never. Natch. There are some logos in the the publications
"Violence against Americans Abroad" (more on this later) but
I don't have any plans to scan and uuencode these at any time.
One thing to keep in mind, I work , go to school to get my degree
and have a social life. The TPW is a hobby, as I can't devote too
much time to it.

5) Why haven't I recived a profile in xxxx days?

Cause I'm buzy, see the last couple of lines of Question #4.

6) What happens when you run out of groups??

Oops, this actually has already happened, but that's okay. I'm scurrying
up some more profile for me to use. Also, I'm going to begin reporting 
from the pages of "Violence against americans abroad" which tells
us the startling tales of kidnappings, murders and other such things
overseas, this another annual work which I've gotten my hands on.

7) Do you have an index of the profiles?

No, I've been meaning too, I just don't have any real time, maybe over
christmas I'll type one up, but then again..... maybe not. It took me
8 months to put out a FAQ for chrisakes.

8) Where else can I find this info.

>From you local american embassy. From the Well gopher. On CD-Rom in the
Big Green CD, coming out soon. I'll announce it when it releases. The State
Department proper.

9) Anything else ?

Yeah, remember, I make a point of staying detached from the issues that
these groups fight about, that's all. If you see a group which you
sympathize with being treated with little respect in the profiles, remember
please that this is the position of the government and the State Department,
so don't blame the messenger. 

10) Are you sure that's it?

No, actually one more thing , I didn't think that the movies True Lies 
had/has a political agenda.

DESCRIPTION
The    PIJ    originated    among    militant    Palestinian
fundamentalists in the Gaza Strip during the 1970s. The  PIJ
may  be a series of loosely affiliated factions, rather than
a cohesive group. The PIJ is committed to the creation of an
Islamic  Palestinian  state and the  destruction  of  Israel
through  holy war. Because of its strong support for Israel,
the  United  States has been identified as an enemy  of  the
PIJ. The PIJ also opposes moderate Arab governments that  it
believes have been tainted by Western secularism.

ACTIVITIES
The  PIJ  demonstrated  its terrorist  credentials  when  it

*30>  PALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION   (PLO)

DESCRIPTION
Founded  in  1964  as  a  Palestinian  nationalist  umbrella
organization   dedicated   to  the   establishment   of   an
independent  Palestinian state. After the 1967  Arab-Israeli
war,  control  devolved  to the leadership  of  the  various
fedayeen  militia  groups, the most dominant  of  which  was
Yasser Arafat's Al-Fatah. In 1969, Arafat became chairman of
the PLO's Executive Committee, a position he still holds. In
the   early  1980s,  PLO  became  fragmented  into   several
contending  groups  but  remains the preeminent  Palestinian
organization.  The  United  States  considers  the  PLO   an
umbrella organization that includes
several constituent groups and individuals holding differing
views on terrorism. At the same time, US policy accepts that
elements of the PLO have advocated, carried out, or accepted
responsibility  for acts of terrorism. PLO  Chairman  Arafat
publicly  renounced terrorism in December 1988 on behalf  of
the  PLO.  The United States considers that all PLO  groups,
including  Al-Fatah, Force 17, Hawari Group, PLF, and  PFLP,
are  bound by Arafat's renunciation of terrorism. The US-PLO
dialogue  was suspended after the PLO failed to condemn  the
30  May  1990  PLF attack on Israeli beaches. PLF  head  Abu
Abbas  left  the PLO Executive Committee in September  1991;
his seat was filled by another PLF member.

ACTIVITIES
In  the early 1970s, several groups affiliated with the  PLO
carried out numerous international terrorist attacks. By the
mid-1970s, under international pressure, the PLO claimed  it
would  restrict  attacks were later carried  out  by  groups
affiliated with  the PLO/Fatah, including the Hawari  Group,
the  Palestine  Liberation  Front,  and  Force  17,  against
targets inside and outside of Israel.

STRENGTH
See numbers for affiliated groups.

LOCATION/AREA OF OPERATION
Tunis, other bases in various countries in the Middle East.

EXTERNAL AID
See  affiliated  groups.  Accurate  public  information   on
financial  support  for  the  PLO  by  Arab  governments  is
difficult to obtain.

*32>  RED ARMY FACTION   (RAF)

Description
The small and disciplined RAF is the successor to the Baader
Meinhof  Gang,  which  originated  in  the  student  protest

hardcore  cadres  that  carry out terrorist  attacks  and  a
network  of  supporters who provide logistic and  propaganda
support.  Has  survived  despite  numerous  arrests  of  top
leaders over the years.

Activities

support,  sanctuary, and training from the German Democratic
Republic  during  the early 1980s. The  RAF  appears  to  be
developing closer ties to GRAPO in Spain.

announced  in  July  1991 that the group  had  ceased  terrorist
operations, but hardcore members may remain active.

Activities
Mainly   small-scale   bombing  attacks  against   property   in
northeastern  Spain. Targets include foreign  banks  and  travel
agencies. Reportedly renounced terrorism in July 1991.

Strength
Unknown.

Location/Area of Operation
Spain.

External Aid
None known.

*36>  TUPAC AMARU REVOLUTIONARY MOVEMENT   (MRTA)

Description
Traditional  Marxist-Leninist  revolutionary  movement  in  Peru
formed  in 1983. Led by Nestor Serpa and Victor Polay. Objective
is  to  rid Peru--and perhaps region--of "imperialist" influence
and establish a Marxist regime.

Activities
Responsible  for more anti-US attacks than any  other  group  in
Latin  America.  In 1990 and 1991, attacked the US  Ambassador's
residence,  bombed  the US Consulate and US-Peruvian  Binational
Center,  attacked  US businesses and Mormon  churches.  Attacked
Peru's Presidential Palace, and President Fujimori's airplane in
1991.

Strength
1,000 to 2,000 combatants.

 Location/Area of Operation
Peru. Bolivia in conjunction with the ELN.

External Aid
Has received training in Cuba. May have ties to Libya.

*37>  PROVISIONAL IRISH REPUBLICAN ARMY   (PIRA)
       aka: The Provos

Description
A  radical  terrorist group formed in 1969  as  the  clandestine
armed wing of Sinn Fein, a legal political movement dedicated to
removing British forces from Northern Ireland and then to  unify
Ireland.  Has  a  Marxist  orientation.  Organized  into  small,
tightly knit cells under the leadership of the Army Council.

Activities
Bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, extortion, and robberies.
Targets   government   and  private-sector  interests--including
senior British officials and British military targets in Western
Europe-and Northern Irish Protestant paramilitary organizations.
Has   become  increasingly  indiscriminate  in  its  spectacular
bombing  attacks.  PIRA  has stepped up operations  on  mainland
Britain  over  the past two years, conducting  over  20  attacks
there  during 1991. In February, a mortar attack against No.  10
Downing  Street  was  launched while Prime  Minister  Major  and
senior members of his Cabinet were meeting.  Bombing at two busy
railway stations in central London resulted in the death of  one
civilian  and injury to dozens more.  In December, PIRA exploded
a 2,000-pound bomb outside a police station in Northern Ireland,
injuring over 60 civilians, and launched a wave of bomb  attacks
against rail lines and shopping centers on the British mainland.

Strength
Several hundred, plus several thousand sympathizers.

Location/Area of Operation
Northern  Ireland,  Irish Republic, Great Britain,  and  Western
Europe.

External Aid
Has  received  aid  from a variety of groups and  countries  and
considerable training and arms from Libya and, at one time,  the
PLO.  Also  is  suspected  of  receiving  funds  and  arms  from
sympathizers in the United States. Maintains links to ETA.

<b>Caution When Traveling - Public Announcement</b><br>
April 19, 1996<p>

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
Office of the Spokesman<br>
For Immediate Release<p>

In the immediate future, U.S. citizens traveling or residing abroad may wish to exercise greater
than usual caution in light of the recent events in the Middle East and threats made to American
interests from Hizbollah and other extremist groups.  Although the Department of State has no
specific information regarding threats to U.S. citizens, we cannot discount the possibility of
random acts of anti-American violence.  U.S. diplomatic posts are taking appropriate security
precautions.  U.S. citizens planning to travel abroad should consult the Department of State's
country-specific Travel Warnings, Consular Information Sheets and regional travel brochures, and
refer to the Department's advisories on security awareness overseas.<p>

</center>
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Wing span: 43.6 Ft. 43 ft 
<LI>Length: 67.4 ft. 64 ft, 2 in. 
<LI>Height: 17 ft., 8.9 in. 
<LI>Maximum Speed: Supersonic without aid of afterburner same
<LI>Range: Long range same 
<LI>Engine@Thrust: Two PW&amp; A YF119 Turbofan engines Two GE YF119 Turbofans
<LI>Armament: Aim-9 and AIM-120 AMRAAM same
<LI>carried internally 
<LI>Manufacturer: Northrop/McDonnell Douglas Lockheed/General Dynamics
</UL>

<P>The ATF was contracted to provide the next generation tactical fighter,
blending low- observable (stealth) technologies and new advances in aerodynamic
design. The down select funded two teams, the Lockheed/General Dynamics
team (<a href="/milnet/yf22ref.htm">YF-22A</a>), and the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas team (YF-32A).</P>

<P> The ATF is to be designed to penetrate enemy airspace, and support
the &quot;AirLand Battle Forces&quot; with a first-look, first kill capability
against multiple targets. With significantly integrated avionics and weapons
systems, the aircraft will be able to engage multiple targets and shoot
from a very stable platform, using internally carried AIM-9 and AMRAAM
(AIM-120) missiles, aas well as an internally mounted gun.</P>

<P> The ATF is described as being a long range, low detectability, curise
supersonic without afterburner, carry a respecable payload of air to air
missiles and still have another 1/3 power available at supersonic speeds.
The ATF must be an air superiority fighter capable of close in and stand
off operations. The ATF must be able to mount either the GE YF120 or P&amp;
WA YF119 engines, with the initial demonstraters each implementing different
engines (YF-22A will use the GE engine, the YF-23 will use the P&amp; WA
engine) to provide test beds for each. Also, the ATF must provide for 1/2
the maintenance of current fighters as well as 1/2 the sortie turnaround
time.</P>

<P> The ATF is expected to enter Full Scale Development in September of
1991 after the two demonstration aircraft define the technology base for
the final implementation, by December of 1990.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>YF-22A</H3>

<P>The Lockheed demonstrator rolled out on August 29, 1990. Initially the
YF-22A will use General Electric YF120 engines, but both ATF will have
to be able to fitted with both the GE or the PW&amp; A engines.</P>

<P> The YF-22A has a conventional (ala F/A-18) dual canted outward vertical
stablizer at the rear, with conventional rudders. The horizontal stablizers
move fully to provide the elevator control. To control airflow on top of
the wings, there are two control panels atop each engine inlet. Most wing
and stablizer edges are all aligned in one direction to reduce the radar
signature of the aircraft. Also most openings such as canopy, gea door,
etc. have serrated edges to further aid in reduction of reflections. The
leading edge of the wing where the leading edge flap is located has strangely
shaped gaps to reduce radar cross section there as well (similiar to that
used on the F-117).</P>

<P> The aircraft is 25% manufactured of composites, with production aircraft
probably planned to be more along the lines of 40-50% composite.</P>

<P> The nozzles are located at the rear of the aircraft and can be vectored
up or down for additional thrust in those directions. There are pointed
variable flaps as part of the nozzle construction to minimize radar reflection
along the direction of flight. The engine inlets are long and provide a
curving path from their openings on either side and well forward on the
fuselage, similiar to the F-15. They are under the wing, with the engines
each inboard of the body of the fuselage, placing the high radar reflecting
portions of the engine &quot;hidden&quot; in the fuselage. This long path
is also assumed to smooth out the air flow for low distortion. The inlets
are of fixed geometry, and excess air is vented through porous inlet walls
to screened vents atop the inlet. Extra air needed for low speed, high
power conditions is provided via serrated power actuated blow-in doors
on top of the mid-fuselage.</P>

<P> There are three missile bays, one on the bottom center of the fuselage,
and two on the outside faces of the rectangular inlet walls.</P>

<P> </P>

<H3>YF-23A</H3>

<P>The YF-23A was rolled out in a low-key ceremony on June 22, 1990. It
has twin rear stabilizers canted at 45 degrees on either side of the fuselage,
and sharp chines which extend out on the forebody of the fuselage, similiar
to the extended chines on the SR-71. </P>

<P>The center section of the aircraft is also similiar to the SR-71, with
the main difference being the twin engines buried in the wings of the aircraft.
From the top, the YF-23A appears to have diamond shaped wings, and the
exhaust nozzles are obviously above the wing, probably reducing the ability
for vectored thrust (unless some kind of opening can be made through-wing).
The body of the aircraft is blended very smooth and has a flat belly where
the doors hinge into the internal stores area for the weaponry.</P>

<P> The YF-23 is a study in complex curves. But unlike the B-2 stealth
bomber, the curves are blended to provide a balance of stealth and supersonic
flight characteristics.</P>

<P> The engine inlets are under the forward oiinboard seciton of each wing,
separeed from the main forward fuselage secgtion by a deep longiudinal
channel, and feed air is ducted in through S-ducts to the engines. Two
trapazoidal panels with sawtooth aft edge are positioned on top of the
wing well forward forward of each engine inlet duct and are probably inlet
dumps or extra air intakes to be used as necessary in low or high pressure
flight regimes.</P>

<P> Visibilityin the YF-23A appears to be good, with attention being paid
to the a high mounted seat, scalloped canopy rail and forward windscreen
border, providing excellent visibility in the forward, downward, and over-the-shoulder
directions.</P>

</UL>
<P>
The X-29A  is a multi-technology demonstrator being flo  Click hwn by NASA's Dryden 
Flight Research Center at Edwards AFB, CA.  The introduction of advanced lightweight 
composite materials and improvements in fly-by-wire systems has eliminated a major 
number of the difficulties in saftey, reliability and performance in this type of aircraft.<P>
Originally developed in conjuction withthe USAF's Aeronautical Space Division, with 
Grumman Aircraft performing hte contract by modifying a standard Northrop F-5 airframe 
and adding F-16 main landing gear and control actuators. In flight the compotoe wings 
change form constantly to facilitate control of the radical airfoil geometry.  The avionoics 
are triplex-redundant fly by wire, and continuously monitor the flight envelop in order to 
properly control the forward canards,  wing trailing edges, flaperons, strake flaps, and tail 
pieces.<P>
The first supersonic flight of the X-29A occurred on December 1985 with the speed at 1.03 
Mach at 40,000 feet.  Later the number one aircraft acheived Mach 1.52 at 51,000 (after 
242 flights, a record for any X aircraft)  before being grounded as a flyable spares for the 
second demo aircraft.  <P>
The second demonstrator aircraft is being used to study the low speed, high angle of attack 
characteristics of the design.<P>

NASP is a joint development of NASA and the USAF.  The objective is to develop a 
family of hypersonic single-stage-to-orbit aircraft/spacecraft able to take off from and land 
on conventinal runways.  Such vehcilces could place payloads in orbit at costs far below 
those of current expendable launch vehicles or the STS (Shuttle Transport System).  The 
development could also lead to a future military application, the TransAtmospheric 
Vehicle (TAV).<P>
In 1987, teh DoD and NASA downselected to General Dynamics, McDonnell Douglas, and 
Rockwell International to proceeed intao a three-year preliminary design phase on the 
airframe, with Rocketdyne and Pratt&amp Whitney continuing their propulsion work.  By 
late 1989, the program was stretched to cut costs in the short term.<P>
In 1990, the five conractors began talks on a national contract team to pool resources.  In 
the October 29, 1990 Aviation Week, the details of the down-select were revealed as well 
as the details of a unique new procurement teaming arrangement.<P>
The X-30A is to be a hypersonic space/aircraft utilizing a wide, lifting body design, with 
small wings providing the horizontal control surfaces and dual aft vertical stabilizers.  The 
objective is for the control avionics to be of a simple design, providing for a high degree 
of safety and reduced complexity of the flight control avionics.<P>
The actual design is a blend of the three designs put forth by McDonnell Douglas, General 
Dynamics, and Rockwell, all of which are particiapating in the development of the 
prototype.  Pratt &amp  Witney Aircraft and Rocketdyne are teaming for the propulsion of 
the X-30A, with each providing their expertises...P&amp WA for the air breathing portion 
of flight, and rocketdyne concentratring on out of atmosphere (as the scramjet moves from 
turbine to ram, as well as the additional rocket engine envisioned for the craft).  There may 
be between 3 to 5 scramjets.  tests have already been performed on engine models of up to 
Mach 17.<P>
The X-30A will cruise at Mach 2 to 4 to get to the proper altitude, then once engaging the 
rocket, soar out of the atmosphere and achieving Mach 25.<P>
<H3>Test Program  </H3>
NASA plans to begin the initial testing of one of the two flight vehicles in 1997, with the 
first attempt at a single-stage-to-orbit would be in 1999.  The testing will follow leasons 
learned during the X-15 flight tests, thus, all tests will wind up with the X-30A on a direct 
course to Edwards AFB during any high speed runds.<P>
The first tests of flight regimes will be a short cruise away from Edwards, a gradual turn 
back towards Edwards, then a brief spurt of acceleration, followed by a long glide back to 
Edwards.  Only the very early flights will place restrictions on the use of the engines, as 
the X-30A will be quite capable of powered go arounds if necessary.  These initial flights 
will see the X-30A confined to Edwards restricted airspace (R-2508 on Los Angeles 
sectional VFR maps)<P>
The next regime would begin with a ling cruise across the U.S. toward Kennedy Space 
Center.  If problems occur, the X-30A can land anywheer along hte Souther U.S. Coast, or 
at Kennedy.  If all goes well, then the X-30A will turn at Kennedy, and accelerate to high 
Mach flying halfway across the U.S., then gliding for the second half before landing at 
Edwards.<P>
The final max speed runs will occur with a similiar first leg cruising from Edwards to 
Kennedy.  But the acceleration will be longer, and will cross South East to NorthWest, to 
the Northern Central U.S., and then a short glide, a turn  to the SoutheWest, and long glide 
back to Edwards  AFB in California.<P>

The X-31 is a US Navy technology development aircraft being used to explore the 
maneuverability envelope for new generations of fighter aircraft.  This aircraft has just 
completed its prerequisite high speed taxi tests on October 3rd, and is expectd to begin its 
first flights soon.<P>
The first tesst reached a ground speed of 130 kts and included a nosewheel liftoff to an 8 
degree up-pitch.  The second test featured a 120 kt deployment of the spin chute and it 
jettison.<P>

The F-117A Stealth fighter was another example (and probably one of, if not THE last such project)  of an aircraft designed and built in 
Lockheed's Advanced Design Projects group (Skunk Works), first established by Lockheed 
President Kelly Johnson to design the U-2 and the SR-71.Much about the aircraft is secret, 
but it is known that its wings can be folded so it can be transported by C-5A, it is air 
refuelable, and can carry 2,000 lb laser guided weapons.  It uses a high precision Inertial 
Guidance System, GPS, and other advanced avionics.  It has FLIR and a steerable laser 
designator to assure precision when attacking ground targets.    It is a single seat, twin 
engine sharply angled, faceted skin aircraft, made up of speical composite materials, with 
engine inlet and outlet on the top side of the wings.  All this blends into a superior low 
observable aircraft.  The wings are swept back at a sharp 67.5 degrees.  Control is multi-
redundant fly-by-wire and a state of the art digital avionics suite.<P>
The F-117 first flew in June of 1981, and became operational in 1983.  It is based at the 
37th Tactical Fighter Wing (TFW) at Tonopah Test Range Airfield.<P>
Six F-117As were deployed to Panama for Operation Just Cause, traveling by air and by 
air-to-air refueling.   Some number of F-117s were also purported to be flown in C-5s to 
Saudi Arabia when Iraq invaded Kuwait.<P>
<p>
This was later confirmed, as it became public that the majority of the "downtown" raids into Baghdad were made by F-117s.  It is interesting to note that the pictures of anti-aircraft fire in the sky over Baghdad shown on television network low light setups, occurred after the F-117s had come and gone.  The only targets that could have been hit by the AA fire, would have been later Tomahawk 
cruise missiles, but these were usually sailing down "main street" below the tops of the buildings (jokingly called "street level flying" by the defense contractors involved in the manufacturer of Tomahawks).

<TITLE>C-130 Hercules</TITLE>
<H1>C-130 Hercules</H1>
The C-130 Hercules has been an aircraft boasting of one of the 
largest production runs of any aircraft in the Lockheed stable.  The 
uses of this aircraft were not predictable from its rather austere beginnings as a short field 
takeoff cargo aircraft in what was previously known as the Material Airlift Command.
As a MAC transport, C-130s spanned the globe 
moving cargo from San Francisco to Guam to Japan in a relentless daily effort to support at 
first the occupation of Japan and then the transistion to today's current U.S. military 
presence in that country.  C-130s had caught the eye of the Army, the U.S. Marines, the 
Army and Air Force Reserves, the National Guard, and even the Coast Guard.  Soon even 
organizations like the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration were 
buying them.  One reason of course is their short landing and takeoff capability, the other is 
the fact it is such a stable aircraft, both in terms of its flyability as well as stablility of design engineering making maintenance a well known quantity, and with most every replacement part in ready availability.  The Hercules has great utility in terms of cargo caryying ability, and is quite 
economic to operate.  <P>
If you key in on another aspect of the stable platform feature, you will also understand why there are things 
such as AC-130H derivatives.  Chosen for its stability in the air, the C-130 
based AC-130H design was first used by U.S. Special Forces  
in Vietnam.  By mounting a 105mm howitzer, two 20mm Vulcan cannon and one 40mm 
cannon, you have an extremely versatile loiterable gunship called the 
"Spectre".
The original AC-130H had two 7.62mm miniguns and an extra 40mm cannon instead of the howitzer 
mounted, and was codenamed "Puff" for "Puff the Magic Dragon" (due to its visage during nightime operations, spitting fire, actually tracer rounds.  When explosive shells were used, the ground even seemed to light up, catching on fire as 
the "dragon" breathed fire down on the enemy emplacements or convoys.
<p>
Other uses include the EC-130E ABCCC (Airborne Battlefield Command and Control 
Center), the EC-130E "Volant Solo" PSYOP broadcast aircraft flown by the 193d Special 
Operations Group, the EC-130H "Compass Call" communications jammer, HC-130H 
Special Operations night vision equipped aircraf, the MC-130H "Combat Talon II" a low 
altitude penetration transport used by the 1st, 7th, and 8th Special Operations Squadrons, and the  
WC-130H weather reconaissance aircraft.  The 130s are all listed below:<P>

The B-1B is a low alitutude penetration bomber designed to use terrain avoidance radar, 
high speed, and a fairly low radar cross section to rapidly sneak up on Soviet strategic 
targets.  The aircraft is designed around technology learned from the XB-70 experimental 
swept wing bomber, as well as the beginnings of stealth technology.  Although certainly not 
invisible to radar, the B-1B is never the less has only 14% of the radar signature of the B-
52G which it is intended to replace.<P>
The B-1B is able to fly at low penetration altitudes at supersonic speeds if necessary, i.e. 
this would most likely be the transition from  "stealthy" approach into the target area as  the 
B-1B accelerates from the quieter subsonic speeds to supersonic as it prepares to make its 
climb and bomb run.<P>
The B-1B, as indicated, can carry a heavy load of nuclear or conventional bombs, as well 
as the SRAM and SRAMII short range attack missile.<P>
On July 4, 1987, 2,000km close circuit speed and distance with payload record set at 
669.96 mph with 66,140 lb payload and on September 17, 5,000km circuit at 655.05 mph.

The B-2, under a storm of controversey, has proven to been a nearly invisible stealth 
aircraft, with the use of it in tests requiring a number of special radar reflectors for safety 
purposes.  The aircraft resembles a large flying wing, with serrated edges along the trailing 
edge of the wing.  The engines are mounted on top of the wings with both the inlets and the 
outlets above the wing.  The aircraft is designed for low-altitude, sub-sonic penetration 
into enemy airspace, placing their most valued targets at risk.<P>
It is estimated that the B-2 could penetrate Soviet Airspace and be on target before 
detection.  While flying at night the B-2 is virtually invisible unless it blocks out the 
moon.<P>
The controversey over hte aircraft, which was developed in total secrcy until a few years 
ago, is over hte price tag (what else?).  The aircraft buy is being reduced drving the per 
aircraft price into the $20 billion range.  Of course if no aircraft are produced, the price tag 
for the prototypes is around $200 billion, due to the termination costs for the aircraft 
already started.<P>
Although not invisible to radar, the signature is estimated to be less than 10% of that of the 
B-52 which it will replace.  A number of B-2s in formation would be detectable though, so 
it would only seem reasonable that its missions be in pairs or solo.<P>

<A NAME="disp1"><B>Background</B></A>
<p>
President Clinton signed an <A HREF="eo0295.htm">Executive Order</a> on 24 February 1995,
directing the declassification of intelligence imagery acquired
by the first generation of U.S. photo-reconnaissance satellites;
the systems code-named CORONA, ARGON and LANYARD.  The order
provides for the declassification of more than 860,000 images
of the Earth's surface, collected between 1960 and 1972.
<p>
Early imagery collections were driven, in part, by the need to
confirm purported developments in Soviet strategic missile
capabilities.  Worldwide photographic coverage was also used
to produce maps and charts for the Department of Defense and
other U.S. Government mapping programs.  A <A HREF="dci0295.htm"> speech made on
24 February 1995</A> by Admiral William O. Studeman, Acting Director
of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), recounts some of the
important achievements of the historical satellite imagery
reconnaissance programs. The Honorable John Deutch, Director
of Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), spoke on the revolution
in intelligence brought on by the CORONA program at a <A HREF="dci0595.htm">CORONA
symposium on 23 May 1995</A>.
<P>
<A NAME="disp17">The </A>intelligence community used the designators KH-1, KH-2, KH-3,
KH-4, KH-4A, and KH-4B for the CORONA systems.  The ARGON
systems were designated KH-5 and the LANYARD systems KH-6.  These
KH (Keyhole) designators are used throughout this guide to
describe system characteristics and accomplishments.  Mission
numbers were a principal means for indexing the reconnaissance
imagery and associated collateral data. The correlation of
mission numbers to KH designators for missions that acquired
film is given in the following table:

*A very limited amount of color test film was attached to the end
of missions 1104, 1105, 1106 and 1108.  
<p>
A complete list of mission numbers for all attempted missions is
provided in the <A HREF="#disp15">Mission Summaries</A> of the
Appendix.
<p>
<A NAME="disp2"><B>Extent of Coverage</B></A>
<p>
The declassified imagery provides extensive coverage of the Earth.
It contains imagery collected during the period 1960-1972 from
throughout the world with significant emphasis on Eastern Europe
and Asia.  
<p>
<A NAME="disp3"><B>Acquisition</B></A>
<p>
The declassified imagery was acquired by satellite-borne camera
systems. The satellites were designed to deorbit a film capsule
(referred to as a "bucket")from space with mid-air recovery of
the returning capsule by a specially equipped aircraft.  Early
systems operated with a single bucket, while later systems were
configured with two buckets;  the KH-4A was the first satellite
with multiple film buckets.
<p>
Early systems (KH-1, KH-2, KH-3 and KH-6) carried a single
panoramic camera, or a single frame camera (KH-5), while the
later systems (KH-4, KH-4A, and KH-4B) carried two
panoramic cameras with 30 degrees separation angle.  For KH-4,
KH-4A,and KH-4B missions, the two cameras are referred to as
fore (for forward looking) and aft (for rear looking).  The
KH-6 camera was programmed to tilt between fore and aft to
cover the same land area twice during a photographic pass and
thus to acquire stereo coverage.
<p>
<A NAME="disp4"><B>Data Characteristics</B></A>
<p>
The spatial and temporal characteristics of the declassified
historical satellite imagery are given here according to KH
designator.  For additional insight on how performance varied
by mission see <A HREF="#disp15">Mission Summaries</A> of the
Appendix.
<p>
<A NAME="disp5"><B>Spatial Resolution</B></A>
<p>
The best spatial resolution of the imagery is 6 feet (KH-6);
the lowest resolution is approximately 460 feet (KH-5).

*The KH-1, KH-2, KH-3, and KH-4 are grouped together for
describing camera-related features. The KH-4 designator
was sometimes used by the Intelligence Community to refer
to the entire group.<br>
** GLIS - Global Land Information System

<p>
<A NAME="disp6"><B>Temporal Coverage</B></A>
<p>
The first successful photographs from space were taken on
18 August 1960 by the KH-1 system and the last of the imagery
of this collection was acquired on 31 May 1972 by the KH-4B
system.  The Appendix entitled <A HREF="#disp15">Mission Summaries</A> gives the
launch date and a summary account of each mission.
<p>
The periods of operation of the systems are given in a 
<A HREF="#disp17">previous table.</A>
<p>
<A NAME="disp7"><B>Data Organization</B></A>
<p>
The imagery collection is organized as rolls of film and
comprises more than 17,000 rolls.  Each mission (e.g., 9009
or 1117-2 for bucket 2 of mission 1117) is divided into passes
(or orbit revolutions), and each image frame within a
pass is designated by a frame number.  In order to conserve
film for important areas of coverage, film was not always
exposed on every pass.  Additionally, the fore and aft camera
film are packaged separately for missions that carried twin
panoramic cameras (as did mission 1117-2).  Occasionally one
of the pair of cameras malfunctioned or was programmed to halt,
while its mate continued to operate.  Therefore, there may be
fore camera film but no aft camera film, or vice versa.
<p>
<A NAME="disp8"><B>Imagery Index</B></A>
<p>An electronic catalog of imagery frames is available through
the USGS Global Land Information System (GLIS) which 
indexes approximately 98% of the total imagery collection. The 
index contains mission, pass, camera, and frame number for each
image frame.  It also contains the date of the image and an
estimation of the four corner coordinates of the area of ground
coverage.  This index was derived from several sources:
approximately 76% of the image frames were indexed at the time
of the original collection; and an additional 22% were
indexed by calculating geographic coverage during 1995 by a
private contractor for the CIA.
<P>
Mathematical models of camera operation and frame ephemeris
(location of the satellite at the time of image frame acquisition
and camera orientation information) were used to calculate
image corner coordinates for all the film indexed during the
1995 effort, except KH-5 imagery frames. Frame ephemeris is
not available for the KH-5 imagery, so orbital ephemeris
(track of satellite through space) and estimates of timing
data and camera orientation data were used along with a
mathematical model of camera operation to estimate imagery
frame corner coordinates.  
<p>
Approximately 2% of the imagery frames have not been indexed
because satellite position data or timing data are not available.
Lack of position data was due to various causes from
instrumentation failures during collection and erratic vehicle
attitude behavior.  The latter problem with mission 9051
precluded the indexing of any imagery frames from that mission.
None of the imagery frames from mission 9046A have been indexed
because time of collection was not available from existing
collateral documents. For the same reason, portions of mission
9066A have not been indexed.
<p>
Corner coordinate data is a critical component of the index
information.  Accuracy in locating corner coordinates varies
according to how coordinates were derived and according to the
accuracy of information used for the derivation. As a general
rule, metadata corner points have errors less than 10 miles
from their actual ground positions for the CORONA and LANYARD
systems, and less than 50 miles for the ARGON system.  <B>After
a search of the metadata, the user should inspect the browse
image and its immediate neighbors in the image series for the
point of interest before placing an order for photography.</B>  For
example, each CORONA image is about 10 miles wide and looking at
three consecutive images in a series will compensate for 10 mile
errors in cornerpoint locations. The Appendix <A HREF="#disp14">Guidance on
Metadata Accuracy</A> gives insights into the accuracy of corner
coordinate data used within the imagery index, and will aid
the reader in using the index to select imagery frames of
interest.  Also, the use of browse imagery allows the user to
review a reduced resolution image to determine whether or not
a specific site is contained in the selected frame.
<p>
<B>More than 40% of the imagery contains significant cloud cover.</B>
The use of browse imagery gives the user the opportunity to
review a reduced spatial resolution image to determine whether
or not the area of interest is covered and is or is not
obscured by clouds.
<p>
<A NAME="disp9"><B>Data Availability</B></A>
<p>
Nearly all of the imagery from these systems was collected
using black and white film.  There is a very limited amount of
infrared film and high definition color aerial film that was
tested as part of the KH-4B missions and yielded poor spatial
resolution performance.  The original film is being preserved
by the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and
is stored at the National Archives at College Park, MD.
<P>
An automated index of the entire film collection is accessible
through the USGS <A HREF="http://edcwww.cr.usgs.gov/glis/glis.html">Global Land Information System (GLIS)</A>.
<p>
<A NAME="disp10"><B>Procedures for Obtaining Data</B></A>
<p>
Photographic copies and enlargements of the declassified
historical satellite imagery can be purchased from the USGS
EROS Data Center(EDC), Sioux Falls, SD.
<p>
In addition to the imagery, there are a number of related
documents (collateral materials) available to support research.
Available documents include frame ephemeris data, orbital
ephemeris data, and mission performance reports.  These
materials are available at the National Archives at College
Park.  The creation of such materials evolved over time,
so not all materials are available for all missions; collateral
materials were not produced for unsuccessful missions. An
Appendix, <A HREF="#disp16">Availability of Collateral Materials</A>, categorizes
the availability of information by mission.

The following table gives a listing of all missions.  The list is
organized according to KH system designator and, secondarily, by
mission number order.  The statement "mission failed" is made
under the mission description for missions that failed to
acquire imagery. A previous table concerning the <A HREF="#disp17">CORONA, ARGON
and LANYARD</A> systems provides additional information.
<p>
About 4% of the photographic passes for the CORONA system
encountered circumstances where camera orientation data was
not recorded.  It is possible that the predicted ground area
of coverage is incorrect for one or more images contained within
such passes.  These passes occurred within missions marked
with an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the corresponding short
mission description.

<A NAME="disp14"><B>Guidance on Metadata Accuracy</B></A>
</DL>

<p>The imagery is indexed, and can be accessed and retrieved
 using spatial metadata containing the geographic area of
coverage of each image.  The metadata has over 860,000 records,
each corresponding to an image.  For each image the predicted
area of coverage is recorded using the latitudes and longitudes
(coordinates) of the four corner locations of each image.
<p>
A critical component of the index information is the corner
coordinate data.  The ability to correctly retrieve an image
containing a specific point of interest on the ground depends
on the percentage of overlap between the area of coverage
predicted by the metadata and the area of coverage of the
actual image.  This in turn depends on the accuracy of the
corner points in each metadata record.  The accuracy in locating
corner coordinates varies according to how the coordinates were
derived and according to the accuracy of information that was
available for the derivation.
<p>
Metadata records can be divided into three classes according
to how the data was derived:
<OL>
<LI> metadata records derived from legacy databases
<LI> metadata records computed using camera model software
(completed under CIA contract by a private company)
<LI> metadata records for which no corner coordinate data is
available.
</OL>
<P>
For the first class, corner point coordinates were derived
from legacy databases for approximately 76% of the imagery.
This data was created and entered during the period 1960 to
1972.  For the second class (approximately 22% of the imagery),
metadata were calculated by camera model algorithms in 1995
using ephemeris documents that estimated the orbital position
of the vehicle and camera orientation at the time each
photograph was acquired.  The class of metadata calculated by
camera model algorithms can be subdivided further into two
subclasses:  that calculated using frame ephemeris (18%), and
that synthesized using orbital ephemeris (4%).  For the third
class (approximately 2% of the imagery), no camera position
data could be found or interpolated.  The metadata referencing
these images has been coded to indicate the absence of corner
point information and are not searchable by geographic
location.
<p>
As a general rule, metadata corner points have errors less
than 10 miles from their actual ground positions for the CORONA
and LANYARD systems, and less than 50 miles for the ARGON system.
A summary on the accuracy of corner coordinate data is given
here.  As a caution to the user, it is noted that the information
presented here was derived from a small number of data samples.

<P>
Notes:<br>
(1) Actual images are larger than area calculated from
metadata.<br>
(2) Ground position of some corners could not be
accurately located from imagery.<br>
(3) Most of error is due to yaw variation.<br>
(4) Camera model algorithm assumed zero values for roll, pitch
and yaw.<br>
(5) For this ARGON image, 4 of 4 were within 50 miles of the
actual location.
<p>
The message from this information is that, after a search of
the metadata, the user should inspect the browse image and
its immediate neighbors in the image series for the point of
interest before placing an order for photography.  For example,
each CORONA image is about 10 miles wide and looking at three
consecutive images in a series will compensate for 10 mile
errors in corner point locations. 
<p>
Additional observations on the metadata are given as an aid to
using the index to select imagery frames.
<P>
Relationships Between Adjacent Image Frames
<p>
When using the metadata, it is helpful to know that the imagery
was collected as a series of adjacent frames.  The overlap
between adjacent frames is approximately 10% and is in the
direction of the satellite ground track for the KH-1, KH-2,
KH-3, KH-4, KH-4A, KH-4B and KH-6 systems.  There is
approximately 70% overlap in the direction of the satellite
ground track for imagery collected by the KH-5 camera.
<p>
Additional Metadata Observations
<p>
Most (nominal) corner points appear to have less than 10 miles
of error for the CORONA system.  A few exceptions (outliers)
have been observed with 100's of miles of error.  The outliers
appear to result from vehicle guidance problems, or sensor
malfunction.  
<p>
Legacy metadata are affected by the following: legacy databases
only recorded latitude and longitude to the nearest minute of
arc;  and legacy data appears to have been cropped top and
bottom by about 5%;  and left and right by about 10%.  This
means that the actual images are wider by 20 to 30 miles than
indicated by some metadata.  This does not affect the camera
model software derived metadata.
<p>
Yaw Measurement Systems
<p>In many cases, corner point errors can be largely attributed
to uncertainty of the vehicle yaw at the time the image was
acquired.  It appears that two systems for measuring yaw had
been used in the historical frame ephemeris documents, and
there is ambiguity as to which was used for each mission. 
<p>
In the first system, yaw is measured from the ground track of
the vehicle. In the second system, yaw is measured from the
inertial flight path of the vehicle.  These systems differ due
to the rotational velocity of the Earth which at the equator
can cause the two yaw measures to differ by up to 3.5 degrees
(this would correspond to a 4 mile corner point error).  Some
frame ephemeris documents indicate that the yaw difference
between the forward and aft cameras varies by up to .25 degrees
through the course of a mission.  This observation is
inconsistent with the previously mentioned yaw measurement
systems and points to the possibility of a third system for
measuring yaw for some missions.
<p>
The success rate for image retrieval during a search on GLIS
is determined by the percentage of area overlap between the
predicted and actual area of coverage.  The effect of yaw
error is to rotate the predicted area of coverage.
Fortunately, even though the corner points may have up to
10 miles of error, the area of overlap has been observed to
nominally be between 50% and 80%.  These percentages are the
same as the likelihood of retrieving the correct image on the
first try.  The likelihood improves when neighboring images
in a series are also retrieved.
<p>
Since most frame ephemeris documents do not indicate which yaw
measurement system was used, some camera model software-
derived metadata may not have used the most appropriate model.
The area of coverage for these images will show a yaw bias
from 0 to 3.5 degrees depending on the orbital inclination
of the mission and the latitude of the vehicle at the time
the image was acquired.
<p>
A description of yaw bias was reported in the preface of the
frame ephemeris document for mission 1105-1.  It advises that
approximate yaw for a given descending pass and frame may be
derived (for mission 1105-1) by using the following table of
programmed vehicle yaw values.  It is based on geodetic
latitude and the orbital inclination angle for the mission.

<h2>Your First Step On The Information Super-Highway</h2>

<p>
<p>
<h1>OnSite Web Pages</h1>
<h2>Method 4, Your Own, True Domain</h2>
<p>
<nl>
<b>4.</b>  Searching and finding your web page via "http://www.yourname.com/"
</nl>
<p>
Using the URL "www.yourname.com" requires that you register AND operate a domain name server for your registered domain.  We can do that for you, but only if your domain is not being used elsewhere (and actually that will prohibit are getting it registered for you) and you aren't planning to put any of your own computer networks on the Internet in the near future.  
<p>
For example, if your company name is ABC, you might want to have "www.abc.com" as your web page URL.  But if you have computers at your facility, you may want to have an IP address (i.e. something akin to 205.199.11.1) that is used to put your computers on the Internet.  As you can see, we are certainly leaving the realm of personal web pages, and branching into the commercial OnSite web pages.  
<p>
If OneStep Internet Services registers your domain name for you (the "www.abc.com" yields a new domain name of "abc.com"), then from that day forward the Internet will all messages meant for computers of "abc.com" to our servers.  Thus later, this becomes a major pain for both us if you decide to bring your own computers online.
<p>
However, having said this, there is one situation where this is actually just fine.  If you are planning on building a Web Server with us, and then sometime later taking over maintenance and further development, then it only makes sense that our use of your domain name be temporary.  For this situation, we will help you register your domain.
<p>
Since this is a "true" domain registeration, it requires a set of complex transactions between us and the Internet.  These transactions translate into hours of time spent on the project, and we must pass that cost onto you.  
<p>
Therefore, for a "true" domain registeration and domain server setup, we will charge $250.  This is a onetime fee for the setup.  Transfer of the domain will be charged at $50 at the time of the transfer away from a OneStep Internet Services domain server (we assume deleting your domain is easier than getting it running).
<p>
One advantage of this situation is that we can maintain a number of servers for you at our facility.  Addtional name server operations will be charged at $50 per hour, and will include testing and verification of external access as required.

<p>The goal of OneStep is to provide Internet creative services 
to end users and information providers (including commercial users).  
It is our hope that you will find our creative services unique and complete.  
But for those of you who simply want to try it "on your own", we have 
provided a number of tools and resources designed to make your job easier.
<p>
<a href="1stephq.htm">OneStep</a> is a commercial enterprise aimed at both end users as well as the 
small to medium business 
which feels it has an existing or potential customer base on the Internet.  
For those businesses that wonder if their customer base is already on the 
Internet, or wish to find new customers "browsing around" on the Internet, 
OneStep provides a set of additional services devoted to the marketing 
aspects of the information highway.  Through our own closely tied band of Internet consultants, as well as other contacts we have and discover daily, we will be able to help you in every aspect of Internet creative design, marketing, and access.
<p>
That's why we call it OneStep.  One step to get all the services...you're just one step away from making the Internet profitable as well as fun!  
<p> 
You don't need to follow a 10 step plan or any other long list of things you 
must do to get onto the Internet or to take advantage of its potential.  Turn 
the potential energy we all believe the Internet promises, into a long steady 
stream of kinetic energy aimed directly from your new or existing customers 
into your business.  
<p>
The OneStep web server has a wealth of information available.  To help find the information you are looking for, we can give you some <a href="onetips.htm">tips</a> on how to navigate around with getting lost.  We also provide a <a href="others.htm">brief </a>on similar services to our own, just to ensure you are fully aware of the marketplace, and to make a better decision when choosing who will help you get your web server up and running.  To aid you in understanding who we are, we also provide the following summary of our services.
<p>
<img src="eus.gif">
<p>
What is an "End User"?  We define an end user as someone who is a consumer of 
information on the information superhighway.  Almost all of us are end users. 
See below for a definition of an information provider.  End User services 
provided by OneStep are listed below:
<p>
<ul>
<li><Strong>Low Cost Personal Web Pages</strong> <a href="persweb.htm"><img src="meetyou8.gif" alt="Glad to Meet You"></a>
<p>
We have had dozens of request for personal home pages.  Everyone wants to be on the Internet.  Our program is simple.  We scan a color photo of you, your best friend or both of with you and your cat or dog.  We pop that up on a home page, and help you write a quick biography...one or two pages.  We'll even help with a "marketable" vital statistics page.  Several of our customers are thinking about a permanent resume page...let your imagination be the guide.  Several others are thinking about starting up pages for fostering dialog on their favorites subjects.   
<p>
We will allow up to five pages total (say 200 words each).  We can then charge you $10 per month, or a one time $100 fee per year.  For a limited time, we are also offering a free "Comments" system, that will log any comments to a private file, a file that we will Email to you on a weekly basis.  You can then edit it at will, send it back, and we'll make it visible to YOUR public at a stroke of the mouse on the read button.
<p>
<li> <Strong>Low Cost Mail Connections</Strong> <a href="lowcost.htm"><img src="mailbox.gif"></a>
<p>
We are a "small business" ourselves, catering to other small businesses.  For businesses or "personal home page" users who need an Internet Mail account in the local area (408 area code region) we can provide you with an inexpensive means to get on the Internet.  For those of you outside the 408 area code region, give us a call at 408-749-0943 and we'll log your requirement.  When enough folks in your area express their need for access, (what's enough...don't know yet), we'll see if we can bring up a server in your local area. Special arrangements can be made for people who don't have an Email account on the Internet...like a fax copy for (heaven forbid) a paper copy. 
<p>
<p>
<li> <Strong>Linky Lists</Strong> <a href="linky.htm"><img src="lists.gif"></a>
<p>
Have you tried one of the "easy to use" Internet packages on the 
market today?  It is almost scary what some people consider easy.  Most packages just don't make it easy to do anything on the Internet...except maybe spend more money.  And when it comes to finding a web page with just the information you are looking for?  Forget it.  
<p>
The OneStep approach is to band together interesting people in interesting topic areas that allow you to get a lot of "bang" for your Internet Time.  Our goal is to grow to the point that many users will say "Why spend all your time jumping around the NET, when there is so much here."  But we also realize we don't have all the answers...or all the tools necessary to match everyone's needs.
Therefore, we provide you with links to some of the better search
tools out there...tools that are available to anyone on the Internet.
<p>
And since we have found it hard to find search tools by searching for them (yes that's redundant, but so is searching for a search tool...its a disgusting way of doing business!), we include a nice list of popular search tools that is accessable from the home page.  Just click on the little sonar scope (kind of like "pinging" for a submarine...finding the webmarine in the internetStack).
<p>
And we won't stop there.  As your comments lead us in the directions YOU need to go, we will add more "linky lists" to the best areas you need to visit.  In fact, we fully expect the OneStep Web Servers to grow as you want them to, with very little input needed from us.
<p>
<p>
<li> <Strong>New Server Area </strong> <a href="../newsites/newwebs.html"><img src="butts.gif"></a>
<p>
In our new servers area, we provide links to navigate you to the
latest web servers on our little segment of the Internet.  These are the information
providers who WANT YOU to visit their areas.
</ul>
<p>
<p>
<img src="provserv.gif">
<p>
What is an Information Provider?  Again our definition is simple.  
Anyone who has some kind of information to offer is a provider.  You can be an 
informal provider (i.e. someone who offers suggestions, advice or 
ideas on an ad-hoc basis), or a formal provider (someone who has a 
regularly scheduled forum for exchange of information).  Formal providers 
usually hang out on a bulletin board system or have their own 
<a href="webHelp.htm">web page</a> or <a href="ftphelp.htm">FTP domain</a>.  
Many formal information providers are institutions providing information 
free of charge, others are commercial providers.  Commercial providers 
typically provide a forum for communication, i.e. traditional online services 
who provide search and retrieval, or businesses using the Internet for
technical support areas 
or sales information such as product line information.  Some providers 
are on the Internet to sell you something; a set of services, valuable or 
unique information, or even a tangible product.  Below we list the 
services OneStep offers to Information Providers of all types: 
<p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Do it Yourself Guide</strong> <a href="doityou.htm"><img src="puzzle.gif"></a>
<p>
Puzzled about how to build your own web site?  Are you wondering just how all
the pieces fit together?  We have the answers.  We'll give 
you some great hints, and even provide you with links to free public domain 
software to help you.  Want to buy some quality software and hardware for 
webbing?  We'll offer you links to the latest gear for setting up a web site.  
<p>
<li> <strong>Web Servers Made Easy</strong> <a href="easyserv.htm"><img src="serveasy.gif"></a>
<p>
We know that lots of people are intimidated by the technical aspects of 
building a web site.  Forget It!  Let us make it easy for you!  We have 
experts on hardware and software available to make your decision to have 
a home page on the web, the only step you'll need to take.  We interview 
those most concerned with your home page, build a mockup offline so you can 
see how its is going to look, and then after we agree on the changes, 
implement your home page at light speed.  Don't worry about the hardware, 
we have plenty.  Don't worry about the content, we do the work, you do the 
oversight and make the home page YOUR home page, one you will be proud of.  
Guaranteed! 
<p>
OneStep has a class C Domain.  This means we can offer you up to 255 separate web server machines, and each can contain anywhere from 10 to 50 individual "home pages" and support pages "underneath".  We stay ahead of our customr requirements by having at least one server ready to go online as soon as it is needed.  With our enormous disk capacity on each machine, we have lots of room to provide you with the space you need for all your documents and graphics to support your web pages.
<p>
<li> <strong>Web Server Creative Services</strong> <a href="creative.htm"><img src="server.gif"></a>
<p>
Do you just need help with the creative portion of the web page struggle?  
We handle that quite well.  Our marketing types thrive on the challenge of 
getting your message to your end users.  May they be information seekers, 
new or existing customers, or even your own internal people who just happen 
to be geographically disadvanteged.  We will work with you to build a web 
server structure that best serves your needs.

<p>
<li> <strong>Web Site Posting</strong> <a href="../newsites/newwebs.html"><img src="butts.gif"></a>
<p>
Buried in the noise of Internet?  Forget That!  OneStep puts your web site 
name, logo and description on a button in our new server area for 30, 60, 
or 90 days.  As we grow, we will begin grouping the sites into categories based upon subject matter.  We then keep your site on our list in those categories 
(up to 10) where you choose to be listed.  Thus you can be where you know 
your customers will be looking.

</center><H1>OneStep Internet Services Provider Services - Desigining Your Own Home Page</h1>
<p>
<p>
The design of a home page for the web can be an extremly simple process, or complex to the point of frustration.  It depends on how complex you wish to the make theentire heirarchy of pages and how "cool" you want the interface to be.  
<p>
For instance, a home page could be something as simple as a title and four "links" (underlined blue text) that lead off to four other pages.  This simple Web Server is adequate for many people.  Add in a graphic image...the home page is still quite simple and easy to understand.
<p>
But suppose you want to allow a fancy selection of the next page in the heirarchy... some eye catching navigation method to add "class" to your server.  There are a number of ways to do this, each a little more complex than the other.
<p>
<h2>Classes of Web Server</h2>
<p>
In our <a href="whitep.htm">white paper</a> we discuss a number of different goals for web servers, and how they apply to your design.  If you haven't read it yet, you might want to take a few minutes to do so.  Don't worry if you don't understand it all yet, it will become more clear as you move on.  By the way, if you see a term you don't understand, you can look at our <a href="gloss.htm">glossary</a>.
<p>
For now, however, we can simplify the types of web servers into three groups:
<ol>
<p>
<b><li>Super Complex</b> - Web Servers with large Bitmaps, Image Maps, and CGI forms based interface for moivng between pages.
<b><li>Complex</b> - Web Servers with bitmaps, graphics and a complex interconnection between pages, but usually without CGI froms or data input from the user.
<b><li>Simple</b> - Brief informational structure, with simple text and a few small grahpics, geared toward better performance on the Internet rather than flashy imagery.
</ol>
<p>
The class (1 is the highest class, 3 is the lowest) you choose will depend upon what you plan to do with your web server.  For instance a major corporation does not want to look too "stingy", thus are almost required to go for Super Complex, but still choose to goto class 2 for economical reasons.  A small business looking for a new channel for the sales of their products, may opt for a simple class three server, and then upgrade to a more fancy setup later when the web server has paid for itself.
<p>
Regardless of which class you choose, you probably want to look at our <a href="diyhome.htm">Designer Guide</a> before making the "build or buy" decision.

This page is intended to always be under construction so please take a look around.  There is just no other way to bring you leading edge knowlege without constantly rewriting and rephrasing. <p>

</center><H1>OneStep Internet Services Provider Services - Do It Yourself Web Server
</h1>
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="diyunix.htm">UNIX</a> based servers
<li><a href="diynt.htm">Windows NT</a> based servers
</ul>
<p>
As you can see above, if you decide to build up your own server, you have a major software decision to make right up front.  Is it going to be UNIX or Windows NT based.  In terms of widespread knowlege in the world of the Internet, there are many more fully functional UNIX based sites out there.  But a lot of people think that Windows NT will make for easier to upgrade and maintain web servers.  <p>
In fact, Onestep has an NT server available for experimentation, and we like it a lot.  However, it seems we are always trying to figure out how to integrate the NT with our UNIX boxes while at the same time, our HD Computer's Pentium PC has a harder time talking to the NT server than the UNIX.
<p>
Actually the problems are really embedded in TCP/IP and its close links to UNIX that seem to cause all the problems...many TCP/IP packages for Windows try to look and feel familiar to X Windows/UNIX users, and some of this spreads to the actual interface.  
<p>
For instance, the interface for one of our Windows FTP utility (which works just fine with UNIX) assumes it is okay to tack on a "/" at the end of the directory it is logging into (automatically thank you very much).  While this is okay for UNIX, and while the software engineer did an excellent job of allowing us to type in a fully qualified path for this logon directory, it is a major problem for talking to NT.  Here is the sample:
<p>
<p>
<h3>UNIX</h3>
<pre>
    /var/httpd    (input by the user>

    /var/httpd/   (sent to the UNIX host at FTP logon time)
<p>
<p>
<h3>NT</h3>
<p>
   \httpd\htdocs\  (input by the user)
   \httpd\htdocs\/ (sent to the NT host at FTP log on time)
</pre>
<p>
As you can see, the interface to the user lies just a tad, and what gets sent 
to FTP is, unfortunately, worthless to NT.  The only choice for us is to ask the software manufacturer for a new version of the software with either the "/" fixed, or with an additional OS selection for NT that automatically fixes it up for us (I'd prefer that the software figure out that we're not in UNIX anymore, Toto, and change path "/"s to "\" for windows).  We won't even go into such nonsense as DOS drive letters.
<p>
In any case, despite the integration of OS problems, the other admin activities on Windows NT server may it extremely easy for a Windows knowlegeable user to maintain.  Training a 12 year old only took about 1 hour...you can forget it for most 12 year olds and UNIX.
<p>
So, make your first decision...it should be based on the availability of hardware and cost of software (oh...okay, hardware costs money too...but the same hardware can essentially be used for SCO Open Server or Windows NT).  For instance if you have a SUN lying around justing drooling over have a Web Page loaded onboard, then you choices of interface software are pretty straightforward.  If you want to try NT, don't fear, your hardware investment can be switched to SCO Open Server with little or no fuss.

<H1>OneStep Internet Services Provider Services - Do Your Own Marketing</h1>
<p>
Well its really not THAT hard.  But be prepared to spend time online.  Here's how it works.  You search for topic areas of interest to your customers.  Then vist those areas.  When you find one that is especially suited to your customers, then write the webmaster and see if a link to your Home Page would be possible.  Maybe the other folks would like you to link to them too!  It's a network...so let's use as a network...a network of friends and new friends doing business together.
<p>
<h2>Advertising</h2>
<p>
Advertising on the NET is a strange animal.  The most prevalent method is via EMail.  Like the advertising on your television, this is intrusive.  Word of mouth is better however.  For instance, instead of blasting out a message to everyone, think about compiling a list of Internet contacts.  As this list grows (along with your NET based customer base), then so does your exposure.  This is limited growth, but it beats hitting people over the head!  A good salesman will tell you that qualified leads pay dividends.   Using your search list you created when looking for similar topic areas to your own, make personal Email contact with te contact at the home page you are interested in.  Sometimes all it takes is for you two to find out your doing something similar and BOOM you have a new partner on the NET.

</h1>
<p>
So you have looked at the costs of the equipment and software, and considered that you will need someone to administer and otherwise put together all the components that go into a web server.  And after looking at that, you;ve decided maybe you can do it yourself.
<p>
To help you with this challenge are two areas within the OneStep Internet Services web space that will be emmensely helpful.  First, though, you should read the <a href="white.htm">white paper</a> (if you haven't already), to get a clear picture of how to design your web page.
<p>
Once you taken that setpe. you'll need to begin a parallel effort:
<p>
<ul>
<b><li></b>Get your hardware people working on acquiring the appropriate hardware and software.  Don't be in a rush, there is lots of used equipment perfect for the task of webbing.  
Once the hardware is located, have the admin folks begin to add the OS and install the server software.  OneStep  Internet Service scan act in several different capacities to help you through this trying period.
<b><li></b>While the hardware and OS folks are struggling with getting the PC operable, ask your software folks to get busy on storyboarding the flow of the pages.  Require frequent reviews of all the sections of the target web space,  and ensure thee is a good logical flow.  When you finally "buy-off" on the storyboards, then and only then should work begin on the HTML and images necessary for your web space.
<b><li></b>A word about CGI and Imagemaps.  If your Web Space is of the highly complex variety taking full advantage of CGI scripts and Imagemaps, then some additional planning and coordination will need to take place.  This is an extremely sensitive servef security area, as well as fraught with "thrashing" type errors until you get it up and running.  Again, we suggest a professional, like ourselves, to help you through this effort.
</ul>

<h1>Logo Services</h1>
</center>
Our Graphics Staff excel in the creation of new Corporate Identities including
the building of a new logo for your enterprise.  Below we list several categories
you need to consider when deciding on a new logo.  Especially important on the 
Internet is the size and number of colors used in your color logo.  For 
example, the size and colors determine how many bytes of data are required to
store the logo, which directly effects how fast the logo can be moved from the
web page to the user's display.  
<p>
Few people will sit still for 1MB image to be
"downloaded" while browsing the Internet.  However, as long as you warn folks
about a large logo, say 140,000 bytes, or better yet give them the option to
not have to wait, then your logo does not become a problem.  
<p>
Also you want to ensure your logo is scaleable.  For instance, the logo could
look fantastic at a 2"x3" size, but once scaled down to .5"X.75", the logo
is undecipherable.  That's unfortunate, because that might be the size you 
need to use on lower pages in the web heirarchy, or perhaps used on your 
letterhead.
<p>
As you can see there are a number of things to consider when creating a logo. The previous
examples are just a few of the important matters that must be discussed when 
devloping a new logo.  But for now we will give you a few examples...both to
show you what we can do, but also to get your own creative processes brewing on
this very important aspect of marketing your company.
<p>
Below are a number of examples or our work.  The possibilities are endless 
however, so if you have an idea of a new logo or want us to create an all new
idea for you, we are ready to help:

<B>WHAT ARE CONSULAR INFORMATION SHEETS, TRAVEL WARNINGS & PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS?</B><P>
<B>Travel Warnings</B> are issued when the State Department decides, based on all relevant information, to recommend that Americans avoid travel to a certain country.  Countries where avoidance of travel is recommended will have Travel Warnings as well as Consular Information Sheets.<P>
<B>Consular Information Sheets</B> are available for every country of the world.  They include such  information as location of the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the subject country, unusual immigration practices, health conditions, minor political disturbances, unusual currency and entry regulations, crime and security information, and drug penalties.  If an unstable condition exists in a country that is not severe enough to warrant a Travel Warning, a description of the condition(s) may be included under an optional section entitled "Areas of Instability."  On limited occasions, we also restate in this section any U.S. Embassy advice given to official employees.  Consular Information Sheets generally do not include advice, but present information in a factual manner so the traveler can make his or her own decisions concerning travel to a particular country.<P>
<B>Public Announcements</B> are a means to disseminate information about terrorist threats and other relatively short-term and/or trans-national conditions posing significant risks to the security of American travelers.  They are made any time there is a perceived threat and usually have Americans as a particular target group.  In the past, Public Announcements have been issued to deal with short-term coups, bomb threats to airlines, violence by terrorists and anniversary dates of specific terrorist events.

Albania - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 March 21, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Albania has undergone profound political 
change and continues to see significant economic change.  Facilities 
for tourism are not well developed, and many of the goods and 
services taken for granted in other European countries are not yet 
available.  Hotel accommodations are limited outside of Tirana.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport is required but a visa is not 
necessary for a tourist stay of up to 30 days.  An extension may be 
granted by applying at the local police station.  Please contact the 
Embassy of the Republic of Albania at 1150 18th Street, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20005, tel: (202) 223-4942, for additional visa 
information.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are limited and medicine is 
in short supply.  Doctors and hospitals generally expect immediate 
cash payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance is not 
always valid outside the United States.  Travelers have found that 
supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas coverage is 
useful.  Further information on health matters can be obtained from 
the Centers for Disease Control's international traveler's hotline 
at (404) 332-4559.
<p>
<b>Crime Information:</b>  Albania has a relatively low rate of violent 
crime.  However, street crime is common and occurs against tourists 
both day and night.  Crime is generally directed at targets of 
opportunity, not at Americans in particular.
<p>
The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported 
immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate.  The Department of State's pamphlet "A Safe Trip Abroad" 
is available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.  It provides useful 
information on guarding valuables and protecting personal security 
while traveling abroad.
<p>
<b>Currency Regulations:</b>  Credit cards and traveler's checks are not 
accepted in Albania except at the major new hotels in Tirana.  
Personal checks are not accepted anywhere.
<p>
<b>Other Information:</b>  Several Albanian citizens were killed in a 
carbombing in February 1996.  Following that incident a number of 
smaller, widely scattered bombings occurred.  No one has claimed 
responsibility, and no Americans have been affected or targeted thus 
far.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use 
and dealing of illegal drugs are severe, and convicted offenders can 
expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Registration and Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens may register at 
the U.S. Embassy and obtain updated information on travel and 
security within Albania.  The U.S. Embassy in Tirana is located at 
Rruga E Elbasanit 103; Telephone (355) (42) 32875.
<p>
 No. 96-074
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated August 18, 1995, 
to add information about bombings.

For Immediate Release<p>

Political forces disappointed with the conduct and results of May 26 parliamentary elections in
Albania have called for public demonstrations to protest the elections.  One unapproved
demonstration in central Tirana on May 28 was dispersed by police and resulted in injuries to
participants and bystanders.  The U.S. Embassy in Tirana strongly advises American citizens to
avoid areas where political protests are expected, to leave the area of spontaneous demonstrations
and to avoid any large gatherings of people.<p>

July 15, 1996<p>

<b>Country Description:</b>  Bhutan is a small land-locked Himalayan monarchy.  By treaty it accepts
the guidance of India in foreign affairs.  Facilities for tourism are limited.<p>

<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  Tourists are admitted only in groups by prearrangement with Bhutan's
Ministry of Tourism.  Entry is available only via India, Bangladesh, Nepal, and Thailand; the
border with China is closed.  A passport and visa are required.  For entry information, contact the
Bhutan Travel Service, 120 East 56th Street, New York, N.Y., 10022, telephone (212) 838-6382,
or the Bhutanese Mission to the United Nations in New York, telephone (212) 826-1919.<p>

<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities in Bhutan are limited.  Some medicine is in short supply. 
Doctors and clinics often require immediate cash payment for health services.  As U.S. medical
insurance is not always valid outside the United States, supplemental medical insurance with
specific overseas coverage, including medical evacuation, has proved helpful.  Information on
health matters can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's international
travelers hotline, telephone (404) 332-4559, or via the cdc home page on the Internet at
http://www.state.gov.<p>

<b>Information on Crime:</b>  There is relatively little crime in Bhutan.  However, some pickpocketing
and purse snatching has been reported.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be
reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  Useful
information on safeguarding valuables, protecting personal security, and other matters while
traveling abroad is provided in the Department of State pamphlets.  "A Safe Trip Abroad" and
"Tips for Travelers to South Asia."  They are available from the Superintendent of Documents,
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<p>

<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  Travelers are subject to the laws and legal practices of the country in which they
travel.  Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly enforced in Bhutan. 
Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.<p>

<b>Traffic and Road Conditions:</b>  Although Bhutan's road network is not extensive, principal sites
likely to be visited by travelers are connected by reasonably well-maintained, paved, two-lane
roads.  Traffic is rarely heavy.  Nevertheless, sharp curves, narrow lanes, and limited visibility in
mountainous terrain make reduced speeds and special caution advisable.<p>

<b>Embassy Location and Registration:</b>  There is no U.S. Embassy or Consulate in Bhutan;
however, updated information on travel and security in Bhutan may be obtained at any U.S.
Consulate or Embassy in India or Bangladesh.  Although no formal diplomatic relations exist
between the United States and Bhutan, informal contact is maintained through the U.S. Embassy
in New Delhi.  For assistance, U.S. citizens can contact the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi (located
at Shanti Path, Chanakyapuri, 110021); U.S. Consulates in Bombay, Calcutta or Madras; or to a
more limited degree, the U.S. Embassy in Dhaka, Bangladesh (located at the Diplomatic Enclave,
Madani Avenue, Baridhara).  The U.S. Embassy telephone number in New Delhi is (91)(11)
6889033 or 6113033.  In Dhaka, the U.S. Embassy telephone number is (880)(2) 884-700-22.<p>

 No. 96-133<p>

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated October 5, 1994 to update the U.S. Embassy
telephone numbers and to include information on Traffic and Road Conditions.<p>

Canada - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 July 23, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Canada is a highly developed stable 
democracy.  Tourist facilities are widely available except in 
northern and wilderness areas, where they are less developed and can 
be vast distances apart.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  For information on entry requirements, 
travelers can contact the Embassy of Canada at 501 Pennsylvania 
Avenue, N.W., Washington, DC 20001, (202) 682-1740 or the nearest 
Canadian consulate in Atlanta, Boston, Buffalo, Chicago, Dallas, 
Detroit, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York, San Juan or 
Seattle.  Please note that due to international concern over child 
abduction, single parents, grandparents or guardians traveling with 
children often need proof of custody or notarized letters from the 
other parent authorizing travel.  Anyone under age 18 and traveling 
alone should carry a letter from his/her parent or guardian 
authorizing the trip.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Good medical care is widely available.  U.S. 
medical insurance may not be valid in Canada.  Travelers have found 
that in some cases, supplemental medical insurance with specific 
Canadian coverage has proven useful.  Further information on health 
matters can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's international travelers hotline (404) 332-4559 or visit 
the CDC home page on the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Crime Information:</b>  There is a higher incidence of criminal 
activity in urban areas.  However, violent crimes such as murder, 
armed robbery, and rape are infrequent.  The loss or theft of a U.S. 
passport abroad should be reported immediately to the local police 
and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  U.S. citizens can refer 
to the Department of State's pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad" for ways 
to promote a more trouble-free journey.  Additional information on 
Canada can be found in the brochure "Tips for Travelers to Canada" 
or on the Consular Affairs Internet site at http://travel.state.gov. 
 Both publications are available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington  D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to Canadian laws while 
in Canada.  Penalties for possession, use, and dealing in illegal 
drugs are strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences 
and fines.
<p>
<b>Road and Traffic Information:</b>  Road safety is excellent.  U.S. 
driver's licenses are valid in Canada.  Proof of auto insurance is 
required.  Driving under the influence of alcohol is a serious 
offense.  Penalties are heavy and any prior conviction (no matter 
how long ago or how minor the infraction) is grounds for exclusion 
from Canada.  A waiver of exclusion may be obtained from Canadian 
consulates in the United States, but requires several weeks.  It is 
illegal to take automobile radar detectors into Quebec, Ontario, 
Manitoba or the Yukon and Northwest territories.  The police will 
confiscate radar detectors, whether in use or not, and impose fines 
up to $1000.
<p>
<b>Other Information:</b>  Firearms are strictly controlled.  In general, 
handguns, pepper spray and mace are not permitted.  Anyone wishing 
to bring hunting rifles can contact in advance the nearest Canadian 
consulate for detailed information and instructions.  In all cases, 
travelers must declare to Canadian Customs authorities any firearms 
in their possession when entering Canada.  If a traveler is denied 
permission to bring the firearm in, there are in many cases 
facilities near border crossings where firearms may be stored 
pending the traveler's return to the U.S.  Canadian law requires 
that officials confiscate guns from those crossing the border who 
deny having guns in their possession.  Confiscated guns are never 
returned.
<p>
<b>Registration and Embassy/Consulate Locations:</b>  U.S. citizens who 
register in the Consular Section at the U.S. Embassy or at a U.S. 
Consulate may obtain updated information on travel and security 
within Canada.
<p>

Egypt - Consular Information Sheet<br>
August 20, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Egypt is a developing country with extensive 
facilities for tourists.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport and visa are required.  For 
travelers arriving by air, a renewable 30-day tourist visa can be 
obtained at airport points of entry.  Visitors arriving overland and 
by sea, or those previously experiencing difficulty with their visa 
status in Egypt, must obtain a visa prior to arrival.  Military 
personnel arriving on commercial flights are not exempt from 
passport and visa requirements.  Proof of yellow fever and cholera 
immunization is required if arriving from an infected area.  
Evidence of an AIDS test is required for everyone staying over 30 
days.  For additional entry information, U.S. citizens can contact 
the Embassy of the Arab Republic of Egypt, 3521 International Court, 
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, tel. 202-895-5400, or the Egyptian 
consulates in San Francisco, Chicago, New York, or Houston.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  Egyptian extremist groups seeking to 
overthrow the government have staged violent attacks against 
Egyptian police and security officials, Egyptian Christians and 
moderate Muslim intellectuals.  In several incidents, extremists 
have sought to cripple the Egyptian economy through attacks on 
tourists, tour buses, and sites frequented by tourists.  Some 
attacks have occurred in Cairo, but the vast majority of the violent 
incidents have taken place in the southern provinces of Assiyut, 
Minya and Qena, which lie between Cairo and Luxor.  All surface 
travel (bus, car, train, boat, etc.) through those provinces is 
considered dangerous.  While there have been no specific credible 
threats singling out American citizens or businesses in Egypt, 
Islamic extremists have threatened to target foreign investors and 
tourists.  A series of successful police counter-terrorist 
operations since the beginning of 1994 has reduced terrorist 
capabilities and operations.  Sporadic incidents of extremist 
violence continue, however, and the threat of terrorist activity 
directed against tourist targets remains a concern.
<p>
<b>Restricted Areas:</b>  Those wishing to visit areas near Egypt's 
frontiers, including oases near the border with Libya and off-road 
areas in the Sinai, must obtain permission from the Travel Permits 
Department of the Ministry of the Interior, located at the corner of 
Sheikh Rihan and Nubar Streets in downtown Cairo.  Travelers should 
also be aware of the possible dangers of off-road travel.  Leftover 
mines from previous conflicts remain buried in several regions of 
the country and have caused several deaths, including deaths of 
Americans.  As a rule, all travelers should check with local 
authorities before embarking on off-road travel.  Because known mine 
fields are not marked by signs but are usually enclosed by barbed 
wire, travelers should particularly avoid areas enclosed by barbed 
wire.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  There are many Western-trained medical 
professionals in Egypt.  The U.S. Embassy in Cairo can provide a 
list of local hospitals and English-speaking physicians.  Medical 
facilities are adequate for non-emergency matters, particularly in 
the areas where most tourists visit.  Emergency and intensive care 
facilities are, however, limited.  Facilities outside of Cairo fall 
short of U.S. standards.  Most Nile cruise boats do not have a 
ship's doctor, but some employ a medical practitioner with the 
equivalent of a U.S. bachelor's degree.  Hospital facilities are 
available in Luxor and Aswan, but are extremely limited at most 
other ports of call.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid 
outside the United States.  The U.S. Embassy highly recommends 
travelers evaluate their local policies and consider purchasing 
traveler's insurance if their policies do not cover overseas 
treatment or medivacs.  Doctors and hospitals expect immediate 
payment in cash for treatment.  Beaches on the Mediterranean and Red 
Sea coasts are generally unpolluted; however, there is a strong risk 
of exposure to the bilharzia parasite when swimming in the Nile or 
canals, walking barefoot along the river or drinking untreated river 
water.  Bilharzia can cause extensive tissue damage, kidney failure 
and blindness.  The risk of exposure to rift valley fever (RVF) 
exists throughout Egypt.  RVF is a disease of domestic animals that 
can infect humans and which flares up in parts of the country from 
time to time.  Preventive measures include avoiding freshly 
slaughtered meat and known areas of infestation.  Properly prepared, 
thoroughly cooked meat in tourist hotels, Nile cruise boats, and 
tourist restaurants is considered safe.  Additional information on 
health matters can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention's international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559 
or via the CDC home page on the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  The crime rate in Egypt is low.  While 
incidents of violence are rare, purse snatching, pickpocketing and 
petty theft are not uncommon.  Unescorted women are vulnerable to 
sexual harassment and verbal abuse.  Travelers and foreign residents 
are subject to Egyptian laws.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport 
abroad should be reported immediately to local police and the 
nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  Useful information on 
safeguarding valuables, protecting personal security, and other 
matters while traveling abroad is provided in the Department of 
State pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to the 
Middle East and North Africa."  They are available from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  Travelers are subject to the laws and legal 
practices of the country in which they travel.  Drug enforcement 
policies in Egypt are very strict.  The death penalty may be imposed 
on anyone convicted of smuggling or selling marijuana, hashish, 
opium, LSD, or other narcotics.  Law enforcement authorities 
prosecute and seek fines and imprisonment in cases of possession of 
even small quantities of drugs.
<p>
<b>Customs Requirements:</b>  Everyone entering Egypt must declare items 
such as jewelry, electronic equipment, and other valuables.  This 
requirement is strictly enforced.  Any valuables not accounted for 
may be confiscated.  There are no currency exchange requirements.  A 
maximum of 1000 Egyptian pounds may be carried into or out of Egypt.
<p>
<b>Photography Requirements:</b>  There are strict duties on the 
importation of expensive photographic and video equipment.  This 
includes most types of equipment typically carried by tourists to 
Egypt, including all video cameras, all autofocus cameras, etc.  
Travelers who wish to take such equipment with them on a temporary 
visit have three options with Customs authorities: (A) The Customs 
inspector may inventory the equipment and list it by model and 
serial number in their passports, so that the equipment can be 
crosschecked when they leave Egypt, in which case no duty will be 
collected.  (B) The traveler may have the equipment placed in 
storage for the duration of their stay, in which case a storage fee 
may be collected.  (C) Long-term visitors or residents will pay the 
standard duty fee for importing these items and be issued a receipt; 
at the time of departure the fee will be refunded upon presentation 
of the receipt.  There are restrictions on photographing military 
personnel and sites, bridges and canals.
<p>
<b>Dual Nationality:</b>  The government of Egypt considers all children 
born to Egyptian fathers to be Egyptian citizens.  Even if the 
children bear American passports, immigration officials may require 
proof that the father approves their departure before the children 
will be allowed to leave Egypt.  Americans married to Egyptians do 
not need their spouse's permission to depart Egypt as long as they 
have a valid Egyptian visa.  To renew a visa, or to leave the 
country after a visa has expired, an American woman married to an 
Egyptian must present proof of the husband's consent.  Dual 
Egyptian-American nationals may enter and leave Egypt on their U.S. 
passports.  If a dual national resides in Egypt for extended 
periods, proof of Egyptian citizenship, such as a family I.D. card, 
is required.  Male dual nationals of military age, who have not 
completed military service, are not generally required to enlist in 
the armed forces; however, before they can leave Egypt, they must 
obtain an exemption certificate through the Ministry of Defense 
draft office.  Individuals who may be affected can inquire at an 
Egyptian consular office abroad before traveling to Egypt.  Persons 
with dual nationality who travel to Egypt on their Egyptian 
passports are normally treated as Egyptian citizens.  U.S. consular 
assistance to such persons is extremely limited.
<p>
<b>Traffic Safety and Road Conditions:</b>  The roads in Egypt can be 
hazardous, particularly at night outside of major cities, as 
vehicles sometimes travel with few or no lights.  Fatal accidents 
have occurred.
<p>
<b>Embassy Location and Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens who register at 
the U.S. Embassy in Cairo can obtain updated information on travel 
and security within Egypt.  The U.S. Embassy in Cairo is located on 
Lazoughli Street, Garden City, near downtown Cairo.  The mailing 
address from the U.S. is American Embassy Cairo, APO AE 09839-4900; 
from Egypt, it is 8 Kamal El-Din Salah Street, Cairo.  The telephone 
number is (20)(2) 355-7371.  The Consular Section telephone is 
(20-2)357-2201; the Consular fax is (20)(2) 357-2472.
<p>
The workweek in Egypt is Sunday through Thursday.
<p>
 No. 96-145
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated August 7, 1996, 
to delete tourist registry requirements, as these have been removed 
by the Egyptian Government.  All other information remains the same.

<b>Egypt - Public Announcement</b><br>
April 23, 1996<p>

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
Office of the Spokesman<br>
For Immediate Release<p>

Several Egyptian organizations have designated Friday, April 26, as a day of solidarity with
Lebanon to be observed in Egyptian mosques, universities and other public places.  In addition,
the press has reported threats by an Egyptian terrorist group to kidnap American citizens in order
to pressure the U.S. Government to release Sheikh Omar Abdel Rahman.<p>

In light of this information, the U.S. Embassy in Cairo recommends that Americans in Egypt
observe the following security precautions:<p>

--   Avoid the vicinity of mosques, including the Hussain Mosque in the Khan El-Khalili area,
during mid-day prayers on Fridays.<p>

--   In general, avoid possible flash points such as fights, accidents, demonstrations, and hostile
crowds.<p>

--   Remain aware of your surroundings when out in public.  Vary your daily routine to avoid

<B>Ethiopia - Consular Information Sheet</B><BR>
September 13, 1995<P>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Ethiopia is a developing east African country.  A transitional government, which came to power in September 1991 following two decades of civil war, turned over power to an elected permanent government August 22, 1995.  Although most of Ethiopia is stable, some outlying areas of the country continue to experience lawlessness and there are scattered reports of low-level civil strife.  Tourism facilities in Ethiopia are minimal.  Eritrea, formerly a province of Ethiopia, became an independent country on May 24, 1993.  There is a separate Consular Information Sheet on Eritrea.<P>
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport and a visa are required, as well as evidence of yellow fever immunization.  Travelers must enter Ethiopia by air, either at Addis Ababa or at Dire Dawa.  Travelers entering overland risk being detained by immigration authorities and/or fined.  Airport visas may be obtained only if 72 hours advance notice has been provided by the traveler's sponsoring organization to proper authorities within Ethiopia.  Airport visas are not available to travelers departing from or traveling through a country where an Ethiopian diplomatic mission is located.  Exit visas are required of all visitors remaining in Ethiopia for more than 30 days.  There is an airport departure tax of ten U. S. dollars, payable in hard currency, for all foreigners.   For more information on entry/exit requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of Ethiopia, 2134 Kalorama Road, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 234-2281/2.<P>
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>
Incidents of banditry are not uncommon in the southernmost areas of Ethiopia, along the Kenyan border and as far north as Woleyita (former Sidamo province).  Isolated incidents of violence have recently occurred in other regions as well, including the Lake Tana, Lake Langano, Awassa, and Arbaminch areas.  There have also been sporadic reports of armed clashes between various opposition elements and government forces in Region 5 (Somalia border area).  There is also possible spillover from the conflict in Somalia for travelers in nearby border areas.  Oromo Liberation Front (OLF) elements claim that armed OLF units periodically clash with forces of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) in the western area of Nekemte (former Wollega province) and in the east, around Harar.  However, these claims are unconfirmed.<P>
<p>
<b>Travel within the Country:</b>  Domestic and international air services generally operate on schedule, although flights between Addis Ababa and Asmara are heavily booked and may be canceled without warning.  Airport security procedures are thorough.  Nevertheless, there have been occasional hijackings of domestic flights.  No American citizens or other passengers have been harmed.<P>
<p>
<b>Domestic Travel Hazards:</b>  Land mines and other anti-personnel devices can be encountered frequently in areas which suffered fighting during the war. Areas such as the route to Asebeteferi, the vicinity of Harar, the Ogaden region, and the roads north from Addis Ababa to Tigray province are known mined areas.  Many persons, including foreigners, have been injured by these devices.  Travel on paved roads generally is safer than travel on unpaved roads.  Areas off the pavement around bridges or water crossings may also be hazardous.  Overland travel is especially dangerous in areas east and south of Harar, in Region 5 (formerly known as the Ogaden), due to land mines on the main road between Harar and Jijiga.  Irregular fuel supplies can make traveling by car outside of Addis Ababa very difficult.  Vehicle travel after dark outside Addis Ababa and other cities is dangerous due to the possibility of armed robbery and dangerous driving conditions.<P>
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities in Ethiopia are extremely limited. Even the best hospitals in Addis Ababa suffer from inadequate facilities, antiquated equipment and shortages of supplies, particularly medicine, although physicians themselves are generally well-trained.  Emergency assistance is limited.  Travelers generally bring their own supplies of prescription drugs and preventive medicines.  Doctors and hospitals usually expect cash payment for services.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide for payment of medical services outside the United States.  Not all U.S. medical insurance is valid outside the United States.  Supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas coverage and medical evacuation provisions has proved useful.  Information on health matters may be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control's international travelers hotline, telephone (404) 332-4559.<P>
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Pickpocketing is prevalent in urban areas and there have been numerous reports of thieves snatching jewelry.  Banditry occurs on roads outside major towns or cities, and may be accompanied by violence. The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The pamphlets "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on protecting personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in the region in general.  Both are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<P>
<p>
<b>Currency Regulations:</b>  The black market for hard currency is declining as the official and free market rates for the Ethiopian birr converge. Visitors must declare hard currency upon arrival and may be required to present this declaration when applying for an exit visa.  Penalties for exchanging money on the black market range from fines to imprisonment. Credit cards are accepted by only one hotel in Ethiopia.  Foreigners are required to pay for hotel and car rental expenses in hard currency.<P>
<p>
<b>Prohibition on Photography:</b>  Certain buildings and public places may not be photographed.  Travel guides, police, and Ethiopian officials can advise if a particular site may be photographed.  Photographing banned sites may result in the confiscation of film and camera.  Equipment such as video cameras and laptop computers must be declared upon arrival and departure from Ethiopia.  Tape recorders require special customs permits.  Those intending prolonged stays should check with the Ethiopian Embassy prior to travel regarding customs procedures.<P>
<p>
<b>Export of Antiques and Animal Skins:</b>  Permits are required before either antiques or animal skins can be exported from Ethiopia.  Antique religious artifacts, including "Ethiopian crosses," require documentation from the National Museum in Addis Ababa.<P>
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly enforced.  Convicted offenders can expect jail sentences, fines and possible confiscation of personal property.<P>
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens who register at the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa may obtain updated information on travel and security in Ethiopia.  The U.S. Embassy is located at Entoto Avenue, P.O. Box 1014, in Addis Ababa.  The telephone is (251-1) 550-666, extension 316/336; the emergency afterhours number is (251-1) 552-558.  The Embassy general fax number is (251-1) 55-21-91 and the consular fax number is (251-1) 551- 094/551-748.<P>
<p>
No. 95-111<P>
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated April 6, 1995, to update the summary of the political situation, the areas where banditry has been reported, the description of airport security, and currency developments.

<b>Gambia - Consular Information Sheet</b><br>
April 18, 1996<p>

<b>Country Description:</b>  The Gambia is a developing country in West Africa.  Facilities for tourism
in Banjul are good, but are limited in availability and quality outside the capital.<p>

<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A visa is required.  Travelers are urged to obtain the latest information on
customs and entry requirements from the Embassy of The Gambia, Suite 1000, 1155 15th Street,
N.W., Washington, D.C. 20005, telephone (202) 785-1399 and 1359; or from the Permanent
Mission of The Gambia to the U.N. at 820 Second Avenue, Suite 900-C, New York, N.Y. 10017,
telephone (212) 949-6640.  Overseas inquiries should be made at the nearest Gambian embassy or
consulate.<p>

<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  The democratic government of the Gambia was overthrown in a military
coup in July 1994.  Although a military government now runs the country, elections are scheduled
for July 1996.  There have been several counter-coup attempts, one of which resulted in a loss of
life among Gambian military personnel.  Roadblocks or road checkpoints should be approached
with caution.  Uniformed soldiers and police officers expect their instructions to be heeded.  In the
event of civil disturbances or fighting among security forces, U.S. citizens may wish to seek
shelter and remain indoors.<p>

<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are limited and some medicines are unavailable.  Doctors
and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health care services.  Travelers should
bring their own supplies of prescription drugs and preventive medicines.  U.S. medical insurance
is not always valid or accepted outside the United States.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does
not provide for payment of medical services outside the United States.  Travelers have found
supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas and medical evacuation coverage to be
useful.  For additional health information, travelers can contact the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention's international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.<p>

<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Petty street crime is on the rise.  The U.S. Embassy urges visitors
driving up country to travel with a recognized travel guide.  Travelers should be cautious of
individuals who persistently offer unsolicited help.<p>

The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to local police and to
the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The pamphlets "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for
Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on protecting personal security while
traveling abroad and on travel in the region in general.  Both are available from the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<p>

<b>Import/Export Restrictions:  </b>The Gambia has strict laws on the import/export of skin bleaching
creams and some medications.  Visitors arriving with substances containing hydroquinone,
hydrocortisone, betamethasone, flucinonide, clobestatol or clobestatone are subject to fines up to
$2,000 and/or three years imprisonment.  Airport police and customs officials routinely inspect
incoming and outgoing luggage.  For a complete list of prohibited items, contact the nearest
Gambian embassy or consulate.<p>

<b>Drug Penalties:  </b>U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country in which they are traveling. 
Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly enforced.  Convicted
offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.<p>

<b>Aviation Oversight:  </b>As a result of an assessment conducted by the U.S. Federal Aviation
Administration (FAA) in 1992, the FAA has found the government of Gambia's civil aviation
authority to not be in compliance with international aviation safety standards for oversight of
Gambia's air carrier operations.  Operations to the U.S. by Gambia's air carriers are not permitted
unless they arrange to have their flights conducted by a carrier from a country meeting
international aviation safety standards.  For further information, travelers may contact the
Department of Transportation at 1-800-322-7873.<p>

<b>Embassy Location/Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to register with the U.S.
Embassy at Kairaba Avenue in Fajara, a suburb of Banjul, and to obtain updated information on
travel and security in the Gambia.  The Embassy's mailing address is P.M.B. No. 19, Banjul, the
Gambia.  The telephone numbers are (220) 392856, 392858, or 391971.<p>

 No. 96-086<p>

India - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 July 30, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  India is an economically developing 
democratic republic.  Tourist facilities varying in degree of 
comfort and amenities are widely available in the major population 
centers and main tourist areas.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport and visa are required for entry 
into India for tourism or business.  A visa must be obtained prior 
to entry at an Indian embassy or consulate abroad.  There are no 
provisions for visas upon arrival and those arriving in India 
without visas that have the correct validity dates and number of 
entries are subject to deportation.  The U.S. Embassy can offer very 
little assistance when U.S. citizens arrive without visas.  For 
further entry information the traveler can contact the Embassy of 
India at 2536, Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, 
telephone (202) 939-9849 or 939-9806 or the Indian Consulates in 
Chicago, New York, San Francisco and Houston.
<p>
<b>Terrorism:</b>  In July 1995, six foreign tourists, including two 
Americans, were kidnapped by terrorists in Kashmir.  One hostage was 
brutally murdered and one escaped;  the remaining hostages have not 
been released.  In 1994, several tourists including an American were 
held for weeks by Kashmiri militants before police rescued them.  In 
1995 and 1996, several bomb explosions in New Delhi killed and 
injured a number of people.  No U.S. citizens were among the 
victims, but other foreign visitors were reported injured.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>
<p>
<b>Countrywide</b> -- The potential exists for outbreaks of communal and 
inter-caste violence in most major cities.  Major civil disturbances 
can pose risks to a traveler's personal safety and can disrupt 
transportation systems and city services.  In response to communal 
violence, Indian authorities may occasionally impose curfews.  In 
addition, political rallies and demonstrations in India have the 
potential for violence especially during periods directly preceding 
and following elections.  Foreigners have not been the targets of 
either communal or political violence in India, and are principally 
at risk only of becoming inadvertent victims.  U.S. citizens should 
contact the U.S. Embassy or the nearest U.S. Consulate for further 
information about the current situation in areas where they wish to 
travel.
<p>
<b>Kashmir</b> -- The Department of State strongly urges private U.S. 
citizens to avoid all travel to the Kashmir Valley area of the State 
of Jammu and Kashmir.  In addition to the American and other foreign 
tourists taken hostage (and one murdered) in Kashmir by terrorists 
in July 1995, in July 1994, an American tourist was fatally shot in 
Srinagar.  In June 1994, militants held two British hikers hostage 
for eighteen days before releasing them.  Within the state, the 
Ladakh region has been unaffected by terrorist violence.  Srinagar, 
the Kashmir Valley and the city of Jammu remain dangerous places 
where terrorist activities and violent civil disturbances continue.  
U.S. government employees are prohibited from traveling to the State 
of Jammu and Kashmir without permission from the U.S. Embassy in New 
Delhi.
<p>
<b>Northeast States</b> -- Sporadic incidents of violence by ethnic 
insurgent groups, including the bombing of buses and trains, are 
reported from disturbed parts of Assam, Manipur, Nagaland, Tripura 
and Meghalaya.  While U.S. citizens have not been specifically 
targeted, visitors are cautioned not to travel outside major cities 
at night.  Security laws are in force, and security personnel have 
been deployed by New Delhi in several Northeast States.  Check with 
the U.S. Consulate in Calcutta (see address below) for information 
on current conditions.
<p>
<b>India-Pakistan Border</b> -- Tensions run high between India and 
Pakistan, particularly over Kashmir.  The only official 
India-Pakistan border crossing point is between Atari, India, and 
Wagah, Pakistan.  A Pakistani visa is required for entry to Pakistan.
<p>
<b>Restricted Areas:</b>  Permission from the Indian government (from 
Indian diplomatic missions abroad or in some cases from the Ministry 
of Home Affairs) is required to visit the states of Mizoram, 
Manipur, Nagaland, Arunachal Pradesh, Sikkim, parts of Kulu District 
and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, border areas of Jammu and 
Kashmir, areas of Uttar Pradesh, the area west of National Highway 
No. 15 running from Ganganagar to Sanchar in Rajasthan, the Andaman 
and Nicobar Islands, and the Union Territory of the Laccadive 
Islands.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Adequate medical care is available in the 
major population centers, but is usually limited in the rural areas 
of the country.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside 
the United States.  Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate 
payment in cash for health services.  Travelers, particularly those 
with ongoing or potential health problems may wish to obtain 
supplemental health insurance which specifically covers overseas 
treatment and medical evacuation.  Additional information on health 
matters can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control's 
international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559 or visit the CDC 
home page on the Internet at http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Petty crime, especially theft of personal 
property, is common.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad 
should be reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. 
embassy or consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables, 
protecting personal security, and other matters while traveling 
abroad is provided in the Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe 
Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to South Asia."  They are 
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  Travelers are subject to the laws and legal 
practices of the country in which they travel.  Penalties for 
possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly 
enforced.  Convicted offenders in India can expect a minimum jail 
sentence of ten years and fines.
<p>
<b>Customs Considerations:</b>  Indian customs authorities strictly 
enforce the laws and regulations governing the declaration, 
importation or possession of gold and gold objects.  Travelers have 
sometimes been detained for possession of undeclared gold objects.
<p>
<b>Mountain Climbing:</b>  Both India and Pakistan claim an area of the 
Karakoram mountain range which includes the Siachen Glacier.  The 
two countries have established military outposts in the region, and 
armed clashes have occurred.  Because of this situation, U.S. 
citizens traveling to or climbing peaks anywhere in the disputed 
areas face significant risk of injury and death.  The disputed area 
includes the following peaks:  Rimo Peak, Apsarasas I, II and III, 
Tegam Kangri I, II and III, Suingri Kangri, Ghiant I and II, Indira 
Col and Sia Kangri.
<p>
<b>Piloting Civil Aircraft:</b>  In past years there have been a number of 
incidents in which civil aircraft have been detained for deviating 
from approved flight plans.  U.S. citizens piloting civil aircraft 
in India must file any changes to previous flight plans and may not 
overfly restricted airspace.
<p>
<b>Traffic Safety and Road Conditions:</b>  Travel by road in India is 
dangerous.  Outside major cities, main roads and highways are poorly 
maintained and always congested.  Even main roads often have only 
two lanes, with poor visibility and inadequate warning markers.  
Heavy traffic including overloaded trucks and buses, scooters, 
pedestrians and livestock, is the norm.  Travel at night is 
particularly hazardous.  In March, a tour bus crashed at night near 
the city of Agra, claiming the lives of five Americans.
<p>
<b>Embassy Location and Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens may register at 
the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi or at one of the U.S. consulates in 
India, obtain updated information on travel and security in India 
and Bhutan and request a copy of the booklet, "Guidelines for 
American Travelers in India."  The U.S. Embassy is located in the 
capital city of New Delhi on Shanti Path, Chanakyapuri 110021; 
telephone (91) (11) 6113033 or 6889033.  There are U.S. Consulates 
General in Mumbai (Bombay) at Lincoln House, 78 Bhulabhai Desai 
Road, Mumbai (Bombay) 400026, telephone (91) (22) 363-3611; in 
Calcutta at 5/1 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Calcutta 700071, telephone (91) 
(033) 22-3611 through 22-3615 and 22-2335 through 22-2337; and in 
Madras on Mount Road, Madras 600006, telephone (91) (44) 827-3040.  
The work week is Monday through Friday.
<p>
 No. 96-138
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet for India dated 
November 25, 1994, to update information on the situation in Kashmir 
and the Northeast States; provide a caution against arriving without 
a valid visa; provide updated health information; add information on 
traffic safety and road conditions; provide the new telephone 
numbers for the Embassy of India in Washington D.C., the U.S. 
Embassy in New Delhi and the U.S. Consulate General in Madras; and 
recognize the city's name change from Bombay to Mumbai.

<b>Jammu &amp; Kashmir - Public Announcement</b><br>
May 17, 1996<p>

 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
 For Immediate Release<p>

As the summer tourist season approaches, the Department of State again strongly urges private
U.S. citizens traveling in India to avoid travel to Jammu and Kashmir, in particular the cities of
Jammu, Srinagar, the Kashmir Valley and surrounding mountains.  Terrorist activities, including
bombings, assassinations, kidnappings, and violent civil disturbances, have occurred in these
areas.  Kidnapping is a particularly strong danger to U.S. citizens and other foreigners in Kashmir. 
There have been bombings attributed to Kashmiri militants as well as armed clashes between
militants and Indian security forces.  While U.S. citizens and other foreigners have not been
targeted in these incidents, some bombings have occurred in public places where foreign visitors
might congregate.<p>

Militants have threatened to use violence to disrupt May 23 and May 30 elections in Kashmir and
Indian security forces are on heightened alert.  There is a possibility of increased violence,
including attacks on airlines and other modes of public transport or other facilities, which could
affect innocent bystanders even after the elections have taken place.<p>

The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi prohibits U.S. government employees from traveling to the
Jammu and Kashmir areas without U.S. Embassy permission.<p>

U.S. citizens in India may wish to contact the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi for updated security
information.  The U.S. Embassy telephone number is (91)(11)688-9033.<p>
No. 96-india<P>
This replaces the previous public announcement of August 17, 1995 to update information on the
dangers of travel by U.S. citizens to Jammu and Kashmir and to provide the new telephone
number for the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi.<p>

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION

Indonesia - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 August 2, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Indonesia is an independent republic 
consisting of more than 13,500 islands spread over 3000 miles.  Its 
economy is developing and tourist services are plentiful in the 
major tourist sites.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  For information about entry requirements, 
travelers may contact the Embassy of the Republic of Indonesia, 2020 
Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20036, telephone (202) 
775-5200.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  Due to the possibility of tension and 
sporadic violence in Indonesia during the period leading up to the 
election in May 1997, all American citizens may wish to exercise 
prudence and common sense, and to avoid demonstrations and other 
activities that could turn violent.
<p>
Although tensions have calmed since the civil disturbances in March 
and April 1996, travelers should be aware that the U.S. Embassy has 
received unconfirmed information that the Free Papua Movement (OPM) 
may be targeting U.S. citizens or U.S. companies in Irian Jaya 
Province for hostage taking or for sabotage.
<p>
Periodically, limited civil unrest resulting in violence has 
occurred in the province of Aceh, located in the far northern tip of 
Sumatra, and in the province of East Timor, located 300 miles north 
of Australia.  In January 1996, a group of foreigners was taken 
hostage in the remote province of Irian Jaya.  The U.S. Embassy 
recommends that persons traveling to the province stay in larger 
towns and avoid traveling to remote villages as well as contact the 
U.S. Embassy in advance of any travel.  Travelers may also need 
permits from police authorities to visit certain regions in Irian 
Jaya province.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  The general level of sanitation and health is 
below U.S. expectations.  Adequate routine medical care is available 
in all major cities.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide 
payment of medical services outside the United States.  Supplemental 
medical insurance with specific overseas coverage including 
provision for medical evacuation may be useful.  Information on 
health matters may also be obtained from the Centers for Disease 
Control and Prevention through its international travelers hotline 
at (404) 332-4559 or visit the CDC home page on the Internet at 
http://www.cdc.gov/.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime: </b> The crime rate in Jakarta is moderate.  
Minor crimes, such as pickpocketing and thefts, occur in popular 
tourist sites throughout the country.  Incidents of carjackings and 
robbery have been reported.  Lost or stolen passports should be 
reported to the local police and the U.S. embassy or nearest 
consulate.  Useful information on guarding valuables and protecting 
personal security while traveling abroad is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad."  It is available 
from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Criminal Penalties:</b>  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is 
subject to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes 
differ significantly from those in the United States and do not 
afford the protections available to the the individual under U.S. 
law.  Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the 
United States for similar offenses.  Persons violating the law, even 
unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested, or imprisoned.  Criminal 
penalties for possession, use, or trafficking of illegal drugs are 
strict, and convicted offenders can expect severe jail sentences and 
fines.
<p>
<b>Road Safety:</b>  Roads in major cities and toll roads are good.  Roads 
become narrower and more poorly maintained in rural areas and remote 
regions.  Driving at night outside major cities can be particularly 
hazardous.
<p>
<b>Registration and Embassy Location:  Americans who register at the 
U.S. Embassy or Consulate may obtain updated information on travel 
and security within the country.
<p>
The U.S. Embassy is located in Jakarta at Medan Merdeka Selatan 5;  
telephone:  (62) (21) 344-2211; fax:  (62) (21) 386-2259.
<p>
The U.S. Consulate General is in Surabaya at Jalan Raya Dr. Sutomo 
33;  telephone:  (62) (31) 582-287/8;  fax:  (62) (31) 574-492.
<p>
There is a consular agent in Bali at Jalan Hayam Wuruk 188, 
Denpasar, Bali; telephone:  (62) (361) 233-605.
<p>
The U.S. Consulate in Medan closed in May 1996.
<p>
 No. 96-141
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated January 25, 
1996, updating the section on Areas of Instability regarding 
demonstrations and other activities.  It also updates the sections 
on Entry Requirements, Medical Facilities, Information on Crime, 
Registration and Embassy Location, and adds sections on Criminal 
Penalties and Road Safety.  The Public Announcement of May 31, 1996, 
regarding instability in Irian Jaya, has been incorporated into this 
Consular Information Sheet.

 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
 For Immediate Release<br>
</b>
<p>
Israel - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 August 7, 1996<br>
<p>
(including areas subject to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian 
Interim Self-Government Authority)
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  The state of Israel is a parliamentary 
democracy with a modern economy.  Tourist facilities are widely 
available.  Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan 
Heights, and East Jerusalem as a result of the 1967 war.  Pursuant 
to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, an elected 
Palestinian Authority now exercises jurisdiction in most of Gaza and 
most of the major cities of the West Bank.  Palestinian Authority 
police have responsibilities for keeping order in those areas and 
the Palestinian Authority exercises a range of civil functions in 
other areas of the West Bank.  The West Bank city of Hebron is still 
under the control of the Israeli Army.  Areas of Israeli and 
Palestinian Authority responsibilities and jurisdiction in the West 
Bank and Gaza are complex.  Definitive information on entry, customs 
requirements, arrests and other matters in the West Bank and Gaza 
may not be available and is subject to change without prior notice.
<p>
<b>Embassy/Consulate Location and Sources of Assistance:</b>   The U.S. 
Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, is located at 71 Hayarkon Street. The 
U.S. mailing address is PSC 98, Box 100, APO AE 09830.  The 
telephone number is (972) (3) 519-7575.  The after hours number is: 
519-7551.  The fax number is 972-3-516-0315.  The e-mail address is 
acs.amcit-telaviv@dos.us-state.gov.
<p>
The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy  in Tel Aviv should be 
contacted for information and help in the following areas:  Israel, 
the Gaza Strip, and ports of entry at Ben Gurion Airport and the 
northern (Jordan River) and Southern (Arava) border crossings 
connecting Israel and Jordan.
<p>
The Consular Section of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem is 
located at 27 Nablus Road. The U.S. mailing  address is PSC 98, Box 
100, APO AE 09830.  The telephone number is (972) (2) 625-3288. The 
after hours number is 625-3291/2.  The fax number is (972) (2) 
627-2233.
<p>
The U.S. Consulate should be contacted for information and help in 
the following areas: West and East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and 
border crossings at the Allenby Bridge, connecting Jordan with the 
West Bank.
<p>
There is a U.S. Consular Agent in Haifa, at 12 Jerusalem Street, 
Haifa 33132, telephone (972) (4) 867-0616.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>
<p>
<b>Israel:</b>  Passports, an onward or return ticket, and proof of 
sufficient funds are required for entry.  A three-month visa may be 
issued for no charge upon arrival, and may be renewed.  Anyone who 
has been refused entry or experienced difficulties with his/her visa 
status during a previous visit, or who has overstayed a visa, can 
obtain information from the Israeli Embassy or nearest consulate 
regarding the advisability of attempting to return to Israel.  
Permission must be obtained from Israel for anyone attempting to 
claim the status of a returning resident.
<p>
<b>Palestinian Authority:</b>  Except during periods of closures, U.S. 
citizens may enter and exit Gaza and the West Bank on a U.S. 
passport with an Israeli visa.  It is not necessary to obtain a 
visitor's permit from the Palestinian Authority.  Private vehicles 
frequently encounter long delays entering or leaving Gaza and may 
also expect to be stopped at checkpoints entering or leaving the 
West Bank.  Palestinian Americans with residency permits for the 
West Bank and Gaza are subject to the same travel restrictions as 
other Palestinians residing in those areas.
<p>
<b>Israel-Jordan Crossings:</b>  International crossing points are now in 
operation between Israel and Jordan at Arava (Wadi Al-'Arabah) 
crossing in the south and the Jordan River crossing (Sheikh Hussein 
Bridge) in the north.  Prior visas are not necessary for American 
citizens using these two crossing points, but travelers will have to 
pay a fee.  Visas should be obtained in advance for those wanting to 
cross the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan and the occupied West 
Bank.  (Note: Palestinian  Americans with residency in the West Bank 
must cross into Jordan using the Allenby Bridge.)  Procedures for 
all crossings into Jordan are subject to frequent changes.  
<p>
For further entry information, travelers may contact the Israeli 
Embassy at 3514 International Dr., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, 
telephone (202) 364-5500, or the nearest Israeli consulate general 
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, or Houston.
<p>
<b>Customs Requirements:</b>  Video cameras, among other items, must be 
declared upon entry to Israel and travelers carrying these items 
must go through the red zone at customs.  Definitive information on 
customs requirements for the Palestinian Authority is not available.
<p>
<b>Security Measures:</b>  Israel has strict security measures that may 
affect visitors.  Prolonged questioning and detailed searches may 
take place at the time of entry and/or departure at all points of 
entry to Israel, including entry from any of the areas under 
Palestinian jurisdiction.  American citizens with Arab surnames may 
expect close scrutiny at Ben Gurion Airport and the Allenby Bridge 
from Jordan.  For security reasons, delays or obstacles in bringing 
in or departing with cameras or electronics equipment are not 
unusual.  During searches and questioning, access may be denied to 
U.S. consular officers, lawyers, or family members.  Definitive 
information on security measures in the Palestinian Authority is not 
available.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>
<p>
<b>West Bank and Gaza:</b>  During periods of unrest, the West Bank and 
Gaza are sometimes closed off by the Israeli Government.  Travel 
restrictions may be imposed with little or no warning.  Following 
the series of suicide bombings in Israel in February and March 1996, 
strict security measures were put into effect.  Movement of 
Palestinians (including Palestinian Americans) and foreign passport 
holders has been severely impaired.
<p>
Demonstrations by Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank have 
led to confrontations and clashes with the police, with some turning 
deadly.  Stone throwing and other forms of protest can occur without 
warning and escalate quickly.
<p>
In view of the continued potential for violence and unrest in the 
West Bank and Gaza, the State Department advises all American 
citizens to avoid travel to these areas, except for daylight visits 
to Bethlehem, Jericho, Highway 1 from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, 
Route 90 through the Jordan Valley, and tourist sites along these 
routes.  This includes the Inn of the Samaritan, Nebi Musa, St. 
George's Monastery, Mount of Temptation Monastery, Qumran, and 
Qualiah Water Park.  The consular section of the Consulate General, 
located at 27 Nablus Road in East Jerusalem, is safe and accessible 
to all visitors.
<p>
The U.S. Government instituted and continues to maintain tight 
security procedures regarding travel of U.S. government employees, 
officials, and dependents to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  
Frequently, U.S. government employees are instructed not to travel 
at all to these areas.  Travel guidelines for U.S. government 
employees may change at any time.
<p>
The Palestinian police force has been established in Gaza and the 
major cities of the West Bank which are under Palestinian 
jurisdiction.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian police patrols and 
checkpoints may be encountered.  Guns are often owned by Israeli 
civilians and by Palestinians in Gaza.
<p>
<b>General Precautions:</b>  Travel on strike days or after dark is not 
recommended.  Tourists using public transportation or traveling by 
car in areas less frequented by tourists are at risk.  Vehicles have 
been damaged, with rental cars in particular being targeted.
<p>
<b>Jerusalem:</b>  In Jerusalem, travelers can reduce their risk of being 
involved in violent incidents by traveling in groups, avoiding the 
old city at night, except for the Jewish Quarter, and exercising 
caution at religious sites on holy days, Fridays, and Saturdays.  
Most roads into Ultra-orthodox Jewish neighborhoods are blocked off 
on Saturdays.  Assaults on secular visitors, either for being in 
cars or for being "immodestly dressed," have been known to occur in 
these neighborhoods.
<p>
<b>In the North:</b>  In the Golan Heights, there are live land mines in 
many areas, and some minefields have not been clearly marked or 
fenced.  Visitors who walk only on established roads or trails will 
reduce the risk of injury from mines.  Rocket attacks from Lebanese 
territory can occur without warning close to the northern border of 
Israel.
<p>
<b>Driving and Road Conditions:</b>  There is a high rate of fatalities 
relating to auto accidents, and caution should be exercised.  While 
the roads in Israel are well built, the roads in Gaza and most of 
the West Bank are of poor quality.
<p>
<b>Terrorism:</b>  Although U.S. citizens have not been specifically 
targeted for attack, several terrorist incidents in the West Bank 
and Gaza, as well as within Israel, have killed or injured U.S. 
citizens.  Several violent attacks have involved passengers on buses 
and at bus stops.  The U.S. Embassy and the Consulate General have 
warned their employees and American citizens to avoid travel on 
public buses, as well as congregating at bus stops and other crowded 
areas.  This restriction does not apply to tour buses.
<p>
<b>Arrests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip:</b>  U.S. citizens arrested or 
detained in the West Bank on suspicion of security offenses often 
are not permitted to communicate with consular officials, lawyers, 
or family members in a timely manner during the interrogation period 
of their case.  Youths over the age of fourteen have been detained 
and tried as adults.  The U.S. Embassy is not normally notified of 
the arrests of Americans in the West Bank by Israeli authorities, 
and access to detainees is frequently delayed.  Notification may be 
more rapid if the arrested American shows a U.S. passport to Israeli 
officials as proof of U.S. citizenship.
<p>
Israeli authorities should notify the U.S. Embassy when an American 
is arrested by Palestinian police in the West Bank or Gaza, and 
requests by the U.S. consul to visit arrested Americans should be 
communicated to the Palestinian Authority through a joint 
Israeli-Palestinian committee.  Significant delays in notification 
and consular access may occur under these procedures.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Modern medical care and medicines are 
available in Israel.  However, some hospitals in Israel and most 
hospitals in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank fall below U.S. 
standards.  Travelers can find information written in English about 
emergency medical facilities and after-hours pharmacies in the 
"Jerusalem Post" newspaper.  Doctors and hospitals often expect 
immediate cash payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance 
is not always valid outside the United States.  Supplemental medical 
insurance with specific overseas coverage has proven useful.  The 
international traveler's hotline at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention at telephone (404) 332-4559 has additional health 
information.  The internet site is http://cdc.gov.  Travelers from 
regions where contagious diseases are prevalent may need to show 
shot records before entry.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  The crime rate is moderate in Israel, the 
Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport 
should be reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. 
embassy or consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables, 
protecting personal security, and other matters is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to the Middle East and North Africa," available from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
territory in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, 
use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe in Israel, and 
convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.  The 
Palestinian Authority also has strict penalties for drug use by 
persons under its jurisdiction.
<p>
<b>Dual Nationality:</b>  Israeli citizens naturalized in the United 
States retain their Israeli citizenship, and their children are 
considered Israeli citizens as well.  In addition, children born in 
the United States to Israeli parents acquire both U.S. and Israeli 
nationality at birth.  Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, 
are subject to Israeli laws requiring service in Israel's armed 
forces.  U.S.-Israeli dual nationals of military age who do not wish 
to serve in the Israeli armed forces may contact the Israeli Embassy 
to obtain proof of exemption or deferment from Israeli military 
service before going to Israel.  Otherwise, they may not be able to 
leave the country without doing military service.  Israeli citizens, 
including dual nationals, must enter and depart Israel on their 
Israeli passports.  (Note: U.S.-Israeli dual citizens must enter and 
depart the U.S. on their U.S. Passports.)
<p>
Palestinian-American citizens with residency rights in Israel, 
Gaza, or the West Bank are subject to the same regulations as other 
resident Palestinians.  This may require them to depart these areas 
with Palestinian travel documents or (for residents of Jerusalem) 
laissez-passers with re-entry permits approved by the Israeli 
Ministry of Interior.
<p>
<b>Registration:</b>  The State Department advises American citizens who 
plan to be in the region for a substantial period of time to 
register at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv or the U.S. Consulate 
General in Jerusalem.  When registering, U.S. citizens can obtain 
updated information on travel and security in the area.
<p>
 No. 96-143
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated May 22, 1995, to 
note continued expansion of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank 
and Gaza, and to provide updated information on border crossings 
between Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan.

<b>Israel - Public Announcement</b><br>
 March 5, 1996<p>

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
Office of the Spokesman<br>
For Immediate Release<p>

The February 25 and March 3 bus bombings in Jerusalem as well as the March 4 bombing at the
shopping district in Tel Aviv were the most recent incidents of terrorist bombing attacks since October
1994, 7 of which were directed against passengers traveling on public buses in Israel and the Gaza
Strip.  Fatalities have totalled over 100, including 4 American citizens.  The Department of State
wishes to reiterate information provided in the Consular Information Sheet on Israel, dated May 22,
1995, that:  "The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv and the Consulate General in Jerusalem have warned
their employees and American citizens to avoid use of public buses and bus stops.  This restriction
does not apply to tour buses."  In addition, the Department wishes to reiterate the following
information also contained in the Consular Information Sheet:  "Although U.S. citizens are not
targeted for attack, terrorist incidents in the West Bank and Gaza, as well as within Israel, sometimes
have involved U.S. citizens."<p>

Israel and the Occupied Territories (Including areas subject to the 
jurisdiction of the Palestinian Interim Self-Government Authority) - 
<p>
Consular Information Sheet<br>
August 7, 1996
<p>
<b>Country Description:  The state of Israel is a parliamentary 
democracy with a modern economy.  Tourist facilities are widely 
available.  Israel occupied the West Bank, Gaza Strip, Golan 
Heights, and East Jerusalem as a result of the 1967 war.  Pursuant 
to negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians, an elected 
Palestinian Authority now exercises jurisdiction in most of Gaza and 
most of the major cities of the West Bank.  Palestinian Authority 
police have responsibilities for keeping order in those areas and 
the Palestinian Authority exercises a range of civil functions in 
other areas of the West Bank.  The West Bank city of Hebron is still 
under the control of the Israeli Army.  Areas of Israeli and 
Palestinian Authority responsibilities and jurisdiction in the West 
Bank and Gaza are complex.  Definitive information on entry, customs 
requirements, arrests and other matters in the West Bank and Gaza 
may not be available and is subject to change without prior notice.
<p>
<b>Embassy/Consulate Location and Sources of Assistance:   The U.S. 
Embassy in Tel Aviv, Israel, is located at 71 Hayarkon Street. The 
U.S. mailing address is PSC 98, Box 100, APO AE 09830.  The 
telephone number is (972) (3) 519-7575.  The after hours number is: 
519-7551.  The fax number is 972-3-516-0315.  The e-mail address is 
acs.amcit-telaviv@dos.us-state.gov.
<p>
The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy  in Tel Aviv should be 
contacted for information and help in the following areas:  Israel, 
the Gaza Strip, and ports of entry at Ben Gurion Airport and the 
northern (Jordan River) and Southern (Arava) border crossings 
connecting Israel and Jordan.
<p>
The Consular Section of the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem is 
located at 27 Nablus Road. The U.S. mailing  address is PSC 98, Box 
100, APO AE 09830.  The telephone number is (972) (2) 625-3288. The 
after hours number is 625-3291/2.  The fax number is (972) (2) 
627-2233.
<p>
The U.S. Consulate should be contacted for information and help in 
the following areas: West and East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and 
border crossings at the Allenby Bridge, connecting Jordan with the 
West Bank.
<p>
There is a U.S. Consular Agent in Haifa, at 12 Jerusalem Street, 
Haifa 33132, telephone (972) (4) 867-0616.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:
<b>Israel: 
Passports, an onward or return ticket, and proof of 
sufficient funds are required for entry.  A three-month visa may be 
issued for no charge upon arrival, and may be renewed.  Anyone who 
has been refused entry or experienced difficulties with his/her visa 
status during a previous visit, or who has overstayed a visa, can 
obtain information from the Israeli Embassy or nearest consulate 
regarding the advisability of attempting to return to Israel.  
Permission must be obtained from Israel for anyone attempting to 
claim the status of a returning resident.
<p>
<b>Palestinian Authority:  Except during periods of closures, U.S. 
citizens may enter and exit Gaza and the West Bank on a U.S. 
passport with an Israeli visa.  It is not necessary to obtain a 
visitor's permit from the Palestinian Authority.  Private vehicles 
frequently encounter long delays 
entering or leaving Gaza and may also expect to be stopped at 
checkpoints entering or leaving the West Bank.  Palestinian 
Americans with residency permits for the West Bank and Gaza are 
subject to the same travel restrictions as other Palestinians 
residing in those areas.
<p>
<b>Israel-Jordan Crossings:  International crossing points are now in 
operation between Israel and Jordan at Arava (Wadi Al-'Arabah) 
crossing in the south and the Jordan River crossing (Sheikh Hussein 
Bridge) in the north.  Prior visas are not necessary for American 
citizens using these two crossing points, but travelers will have to 
pay a fee.  Visas should be obtained in advance for those wanting to 
cross the Allenby Bridge which links Jordan and the occupied West 
Bank.  (Note: Palestinian  Americans with residency in the West Bank 
must cross into Jordan using the Allenby Bridge.)  Procedures for 
all crossings into Jordan are subject to frequent changes.  
<p>
For further entry information, travelers may contact the Israeli 
Embassy at 3514 International Dr., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, 
telephone (202) 364-5500, or the nearest Israeli consulate general 
in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Miami, Atlanta, Chicago, New Orleans, 
Boston, New York, Philadelphia, or Houston.
<p>
<b>Customs Requirements:  Video cameras, among other items, must be 
declared upon entry to Israel and travelers carrying these items 
must go through the red zone at customs.  Definitive information on 
customs requirements for the Palestinian Authority is not available.
<p>
Security Measures:  Israel has strict security measures that may 
affect visitors.  Prolonged questioning and detailed searches may 
take place at the time of entry and/or departure at all points of 
entry to Israel, including entry from any of the areas under 
Palestinian jurisdiction.  American citizens with Arab surnames may 
expect close scrutiny at Ben Gurion Airport and the Allenby Bridge 
from Jordan.  For security reasons, delays or obstacles in bringing 
in or departing with cameras or electronics equipment are not 
unusual.  During searches and questioning, access may be denied to 
U.S. consular officers, lawyers, or family members.  Definitive 
information on security measures in the Palestinian Authority is not 
available.
<p>
Areas of Instability:  
<p>
West Bank and Gaza:  During periods of unrest, the West Bank and 
Gaza are sometimes closed off by the Israeli Government.  Travel 
restrictions may be imposed with little or no warning.  Following 
the series of suicide bombings in Israel in February and March 1996, 
strict security measures were put into effect.  Movement of 
Palestinians (including Palestinian Americans) and foreign passport 
holders has been severely impaired.
<p>
Demonstrations by Palestinians and Israelis in the West Bank have 
led to confrontations and clashes with the police, with some turning 
deadly.  Stone throwing and other forms of protest can occur without 
warning and escalate quickly.
<p>
In view of the continued potential for violence and unrest in the 
West Bank and Gaza, the State Department advises all American 
citizens to avoid travel to these areas, except for daylight visits 
to Bethlehem, Jericho, Highway 1 from Jerusalem to the Dead Sea, 
Route 90 through the Jordan Valley, and tourist sites along these 
routes.  This includes the Inn of the Samaritan, Nebi Musa, St. 
George's Monastery, Mount of Temptation Monastery, Qumran, and 
Qualiah Water Park.  The consular section of the Consulate General, 
located at 27 Nablus Road in East Jerusalem, is safe and accessible 
to all visitors.
<p>
The U.S. Government instituted and continues to maintain tight 
security procedures regarding travel of U.S. government employees, 
officials, and dependents to the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.  
Frequently, U.S. government employees are instructed not to travel 
at all to these areas.  Travel guidelines for U.S. government 
employees may change at any time.
<p>
The Palestinian police force has been established in Gaza and the 
major cities of the West Bank which are under Palestinian 
jurisdiction.  Joint Israeli/Palestinian police patrols and 
checkpoints may be encountered.  Guns are often owned by Israeli 
civilians and by Palestinians in Gaza.
<p>
General Precautions:  Travel on strike days or after dark is not 
recommended.  Tourists using public transportation or traveling by 
car in areas less frequented by tourists are at risk.  Vehicles have 
been damaged, with rental cars in particular being targeted.
<p>
Jerusalem:  In Jerusalem, travelers can reduce their risk of being 
involved in violent incidents by traveling in groups, avoiding the 
old city at night, except for the Jewish Quarter, and exercising 
caution at religious sites on holy days, Fridays, and Saturdays.  
Most roads into Ultra-orthodox Jewish neighborhoods are blocked off 
on Saturdays.  Assaults on secular visitors, either for being in 
cars or for being "immodestly dressed," have been known to occur in 
these neighborhoods.
<p>
In the North:  In the Golan Heights, there are live land mines in 
many areas, and some minefields have not been clearly marked or 
fenced.  Visitors who walk only on established roads or trails will 
reduce the risk of injury from mines.  Rocket attacks from Lebanese 
territory can occur without warning close to the northern border of 
Israel.
<p>
Driving and Road Conditions:  There is a high rate of fatalities 
relating to auto accidents, and caution should be exercised.  While 
the roads in Israel are well built, the roads in Gaza and most of 
the West Bank are of poor quality.  
<p>
Terrorism:  Although U.S. citizens have not been specifically 
targeted for attack, several terrorist incidents in the West Bank 
and Gaza, as well as within Israel, have killed or injured U.S. 
citizens.  Several violent attacks have involved passengers on buses 
and at bus stops.  The U.S. Embassy and the Consulate General have 
warned their employees and American citizens to avoid travel on 
public buses, as well as congregating at bus stops and other crowded 
areas.  This restriction does not apply to tour buses.
<p>
Arrests in the West Bank and Gaza Strip:  U.S. citizens arrested or 
detained in the West Bank on suspicion of security offenses often 
are not permitted to communicate with consular officials, lawyers, 
or family members in a timely manner during the interrogation period 
of their case.  Youths over the age of fourteen have been detained 
and tried as adults.  The U.S. Embassy is not normally notified of 
the arrests of Americans in the West Bank by Israeli authorities, 
and access to detainees is frequently delayed.  Notification may be 
more rapid if the arrested American shows a U.S. passport to Israeli 
officials as proof of U.S. citizenship.
<p>
Israeli authorities should notify the U.S. Embassy when an American 
is arrested by Palestinian police in the West Bank or Gaza, and 
requests by the U.S. consul to visit arrested Americans should be 
communicated to the Palestinian Authority through a joint 
Israeli-Palestinian committee.  Significant delays in notification 
and consular access may occur under these procedures.
<p>
Medical Facilities:  Modern medical care and medicines are 
available in Israel.  However, some hospitals in Israel and most 
hospitals in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank fall below U.S. 
standards.  Travelers can find information written in English about 
emergency medical facilities and after-hours pharmacies in the 
"Jerusalem Post" newspaper.  Doctors and hospitals often expect 
immediate cash payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance 
is not always valid outside the United States.  Supplemental medical 
insurance with specific overseas coverage has proven useful.  The 
international traveler's hotline at the Centers for Disease Control 
and Prevention at telephone (404) 332-4559 has additional health 
information.  The internet site is http://cdc.gov.  Travelers from 
regions where contagious diseases are prevalent may need to show 
shot records before entry.
<p>
Information on Crime:  The crime rate is moderate in Israel, the 
Gaza Strip, and the West Bank.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport 
should be reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. 
embassy or consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables, 
protecting personal security, and other matters is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to the Middle East and North Africa," available from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
Drug Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
territory in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, 
use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are severe in Israel, and 
convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.  The 
Palestinian Authority also has strict penalties for drug use by 
persons under its jurisdiction.
<p>
Dual Nationality:  Israeli citizens naturalized in the United 
States retain their Israeli citizenship, and their children are 
considered Israeli citizens as well.  In addition, children born in 
the United States to Israeli parents acquire both U.S. and Israeli 
nationality at birth.  Israeli citizens, including dual nationals, 
are subject to Israeli laws requiring service in Israel's armed 
forces.  U.S.-Israeli dual nationals of military age who do not wish 
to serve in the Israeli armed forces may contact the Israeli Embassy 
to obtain proof of exemption or deferment from Israeli military 
service before going to Israel.  Otherwise, they may not be able to 
leave the country without doing military service.  Israeli citizens, 
including dual nationals, must enter and depart Israel on their 
Israeli passports.  (Note: U.S.-Israeli dual citizens must enter and 
depart the U.S. on their U.S. Passports.)
<p>
Palestinian-American citizens with residency rights in Israel, 
Gaza, or the West Bank are subject to the same regulations as other 
resident Palestinians.  This may require them to depart these areas 
with Palestinian travel documents or (for residents of Jerusalem) 
laissez-passers with re-entry permits approved by the Israeli 
Ministry of Interior.
<p>
Registration:  The State Department advises American citizens who 
plan to be in the region for a substantial period of time to 
register at the U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv or the U.S. Consulate 
General in Jerusalem.  When registering, U.S. citizens can obtain 
updated information on travel and security in the area.
<p>
 No. 96-143
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated May 22, 1995, to 
note continued expansion of Palestinian self-rule in the West Bank 
and Gaza, and to provide updated information on border crossings 
between Israel, the West Bank, and Jordan.

Kuwait - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 August 28, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Kuwait is a constitutional monarchy with a 
modern economy.  Day-to-day life has returned to normal after the 
1991 Gulf War, and facilities for travelers are widely available.  
The workweek in Kuwait is Saturday through Wednesday.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  Passports and visas are required for U.S. 
citizens traveling to Kuwait.  For more information concerning entry 
requirements, travelers may contact the Embassy of Kuwait at 2940 
Tilden St., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 966-0702, 
or the Kuwaiti Consulate in New York City, telephone (212) 973-4318.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  Travel to and near the Iraq-Kuwait border is 
very hazardous.  U.S. citizens having legitimate work-related 
business near the border may receive updated information from the 
U.S. Embassy, and may also wish to consult with their employer's 
security personnel.  Unexploded bombs, mines, booby traps, and other 
items remain in open areas and beaches throughout Kuwait.  U.S. 
Embassy personnel have been forbidden to travel off paved surfaces 
outside Kuwait City.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  The health care delivery system continues to 
rebuild, with many medical facilities, both government and private, 
available in Kuwait.  Medical care at government-run clinics and 
hospitals is generally provided free of charge or at low cost to 
residents of Kuwait, while private physicians and hospitals charge a 
fee for services.  Non-residents have found that private doctors, 
hospitals and clinics expect immediate cash payment for their 
services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the 
United States.  Medevac insurance, for emergencies requiring 
treatment outside Kuwait, and supplemental medical insurance with 
specific overseas coverage have proven useful.  Additional 
information on health matters can be obtained from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers hotline, 
telephone (404) 332-4559 or visit the CDC Home Page on the Internet 
at http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Crime Information:</b>  The crime rate in Kuwait is moderate.  However, 
weapons left over from the 1991 Gulf War remain in the hands of the 
populace, and shooting incidents have occurred,  Both physical and 
verbal harassment of women is a continuing problem.  The loss or 
theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported immediately to 
local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  Useful 
information on safeguarding valuables, protecting personal security, 
and other matters while traveling abroad is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to the Middle East and North Africa."  They are available 
from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing 
Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Currency Regulations:</b>  Travelers checks and credit cards are widely 
acceptable.  Kuwaiti currency is readily convertible to U.S. dollars.
<p>
<b>Drug and Crime Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of 
the country in which they are traveling.  Alcohol, pork products, 
and pornography are illegal in Kuwait.  Penalties for importation, 
possession, use, manufacture or sale of illegal drugs, alcohol, or 
pornography are severe, and convicted offenders can expect jail 
sentences and fines.  Religious proselytizing is not permitted.
<p>
<b>Terrorist Activities:</b>  Americans in Kuwait should be alert to their 
surroundings and take prudent security precautions.  U.S. citizens 
may wish to consult the Department of State or the U.S. Embassy for 
updated information.
<p>
<b>Child Custody:</b>  In Kuwait, child custody decisions are based on 
Islamic law.  It is extremely difficult for an American woman, even 
a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a Kuwaiti court 
decision.  Regardless of their parents' marital status, minor 
children of a Kuwaiti father may not leave Kuwait without the 
father's permission.
<p>
<b>Traffic Safety and Road Conditions:</b>  Driving in Kuwait can be 
hazardous.  Although Kuwait has an extensive and modern system of 
well-lighted roads, excessive speeding on both primary and secondary 
roads, coupled with lax enforcement of traffic regulations, lead to 
frequent and often fatal accidents.
<p>
<b>Embassy Location and Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register at the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy and to enroll 
in the Embassy's emergency alert network, and to obtain updated 
information on travel and security in Kuwait.  The U.S. Embassy in 
Kuwait is located at Al-Masjid Al-Aqsa Street, Plot 14, Block 14, 
Bayan, Kuwait.  The mailing address is P.O. Box 77, Safat 13001, 
Kuwait; telephone (965) 242-4151 through 9.
<p>
 No. 96-150
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet for Kuwait dated 
September 20, 1994, to update information on areas of instability, 
drug and crime penalties, terrorist activities, and the address of 
the U.S. Embassy, and to add information on child custody and 
traffic safety and road conditions.

<b>Liberia - Travel Warning</b><br>
April 16, 1996<p>

The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Liberia.  Despite a peace accord
signed in August 1995, sporadic fighting and unsettled conditions continue in many areas of
Liberia, including Monrovia.  Travelers may be in danger of being detained, harassed, delayed,
injured, or killed.  Although a peacekeeping force is in place in and around Monrovia, the streets
are not safe.  The Department of State has authorized voluntary departure for dependents and
designated employees of the U.S. Embassy.  Although the U.S. Embassy remains open, the
Consular Section is closed for visa services and is only providing emergency services for U.S.
citizens.  Additional information concerning travel and safety in Liberia can be obtained from the
Department's Consular Information Sheet on Liberia.<p>

No. 96-005<p>

This replaces the Travel Warning for Liberia dated April 11, 1996 to note the cessation of visa
and non-emergency U.S. citizen services.<p>

<p>

<b>Liberia - Consular Information Sheet</b><br>
October 24, 1995<p>

<b>Warning:  </b>The Department of State warns U.S. citizens against travel to Liberia.  Despite a
peace accord signed in August 1995, sporadic fighting and unsettled conditions continue in many
areas of Liberia.  Although a peacekeeping force is in place in and around Monrovia, roads
outside the capital are not open for regular travel.  Travelers to the interior of Liberia may be in
danger of being detained, harassed, delayed, injured, or killed.  There is a high rate of armed
robberies in the city of Monrovia.<p>

<b>Country Description:</b>  Liberia is a developing west African country which has suffered internal
strife for the past several years.  Tourism facilities are poor and, in some cases, non-existent.<p>

<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  Travelers who plan a trip to Liberia despite this warning are required to
have a passport and a visa prior to arrival.  Evidence of yellow fever vaccinations is required.  An
exit permit must be obtained from Liberian immigration authorities before departure.  Further
information on entry requirements for Liberia can be obtained from the Embassy of the Republic
of Liberia, 5201 16th Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20011.  The telephone numbers are (202)
723-0437 to 723-0440.<p>

<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  The situation in Liberia changes daily.  Sporadic fighting has occurred
since the August 1995 peace accords and tensions remain high in most of the country.  There are
only a few expatriates, who are engaged in relief activities, in areas of the country outside
Monrovia.  They operate only with the consent of those locally in control.  In recent years and
months there have been serious and frequent incidents of violence against civilians by partisans of
Liberia's warring factions.  It is too early to determine whether the recent peace accords will lead
to the cessation of all fighting and whether travel to some locations outside the capital will
become safe.  Fatal accidents have occurred from exploding land mines on roads.<p>

A security buffer, provided by forces of the West African Peace Monitoring Group (ECOMOG)
surrounds Monrovia.  Roads outside of Monrovia are not generally safe due to robbers, land
mines and unruly elements of the warring factions.  Any person who leaves Monrovia should
return by dusk.  There is a 10:00PM to dawn curfew in force in the capital.  U.S. Embassy
employees are not permitted to travel outside Monrovia except for official business.<p>

Roberts International Airport, about 30 miles outside of Monrovia, is closed.  Limited daytime air
service exists only to Freetown, Sierra Leone and Abidjan, Cote D'Ivoire.  No major international
carrier serves Monrovia's Spriggs Payne Airfield.  Overland routes to neighboring countries are
not open.<p>

<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are poor.  Hospitals have been looted and are barely able to
provide services.  Medicines are scarce in most areas.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid
outside the United States.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide for payment of
medical services outside the United States.  In some cases, supplemental medical insurance with
specific overseas and medical evacuation coverage has proven useful.  For additional health
information, travelers can contact the Centers for Disease Control's international travelers hotline,
telephone (404) 332-4559.<p>

<b>Information on Crime:  </b>Monrovia's crime rate is extremely high.  Foreigners, including U.S.
citizens, have been targets of street crime and violent robbery in their homes.  Residential armed
break-ins are common.  The police are ill-equipped and largely incapable of providing effective
protection.<p>

The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to local police and to
the nearest U.S. Embassy or Consulate.  The pamphlets "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for
Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on protecting personal security while
traveling abroad and on travel in the region in general.  Both are available from the
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<p>

<b>Country Infrastructure:</b>  Lodging, water, electricity, fuel, transportation, telephone and postal
services continue to be unevenly available in Monrovia.  Such services are nonexistent or severely
limited in rural areas.  Commercial power is sporadically available in parts of Monrovia.  Most
businesses and facilities rely upon generators to provide electricity.  Few facilities and even fewer
homes have telephones; disruption of service is common.  Mail delivery is erratic.  Parcel delivery
service is available to Monrovia.  Courier mail service is available in Monrovia.<p>

<b>Drug Penalties:  </b>U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country in which they are traveling. 
Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict and convicted offenders can
expect jail sentences and fines.<p>

<b>Embassy Location/Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens should register upon arrival in order to obtain
updated travel and security information from the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy at 111
United Nations Drive, Monrovia, telephone (231) 226370, fax (231)226148.  The U.S. Embassy's
mailing address is P.O. Box 10-0098, Mamba Point, Monrovia.  Consular assistance is only
available within Monrovia and the immediate vicinity.<p>

No. 95-136<p>

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated October 24, 1994, to include the September
15, 1995 updated travel warning and to update the sections on areas of instability, medical
facilities, country infrastructure, and embassy location.<p>

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION

</center>
New Caledonia - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 August 8, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  New Caledonia is a French overseas territory, 
consisting of the large island of New Caledonia and several smaller 
island groups, located in the South Pacific near Australia.  New 
Caledonia's moderately developed economy is based on mining.  
Tourist facilities are concentrated on the island of New Caledonia, 
but are available in some of the smaller island groups.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  For information about entry requirements, 
travelers and particularly those planning on entering by sailing 
vessel, may contact the Embassy of France at 4101 Reservoir Road, 
NW, Washington, D.C.  20007, telephone (202)944-6000.  Travelers may 
also wish to obtain a visa for Australia (see section on medical 
facilities) before leaving the United States.  Contact the Embassy 
of Australia in Washington, D.C., at 1-800-242-2878 for further 
information.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical treatment on the main island is 
generally good, but is more limited on the remote outer islands.  
The Centre Hospitalier Territorial in Noumea provides emergency and 
outpatient services, as does the smaller Centre Hospitalier 
Territorial in Koumac on the other side of the main island.  Medical 
services in the remainder of the country are limited.  Patients with 
more serious illnesses are often referred to Noumea or to Australia 
for treatment.  Travelers who anticipate the need for on-going 
medical treatment should consider obtaining a visa for Australia 
before leaving the United States.  Doctors and hospitals often 
expect immediate cash payments for health services.  The 
Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide payment for medical 
services outside of the United States.  U.S. medical insurance is 
not always valid outside the United States.  Supplemental medical 
insurance which specifically covers treatment in Australia and New 
Caledonia and includes a provision for medical evacuation may prove 
useful.  Information on health matters may also be obtained from the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through its international 
travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559 or via the CDC home page on the 
Internet:  http://www.cdc.gov/.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime and Safety:</b>  The crime rate in New Caledonia 
is low, but petty crime, such as pickpocketing and purse snatching, 
does occur.  The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be 
reported immediately to the local police and to the nearest U.S. 
embassy or consulate.  Useful information on guarding valuables and 
protecting personal security while traveling abroad is provided in 
the Department of State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad".  It is 
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Criminal Penalties:</b>  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is 
subject to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes 
differ significantly from those in the United States and do not 
afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law.  
Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United 
States for similar offenses.  Persons violating the law, even 
unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned.  Penalties for 
possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and 
convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Road Safety:</b>  Roads are generally well maintained except in remote 
areas.  Animals and unwary pedestrians walking in the road make 
night driving on unlit secondary roads hazardous.
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  There is no U.S. embassy or 
consulate in New Caledonia.  U.S. citizens living in or visiting New 
Caledonia are encouraged to register in person or via telephone with 
the U.S. Embassy in Suva, Fiji, whose consular district includes the 
French Overseas Territory of New Caledonia.  They may also obtain 
updated information on travel and security within the country from 
the U.S. Embassy.  Given the distance between Fiji and New 
Caledonia, the U.S. Embassy's ability to provide on-the-spot service 
is limited.  The U.S. Embassy in Suva, Fiji is located at 31 Loftus 
Street, Suva, Fiji; telephone (679) 314-466; fax (679) 300-081.

<h1>Niger</h1>
<p>
<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION
</h2>
<hr>
</center>
<b>Niger - Consular Information Sheet</b><br>
 April 18, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Niger is a developing, inland African nation 
whose northern area includes a part of the Sahara Desert.  Tourism 
facilities are minimal, particularly outside of Niamey.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements: </b> A visa is required.  Travelers should obtain 
the latest information on customs and entry requirements from the 
Embassy of the Republic of Niger, 2204 R Street, N.W., Washington 
D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 483-4224.  Overseas inquiries should be 
made at the nearest Nigerian embassy or consulate.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  Travel in the northern and far eastern areas 
of Niger is dangerous and should not be attempted.  Despite the 
peace agreement between the government of Niger and the Tuareg rebel 
groups, there is a continuing threat of sporadic armed conflict and 
violent banditry.  U.S. government personnel and contractors wishing 
to travel above a line connecting (West to East) the communities of 
Tera, Tillaberi, Ouallam, Filingue, Tahoua, Keita, Bouza, Dakoro, 
Tamout, and Nguigmi must receive permission from the U.S. Ambassador 
through the regional security office.  The area surrounding Diffia, 
in the far southeast, is also prone to sporadic violence.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are poor in Niger, 
particularly outside the city of Niamey.  Medicines are in short 
supply, and doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash 
payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always 
valid or accepted outside the United States.  The Medicare/Medicaid 
program does not provide for payment of medical services outside the 
United States.  Travelers have found supplemental medical insurance 
with specific overseas coverage, including provision for medical 
evacuation, to be useful.  For additional health information, 
travelers may contact the Centers for Disease Control and 
Prevention's international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Niger is considered a high crime country.  
Armed bandits in northern Niger have robbed and killed a number of 
people over the last several years.  In the cities, especially 
tourist areas, caution and common sense must be used at all times in 
order to avoid thieves and pick-pockets.
<p>
The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported 
immediately to local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate.  The pamphlets "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on 
protecting personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in 
the region in general.  Both are available from the Superintendent 
of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 
20402.
<p>
<b>Dress Restrictions:</b>  Local culture and Islamic tradition encourage 
conservative dress for both men and women.  There have been 
incidents of harassment of African women wearing western clothes in 
the conservative towns along the southern border with Nigeria.  
Although U.S. citizens are not specific targets, travelers should be 
careful in choosing their attire.
<p>
<b>Photography Restrictions:</b>  Tourists are free to take pictures 
anywhere in Niger, except near military installations, radio and 
television stations, the Presidency Building, and the airport.
<p>
<b>Currency Regulations:</b>  There are no laws restricting currency 
transactions in Niger.  Local currency (the CFA franc) or foreign 
currency, up to the equivalent of four thousand U.S. dollars, can be 
taken into or out of Niger without violating local law.
<p>
<b>Road Conditions:</b>  U.S. travelers should exercise caution when 
traveling in Niger as traffic accidents are frequent.  Care must be 
taken on Niger's paved and unpaved roads to avoid farm animals, slow 
moving donkey carts and broken down vehicles.  These dangers are 
amplified at night.
<p>
<b>Telephone Service:</b>  Due to poor line quality, callers often 
experience delays in getting a line and telefaxes are often garbled.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use 
or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict and convicted offenders 
can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Embassy Location/Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register with the U.S. Embassy in Niamey on Rue Des Ambassades, and 
to obtain updated information on travel and security in Niger.  The 
mailing address is B.P. 11201.  The telephone number is (227) 
72-26-61 through 72-26-64. The fax number is (227) 73-31-67.
<p>
 No. 96-087
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated April 29, 1995, 
to revise the paragraphs on areas of instability, crime, and to add 
information on road and safety conditions.

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION

</center>
Papua New Guinea - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 September 5, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Papua New Guinea is a parliamentary democracy 
and a member of the British Commonwealth.  The country consists of 
the eastern half of New Guinea Island, the Bismarck Archipelago, the 
D'Entrecasteaux Islands, the Louisiade Archipelago, and the islands 
of Buka and Bougainville.  Tourist facilities exist in the capital 
of Port Moresby and in major towns such as Lae and Madang.  The 
standards of the facilities vary and may be below U.S. standards, 
particularly in remote areas.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  For information about entry requirements, 
travelers may contact the Embassy of Papua New Guinea, 1615 New 
Hampshire Ave., NW, Suite 300, Washington DC 20009, tel. 
(202)745-3680.  Travelers may also wish to obtain a visa for 
Australia before traveling to Papua New Guinea for transit and other 
purposes (see section on medical facilities).  For further 
information about Australian visas, contact the Embassy of Australia 
in Washington, D.C., at 1-800-242-2878.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities in Papua New Guinea range 
from hospitals in Port Moresby and the larger towns to health 
centers and aid posts in remote areas.  Missionary stations may also 
provide health-care facilities.  The medical facilities vary in 
quality, but those in the larger towns are adequate for routine 
problems and some emergencies.  Equipment failures, sudden shortages 
of common medications, and reductions in services due to lack of 
government funding can mean, however, that even routine treatments 
and procedures (such as x-rays) may become unavailable.  More 
sophisticated medical facilities are located in the Australian town 
of Cairns, in Queensland.  Travelers who anticipate the need for 
on-going medical treatment may consider obtaining visas for 
Australia before leaving the United States.  Australian visas are 
issued in Port Moresby, but in a case involving medical treatment, 
the Australian visa authorities will require a referral from a local 
doctor, proof of acceptance by an Australian doctor, and proof of 
the patient's ability to pay for treatment.  Pharmacies in Papua New 
Guinea are small and found only in urban centers and in missions.
<p>
Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for 
medical services.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide 
payment for medical services outside of the United States.  U.S. 
medical insurance is not always valid outside the United States.  
Supplemental medical insurance which specifically covers treatment 
in Papua New Guinea and Australia and includes a provision for 
medical evacuation may prove useful.  Medical conditions arising as 
a result of diving accidents will almost always require medical 
evacuation to Australia.  Information on health matters may also be 
obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through 
its international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559 or via the CDC 
home page on the Internet:  http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Crime and personal security are serious 
concerns in Papua New Guinea.  Most travelers to Papua New Guinea 
are either tourists traveling as part of tour groups or are 
residents under the auspices of missionary, business, governmental 
or quasi-governmental groups, and do not experience problems as a 
result of carefully following the advice of their tour groups or 
sponsoring organizations.  Armed robberies and car-jackings are a 
major problem throughout the country.  Criminals occasionally 
victimize and rob people in large crowds, such as those at sporting 
events, concerts, or political rallies.  Hiking in rural areas and 
visiting isolated public areas such as parks, golf courses, beaches, 
or cemeteries can be dangerous.  Persons traveling alone are at 
greater risk for robbery or rape than those who are part of an 
organized tour or under escort.  Most visitors to Papua New Guinea 
avoid using taxis or buses known as public motor vehicles, and rely 
instead on their sponsor or a rented car for transportation.  Travel 
outside of Port Moresby and other major towns by car at night can be 
hazardous as criminals set up roadblocks.  Visitors may wish to 
consult with the U.S. Embassy or with local law enforcement 
officials concerning security conditions before driving between 
towns.  Travel to isolated places in Papua New Guinea is possible by 
general aviation aircraft; there are many small airstrips throughout 
the country.  Security measures, if any, at these airports are rare.
<p>
The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported 
immediately to the local police and to the U.S. Embassy.  Useful 
information on guarding valuables and protecting personal security 
while traveling abroad is provided in the Department of State 
pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad".  It is available from the 
Superintendent of Documents U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  The government of Papua New Guinea does not 
allow travel to Bougainville, the largest island in the North 
Solomons province, because of an active armed insurgency.  An 
Indonesian secessionist group remains active along the largely 
inaccessible Papua New Guinea/Indonesia border.  The town of Rabaul 
is located near two active volcanoes which buried half of the town 
during eruptions in September 1994.  Volcanic activity has occurred 
on a periodic basis since that event and travelers should be aware 
of the potential for further eruptions.  Rabaul has not recovered 
completely from the 1994 eruptions, and travelers may wish to verify 
that their hotels provide full amenities.  Persons with respiratory 
problems may find that airborne ash exacerbates their conditions.
<p>
<b>Criminal Penalties:</b>  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is 
subject to that country's laws and regulations, which sometimes 
differ significantly from those in the United States and do not 
afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law.  
Penalties for breaking the law can be more severe than in the United 
States for similar offenses.  Persons violating the law, even 
unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned.  Penalties for 
possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and 
convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Road Safety:</b>  Traffic in Papua New Guinea moves on the left as in 
Great Britain.  There is no country-wide road network and roads are 
generally in poor repair with flat tires a routine result of debris 
on the roadways.  Landslides can be a problem on the Highlands 
highway during the rainy season.  Travel on highways outside of 
major towns can be hazardous due to roadblocks set up by criminals 
at night.  Criminal roadblocks have occurred during the day time on 
the Highlands highway.  Travelers may wish to consult with local 
authorities or the U.S. Embassy before traveling on the Highlands 
highway.  Reactions by crowds after road accidents in Papua New 
Guinea can be emotional and violent.  Crowds form quickly after an 
accident and may attack those that they hold responsible or burn 
their vehicles.  Friends and relatives of an injured party may 
demand immediate compensation from the party which they hold 
responsible for injuries, regardless of the legal responsibility.  
Persons involved in accidents usually find it prudent to proceed 
directly to the nearest provincial police headquarters rather than 
stopping at the scene of an accident.
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register at the U.S. Embassy in Port Moresby, where they can obtain 
updated information on travel and security.  The U.S. Embassy in 
Port Moresby is located on Douglas Street, adjacent to the Bank of 
Papua New Guinea.  This address should be used for courier service 
deliveries.  The mailing address is P.O. Box 1492, Port Moresby, 
N.C.D. 121, Papua New Guinea.  The U.S. Embassy's telephone number 
is (675) 321-1445; fax (675) 321-1593.
<p>
 No. 96-154
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated November 17, 
1994 adding sections on Criminal Penalties and Road Safety and 
updating Sections on Country Description, Entry Requirements, 
Medical Facilities, Information on Crime, Areas of Instability and 
Registration and Embassy Location, including the new address, phone 
number and fax number for the U.S. Embassy in Port Moresby.

<b>
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
 For Immediate Release<br>
</b>
<p>
The Department of State has received information concerning a 
terrorist threat against official U.S. facilities in Asuncion.  
While there is no reason to believe that non-official Americans are 
the target of this threat, private U.S. citizens should exercise 
caution in their daily routines and in visiting U.S. Government 
facilities or attending U.S. Government sponsored activities.  
General personal security guidelines include varying schedules and 
routes; being alert to surveillance, unusual events, unexpected 
visitors, and strange vehicles or packages; inspecting vehicles for 
signs of tampering; and parking in secure, well-lit places.
<p>
For further information on travel to Paraguay, consult the 
Departments latest Consular Information Sheet for Paraguay.
<p>
This announcement will expire February 1, 1997.
<p>
<hr>
Paraguay - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 September 2, 1994 <br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Paraguay is a medium income nation with a 
developing economy.  Tourist facilities are good in Asuncion, poor 
in major cities, and almost nonexistent in remote areas.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport is required.  U.S. citizens do not 
need a visa for a three-month stay.  Minors (under 20) traveling 
alone, with one parent or with a third party must present written 
authorization from the absent parent(s) or legal guardian, 
specifically granting permission to travel alone, with one parent or 
with a third party.  This authorization must be notarized, 
authenticated by the Paraguayan embassy or consulate, and translated 
into Spanish.  For current information concerning entry and customs 
requirements for Paraguay, travelers can contact the Paraguayan 
Embassy at 2400 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, 
tel: (202) 483-6960 or the nearest consulate in Los Angeles, Miami 
or New York.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Facilities for medical care are limited.  
Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health 
services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the 
United States.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide for 
payment of medical services outside the United States.  In some 
cases, medical insurance with specific overseas and medical 
evacuation coverage has proved to be useful.  For additional health 
information, travelers can contact the Centers for Disease Control's 
international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.
<p>
<b>Crime Information:</b>  Armed robberies, car thefts, and burglaries 
have increased significantly.  Street crime to include pickpocketing 
and muggings is prevalent in the cities, particularly during the 
evening hours in the vicinity of hotels and airports.  There have 
been incidents of pilferage from checked airline baggage.  Travelers 
have found it prudent to put valuables in their carry-on luggage.
<p>
The loss or theft of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately 
to the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  
Useful information on guarding valuables and protecting personal 
security while traveling abroad is provided in the Department of 
State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad," which is available from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.  Also available from the same address is the 
Department of State publication, "Tips for Travelers to Central and 
South America."
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties in Paraguay for 
possession, use and trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and 
convicted offenders can expect lengthy jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Adoptions:</b>  Due to serious problems in the international adoption 
process in Paraguay, including chronic unpredictability in the 
issuance of final decrees and uncertainty over case processing and 
prospects for proposed adoption regulations, the U.S. Embassy 
strongly urges prospective adopting parents to postpone any 
commitment to a Paraguayan prospective child until such time as the 
situation at juvenile court is clarified.  Some adoptions have been 
put on hold pending court investigations of local lawyers, notaries 
and government officials responsible for documentation of birth and 
abandonment.  American citizens who have secured court dates with 
the judge handling their international adoption petition, should be 
aware that prospective parents' stay in Asuncion is often a 
prolonged one.  The consular officer is not authorized to act as 
agents of behalf of U.S. citizens seeking to adopt Paraguayan 
children.
<p>
Updated information on Paraguayan adoption proceedings and U.S. 
immigrant visa requirements is available from the consular section 
of the U.S. Embassy.  Additional information is available by writing 
the Office of Children's Issues, CA/OCS/CI, Rm. 4811, Department of 
State, Washington, D.C. 20520, or by telephoning (202) 736-7000.
<p>
<b>Civil Aviation Oversight:</b>  In March 1992, the U.S. Federal Aviation 
Administration assessed Paraguay's civil aviation authority as not 
in compliance with international aviation safety oversight standards 
for Paraguay's carriers operating to and from the U.S.  Typically, 
the same level of safety oversight is applied to operations to other 
destinations.  For further information, travelers may contact the 
Department of Transportation at 1-800-322-7873.
<p>
<b>Embassy Location/Registration:</b>  Americans who register with the 
Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy in Asuncion at 1776 Mariscal 
Lopez Avenue, telephone:  (011-595-21) 213-715, may obtain updated 
information on travel and security within Paraguay.
<p>
 No. 94-211
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated May 20, 1994  to 
add information on aviation oversight.

<b>Peru - Public Announcement</b><br>
 December 18, 1996<br>
<p>
U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
Office of the Spokesman<br>
<p>

The United States Embassy in Peru advises that there is an ongoing 
hostage situation in Lima, Peru.
<p>
On December 17, the terrorist group Movimiento Revolucionario Tupac 
Amaru (MRTA) took hostage attendees at a reception at the residence 
of the Japanese Ambassador.  An undetermined number of hostages 
remain inside the residence.
<p>
Travelers in Peru are advised that this situation will likely 
result in increased security vigilance by the government of Peru.  
This area of the Japanese residence in San Isidro is cordoned off by 
security forces.  The area in San Isidro, bounded by the streets 
Salaverry, Cesar Vallejo, Prescott and Dos de Mayo, and the area of 
the Navy Headquarters, should be avoided.  Americans in Peru should 
take normal security precautions.
<p>
For further information on travel to Peru, consult the Department's 
latest Consular Information Sheet for Peru.
<p>
American residents in Peru may obtain updated information on travel 
and security and may register with the Consular Section of the U.S. 
Embassy.  The U.S. Embassy is open for these services Monday through 
Friday, 8 A.M. to Noon.  The telephone number is 434-3000.

Peru - Public Announcement
 August 23, 1996

U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE
Office of the Spokesman


On August 23, the American Embassy in Lima issued the following 
notice to American citizens in Peru:

"The Embassy has received information that Aero Continente Airlines 
has been operating aircraft with unsafe engine conditions.  It is 
our opinion that this constitutes an unacceptable risk to U.S. 
Embassy employees.

Therefore, all U.S. Mission personnel are hereby prohibited from 
flying Aero Continente until further notice."

The State Department is making this information available to the 
public.  Further, the U.S. Embassy has informed the government of 
Peru of its concerns and has received assurances that immediate 
action is being taken to ground aircraft with unsafe engines and 
review airline procedures and practices to ensure the proper 
maintenance and safety of all Aero Continente aircraft.  Competent 
international aviation authorities and equipment suppliers are 
providing technical assistance to correct this problem.

For further information on travel to Peru, consult the Department 
of State's latest Consular Information Sheet for Peru.


Peru - Consular Information Sheet
 July 24, 1996

Country Description:  Peru is a developing country with significant 
tourist and commercial activity.  The quality of tourist facilities 
varies, depending on cost and location.

Entry Requirements:  U.S. citizens must have a valid passport but 
do not need a visa for tourist visits of up to 90 days.  Visitors 
for other purposes must obtain a visa.  Further information 
regarding entry requirements is available from the Embassy of Peru, 
1700 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20036, tel. (202) 
833-9860, and Peruvian consulates in California, Florida, Illinois, 
New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Texas.

Medical Facilities:  Medical care is adequate in major cities but 
is generally less so elsewhere.  Private health facilities tend to 
offer more modern equipment and a better supply of medicines than 
public hospitals.  Local health care providers do not accept U.S. 
health insurance coverage and require cash payment upon provision of 
medical services.  Medicare/Medicaid does not pay for medical 
services outside the United States.  Supplemental medical insurance 
with specific overseas coverage, including provision for medical 
evacuation or other emergency, is strongly recommended. For 
information regarding health conditions and precautions, contact the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers 
hotline at (404) 332-4559, Internet - http://www.cdc.gov/.

Terrorist Activity:  Peruvian government action has greatly reduced 
the effectiveness of the two active terrorist groups, Sendero 
Luminoso (Shining Path) and MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement).  Terrorist attacks have not occurred in traditional 
tourist destinations outside Lima in recent years.  Terrorists do, 
however, continue to attempt sporadic attacks against institutional 
targets, including government offices, embassies and major 
commercial interests.  Incidents during 1995-1996, including two 
major car bombings, have occurred in industrial areas and affluent 
Lima suburbs.  U.S. visitors to Peru are advised of the potential 
risk of collateral damage from terrorist bomb attacks.  In July 1995 
in La Libertad Department, a Peruvian employee was killed in an 
attack directed against geologists working for a U.S. mining 
company.  Mineral prospectors and other investors visiting remote 
areas of Peru are strongly advised to contact the U.S. Embassy for 
updated security information.

The U.S. Embassy restricts official travel of government employees 
to several areas because terrorist groups and narcotics traffickers 
there still resort to violence, usually against local security 
forces and civilians.  Overland travel in or near these areas, 
particularly at night, is risky.  (Note:  These "restricted travel 
areas" do not in all cases correspond to existing Peruvian 
government-designated "emergency zones" which still encompass nearly 
half of the country, including metropolitan Lima.  Certain 
constitutional rights are suspended in these "emergency zones," 
giving security forces extraordinary powers to detain and question 
individuals.)

Private U.S. citizens may wish to take the following U.S. Embassy 
employee-restricted travel areas into consideration when making 
their travel plans.

Ancash:  Provinces of Pallasca, Corongo, and Sihuas.

Apurimac:  All areas, except Abancay City by road from Cuzco, and 
Andahuaylas by private or charter air only.

Ayachucho:  All areas, except Ayachucho and Huanta City, and the 
highway that joins them.

Cajamarca: Provinces of Cajabamba and Jaen, except Jaen City.

Cuzco: Province of La Convencion, except Quillabamba City.

Huancavelica:  All areas, except Huancavelica City by train from 
Huancayo.

Huanuco:  All areas, except the cities of Huanuco by highway from 
Cerro de Pasco and Tingo Maria by highway from Huanuco.  The highway 
leading north from Tingo Maria is considered extremely dangerous.

Junin:  Provinces of Satipo and Chanchamayo, except La Merced City 
and San Ramon, and the highway that joins these two cities with 
Tarma.

La Libertad:  Provinces of Bolivar, Sanchez Carrion, Otuzco and 
Pataz.

Pasco:  Province of Oxapampa, except Puerto Bermudez and Ciudad 
Constitucion cities, by air.

Piura:  Province of Huancabamba

San Martin:  All rural areas.  Travel by air is permitted to the 
cities of Tarapoto, Juanjui, Lamas, Saposa, Rioja and Moyobamba

Ucayali:  Provinces of Padre Abad and Coronel Portillo, except 
Pucallpa City by air.

This list is under constant review.  For updated information 
regarding U.S. Embassy-designated restricted travel areas, contact 
the U.S. Embassy in Lima.

Security and Crime Information:  Outside the above-listed areas, 
Peru is relatively safe for the group tourist who takes appropriate 
precautions and does not stray from the confines of organized tour 
packages.  The risk of street crime in downtown Lima and other 
tourist areas is high.

Violent crimes include assault and armed robbery.  There have been 
several "choke and rob" attacks against tourists in Cuzco, 
particularly near the train station and the Plaza de Armas (Main 
Square).

Carjackings/kidnappings have occurred in urban areas.  Resistance 
to violent crime usually provokes greater violence.  Travel in 
groups and with experienced guides during daylight hours is safer.  
Walking alone, especially late at night or early in the morning, can 
be dangerous.  Nonviolent street crime such as petty theft also 
occurs in most other urban areas.

Hostilities in the border area between Peru and Ecuador have 
ceased.  Both countries are in the process of negotiating their 
differences.  Border crossings are not usually restricted, but 
travelers are advised to follow the instructions of local 
authorities.

It is important that trail hikers register at Ministry of Tourism 
trail checkpoints and register admission to national parks.  
Visitors to high altitude places, such as Cuzco and Puno, should be 
aware of the effects of high altitude, which may affect people 
regardless of overall physical condition.  It is also essential for 
visitors to remote tribal areas to obtain permission to visit from 
the tribal council, and not to visit villages without advance 
permission.  Two U.S. citizens who did not have such permission were 
attacked, one killed and one severely wounded, in the Maranon River 
between Imaza and Santa Maria de Nieva in January 1995.

Visitors to Peru should immediately report any criminal activity 
against them to the nearest police station or tourism police office 
and to the U.S. Embassy in Lima or the consular agent in Cuzco.  
Immediate action may result in detaining the thieves and recovering 
stolen property.

There is a 24-hour hotline where tourists may register complaints, 
provided by INDECOPI (National Institute for the Defense of 
Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property). In Lima 
call tel. 224-7888 or 224-8600.  Outside of Lima, callers should 
dial the prefix (01) then these numbers or the toll free number 
0-800-42579 (not available from pay phones, but may be accessed from 
any private phone).

The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported 
immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate.  Useful information on guarding valuables and protecting 
personal security while traveling abroad is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad."  This 
publication, as well as others such as "Tips for Travelers to 
Central and South America," are available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.  20402.

Drug Penalties:  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties in Peru for 
possession, use and trafficking in illegal drugs are strict.  
Persons arrested on drug trafficking or other criminal charges can 
expect protracted pre-trial detention and, if convicted, long jail 
sentences and heavy fines.  Prison conditions are poor.

Other Information:  Updated information on Peruvian adoption 
procedures and the U.S. immigrant visa application process is 
available from the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy, as well as 
from the Office of Children's Issues, Room 4811, Department of 
State, Washington, D.C.  20520, tel. (202) 736-7000.

Civil marriage in Peru of U.S. citizen non-residents to Peruvians 
is difficult, if not impossible.  Non-residents are required to 
present a "Certificado de Solteria" (certificate of 
marriageability).  The U.S. Embassy does not issue such documents.  
The U.S. Embassy also does not authenticate U.S. civil documents for 
local use.  U.S. citizens may wish to have a Peruvian consular 
official in the U.S. authenticate relevant U.S. civil documents 
before traveling to Peru.

Civil Aviation Oversight:  As a result of an assessment conducted 
by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in June 1995, the 
FAA has found the government of Peru's Civil Aviation Authority not 
to be in compliance with international aviation safety standards for 
oversight of Peru's air carrier operations.  While consultations to 
correct the deficiencies are ongoing, Peru's carriers are permitted 
to conduct limited operations to the U.S. subject to heightened FAA 
surveillance.  For further information, travelers may contact the 
Department of Transportation at 1-800-322-7873.

Road Conditions:  Road travel at night is very dangerous due to 
poor illumination and other road hazards, such as potholes, sudden 
lane ends, unmarked road works, parked/stalled vehicles, and 
vehicles without working lights.  It is also risky to drive alone on 
rural roads or without spare equipment and supplies since the 
distance between road services is great in remote areas.  Trucks and 
buses pose particular hazards due to the high speeds and/or 
unsecured loads with which they often travel.  For further 
information, travelers may wish to contact their nearest automobile 
club or the Asociacion Automotriz del Peru, 299 Avenida Dos de Mayo, 
San Isidro, Lima, Peru, tel. (51) (1) 440-0495.

Registration and Embassy/Consular Agency Locations:  U.S. citizens 
with valid U.S. passports may register at the Consular Section of 
the U.S. Embassy in Lima and may also obtain updated information on 
travel and security within Peru.  The U.S. Embassy is open for these 
services Monday through Friday, except U.S. and Peruvian holidays, 
from 8 AM to noon.  The U.S. Embassy in Lima is located at Avenida 
la Encalada, Block Seventeen, Monterrico, Lima, tel. (51) (1) 
434-3000 during business hours (8 AM to 5 PM except weekends and 
holidays) and (51) (1) 434-3032 for emergencies only during 
non-business hours.  The consular agency in Cuzco is located at 
Avenida Tullumayo 125, tel. (51-84) 23-9451.

 No. 96-137

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet for Peru dated July 
28, 1995, providing updated information on medical facilities, 
terrorist activity, crime, and the new U.S. Embassy and Cuzco Agency 
telephone numbers, and to add information on road conditions.

 July 24, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Peru is a developing country with significant 
tourist and commercial activity.  The quality of tourist facilities 
varies, depending on cost and location.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  U.S. citizens must have a valid passport but 
do not need a visa for tourist visits of up to 90 days.  Visitors 
for other purposes must obtain a visa.  Further information 
regarding entry requirements is available from the Embassy of Peru, 
1700 Massachusetts Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C.  20036, tel. (202) 
833-9860, and Peruvian consulates in California, Florida, Illinois, 
New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and Texas.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical care is adequate in major cities but 
is generally less so elsewhere.  Private health facilities tend to 
offer more modern equipment and a better supply of medicines than 
public hospitals.  Local health care providers do not accept U.S. 
health insurance coverage and require cash payment upon provision of 
medical services.  Medicare/Medicaid does not pay for medical 
services outside the United States.  Supplemental medical insurance 
with specific overseas coverage, including provision for medical 
evacuation or other emergency, is strongly recommended. For 
information regarding health conditions and precautions, contact the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers 
hotline at (404) 332-4559, Internet - http://www.cdc.gov/.
<p>
<b>Terrorist Activity:</b>  Peruvian government action has greatly reduced 
the effectiveness of the two active terrorist groups, Sendero 
Luminoso (Shining Path) and MRTA (Tupac Amaru Revolutionary 
Movement).  Terrorist attacks have not occurred in traditional 
tourist destinations outside Lima in recent years.  Terrorists do, 
however, continue to attempt sporadic attacks against institutional 
targets, including government offices, embassies and major 
commercial interests.  Incidents during 1995-1996, including two 
major car bombings, have occurred in industrial areas and affluent 
Lima suburbs.  U.S. visitors to Peru are advised of the potential 
risk of collateral damage from terrorist bomb attacks.  In July 1995 
in La Libertad Department, a Peruvian employee was killed in an 
attack directed against geologists working for a U.S. mining 
company.  Mineral prospectors and other investors visiting remote 
areas of Peru are strongly advised to contact the U.S. Embassy for 
updated security information.
<p>
The U.S. Embassy restricts official travel of government employees 
to several areas because terrorist groups and narcotics traffickers 
there still resort to violence, usually against local security 
forces and civilians.  Overland travel in or near these areas, 
particularly at night, is risky.  (Note:  These "restricted travel 
areas" do not in all cases correspond to existing Peruvian 
government-designated "emergency zones" which still encompass nearly 
half of the country, including metropolitan Lima.  Certain 
constitutional rights are suspended in these "emergency zones," 
giving security forces extraordinary powers to detain and question 
individuals.)
<p>
Private U.S. citizens may wish to take the following U.S. Embassy 
employee-restricted travel areas into consideration when making 
their travel plans.
<p>
<b>Ancash:</b>  Provinces of Pallasca, Corongo, and Sihuas.
<p>
<b>Apurimac:</b>  All areas, except Abancay City by road from Cuzco, and 
Andahuaylas by private or charter air only.
<p>
<b>Ayachucho:</b>  All areas, except Ayachucho and Huanta City, and the 
highway that joins them.
<p>
<b>Cajamarca:</b> Provinces of Cajabamba and Jaen, except Jaen City.
<p>
<b>Cuzco:</b> Province of La Convencion, except Quillabamba City.
<p>
<b>Huancavelica: </b> All areas, except Huancavelica City by train from 
Huancayo.
<p>
<b>Huanuco:</b>  All areas, except the cities of Huanuco by highway from 
Cerro de Pasco and Tingo Maria by highway from Huanuco.  The highway 
leading north from Tingo Maria is considered extremely dangerous.
<p>
<b>Junin:</b>  Provinces of Satipo and Chanchamayo, except La Merced City 
and San Ramon, and the highway that joins these two cities with 
Tarma.
<p>
<b>La Libertad:</b>  Provinces of Bolivar, Sanchez Carrion, Otuzco and 
Pataz.
<p>
<b>Pasco:</b>  Province of Oxapampa, except Puerto Bermudez and Ciudad 
Constitucion cities, by air.
<p>
<b>Piura:</b>  Province of Huancabamba
<p>
<b>San Martin:</b>  All rural areas.  Travel by air is permitted to the 
cities of Tarapoto, Juanjui, Lamas, Saposa, Rioja and Moyobamba
<p>
<b>Ucayali:</b>  Provinces of Padre Abad and Coronel Portillo, except 
Pucallpa City by air.
<p>
This list is under constant review.  For updated information 
regarding U.S. Embassy-designated restricted travel areas, contact 
the U.S. Embassy in Lima.
<p>
Security and Crime Information:</b>  Outside the above-listed areas, 
Peru is relatively safe for the group tourist who takes appropriate 
precautions and does not stray from the confines of organized tour 
packages.  The risk of street crime in downtown Lima and other 
tourist areas is high.
<p>
Violent crimes include assault and armed robbery.  There have been 
several "choke and rob" attacks against tourists in Cuzco, 
particularly near the train station and the Plaza de Armas (Main 
Square).
<p>
Carjackings/kidnappings have occurred in urban areas.  Resistance 
to violent crime usually provokes greater violence.  Travel in 
groups and with experienced guides during daylight hours is safer.  
Walking alone, especially late at night or early in the morning, can 
be dangerous.  Nonviolent street crime such as petty theft also 
occurs in most other urban areas.
<p>
Hostilities in the border area between Peru and Ecuador have 
ceased.  Both countries are in the process of negotiating their 
differences.  Border crossings are not usually restricted, but 
travelers are advised to follow the instructions of local 
authorities.
<p>
It is important that trail hikers register at Ministry of Tourism 
trail checkpoints and register admission to national parks.  
Visitors to high altitude places, such as Cuzco and Puno, should be 
aware of the effects of high altitude, which may affect people 
regardless of overall physical condition.  It is also essential for 
visitors to remote tribal areas to obtain permission to visit from 
the tribal council, and not to visit villages without advance 
permission.  Two U.S. citizens who did not have such permission were 
attacked, one killed and one severely wounded, in the Maranon River 
between Imaza and Santa Maria de Nieva in January 1995.
<p>
Visitors to Peru should immediately report any criminal activity 
against them to the nearest police station or tourism police office 
and to the U.S. Embassy in Lima or the consular agent in Cuzco.  
Immediate action may result in detaining the thieves and recovering 
stolen property.
<p>
There is a 24-hour hotline where tourists may register complaints, 
provided by INDECOPI (National Institute for the Defense of 
Competition and the Protection of Intellectual Property). In Lima 
call tel. 224-7888 or 224-8600.  Outside of Lima, callers should 
dial the prefix (01) then these numbers or the toll free number 
0-800-42579 (not available from pay phones, but may be accessed from 
any private phone).
<p>
The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported 
immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate.  Useful information on guarding valuables and protecting 
personal security while traveling abroad is provided in the 
Department of State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad."  This 
publication, as well as others such as "Tips for Travelers to 
Central and South America," are available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U. S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C.  20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties in Peru for 
possession, use and trafficking in illegal drugs are strict.  
Persons arrested on drug trafficking or other criminal charges can 
expect protracted pre-trial detention and, if convicted, long jail 
sentences and heavy fines.  Prison conditions are poor.
<p>
<b>Other Information:</b>  Updated information on Peruvian adoption 
procedures and the U.S. immigrant visa application process is 
available from the Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy, as well as 
from the Office of Children's Issues, Room 4811, Department of 
State, Washington, D.C.  20520, tel. (202) 736-7000.
<p>
Civil marriage in Peru of U.S. citizen non-residents to Peruvians 
is difficult, if not impossible.  Non-residents are required to 
present a "Certificado de Solteria" (certificate of 
marriageability).  The U.S. Embassy does not issue such documents.  
The U.S. Embassy also does not authenticate U.S. civil documents for 
local use.  U.S. citizens may wish to have a Peruvian consular 
official in the U.S. authenticate relevant U.S. civil documents 
before traveling to Peru.
<p>
<b>Civil Aviation Oversight:</b>  As a result of an assessment conducted 
by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in June 1995, the 
FAA has found the government of Peru's Civil Aviation Authority not 
to be in compliance with international aviation safety standards for 
oversight of Peru's air carrier operations.  While consultations to 
correct the deficiencies are ongoing, Peru's carriers are permitted 
to conduct limited operations to the U.S. subject to heightened FAA 
surveillance.  For further information, travelers may contact the 
Department of Transportation at 1-800-322-7873.
<p>
<b>Road Conditions:</b>  Road travel at night is very dangerous due to 
poor illumination and other road hazards, such as potholes, sudden 
lane ends, unmarked road works, parked/stalled vehicles, and 
vehicles without working lights.  It is also risky to drive alone on 
rural roads or without spare equipment and supplies since the 
distance between road services is great in remote areas.  Trucks and 
buses pose particular hazards due to the high speeds and/or 
unsecured loads with which they often travel.  For further 
information, travelers may wish to contact their nearest automobile 
club or the Asociacion Automotriz del Peru, 299 Avenida Dos de Mayo, 
San Isidro, Lima, Peru, tel. (51) (1) 440-0495.
<p>
<b>Registration and Embassy/Consular Agency Locations:</b>  U.S. citizens 
with valid U.S. passports may register at the Consular Section of 
the U.S. Embassy in Lima and may also obtain updated information on 
travel and security within Peru.  The U.S. Embassy is open for these 
services Monday through Friday, except U.S. and Peruvian holidays, 
from 8 AM to noon.  The U.S. Embassy in Lima is located at Avenida 
la Encalada, Block Seventeen, Monterrico, Lima, tel. (51) (1) 
434-3000 during business hours (8 AM to 5 PM except weekends and 
holidays) and (51) (1) 434-3032 for emergencies only during 
non-business hours.  The consular agency in Cuzco is located at 
Avenida Tullumayo 125, tel. (51-84) 23-9451.
<p>
 No. 96-137
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet for Peru dated July 
28, 1995, providing updated information on medical facilities, 
terrorist activity, crime, and the new U.S. Embassy and Cuzco Agency 
telephone numbers, and to add information on road conditions.

<B>Saudi Arabia - Consular Information Sheet</b><BR>
April 10, 1995<P>
<b>Country Description:</b>  The Saudi Arabian political system is a monarchy.  The King is chosen from and by members of the Al-Saud family.  The King rules through royal decrees issued in conjunction with the Council of Ministers, and with advice from the Consultative Council.  Members of both councils are appointed by the King.  Islamic law is the basis of the authority of the monarchy, and provides the foundation of the country's conservative customs and practices.  Saudi Arabia has a modern and well
developed infrastructure, and facilities for travelers are widely available, although the country does not issue visas for tourism.  The workweek in Saudi Arabia is Saturday through Wednesday.<P>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  Passports and visas are required.  Tourist visas are not available for travel to Saudi Arabia.  Visas are required for persons on vessels calling at the port of Jeddah.  Visitors must have a business or personal sponsor.  Women visitors and residents are required to be met upon arrival at a Saudi airport by their business or personal sponsor.  Residents in Saudi Arabia generally must surrender their passports, and the passports of family members, to the Saudi sponsor while in the kingdom, and are required to get an exit/reentry visa each time they leave Saudi Arabia. Those on visitor visas do not need an exit visa to leave the kingdom. Residents carry a Saudi residence permit (iqama) for identification in place of their passports.  The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General cannot sponsor private American citizens for Saudi visas.<P>
<p>
Visitors to Saudi Arabia generally obtain a meningitis vaccination prior to arrival.  A medical report is required to obtain a work and residence permit.  This includes a medical certification stating that the individual is free of AIDS.  Temporary visitors need not present an AIDS-free certification.  For further information on entry requirements, travelers may contact the Royal Embassy of Saudi Arabia, 601 New Hampshire Ave., N.W., Washington, D.C. 20037, telephone (202) 333-4595, or a Saudi Arabian Consulate General in Los Angeles (telephone 213-208-6566), New York (telephone 212-752-2740) or Houston (telephone 713-785-5577).<P>
<b>Exit Permission:</b>  Residents in Saudi Arabia may not depart the country without obtaining an exit permit, which requires the approval of their Saudi sponsor.  The U.S. Embassy and Consulates General cannot apply for an exit permit for a U.S. citizen under any circumstances.  A married woman residing in Saudi Arabia with her husband must have her husband's permission for herself and her children to depart the country, even if they are U.S. citizens.  Persons in Saudi Arabia on visitor visas do not need an exit visa to leave the country.<P>

Saudi Customs, Religious Police, and General Standards of Conduct:  Islam pervades all aspects of life in Saudi Arabia.  It is the official religion of the country, and observance of any other religion is forbidden.  Non- Muslim religious services are illegal and public display of non-Islamic religious articles such as crosses and bibles is not permitted.  Travel to Mecca and Medina, the cities where the two holy mosques of Islam are located, is forbidden to non-Muslims.<P>

The norms for public behavior in Saudi Arabia are extremely conservative, and religious police, known as mutawwa'iin, are charged with enforcing these standards.  To ensure that conservative standards of conduct are observed, the Saudi religious police have harassed, accosted or arrested foreigners, including U.S. citizens, for improper dress or other infractions, such as consumption of alcohol or association by a female with a non
relative male. 
<p>
While most incidents have resulted only in inconvenience or embarrassment, the potential exists for an individual to be physically harmed or deported. U.S. citizens who are involved in an incident with the mutawwa'iin may report the incident to the U.S. Embassy in Riyadh or the U.S. Consulates General in Jeddah or Dhahran.<P>

The Saudi Embassy in Washington advises women traveling to Saudi Arabia to dress in a conservative fashion, wearing ankle-length dresses with long sleeves, and not to wear trousers in public.  In many areas of Saudi Arabia, particularly Riyadh and the central part of the Kingdom, mutawwa'iin pressure women to wear a full-length black covering known as an abaya and to cover their heads.  The result is that most women in these areas wear the abaya and carry a headscarf to avoid harassment.  Women who appear to be of Arab or Asian ethnic origin, especially Muslims, face a greater risk of harassment.<P>

Some mutawwa'iin try to enforce the rule that men and women who are beyond childhood years may not mingle in public, unless they are family or close relatives.  Mutawwa'iin may ask to see proof that a couple is married or related.  Women who are arrested for socializing with a man who is not a relative may be charged with prostitution.  Women who are not accompanied by a close male relative have not been served at some restaurants, particularly fast-food outlets.  In addition, many restaurants no longer have a "family section" in which women are permitted to eat.  These restrictions are not always posted, and in some cases women violating this policy have been arrested.<P>

Women are not allowed to drive vehicles or ride bicycles on public roads. In public, dancing, music, and movies are forbidden.  Pornography is strictly forbidden.<P>

Homosexual activity is considered to be a criminal offense and those convicted may be sentenced to lashing and/or a prison sentence.<P>
<b>The Hajj:</b>  American pilgrims planning to participate in the annual Hajj pilgrimage to the holy cities of Makkah (Mecca) and Medina should be aware of the following travel advice:<P>

All travel plans should be made through a travel agent in the United States in order to book accommodations in advance.  Hajj visas are required and are valid only for travel to the two holy cities.  Stopovers in Jeddah or onward travel to Riyadh or other cities in Saudi Arabia are not permitted.<P>

King Abdul Aziz International Airport in Jeddah is a large and modern facility, with a special terminal with facilities to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims.  However, due to the extremely large number of visitors arriving, waiting time at the airport upon arrival during the Hajj may be as long as ten hours.  Pilgrims should plan on a lengthy wait before leaving the airport on their way to Makkah or Medina.  Travelers with only carry-on bags will find baggage transfer at the airport much easier than with checked baggage.<P>

Before leaving home, travelers should make copies of their passports, including the pages stamped with Saudi visas.  One copy should be left with someone at home and one taken with the traveler.  Passports are turned over to Saudi officials upon arrival in the Kingdom and will be given back immediately prior to departure.  Upon arrival, all pilgrims are issued an identification card or wrist-band.  Travelers should carry this identification at all times.<P>

A money belt or pouch is the best way to carry valuables.  Upon arrival it is possible to buy what is known as a "Hajj belt," which is somewhat larger than American equivalents.<P>

Visitors should check with the Centers for Disease Control, their travel agent, or a Saudi consulate or the embassy regarding recommended or required shots.<P>

Travelers should expect extremely crowded conditions during the Hajj. Temperatures in Makkah range between 80 and 107 degrees in May.  There are many facilities providing water, public accommodations, and other amenities. 
<p>
In case of emergency, Hajj pilgrims should contact United Agents Office (Makkah), telephone (02)545-1444, or National Adilla est. (Medina), telephone (04)826-0088, and then contact the American Consulate General in Jeddah.<P>

<b>Alcohol and Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country in which they are traveling or residing.  In Saudi Arabia penalties for the import, manufacture, possession and consumption of alcohol or illegal drugs are severe and convicted offenders can expect sentences of jail terms, fines, public flogging, and/or deportation.  The penalty for drug trafficking in Saudi Arabia is capital punishment.  Saudi officials make no exceptions.<P>

<b>Child Custody:</b>  In Saudi Arabia, child custody decisions are based on Islamic law.  It is extremely difficult for an American woman, even a Muslim, to obtain custody of her children through a Saudi court decision. Further information on this subject can be obtained in the Department of State publications "Marriage to Saudis" and "Child Custody Disputes in Saudi Arabia" which are available from the Office of Overseas Citizens Services, Department of State, Washington, D.C. 20520-4818, telephone (202) 736-7000, or from the U.S. Embassy or Consulates General in Saudi Arabia.<P>

<b>Business Disputes:</b>  Prior to the execution of a final contract, some business persons and contract employees of Saudi companies have obtained an independent translation of the Arabic-language contract, to ensure a full understanding of all terms, limits and agreements, because the Arabic version usually governs under Saudi law.  Settlement of disputes depends on the type of agreement and the agency involved.  If the Saudi party in a business dispute files a complaint with the Saudi authorities, Saudi law permits barring the exit of the foreign party from the country until the dispute is settled.  U.S. consular officers can provide lists of local attorneys to help U.S. citizens settle business disputes, but ultimate responsibility for the resolution of disputes through the Saudi legal system lies with the parties involved.<P>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Basic modern medical care and medicines are available in several hospitals and health centers in Saudi Arabia.  Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the United States. Supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas coverage has proved useful.  The international travelers hotline at the Centers for Disease Control, telephone (404) 332-4559, has additional health information.<P>

<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Crime is generally not a problem for travelers in Saudi Arabia.  However, private Saudi citizens who perceive that conservative standards of conduct are not being observed by a foreigner may harass, pursue, or assault the person.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables and protecting personal security while traveling abroad is provided in the Department of State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad".  General information about travel to Saudi Arabia can be found in the Department of State publication "Tips for Travelers to the Middle East and North Africa."  Both pamphlets are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington D.C. 20402.<P>

<b>Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens who register at the U.S. Embassy or the U.S. Consulates General may obtain updated information on travel and security within Saudi Arabia.<P>

<b>Embassy Location:</b>  The U.S. Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, is located at Collector Road M, Riyadh Diplomatic Quarter. The mailing address is P.O. Box 94309, Riyadh 11693, or AMEMBASSY, Unit 61307, APO AE 09803
1307.  The Embassy telephone number is (966-1) 488-3800, FAX (966-1) 488-7275.<P>
The U.S. Consulate General in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, is located between Aramco Headquarters and Dhahran International Airport.  The mailing address is P.O. Box 81, Dhahran Airport 31932, or Unit 66803, APO AE 09858-6803.  The telephone number is (966-3) 891-3200, FAX (966-3) 891-6816.<P>

The Consulate General in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, is located on Palestine Road, Ruwais. The mailing address is P.O. Box 149, Jeddah; or Unit 62112, APO AE 09811-2112.  The telephone number is (966-2) 667-0080, FAX (966-2) 669-3078. The workweek in Saudi Arabia is Saturday through Wednesday.<P>
No. 95-049<P>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet for Saudi Arabia dated April 22, 1994, to add information on entry requirements for women travelers, to add the section on Hajj travel, and to update the U.S. Embassy and Consulates' fax numbers.

<p>
Saudi Arabia - Public Announcement<br>
 July 10, 1996<br>
<p>
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
 For Immediate Release<br>
<p>
On July 10, 1996, the American Embassy in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia,
issued the following warden message to U.S. citizens in Saudi Arabia:
<p>
"The U.S. Embassy and other elements of the U.S. government in
Saudi Arabia continue to assist Saudi authorities in their
investigation of the June 25 bombing and their effort to apprehend
those responsible for this tragedy, wherever they may be.  We
continue to work with the Saudis to implement additional measures
designed to protect the security of Americans in the Kingdom.
<p>
Unfortunately, the sophistication of the operation behind the June
25 bombing suggests that additional attacks are quite possible.  The
U.S. Embassy continues to receive reports that suggest that there
could be further attacks upon official and unofficial U.S.
facilities, as well as other facilities that employ or are
frequented by U.S. and foreign citizens.  In addition, individual
Americans and companies in Saudi Arabia have received calls
threatening further attacks.  Some of these reports may have no
basis or be only harassment.  But it is likely that some of these
reports reflect planning for attacks.

<p>
As a result, the U.S. Embassy wishes again to remind the entire
American community of the importance of exercising extreme caution,
keeping a low profile, reducing travel within the Kingdom, and
treating mail from unfamiliar sources with suspicion.  U.S.
facilities are at very high states of alert and we continue to
stress that all Americans in Saudi Arabia should be especially
vigilant of their personal security and surroundings, paying
particular attention to suspicious vehicles.  Any suspicious
activity or vehicles should be quickly reported to the nearest
embassy or consulate.  License numbers and full descriptions will be
invaluable.
<p>
The U.S. Embassy will endeavor to keep the community informed of
relevant security information through the warden system.  To access
the system within Saudi Arabia, call 488-3800 and press 7."

<p>
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
<p>
The American Embassy in Belgrade has issued the following 
announcement to the local American community:
<p>
There have been several post-election demonstrations in Belgrade 
and other urban centers since the municipal elections in Serbia on 
November 17, 1996.  While these demonstrations have not been violent

<p>
Serbia & Montenegro - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 January 31, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia 
and Montenegro) is a moderately developed European country 
undergoing profound political and economic change.  In January 1996, 
the U.S. implemented the suspension of UN economic sanctions.  U.S. 
citizens and companies may now undertake normal business and 
personal transactions involving the export and import of goods to 
and from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Tourist facilities are 
widely available, but conditions vary considerably and some services 
and supplies found in other European countries are unavailable.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  U.S. citizens require a passport and visa.  
Visas should be obtained prior to departure from the U.S. as they 
are not normally granted at land border points, and never granted at 
airports.  The Embassy of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia at 2410 
California Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 
462-6566, may be contacted for updated entry requirements.  Visitors 
staying in private homes need to register with police immediately 
upon arrival; failure to comply may result in a fine, imprisonment 
and/or expulsion.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  The potential for violent incidents persists 
throughout the country.  Ethnic tensions remain high, particularly 
in the Kosovo and Sandzak regions.  Travelers may be stopped by 
government militia at any time and should be prepared to cooperate.  
Border regions, particularly near Croatia and along the Drina River, 
are sensitive areas.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>   Although many physicians are highly trained, 
hospitals and clinics are generally not equipped and maintained to 
U.S. standards.  Medicines and basic medical supplies are usually 
available in private pharmacies.  Because U.S. medical insurance is 
not always valid outside the United States, travelers have found 
that supplemental insurance with overseas coverage, including 
specific provision for air evacuation, has proven beneficial.  
However, even with special coverage, payment is required in cash at 
the time of service.  Further information on health matters can be 
obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
international travelers hotline, telephone (404) 332-4559.
<p>
<b>Crime Information:</b>  There is a continuing trend toward lawlessness 
and disorder.  Robberies are often perpetrated near railroad and bus 
stations, on public transport, and in city centers.  Violent crime 
has increased dramatically, with many incidents taking place in 
broad daylight at popular public places.  Possession of firearms 
(including grenades and mines) is widespread and weapons are 
frequently discharged in public.
<p>
The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported 
immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate.  The Department of State's pamphlet "A Safe Trip Abroad" 
provides useful information on protecting personal security and 
possessions while traveling abroad.  It is available from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.  
<p>
<b>Currency Information:</b>  All currency must be declared upon entry and 
a customs receipt issued.  Failure to produce this receipt upon 
departure may result in all funds being confiscated.  Credit cards, 
personal checks and traveler's checks are generally not accepted.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use 
or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and convicted offenders 
can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Internal Travel:</b>  The suspension of sanctions and increased 
commercial traffic across the border have added to long delays when 
entering the country by car or bus.  Purchase of third party 
insurance is required for cars.  Road tolls for foreign registered 
vehicles are very high.  Overland travel between Serbia and Croatia 
and between Montenegro and Croatia generally is not possible for 
private individuals. 
<p>
<b>Registration and Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens may register with 
the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and obtain updated information on 
travel and security in Serbia and Montenegro.  The Embassy is 
located at Kneza Milosa 50, telephone (381)(11) 645-655.  The after 
hours telephone number is (381) (11) 646-481.  
<p>
 No. 96-008
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated November 2, 
1994, to remove the travel warning, delete sanctions information and 
update all information.

<hr>
<b>Singapore - Consular Information Sheet</b><br>
July 15, 1996<p>

<b>Country Description:</b>  Singapore is a small, highly developed parliamentary democracy.  Tourist
facilities are modern and widely available.<p>

<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  Information about entry requirements may be sought from the Embassy of
the Republic of Singapore at 3501 International Place, N.W. Washington, D.C.  20008, telephone
(202) 537-3100.<p>

<b>Medical Facilities:  </b>Good medical care is widely available.  Doctors and hospitals may expect
immediate cash payment for health services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside
the United States.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide payment of medical
services outside the United States.    Supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas
coverage including provision for medical evacuation may be useful.  Information on health matters
may also be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through its
international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559 or via the CDC home page on the Internet: 
http://www.cdc.gov/.<p>

<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Major crimes against tourists are uncommon.  Petty crimes such as
pickpocketing do occur in tourist areas.  The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be
reported immediately to the local police and to the U.S. Embassy.  Useful information on
guarding valuables and protecting personal security while traveling abroad is provided in the
Department of State pamphlet, "A Safe Trip Abroad".  It is available from the Superintendent of
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<p>

<b>Criminal Penalties:</b>  While in a foreign country, a U.S. citizen is subject to that country's laws
and regulations, which sometimes differ significantly from those in the United States and do not
afford the protections available to the individual under U.S. law.  Penalties for breaking the law
can be more severe than in the United States for similar offenses.  Persons violating the law, even
unknowingly, may be expelled, arrested or imprisoned.  Visitors should be aware of Singapore's
strict laws and penalties for a variety of offenses that might be considered minor in the United
States, including jaywalking, littering and spitting, as well as the importation and sale of chewing
gum.  Singapore imposes a mandatory caning sentence on males for vandalism offenses.  Caning
may also be imposed for immigration violations and other offenses.  Penalties for possession, use,
or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines. 
Singapore has a mandatory death penalty for many narcotics offenses.  Commercial disputes that
may be handled as civil suits in the U.S. can escalate to criminal cases in Singapore and result in
heavy fines and prison sentences.  There are no jury trials in Singapore.  Judges hear cases and
decide sentencing.  The Singapore government does not provide legal assistance except in capital
cases.<p>

<b>Road Safety:</b>  Driving in Singapore is similar to driving during rush hour in large cities in the
United States, although traffic moves on the left.  Motorists should be particularly aware of
motorcyclists who often ignore lane markings.  Lanes are frequently closed without warning due
to constant construction throughout the city.  Public transportation and taxis are abundant and
inexpensive.  As with all laws in Singapore, those involving traffic rules, vehicle registration,  and
liability in case of accident are strictly enforced and may have criminal penalties.<p>

<b>Registration/U.S. Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens living in or visiting Singapore are
encouraged to register in person or via telephone with the U.S. Embassy in Singapore.  They may
also obtain updated information on travel and security within the country at the U.S. Embassy.<p>

The U.S. Embassy may be visited in person or contacted by telephone by U.S. citizens.  The U.S.
Embassy is located at 30 Hill Street, Singapore 179360; the mailing address is American Embassy
Singapore, FPO AP 96534; the telephone number is (65) 338-0251.<p>

 No. 96-132<p>

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated July 16, 1995.  It updates information on
entry requirements, criminal penalties and medical information.<p>

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION
</h2>
</center>
United Arab Emirates - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 August 7, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a 
federation of seven independent emirates, each with its own ruler.  
The federal government exists as a constitutional republic, headed 
by a president and council of ministers.  Islamic ideals and beliefs 
provide the conservative foundation of the country's customs, laws 
and practices.  The UAE is a modern, developed country, and tourist 
facilities are widely available.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport and visa are required.  In 
addition, an AIDS test is required for work or residence permits; 
testing must be performed after arrival.  A U.S. AIDS test is not 
accepted.  For further information, travelers can contact the 
Embassy of the United Arab Emirates, Suite 600, 3000 K Street, N.W., 
Washington, D.C. 20007, telephone (202) 338-6500.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Basic modern medical care and medicines are 
available in the principal cities of the UAE, but not necessarily in 
outlying areas.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside 
the United States.  In some cases, supplemental medical insurance 
with specific overseas coverage has proven useful.  Additional 
information on health matters can be obtained from the Centers for 
Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers' hotline at 
(404) 332-4559 or via the CDC home page on the Internet at 
http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Crime is generally not a problem for 
travelers in the UAE.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport should 
be reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. embassy 
or consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables, 
protecting personal security, and other matters while traveling 
abroad is provided in the Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe 
Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to the Middle East and North 
Africa."  They are available from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug and Crime Penalties:</b>  Travelers are subject to the laws and 
legal practices of the country in which they travel.  Penalties for 
possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict in the 
United Arab Emirates and convicted offenders can expect jail 
sentences and fines.  Legislation enacted in January 1996, imposes 
the death sentence for convicted drug traffickers.  Crimes of fraud, 
including passing bad checks and non-payment of bills (including 
hotel bills), are regarded seriously in the UAE and can result in 
imprisonment, as well as fines.  Penalties are generally assessed 
according to Islamic (Shariah) law.  In the case of imprisonment, 
bail is generally not available to non-residents of the UAE.
<p>
<b>Dual Nationality/Child Custody:</b>  The UAE government does not 
recognize dual nationality.  Children of UAE fathers automatically 
acquire UAE citizenship at birth and must enter and leave the UAE on 
UAE passports.  UAE authorities will usually confiscate the U.S. 
passports of dual (UAE/U.S.) nationals.  This does not constitute 
loss of citizenship, but should be reported to the U.S. Embassy in 
Abu Dhabi or the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai.  Child custody 
decisions are based on Islamic law.  It is difficult for an American 
woman, even a Muslim, to obtain custody of her dual national 
(UAE/U.S.) children through the UAE courts.
<p>
<b>Business Disputes:</b>  American citizens may become involved in 
disputes of a commercial nature involving the withholding of the 
American citizen's passport by the local individual or firm.  It is 
customary for a local sponsor to hold an employee's passport, but it 
is not required under UAE law.  Most such disputes can be avoided by 
clearly establishing all terms and conditions of employment or 
sponsorship in the labor contract at the beginning of any 
employment.  Should a 
dispute still arise, the UAE Ministry of Labor has established a 
special department to review and arbitrate labor claims.  A list of 
local attorneys capable of representing Americans in such matters is 
available from the Consular and Commercial Sections of the U.S. 
Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the U.S. Consulate General in Dubai.
<p>
<b>Traffic Safety and Road Conditions:</b>  Traffic accidents are a 
leading cause of death in the UAE.  While road conditions are 
generally good, unsafe driving practices are common, especially on 
intercity highways.  Traffic safety laws, including speed limits and 
seat belt regulations, are only selectively enforced, especially for 
UAE citizens.  On highways, wandering camels, unmarked speed bumps 
and drifting sand create additional hazards.
<p>
New country-wide traffic laws impose stringent penalties for 
certain violations, particularly driving under the influence of 
alcohol.  Penalties may include hefty jail sentences and fines, and, 
for Muslims, lashings.  Persons involved in an accident in which 
another party is injured automatically go to jail until the injured 
person is released from the hospital.  Should a person die in a 
traffic accident, the driver of the other car is liable for payment 
of compensation for the death (known as "dhiyya"), usually the 
equivalent of $41,000.  Even relatively minor accidents may result 
in lengthy proceedings, during which both drivers may be prohibited 
from leaving the country.
<p>
UAE residents must obtain a UAE driver's license in order to drive. 
 Visitors may obtain one-month temporary licenses by presenting 
their valid foreign license, a copy of their valid UAE visa, and the 
required fees.  Car rental agencies can usually process the request 
for a temporary license on behalf of their clients.  The UAE 
recognizes driver's licenses issued by other Gulf Cooperation 
Council (GCC) states only if the bearer is driving a vehicle 
registered in that GCC state.  Under no circumstances should anyone 
drive without a valid license.
<p>
<b>Embassy Location and Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens who register at 
the U.S. Embassy or Consulate General can obtain updated information 
on travel and security within the UAE.  The U.S. Embassy in Abu 
Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, is located on Al-Sudan St., P.O. Box 
4009.  The telephone number is (971) (2) 436-691.  The U.S. 
Consulate General in Dubai is located at the Dubai International 
Trade Center, P.O. Box 9343.  The telephone number is (971) (4) 
313-115.
<p>
The workweek in the UAE is Saturday through Wednesday.
<p>
 No. 96-144
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated July 21, 1995, 
to update information on criminal penalties for drug trafficking; 
add a new section on traffic safety and road conditions; and provide 
the new address for the Embassy of the United Arab Emirates in 
Washington, D.C.

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION

<p>
Zaire - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 July 24, 1996<br>
<b>
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
 For Immediate Release<br>
</b>
<p>

<b>Country Description:</b>  Despite plentiful human and natural 
resources, Zaire is in a deep political and economic crisis which 
has resulted in the dramatic deterioration of its physical 
infrastructure, insecurity and increased crime in cities, occasional 
official hostility to U.S. citizens and other expatriates, periodic 
shortages of basic items such as gasoline, chronic shortages of 
medical supplies, high inflation, corruption, and in some areas, 
serious malnutrition.  Tourism facilities are minimal and only 
essential travel is recommended.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  The government of Zaire has requested all 
first time visitors to Zaire, including those involved in 
humanitarian assistance, to schedule their arrivals in Zaire via 
Kinshasa.  First time visitors and those traveling on a passport 
without a Kinshasa entry stamp should be aware that this measure is 
being interpreted at some ports of entry as barring first time entry 
to Zaire other than through Kinshasa, including holders of valid 
Zairian visas.  Visa must be obtained in advance.  Under no 
circumstances should American citizens travel to Zaire without a 
valid visa.  Additional information may be obtained from the Zairian 
Embassy, 1800 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009 at 
(202) 234-7690 or 234-7691, or Zaire's Permanent Mission to the U.N. 
at 2 Henry Avenue, North Caldwell, New Jersey 07006, telephone (201) 
812-1636.  Overseas, inquiries should be made at the nearest Zairian 
embassy or consulate.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>
<p>
<b>North and South Kivu Provinces</b> - Travel to North and South Kivu 
Provinces is unsafe due to the presence of armed elements in the 
region, landmines on major thoroughfares, and the possibilities of 
inter-ethnic violence.
<p>
<b>Urban Areas</b> - Military mutinies in 1991 and 1993 caused many deaths 
and major property loss, damage, and destruction in Kinshasa and 
elsewhere.  The underlying causes of these mutinies -- the inability 
of the Zairian government to pay the military enough to support 
themselves and their families -- have not been resolved.  Civil 
disturbances, including looting and the possibility of physical 
harm, can occur without warning in all urban areas.
<p>
Corrupt Zairian security personnel may seek bribes to perform their 
duties, or single out foreigners and stop them on the street for 
proof of immigration status.  The U.S. Embassy advises travelers to 
not be belligerent if confronted with these situations and to 
contact the U.S. Embassy if taken into custody.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are limited and medicine is 
in short supply.  Doctors and hospitals expect immediate cash 
payment in full for health services.  U.S. medical insurance is not 
always valid or accepted outside the United States.  The 
Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide for payment of medical 
services outside the United States.  Travelers should consider 
supplemental medical insurance, with specific overseas and medical 
evacuation coverage.  For additional information, travelers can 
contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.  Internet:  
http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  The deterioration of Zaire's economy has led 
to an increase in crime.  Vehicle thefts, including armed 
carjackings, occur, as do burglaries and other crimes.  The loss or 
theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to 
local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The 
pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to 
Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on protecting 
personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in the region 
in general.  Both are available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20420.
<p>
<b>Road Safety and In-Country Travel:</b>  Intercity roads are difficult 
and in the rainy season often impassable.  When driving in cities, 
individuals should keep windows up and doors locked.  At roadblocks 
or checkpoints, documents are shown through closed windows.  
Visitors to the interior may be required to obtain a "mining permit" 
in Kinshasa before continuing the trip, regardless of the purpose of 
the trip.
<p>
<b>Zaire/Congo Border Crossing</b> - A special exit permit from Zaire's 
immigration department and a visa from an embassy of the Congo are 
required to cross the Congo River from Kinshasa to Brazzaville.
<p>
<b>Zaire/Central African Republic Border Crossing</b> - Ferry service to 
the Central African Republic is not reliable.
<p>
<b>Currency Regulations:</b>  The foreign exchange office at N'Djili 
Airport in Kinshasa remains closed.  U.S. dollars and travelers 
checks can, in theory, be exchanged for local currency (New Zaires) 
at banks, but there is often insufficient New Zaire cash on hand to 
make transactions.  Visitors may be given an unfavorable rate of 
exchange, making daily necessities extremely expensive.  Credit 
cards are not widely accepted, with the exception of a few major 
hotels.  Taking Zairian currency out of the country is illegal.  
With the continued devaluation of the New Zaire currency, U.S. 
currency has become a popular means for unofficial transactions 
greater than 100 dollars.  Participating in unofficial money 
exchanges, however, is illegal.  Foreigners have been picked up for 
infractions and had their money confiscated.  Large denominations of 
U.S. currency may not be accepted.
<p>
<b>Photography Restrictions:</b>  Photography of public buildings, 
military installations, airports, and the banks of the Congo River 
is forbidden.  Offenders can expect to be arrested, held for at 
least several hours, and fined.  Film and cameras may also be 
confiscated.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use, 
and trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly enforced.  Convicted 
offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Civil Aviation:</b>  As a result of an assessment conducted by the U.S. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in November 1992, the FAA has 
found the government of Zaire's Civil Aviation Authority to not be 
in compliance with international aviation safety standards for 
oversight of Zaire's air carrier operations.  Operations to the U.S. 
by Zaire's air carriers are not permitted unless they arrange to 
have their flights conducted by a carrier from a country meeting 
international aviation safety standards.  For further information, 
travelers may contact the Department of Transportation at 
1-800-322-7873.
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register at the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa and to obtain updated 
information on travel and security within Zaire.  The U.S. Embassy 
is at 310 Avenue des Aviateurs, Kinshasa.  The telephone number is 
(243) (12) 21532 or 21628.  The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy 
is located at Avenue d'Isiro, Mobil Building; the telephone number 
is (243) (12) 21532, extension 2376.  Telephone service is often 
unreliable and cellular phones are becoming increasingly popular.  
The U.S. Embassy's cellular switchboard phone number is (243) (88) 
43608.  The Consular Section may be reached by fax at (243) (88) 
00228.
<p>
 No. 96-136

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated June 24, 1996 to 
update paragraphs on Entry Requirements, Areas of Instability and 
Registration/Embassy Location.

<h1>The President of the United States</h1>
As the Commander in Chief (CINC), the President commands all the armed forces of the United States.  To facilitate command and control of this awesome responsibility, the President is constantly followed around by a senior officer carrying a mobile communications setup and the sets of codes that allow the President to swing the U.S. nuclear machine into operation.
<p>
<h2><a href="warpower.htm">War Powers Act</a></h2>
But this power cannot be used at the President's whim.  Certain conditions must exist before the President's orders will be followed, for instance the U.S. must be under immenent threat of nuclear attack before nuclear forces will accept his codes to launch nuclear weapons.  A pre-emptive strike out of the "clear blue" cannot happen.  On the other hand, the President may issue orders to that effect if the Armed Forces have moved to a readiness "footing" which signifies war is emminent (DEFCON 3 or Defense Condtion Three, with DEFCON 4 meaning to actually  be at war.)
<p>
The Presidents power to take the nation to war, of course, also extends outside the nuclear warfare role, but Congress, over the years since the Vietnam War, has severely limited the President's war power in the conventional sense.  
<p>
<h2>Defense Budget</h2>
As the commander-in-chief, the President is responsible, through the Defense Department, for proposing the budget changes to provide for the defense of the United States.  It is his policies, then that are articulated to Congress.  Congress in turn makes the final decisions, modifing the budget (including the Defense Budget, a segment of the overall national budget) with the President able to veto the budget package.  Congress then has the opportunity to override the President's veto.

<TITLE>The U.S. Congress</TITLE>
<H1>The U.S. Congress</H1>
The U.S. Congress, comprised of the U.S. Senate (2 Senators from each state) and the U.S. House of Representatives (a 
number of Representatives for each state based on population) control the monies spent by the government for military uses 
and ensures compliance with U.S. Policy for use of military force.  For instance, the  War Powers Act  of 1973 prohibits the 
President from waging war beyond a certain period without Congressional approval.  All such controls are placed upon the 
Executive Branch of the government by the Congress through enactment of law, as well as various oversight and planning 
committees:<P>
<B>House Appropriatiions Committee:</B>  Acts upon budget requests from the White House or from the U.S. 
Senate.<P>
<B>Senate Appropriations Committee</B>:  Acts upon Presidential budget requests as well as their own proposals and 
amendments as directed by the President.  The Senate does not control what expenditures are made, rather provide a set of 
expenditures to be approved by the House of Representatives.<P>
<B>House Armed Services Committee and the Senate Armed Services Committee</B>:  Propose and approve 
expenditures and direction for the U.S. Armed Forces.  This includes oversight and budget input on Pentagon spending for 
weapons systems, maintenance, and payroll for the U.S. Armed Services.  A Joint Committee for Defense Appropriations is 
typically responsible for reviewing the U.S. Military Budget and expenditures.  This process begins with the Penatagon 
submittal of its proposed spending, and is presented by the Secretary of Defense to each of the Houses of Congress.  <P>
<B>The Senate Appropriations Committee </B>will recommend changes to the House Appropriations Committee, who in 
turn may add or delete items.  Once this part of the process has taken place, the Joint Committee may add or delete after 
consultation with the White House and/or the Pentagon.  Finally the Defense Budget is placed before the full House with the 
recommendations from the Senate and House Armed Services committees.  The final vote firmly sets the appropriations for 
Defense as a percentage of the budget and as certain milestone are met throughout the year, these funds are awarded to 
contractors (or in the case of payroll added to the serviceman's paycheck).<P>
<B>House Select Committee on Intelligence and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence:</B>  Certain 
Representatives and Senators are selected for participation on the Intelligence committees to provide the oversight on 
expenditures, direction and policy for the U.S. Intelligence Community.  The Chairman and Co-Chairman of the two houses of 
Congress are part of the modern management of Intelligence affairs on a day-to-day basis.  For more information on the legal 
aspects of U.S. Intelligence, see  Legal History of Intelligence  .  <P>
For instance, in compliance with the  Hughes-Ryan  Act of 1974 and the  Intellience Authorization  Act of 1981, the U.S. 
President, when authorizing covert activities, must notify the senior members of Congress (President of the Senate, President 
Pro-tem of the Senate, the Speaker of the House, the Majority Leader and the Minority Whip and the Chairman and Vice 
chairman of the House and Senate Select Intelligence Committees) within a reasonable time after that operation begins.  
Similiarly, this same group of leaders must be notified of pending use of military force in a covert or open manner before that 
action is to take place.  These two committees provide input to the budget process for items including Intelligence activities 
such as technological as well as human tools and needs.  Congress sometimes has elected to act outside of the bounds of the 
committee in the oversight functin.  For example the   Boland Amendment  was passed by Congress to limit the President's 
power to authorize use of intelligence funds to support the Sandinistas in their attempt to overthrow the communist 
government in Nicaragua.<P>
<B>Senate Foreign Relations Committee:</B> Provides guidance to the President and his Secretary of State, and 
consults on the setting of U.S. Foreign Policy and foreign aid.  This committee aids the President in the appropriate levels of 
appropriation for foreign aid, to be included in the annual national budget.<P>
Typically, the U.S. Congress and the Pentagon clash annually as their sometimes divergent views on the needs of the military 
create dissention and at times very vocal recriminations.  But each year the debate is settled by the adoption of the U.S. 
budget, and in the last few years, has been demonstrated to be a last ditch affair caused by partisian bickering between the 
two houses as well as within the parties themselves.<P>
<B>Defense Appropriations Committee:</B>  This is a special committe formed during the hearings on the Defense 
Budget, and is responsible for this portion of the budget.  It makes recommendations to the full House based upon its research 
and analysis.<P>
There are also various acts as passed by Congress which set the statutes governing the practices of Department of Defense 
contact management and the outlay of funds to Defense Contractors.  In the last few years, charges of corruption and 
cheating on the DoD contracts have spawned new and more restricing legislation.  As the legislation restricts the activities of 
the Department of Defense in its role as the contractor, the Defense Industry finds itself spending more to comply, and thus 
the cost of procurement of weapons and weapons systems increases dramaticaly.<P>
In 1990, Congress adopted a set of new laws which on one hand reduce the amount of effort in justifying Defense Contractor 
Research and Development reimbursements (Tri-Service Negoations Statutes) and at the same time added more bureaucracy 
to the DoD procurement management structure.  Whether these actions will wind up costing the taxmaker more or less will be 
seen in less than five years.<P>

<TITLE>US Coast Guard</TITLE>
<H1>US Coast Guard</H1>
In an interview with the Navy League's <a href="biblio.htm#seapowermag"><i>Sea Power</i></a> magazine (August, 1990), the new Coast 
Guard Commandant, Admiral J. William Kime, stated his philosophy on the mission for the 
USCG, "...I want to be able to provide balance among all the operating forces the Coast 
Guard has: law enforcement, environmental protection, and our traditional missions of aids 
to navigation, search and rescue, and boating safety."  1<P>
Later in that same article he reponded to a probe on any new roles for the Coast Guard, 
with he reply, "...The lead role in the maritime drug-interdiction effort; also in the air-
interdiction effort, and obviously the environmental initiatives that have come forward.  
We have added responsibilities in vessel documentation, and Congress has passed a 
number of marine-safety laws that have given us new responsibilities."  <P>

Note:  U.S. service force structures are going through a major upheaval, as part of the scaling down of forces due to the perceived reduction in threat from
the Soviet Union.  Therefore much of the data presented is pre-scaledown.  
Changes in force structure are occuring so quickly, it is nearly impossible to
keep track.  However, not much remains, so the cuts will have to stop soon, or
there will be no military, a fact many officials in our government seem to 
favor.

<H1>U.S. Defense Department</H1>
</center>
Tasked with the enormous duty of protecting the United States and its interests worldwide, the U.S. Department of Defense 
has the largest budget of any Department in the U.S. govenment.  In as such, it 
has always been available as a target for budget 
cutters to reduce the overall deficit or to fund other projects in 
government, thus has oscillated up and down since the 
formation of the department following World War II.<P>
<a name="secdef">
The structure of the DoD can be seen in the <a href="dodchrt.htm">chart</a> included.  The actual military chain of command flows from the President, 
to the <b>Secretary of Defense</b>, through the under-Secretaries, and then to the 
Generals in the <a href="opcomm.htm">Operational Commands</a>.  The Operational commands can be 
thought of as two types of command structures; Specific Commands and Unified Commands.<P>
<a name="specific">
<h3>Specific Commands</h3>
Specific Commands are those in a given task within a specified military service, such as the Strategic Air Command, which is 
part of the U.S. Air Force, and tasked with strategic offensive and reconaissance operations.<P>
<a name="unified">
<h3>Unified Commands</h3>
The Unified Commands are intra-service commands, usually tasked with operations in a particular region such as the 
European Command.  <P>
Any given military commander is subordinate to one of these Commands and receives his or her operational orders from the 
commander or staff of that command.  <P>
<a name="undsec">
<h3>Under-Secretaries of Defense</h3>
The Under-Secretaries of Defense work with the Specified or Unified Command Commanders to build a specific day-to-day 
operational budget, which is melded into the overall DoD budget request.  This budget request also includes monies for 
R&amp D, operational weapons procurement, as well as intelligence assets that are not covered in other Intelligence 
Community budget request.<P>
The staff in the Department of Defense is also the largest of all Departments in the govenment, with their offices being mainly 
located in the Penatagon, a five sided, three concentric sectioned building in Maryland bordering a freeway into Washington, 
D.C.  The Department of Defense also has several smaller offices near the capital building.<P>
One of the key installations housed within the Penatagon is the National Military Command Center (NMCC) the hub of 
command and control for the U.S.  Here the Generals in command of military can communicate with their subordinates as well 
as analyze the tactical environment on high tech displays.<P>

<TITLE>Joint Chiefs of Staff </TITLE>
<H1>Joint Chiefs of Staff </H1>
The JCS, found on the web at <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/jcs">http://www.dtic.mil/jcs</a> (this link can 
at times be quite slow...it is the U.S. DoD's web page and is quite busy) is a structure which arose following World War II.  The United 
States military recongized that during that war, inter-branch rivalry in the military had 
reduced U.S. war fighting capability.  The Joint Chiefs of Staff was created as a 
recommendation panel for the U.S. President, with the goal of determing the correct U.S. 
military response, putting aside inter-branch rivalry, and thus presenting the President with 
a clear and unbiased miltary option.  <P>
It soon became apparent that a panel of experts could rarely speak in one voice.  Thus the 
position of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was created.  While this new position 
helped resolved some of the conflict, it is still, by no means perfect.<P>
The Joint Chiefs of Staff are appointed to those positions, and the Chairman is chosen from 
the members. The Chairman serves at the pleasure of the President, as do all the Joint  
Chiefs, there appointments actually being part of the President's Cabinet.  Past Presidents 
have placed the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs in the National Security Council, thus 
bringing a military viewpoint into all issues of National Security.  
<p>
The Chairman of the JCS is an important individual in both the military processes of the 
goverment, as well as the political side.  For instance, General  Colin Powell ,  
had great influence upon the 
Presidents during his tenure as the Chairman of the JCS and of course was quite visible 
during the Gulf War.  Some said his political savvy and excellent performance as the 
Chairman during the Gulf War would make him an ideal candidate for President.<P>
Since the JCS is an advisory body only, it is not part of the command structure.  Reporting 
to the President, the JCS can only recommend any particular action.  In reality though, JCS 
officers are four star generals, thus have the highest rank possible in the military.  It is 
therefore thought that the JCS may effect military policy and preparations by simply picking 
up the telephone.  It is also clear that no officer in any of the services would ever take 
action as ordered by the JCS, ensuring that the proper chain of command is followed.<P>

<h1>MILNET:  U.S. Rank System</h1>
<p></center>
<p>
The U.S. Ranking System is somewhat straightforward with there being a total
of 10 officer grades (discounting a special segment called the Warrant Officer
Program), and 9 Enlisted grades.  The ranks strcutures in ascending order are:
<p>
    <b>Officers</b>
    <ul>
<b>USAF, USMC, USArmy:</b>
       <li>O-1  - 2nd Lieutenant (single gold bar)
       <li>O-2  - 1st Lieutenant (single silver bar)
       <li>O-3  - Captain (Two Silver Bars ... "H" pattern)
       <li>O-4  - Major (Gold Leaf)
       <li>O-5  - Lt. Colonel (Silver Leaf)
       <li>O-6  - Colonel (Silver Eagle)
       <li>O-7  - Brigadier General (1 Silver Star)
       <li>O-8  - Major General (2 Silver Stars)
       <li>O-9  - Lt. General (3 Silver Stars)
       <li>O-10 - General (4 Silver Stars)
       <li>O-11 - General of the <service> (5 Silver Stars in circle) - None Today
last was General Ike D. Eisenhower, General Allied Forces during World War II.
<p>
<b>USN:</b>
       <li>O-1  - Ensign (single gold bar or single thin stripe)
       <li>O-2  - Lieutenant J.G. (single silver bar or one thin, one broad stri
pes)
       <li>O-3  - Lieutenant (Two Silver Bars in H pattern or two broad stripes)
       <li>O-4  - Lt. Commander (Gold Leaf or Two broad stripes with thin one be
tween)
       <li>O-5  - Commander (Silver Leaf or Three Broad Stripes)
       <li>O-6  - Captain (Silver Eagle or Four Broad Stripes)
       <li>O-7  - Commododore (rare, Silver Star or Large stripe with "eupulat")
       <li>O-8  - Rear Admiral (Two Silver Stars, or Large and  thin stripe  and
 "eupulat")
       <li>O-9  - Vice Admiral (Three Silver Stars, or Large Stripe, 2 thin strip
 with "eupulat")
       <li>O-10 - Admiral (Four Silver Stars, or Large Stripe, 3 thin stripes wi
th "euplat")
       <li>O-11 - Fleet Admiral (5 stars circle or Large stripe, 4 thin stripes
with "eupulate"
</ul>
    <b>Warrant Officers</b>
The Warrant Officer program allows technically trained individuals with specific command authority to command missions of key importance in combat or in administrative tasks.  An excellent example of a warrant officer is one who has trained
as a helicopter pilot, and thus commands his aircraft and crew.
<ul>
        <li>W-1 - Warrant Officer (one gold section on cloth bar)
        <li>W-2 - Chief Warrant Officer (two gold sections on cloth bar)
    <b>Enlisted</b>
Various services implement quite differently, E-1 thru E-9 is basic structure,
for example, U.S. Army:
    <ul>
       <li>E-1 - Private (recruit) (no chevron)
       <li>E-2 - Private (after basic)
       <li>E-3 - Private 1st Class (1 chevron)
       <li>E-4 - Corporal (2 chevrons)
       <li>E-5 - Sergeant (3 chevrons)
       <li>E-6 - Staff Sergeant (3 Chevrons 1 below )
       <li>E-7 - Sergeant First Class (3 chevrons above 2 below)
       <li>E-8 - First Sergeant (3 chevrons above 3 below)
       <li>E-9 - Sergeant Major (3 chevrons above 3 below, star center)
    </ul>
   <b>U.S. Marines</b>
    <ul>
       <li>E-1 - Private (recruit) (no chevron)
       <li>E-2 - Private First Class (1 chevron)
       <li>E-3 - Lance Corporal (1 Chevron, crossed rifles)
       <li>E-4 - Corporal (2 chevrons, crossed rifles)
       <li>E-5 - Sergeant (3 chevrons, crossed rifles)
       <li>E-6 - Staff Sergeant (3 Chevrons 1 below, crossed rifles)
       <li>E-7 - Gunnery Sergeant (3 chevrons above 2 below, crossed rif.)
       <li>E-8 - First Sergeant (3 chevrons above 3 below, crossed rifles)
       <li>E-9 - Sergeant Major (3 chevrons above 4 below, crossed rifles)
    </ul>
<b>U.S. Navy</b>
    <ul>
       <li>E-1 - Seaman Recruit (1 diagonal hash marks)
       <li>E-2 - Seaman Apprentice (2 diagonal hash marks) 
       <li>E-3 - Seaman (3 diagonal hash marks)
       <li>E-4 - Petty Officer Third Class (Eagle and 1 lower stripe)
       <li>E-5 - Petty Officer Second Class (Eagle and 2 lower stripes)
       <li>E-6 - Petty Officer First Class (Eagle and 3 lower stripes)
       <li>E-7 - Chief Petty Officer (Eagle, stripe above, 3 stripes below)
       <li>E-8 - Senior Chief Petty Officer (Star, Eagle, stripe above, 3 below)
       <li>E-9 - Master Chief Petty Officer (2 Stars, Eagle, stripe above, 3 below)

    </ul>

<h1>MILNET:  The Military Threat Situation</h1>
<p>
<dl>
<dt><b>NOTE: </b> 
<dd>Due to the breakup of the Soviet Union, the information on threats in this section has nearly become obsolete.   Thus a minor edit has modified the information into the past tense.   New sections dealing with each of the emerging states are being compiled. 
<p>
However, the disposition of weapons, both conventional and nuclear, remains very much like that at the time of the breakup (in terms of total count and locations).   This fact has added a number of new nuclear powers to the world, powers that are in of themselves fledging governments with little stability.  
<p>
Since much of the "off Russian soil" conventional weaponry also remains in the 
hands of these new goverments, it is clear a new accounting of the world's 
balance of power must be made.  But again, the disposition most likely follows 
that prior to the breakup.  Therefore, the reader can take note of where 
disposition is implied in the following data, and should be safe in assuming 
that few changes have been made in terms of total count or location.</b></dl>
<p>
<h2>General Threat Assessment</h2>
The worldwide military threat is comprised of three components today, however, 
it is felt, perhaps incorrectly, that the major threat - 
nuclear attack - has lessened in the light of the break-up of the Soviet Union.
However, one of the theories of the post World War II military approach, was
the Mutual Assurred Destruction doctrine.  The idea is simple, "you won't use
nuclear weapons on me, cuz I will blow your country off the face of the earth."
Unfortunately, today's nuclear threat is much different.  First, the nuclear
weapon may soon fall into the hands of "country-less" attackers...the terrorist.
Second, the nuclear weapon may fall in the hands of totally irresponsible
third world countries without the sophistication to understand the weapon, its
destructiveness and secondary effects, nor the repercussions for its use.  Both
these possibilities are very, very real, and the contingency plannning for these
events is chewing up some major strategic planning time in the major countries
worldwide.
<p>
The newest major threat countries today face is the increased and strategic 
elements of anti-terrorist planning.  The <a href="/milnet/tthreat.htm">
Terrorist</a> threat is perhaps the second most frightening aspect of conflict
in our world today, because it has the abililty to reach into any country and
attack any citizen with little warning, and in most cases, with a random
choice as to the victim.  In other words, anyone is the target.  The 
strategic element, of course, is the fact that a few individual terrorists can 
<a href="/milnet/dhahran.htm">attack</a> a 
military force with near impunity, because often there is no country or 
logical region the victimized military force can mount a reprisal against.   
<p> 
For obvious reasons, military and government officials will always term such attacks as cowardly, since they are helpless to respond.  It is clear however, 
that prevention and capture of would-be terrorist attackers, while at times
nearly impossible, would be a more productive use of time.  Indeed, force 
structure protection has become a key element of military planning and it seems
to be emerging as an overriding tactic in cooperative military planning.  For 
instance, it is clear that U.S. troops will no longer be allowed to suffer 
reduced security in a hosting country.  If you want us there, you provide
the cooperation and basing requirements we need.  Without those two major
elements, we deny the request and offer the mission to others.  
<p>
Also, we should not forget that the nuclear armed submarine
still remains a potent nuclear threat, and while we have managed to reduce the
ground and air based delivery systems, the submarine still remains a powerful
nuclear asset in the hands of major countries in the world.  It should be noted
that by mutual agreement, U.S. and Russian submarine commanders no longer have
the "on-site" authority (and one assumes ability) to launch a nuclear attack. 
The details of this change in authority (which were based upon home port launch
orders anyway) are not clear, and of course the new mechanisms are highly 
classified.  Technical analysis still shows that a sub commander, once 
authorized, must be able to submerge to the firing depth and carry out the
attack, thus creates a "no recall" delay in that component of the nuclear 
attack, and also once launched, the missiles must at some point become 
non-recallable so as to thwart any countermanding by hostile forces.
<p>
Below we include the mid 1990s threat analysis for the Soviet Union.  Since the
breakup this threat does not exist in this form, however, the information 
below is an excellent example of a threat analysis and serves to illustrate
the thinking and process that goes into military threat analysis.
<p>

<h2>Soviet Military Spending</h2>
<p>
The Soviets were known for their unprecedented spending on arms, some 60% of their GNP in the years between 1950 and 1970.   The spending rate did not decline and even in throughout the early 1990s  environment of "lessening of tensions" the Soviets continued to expand and modernize their forces.  While the threat from the countries of the former Soviet Union has lessened, it remains that the countries of the former Soviet Union still pose the major military threat that shapes how the U.S. structures its own military forces.  
<p>
Other threats such as world terrorism and tensions in the Middle East will continue to shape contingencies planning in the U.S.  The U.S. however will have to consider countering a  huge  BALTIC <a href="sovieti.htm">intelligence machine</a>  that is equalled by no other in the world.  
<p>
A major set of the U.S.' weapons were poised to retalitate against nuclear attack from the Soviet Union.  Of course, there were also conventional threats from the Soviet Union as well.  The total concern for U.S. military in terms of the Soviet Union could be characterized by the threat of:
<p>
<ol>
<li>Soviet Strategic Nuclear Attack upon the United States
<li>Soviet Strategic Nuclear Attack upon U.S. Allies in Europe (NATO)
<li>Soviet Strategic Nuclear Attack upon any other U.S. Allies
<li>Soviet Strategic Nuclear Attack upon anyone else in the world
<li>Any use of Tactical Nuclear weapons anywhere in the world
<li>Any conventional attack against U.S. Allies in Europe (NATO)
<li>Any conventional attack against other U.S. Allies anywhere else in the World
<li>Any conventional attack against any country in the world who requests U.S.
     assistance.
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Stategic Threat</h2>
<p>
The Strategic Threat was the most severe, that is, the threat of Nuclear Attack with Strategic Nuclear Weapons.  This threat was imposed by the :
<p>
<ul>
<li>Soviet Naval Forces
<li>Soviet Air Forces
<li>Soviet Ground Forces
<li><a href="sovsats.htm">Soviet Space Assets</a>
</ul>
<p>
Within these forces the threats originated from the forces controlled by the Soviet Command, Control and Intelligence structure (<a href="sovc3i.htm">C3I</a>):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Soviet Strategic Rocket Forces (ICBMs)
<li>Soviet Navy (SLBMs)
<li>Soviet Air Force (Bombers)
</ul>
<p>
<h2>ICBMs</h2>
<p>
The Soviet ICBM threat continued to grow from the very first capable missile and warhead in Soviet hands.  The U.S. had typically been at a higher level of technology in terms of accuracy of the delivery systems, and thus as the Soviets amassed a 3 to 1 or 4 to 1 ratio of their warheads over ours, there was not much concern.  At the time of the breakup however, the accuracy of the Soviet missile arsenal had continued growing as older weaponry was being replaced with newer and newer equipment.  
<p>
At the time of the breakup the Soviets had some 1,451 ICBMs which includes 165 of the latest model SS-25 single warhead, ground mobile missiles.  The mobility of the ICBM force was a major problem for U.S. deterrence.  In order to provide a military deterrence (as opposed to a general deterrence) you had to be able to strike at the Soviet's ability to wage nuclear war, thus eliminating any such power they might have to use elsewhere in the world.  This deterrence, in response to a Soviet launch, required the U.S. to target the Soviet ICBM force.  Unfortunately, mobile launchers place a heavy burden on strategic surveillance, the task being quite difficult and expensive to pinpoint mobile launcher locations. 
<p>
With the increase of mobile launchers and the improvement in accuracy, the Soviet Union's weapons ratio  quickly drew even to the U.S.
<p>
Today, the dismantling and destruction of weapons in both the U.S. and Russia have reduced the number of warheads dramatically.  Again, it will take a historical perspective to finally account for the new balance of nuclear power when the current rounds of dismantling occurs.
<p>
<h2>SLBMs</h2>
<p>
The Soviet SLBM force continued to grow at an alarming rate.  Production of SLBM and attack submarines in the Soviet had doubled and in some years tripled that of the U.S.   Moreover, the Soviets continued to field a large number of different models of submarines, continuing to push the edge of technology and learning at a prodicious rate.  At the breakup, the Soviet SLBM force numbers 69 submarines (does not include attack submarines which could also carry nuclear tipped submarine launched cruise missiles), with an approximate total of 960 SLBM missiles launchable.  Some of these of course are multiple reentry/multiple warhead missiles. 
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Note: 
<dd>It is not clear if Russia maintained absolute control of all the nuclear armed submarines, but it is postulated that one of the terms for U.S. support during the breakup was the maintenance of control.  Perhaps this resulted in the return to Russian control of Soviet submarine technology.  This will be a historical lesson to be learned, however, as little information is available today.
</dl>
<p>
The advent of SLBM submarines has reduced the warning time from launch to detonation from the 30 minutes warning we have from satellites, to a meer 10 to 12 minutes.  This doesn't leave much time for an effective retaliation force to be launched.
<p>
The effects of this SLBM force was (and my continue to be) a heavy burden on U.S. surveillance systems, both airborne and space-borne.
<p>
<h2>BOMBERS</h2>
<p>
The Soviets, at the breakup, maintained some 175 Bear long range bombers capable of carrying  40,000 pounds of ordnance to a max range of approximately 7000 nautical miles.  75 Bear H bombers were configured to carry air launched cruise missiles.  The Soviets also had the luxury of some 175 TU-26 Backfire, Mach 2.5 bombers which were not counted as strategic bombers in the SALT treaty.   The TU-26 can a weapon load of 17,500 pounds to a max range of around 4,000 nautical miles.
<p>
The Soviet Naval Force, just prior to the breakup, had added around 180 TU-26s to their force, presumably as maritime patrol.  Of course these could easily be dual configured providing long range strike capability against shipping.
<p>
In a very short time after the TU-26 deploymnet, the Soviets had planned to deploy their new supersonic Blackjack bomber, adding to the new technology even further.  It is not clear what the disposition of these aircraft is, or even if the planned build of these aircraft took place.
<p>
<h2>Conventional Threat</h2>
<p>
The Soviet Union's conventional threat has for years been seen as a threat to the Western European countries.  With the Soviets able to place huge amounts of troops and equipment into their Warsaw Pact allies terrorities, they were able to place a formidable force right on the borders of our allies in Western Europe.  The NATO alliance was formed to counter this threat, and the U.S. has invested billions to arm those allies with appropriate and leading edge technologies in weapons.
<p>
With the Eastern European country's governments falling to a new order, it doesn't appear that the level of threat we percieved in the past will continue.  Still the former Soviet Union's ability was tremendous.  If we took the best scenario possible in the restructuring of the Eastern European governments, we would have a united Europe, poised on the borders of the emmensely powerful sister states of the former  Soviet Union.  This will only lead to the fomer Soviet states bolstering their forces at their own border instead of in Hungary, Poland, or East Germany.  
<p>
With tensions lessening between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, it is clear that there will be need for change, and defense spending in both countries will fall.  However, until the new governements in the region are truly stabilized, much can happen which could, virtually overnight, change the strategic balance dramatically.  Decapitating our own forces in hopes that "everything will turn out okay" is not only dangerous, but irresponsible.

<H1>Police Actions</H1>
</center>
The U.S. has participated in a large number of United Nations "Police Actions" over the 
years following the formation of the U.N. Security Council (the body within the United 
Nations tasked with protecting soverienty of the nations of the world,and thus continues to 
be the body voting to intercede on a nations behalf or on the behalf of a region).<P>
The U.S. policy has been to actively pursue diplomatic means to ensure freedom throughout 
the world, thus has been the driving force behind many of the votes within the U.N. 
Security Council, and has been the target of many forms of propaganda from those opposed 
to U.S. Policy, propoganda designed to make the U.N. look like a tool of the U.S. 
government.<P>
<p>
Note that U.S. conflicts since World War II have been primarily police actions of
one sort or another, with the Vietnam War being the only major military event 
which was not fully sanctioned by the U.N.  There are numerous 
<a href="/milnet/conflict.htm">conflicts</a> however where the U.S. has chosen
to invade on their own or has taken the lead.
The actions the U.S. has participated in have ranged from the Korean War, a 
conflict defined by the 28th parallel in between the North and South Korean borders, to the 
Intercession in Iraq, the enforcement of the No-Fly Zone which split the country of Iraq into 
thirds (as far as military air traffic is concerned).  See  
<a href="/milnet/polact2.htm">List of Police Actions</a> for more 
information.<P>
Police Actions usually deal with a country which does not honor treaty or border terms and 
thus the rest of the world is faced with watching a conflict that will not be resolved by the 
fighting parties, or faced with intervention.  Since the U.S. and the former Soviet Union 
have been the two largest "Super-Powers", it has fallen on them to make the major efforts 
in policing smaller countries.  Until the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the break-up of the 
former Soviet Union, the Soviets have primarily been sponsors of communist inspired 
revolutionaries who fostered many of the conflicts for which police action was called for.  
This was not always the case, as both Cuba and China have fostered their own brand of 
revolutionary actions.<P>
The most recent of the major police actions was in the Gulf War, see   
<a href="/milnet/gulfwar.htm">Gulf War</a> Summary  
for more information.<P>
The "Coalittion Forces", a vast number of Middle Eastern and European countries 
combined with the U.S. and Canada, warned Suddam Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait in 
August of 1991, or face a police action to force Iraq back into its own borders.  As the 
coalittion forces began deploying troops to the area, Iraq made unrealistic demands and 
half-hearted diplomatic efforts to resolve the situation, while at the same time its leader 
Saddam Hussein bragged on television and radio how he was going to fight the "mother of 
all battles" and called for a "jihad", a religious holy war against the U.S. and its "evil 
partners in this heinious crime".  The rhetoric only served to solidify the coalition, and in 
January of 1992, the U.S. led the coaltion forces into a 2 week air bombardment using high 
tech weaponry that practically reduced the Iraq war machine into a force encapable of 
fighting.  When Iraq and Saddam still refused to withdraw, the U.S. led coalition ground 
forces in a 1 week rout sending Iraqi tank crews scurrying back across their borders, and 
then when pursued by coalition forces into southern Iraq, fled their vehicles, leaving a long 
line of burned out hulks.<P>
This police action in Iraq is quite atypical, as the Korean War was a long, protacted and 
painful excercise, eating up U.S. troops, and only accompolishing a few goals of the U.S. 
and the U.N.<P>
It is clear though that some actions can be taken without huge losses of life, and which can 
result in betterment for the country who needs the help.   <P>
<p>
<p>
<h2>Mogadushu</h2>
<p>
With "The Technicals" roaming the streets, the police action sponsored by the U.N., and manned in force by U.S. troops on the ground and in the air, this 
activity created a formula for disaster.  The U.S. forces were there to ensure
food and other relief supplies got to the needy, rather than into the coffers
of the technicals, thus increasing their power over the average person on the
street, and thus building the power base of the so leaders of the "technicals".
With a Coalition forces command center in charge of air assets, it wouldn't be long
before the disaster would occur.  And it did, some troops on the ground getting
massacred while air units were not mobilized to reinforce them.  Within three 
months the majority of U.S. forces had withdrawn, and by six months most of the
U.N. troops had left.
<p>
Due to U.N. ineffectiveness in such places as Magadushu and Bosnia (just
to name a few), U.N. participatory countries are beginning to rethink their 
roles in the U.N., if not indeed the role of the U.N. itself.  On the anniversary 
1995 anniversary celebration, it was clear that the UN political force is strong
but nations willingness to contribute goes weaker.  U.S. press carried a large number of
negative stories about the U.N., fueling the fire to either abolish or totally
rewrite the UN charter.  Interestingly, few of the calls in the press were
echoed by member nations representatives at the anniversary celebrations, and
it was clear that there is a marked division between U.S. (and to a lesser degree world press) and the member governments of the U.N.  Some believe the 
unprecendented press outpouring may be a direct attack on the conservative 
U.S. Congress, making a political hay as the U.S. Presidentail Campaign begins.
<p>
Thus while there is a high degree of concern about U.S. military participation in police
actions, the political situation may or may not make this an issue for election.
<p>
It is clear however, that the U.S., as the major military force in the world, 
still remains the only power in the world logistically capable of rapid 
response and major transport necessary to conduct major police actions, and 
will continue to be called upon again and again to buttress the U.N.'s resolve
, providing police actions in any part of the world.

<h1>United States Intelligence Agencies</h1>
<hr>
</center><p>
MILNET presents a compilation of information on the United States Intelligence Community.  
<p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
The U.S. has a number of intelligence agencies whose overall mission is  <a href="definei.htm">defined </a>  by each of the U.S. Presidents.   The complexity of the U.S. Intelligence Community is such that one really needs a comprehensive guide.  Fortunately, Jeffrey T. Richelson has devoted an entire book to the 
"community" called The U.S. Intelligence Community<strong>1</strong> .  The agencies are split into three groups, those concerned with counter intelligence within the U.S. borders; counter-intelligence, offensive intelligence activites, and covert activities outside of the U.S.; and miiltary intelligence inside and outside the U.S..  Intelligence is the key element in Command, Control, Communications, and 
Intelligence (<a href="c3i.htm">C3I</a> ) .   Management of the intelligence agencies is conducted by the President of the United States, through the Director of Central Intelligence, who also is the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and intelligence oversight is conducted via the Congress' Intelligence Committees.   <a href="collecti.htm">Collection</a>;  systems in the U.S. are typically very sophisticated 
and technically advanced.  U.S. Intelligence agencies are centered in the Washington, D.C. area, see 
<a href="location.htm">Locations</a> (large graphic!).  
<p>
<h2>Intelligence Activities Within the U.S.</h2>
<p>
The only agency which can conduct intelligence activities (at least according to publicly disclosed intellience documents or charters...see  <a href="nsa.htm">NSA</a>) is the Federal Bureau of Investigation (<a href="fbi.htm">FBI</a>).  The individual military intelligence groups may cooperate with the FBI to catch spys in their areas of control, but only the FBI can actually conduct surveillance and make arrests on their own.  In practice though, it is probably more accurate to say that the FBI is involved in all surveillances and arrests, whereas the military intelligence groups are legally bound to coordinate with the FBI.  The only other exception is the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) who may conduct drug related surveillance on their own.  And of course city, county and state police may conduct their own surveillance as necessary.
<p>
Intelligence in  the U.S. is controlled by the Executive Branch,  with the President acting on guidance from the Director of Central Intelligence and the Department of Defense.  Presidential directives establish the high level goals of the U.S. Intelligence Community, and organizations authorized by the President then define the <a href="collecti.htm">collection</a>, <a href="analysis.htm">analysis</a> ,  and interpretation  of intelligence data, and control the content and dissemination of the end <a href="product.htm">"product"</a> of intelligence gathering.
<p>
<p>
<a href="inttop.htm"><img src="morinttp.gif"></a>
<p>
<h2>Intelligence Activities Outside the U.S.</h2>
<p>
Outside the U.S., the CIA coordinates all intelligence activity.  This includes both operations as well as production of intelligence reports and analysis.  The authority for this comes from the Intelligence Act of 1947, portions of which still remain classified (specifically the charter and authority of the <a href= "nsa.htm">NSA</a> ).  The <a href="cia.htm">CIA</a> (through the USAF and the USN) controls the assets used for technial collection of intelligence, i.e.  <ahref="ovrhead.htm">overhead surveillance</a>  devices such as  <a href="aircraft.htm">aircraft</a> , ground facilities, and <a href= "ussats.htm">satellites</a> .
<p>
In short the agencies concerned with activity outside the U.S. are:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/milnet/cia.htm">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA)
<li><a href="/milnet/nro.htm">National Reconaissance Office</a> (NRO)
<li><a href="/milnet/nsa.htm">National Security Agency</a> (NSA)
<li>Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)
<li>Defense Mapping Agency (DMA)
<li>Armed Forces Medical Information Center (AFMIC)
<li>Other Armed Forces Intelligence Agencies
<ul>
<li>Navy Intelligence
<li>Air Force Intelligence
<li>Army Intelligence
<li>Specified Command Intelligence
          *   <a href="spacecom.htm">USSPACECOM</a>  
</ul>
</ul>      
<p>
<a name="military">
<h2>Military Intelligence</h2>
<p>
The major branches of the military have their own intelligence agencies, all reporting to the Pentagon via the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA).  The military agencies remain in the U.S. because of the ever increasing need for intelligence on the technologies of each of the service areas, i.e. the Navy needs up-to-date intelligence on the submarine technology of our adversaries, the Air Forces concentrates on aircraft and space vehicles.  The military agencies are:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Office of Naval Intelligence (ONI) reporting to the Director of Naval Intelligence
<li>Air Force Intelligence Agency (AFIA) reporting  to the Assistant Chief of Staff - Intelligence
<li>Army Intelligence Agency (AIA) & Intelligence and Security Command (INSCOM) reporting to the Deputy Chief of Staff - Intelligence
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Other Issues</h2>
<p>
One of the attributes of a free society such as that in the United States of America, is the right to access to public information as well as information required by the U.S. Congress in order to fulfill its role in overseeing the activities of the Intelligence Community.  Under the <a href="fia.htm">Freedom of Information Act </a> , U.S. citizens can apply for disclosure of documents held by the government that pertain to themselves or various other reasons.

<title>MILNET:  Military Information - Overhead Reconnaissance</title><P>

<p>
<p><H1>Overhead Reconnaissance</H1>
<P></center>
Overhead reconnaissance provides a new "high ground" for military 
intelligence.  In fact every asset placed in space by the military 
serves a number of differing roles, not excluding useful and timely 
peaceful uses as well.  Overhead Reconnaissance is nothing more than 
another means for intelligence  collection .  There are two types of 
overhead reconnaissance, that performed by surveillance <a href="/milnet/recair.htm">aircraft</a> such 
as the  <a href="#sr71">SR-71</a> (retired and rehired), the TR-1  (<a href="#u2">U-2</a>), the  <a href="#rc135">RC-135</a> (with the versions sporting side looking narrow apeture radar such as Joint STARS), 
the  <a href="#f117">F-117</a> (with its ability to sneak in undetected)  and that performed by Satellites.   
<p>
<B><H2>Satellite Reconnaissance</H2>
</B>Satellite reconnaissance is a "modern" method for intelligence 
collection.  From space, high overhead, the satellite can peer down with 
cameras, and with modern resolution, make out remarkable details.  So 
efficient is this technique, that the major powers are said to chart 
where suspected recon satellites are orbiting, so that secret 
installation operation, movement of aircraft, ships or troops can be scheduled when these satellites are not overhead.<P>
Because of the incredible capabilities, as well as the highly 
sophisticated nature of satellites used in this role, few real details 
of performance or even operation is available.  Suffice to say that 
orbital physics are fixed, thus the military must use the same 
techniques for launch, tracking, and on-orbit maintenance as for either 
the close orbit or geo-synchronous commercial communications 
satellites.<P>
And of course, one would suspect that film, camera, communications, and 
electronic sensor technology used in military satellites is at the 
leading edge, and most likely exceeds that found in the commercial 
satellite field.  See also  <a href="milsats.htm">U.S. Satellite Summary</a>, and 
<a href="/milnet/sovsats.htm">Soviet Satellites</a>.<P>
<p>
<a name="aircraft">
<B><H2>Aircraft Reconnaissance</H2>
</B>The use of  aircraft  for reconnaissance has a long history, the 
first being that of a Capt. Pizazz who reconoiterred in an aircraft and 
returned to report on troop positionings.  Later that same year, he took 
photographs of enemy troops from the air.<P>
Today, a number of aircraft are used for reconaissance.  To limit the 
discussion, we will not provide details on the various ECM, EM, and 
other ELINT aircraft, instead we will concentrate on four representative 
types of aircraft, the  SR-71  (high speed, high altitude), the  U-2/TR-
1  (low speed, high altitude), the lower altitude  RC-135  (Electronic 
eavesdropping), and stealth (viturally undectable future aircraft).<P>
the  <a href="#f117">F-117</a> (with its ability to sneak in undetected)  and that performed by Satellites.   
<p>
<a name="sr71">
<h3>SR-71</h3>
The SR-71 was the fastest aircraft in the world when retired in June of 
1990 (and in 1995 reported to have been reinstated if in a somewhat limited
role), and today still holds most speed and altitude records.  The 
aircraft is so unique, that only its ancestors the YF-12 and the A-12 
reside in the same class of aircraft.  At greater than Mach 3, and 
higher than 85,000 feet, the SR-71 was a formidable reconaissance 
platform.  And unlike satellites, the SR-71 could be on target in two 
days under normal circumstances, or significantly sooner if required.  
And of course the coverage pattern of the SR-71 (and for that matter its 
cousin the U-2) is far more flexible than a satellite.  With its 
"blazing" speed, the SR-71 was also extremely hard to attack 
successfully, and in its 30 year history, it was never shot down.  Just 
recently, Air Force Magazine reported that the SR-71 was again being 
pressed into service...a total of 3 aircraft being placed in service as 
recon platforms.  This would tend to dispell the rumors of a hyperspace 
plane as a replacement or could simply be disinformation.<P>
In any case, the SR-71 was used to take photographs and of course 
carried a variety of other sensors.<P>
<p>
<a name="u2">
<h3>U-2</h3>
The U-2, also a high flyer, is subsonic, and thus is much more 
vulnerable to surface-to-air missiles.  In fact, in its history, the U-2 
has been shot down at least twice that we know of (Francis Gary Powers 
over the Soviet Union, and another shot down over Cuba during the most 
tension filled days of the Cuban Crisis).<P>
The  TR-1  and its predecessor the U-2 are capable of carrying just 
about any kind of recon payload above 80,000 feet, and they have been in 
operation since the early fifties.  In fact the SR-71 was designed to be 
a follow on as it was felt the U-2 had a useful life of only three years 
(due to the prediction of the discovery, and the subsequent design of 
weaponry to bring the aircraft down).<P>
<p>
<a name="rc135">
<h3>RC-135</h3>
The  RC-135  is essentially an ELINT bird, designed to eavesdrop on 
their target's electronic emmanations.  The aircraft bristle with 
receiving attenna of many various types, and some even carry side cheeks 
such as that used for Side Looking Apeture Radar, used to peer over a 
border deep inside the target area without encroaching into the target 
country's airspace.  Another derivative of the RC-135 called Joint Stars 
is also useable as remote targeting sensor, allowing battlefield 
commanders to get relays of details of targets over the horizon.  This 
of course increases the desirability of the RC-135s as targets, and any 
other RC-135s which may be mistaken as a Joint Stars aircraft.<P>
<p>
<a name="f117">
<h3>F-117</h3>
The fourth type of reconaissance aircraft is likened to the  F-117   
Stealth Fighter.  Since this aircraft has just recently been publicized, 
no details of its mission are available.  But it is clear that a 
stealthy aircraft like the F-117 has great advantages when used in the 
aerial recon role.  To be able to "sneak-up" and be virtually undetected 
allows for a near perfect reconaissance aircraft.  If the stealth 
implementation is good enough, acquisition by attacking aircraft or 
surface-to-air missiles radar is extremely difficult.  So even if the 
aircraft is detected, unless the guiding radar (from the ground or from 
the air) can continue to lock on and guide the attacking craft directly 
to the stealth aircraft, it may slip away.  Moreover, at night, visual 
acquisition would be near to impossible, and a bad lock-on would make 
the aircraft impossible to shoot down.   <P>
Of course the  F-117  is proported to be a sub-sonic aircraft, so once a 
lock-on occurs or visual contact is made, it would most likely be a 
sitting duck.  In any case, the possibilities are tremendous.  Also note 
That in 1986, there was to have been designed the Covert Survivable In-
weather Recon/Strike (CSIRS) aircraft (according to the <a href="biblio.htm#spyplanes">ARCO Illustrated 
Guide to Spy Planes</a>).  Other reports have indicated the concept had lost 
funding.  Perhaps another aircraft similar in function could have 
replaced it.  Certainly, with the nearly untouchable  SR-71 out of 
service, there may a gaping hole left in the Strategic Reconaissance 
role.<P>

From the official U.S. Goverment N.R.O Web Page, at

<p>
<dl><dd>
<i>"The existence of the NRO was declassified by the Deputy Secretary of 
Defense, as recommended by the Director of Central Intelligence, 
on September 18, 1992."
</i>
</dl></dl>
<p>
According to Richelson, in <B><I><a href="/milnet/biblio.htm#usintel">
The U.S. Intelligence 
Community</a></B></I>, <B>1</B> the NRO was proposed on August 25, 1960 in a 
meeting between President Eisenhower and representatives of an ad hoc 
group he had appointed to study what should be done with reconaissance 
gleaned from the new DISCOVERER satellites and the full time 
intelligence follow on program code named CORONA.  This group consisted 
of the Under Secretary of the Air Force Joseph Charyk, Deputy Director 
of Defense Research and Engineering John H. Rubel, and Dr. George B. 
Kistiakowsky, the President's Science Advisor, who was also a member of 
the team who had worked on problems getting the DISCOVERER intelligence 
experiments functioning as well as helping to resolve difficulties on 
the SAMOS project, the Air Forces's radio relay satellite program.<P>
There was a lot of pressure to move the SAMOS program into the hands of 
the CIA, and this concept spread to the care and feeding of the CORONA 
satellite program.  Eisenhower needed little to convince him to provide 
a clear military responsibility for the satellite programs and a 
Secretary of the Air Force Order (Order 115.1) created the Office of 
Missile and Satellite Systems (OMSS) within the Office of the Secratary 
of the Air Force, on August 31, 1960.  This became the cover for the 
NRO.  Its primary responsibility was "assisting the Secretary in                                                                                        
discharging his responsibility for the                                                                                                  
direction, supervision, and control of the SAMOS project."  General 
Robert E. Greer was named Director of the SAMOS Project and under Order 
116.1 he was directly responsible to the Secretary of the Air Force.<P>
Later the OMSS became the Office of Space Systems, and the Office of the 
Director of the SAMOS Project became the Office of Special Projects.<P>
According to Richelson, the NRO remains a "black" or secret office and 
only two occurances of public disclosure of it have occurred, once in an 
accidental disclosure in a Senate Committee hearing in 1973, the other 
in Marchetti and Mark's <a href="/milnet/biblio.htm#ciacult">
The CIA and the Cult of Intelligence</a>. 
<B>2</B><P>.  (Note:  Richelson's work was released prior to the announcement
cited at the beginning of the page, i.e. that the NRO was declassified.  The
student of such matters might also note that Richelson never disclosed the
name of the program that provided the budget to the NRO, the NRP - National Reconnaissance Program, as either he didn't know of its existence, or his knowlege
was at the time classified).
<p>

Richelson also comments that an article in the Washington Post appeared 
a few months after the Senate Committee leak.<P>
In <a href="/milnet/biblio.htm#usintel">The U.S. Intelligence Community</a>, Richelson states that the NRO is 
referenced in the Department of Defense Annual Report as being charged 
with "...the collection of specialized foreign intelligence through 
reconnaissance programs", as well as cites the Murphy Commission as 
refering to the NRO as a "...semi-autonomous office within the Defense 
Department with the largest budget of any intelligence agency and that 
operates overhead reconnaissance programs for the entire intelligence commmunity."<b>1</B><P>
In <b><i><a href="/milnet/biblio.htm#secreteyes">America's Secret Eyes in Space</a></i></b><B> 3</B> , Richelson reports that one 
of the concerns that led to the formation of the NRO was the fact that 
the Air Force had already made up plans for the Strategic Air Command to 
operate and control the SAMOS project.  As it turns out (again according to Richelson), the Air Force 
role remains very large, and the Under Secretary of Air Force is the 
Director of the NRO.  This dual role is often referred to (referring to a busy manager's role of "wearing more than one hat") as "wearing 
the black hat".<P>
<p>
(Note:  At the time this page was originally written for the MILNET project,
speculation was that Richelson's information was right on the nose.  However,
attempts to verify were coldly refused, and only since September 1992 have 
we been able to see Richelson's excellent (if not illegal) information 
was correct).

The Chinese Navy fields a number of impressive ships, including a few but frightening 
nuclear submarines.  The Chinese had commissioned a Varyag (originally the Soviet Riga 
Class) aircraft carrier.  rumor has it now that the Chinese are trying to buy a Kiev class 
aircraft carrier, capable of launching VTOL jets &amp  helicopters, and cruise 
missiles.<P>

<h1>Chinese Army</h1>
</center>
Note:  China Military information dried up in the 1985 timeframe.  Subsequently, the "massacre in Tinimen Square" served to 
further isolate China from the western world, and little verifiable data has been available, and what data appears in public form 
appears to be quite similar to verified data in 1983 and thus shows little or no growth.  This can hardly be the correct 
information, and is most likley dressed up figures from the past.  We will endeavor to update this data as possible.<P>
From 1982 to 1983, the Chinese Army grew 11.7%, leaving no doubt as their continued path of growth.  With this arms growth 
has come a parallel growth in offers to other countries ot excess <P>
Chinese production overflows, a production geared to make Chinese allies some of the most well armed in the World.  <P>
Looking at the Chinese Army can be frightening.  In 1983 the ground forces topped 3.1 million in uniform, consisting of the 
"main forces" in 11 military regions, and the "local forces" contained in some 29 provinces (which at that time was under 
reorganization).  The main battle forces in 1983 were deployed in some 8 regions of China (North-East; North; North-West; 
West; South-West; South; Center; and East; These forces maintain the following arms:<P>
<B>AFV:</B>  11,450 units conisting of Sov IS-2; heavy  and T-54 tanks used for training (could easily be armed at any 
time); Chinese type 59 and T-69 (modified T-59) main battle tanks; Type -62 light and TYpe-60/63 light amphibious tanks; 
2,800 type 531, Type-55/56 (BTR-40/-156) and -63 APC.<P>
<B>ARTY:</B>  13,800 including type-56 85mm field antitank pieces; 100mm, Type-60 122mm; type-59 130mm towed; ISU-
122/-152 Self propelled guns (thought to be training);Type-66 152mm towed howitzer; Type-54 122mm and Type--56 152mm

<H1>Israel</H1>
<p>
Note:  At the conclusion of the Gulf War, Israel was left with a number of
complete Patriot Missile batteries sans expended rounds.  Very soon after the war ended,
Israel ordered yet more Patriot batteries.  It is assumed that this purchase was in addition to the 
replenishment of those complete launch facilities thought left behind.
<p>
Israel was founded on May 14, 1948 after many years of struggle 
between all arabs and jews who populated the palestinian areas.  This 
ended the British caretaker role in the region, precipitated by the U.N. 
General Assembly's partitioning of the area into Jewish and Arab states.  
See also Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq-Kuwait, 
MidEast: Pro-West, Operation Desert Shield, and Operation Desert 
Storm.<P>
	Immediately, the Arab states rejected the partitioning and invaded 
Israel.  Israel weathered the attacks and by 1948 had actually gained 
some land as part of the fighting.  Separate armistices were signed 
between Israel and other Arab states in 1949.  No real peace agreement 
with the Arab states nor autonomy for the Palestinians was reached 
however, and strife continued.<P>
	Finally, after numerous and persistent terrorist raids by arabs, 
Israel invaded Eygpt's Sanai Desert on October 29, 1956.  British and 
French forces aided Israel briefly.  A United Nations cease fire was 
agreed upon on November 6, beginning a shaky truce which only lasted 
until Egypt's President Nasser demanded the U.N. Emergency Force on May 
19, 1967.  Egyptian forces immediately reoccupied the Gaza Strip and 
closed the Gulf of Aqaba to Israeli shipping.  <P>
	On June 5, the Israelis struck back in the 6 days war, retaking 
the Gaza strip,  as well as the area on the Sinai Peninsula to the Suez 
Canal, and captured Old Jerusalem, Syria's Golen Heights, and Jordan's 
West Bank.  Another U.N. arranged cease fire occured on June 10, 
1967.<P>
	Egypt and Syria once again attacked Israel on October 6, 1973 on 
the Jewish Yom Kippur holiday, and were supplied by massive Soviet 
airlifts of material.  Responding to the secret Soviet aid to the Arabs, 
the U.S. added airlift to Israel, and the Israeli's drove across the 
Suez Canal.  <P>
	Again a cease fire was arranged on October 24, and a U.N. peace-
keeping force was left in the area.  Beginning on January 18, 1974, the 
Israeli's withdrew from the Suez Canal's West Bank, and by 1976 all 
troops had withdrawn from all areas except the Sinai.  In 1982, Israel 
returned the Sinai to Egypt.<P>
	Over the next two years Palestinian terrorists killed scores of 
Israeli's throughout the world.  <P>
	In March of 1978 Israel invaded the southern portion of Lebanon 
following a terrorist attack by Palestinians based in Lebanon.  Israel 
then withdrew in favor of a 6,000 man U.N. force.<P>
	Israel again invaded and occupied southern Lebanon in retaliation 
to a Palestinian raid on a kibuttz in April of 1980.  Israel maintained 
troops in Lebanon in the Beirut-Ahle area and Israeli jets bombed 
Palestine Liberation Organization strongholds in Lebanon in April and 
May of 1982.  Once again, on June 6, Israeli aircraft attacked PLO 
strongholds in Lebanon.<P>
	Israeli and Syrian forces engaged in battle in the Bekka Valley on 
June 9,and a quick truce was agreed upon.  Israeli forces then 
surrounded Beirut on June 14 and began massive bombings of Beirut.  
Finally the PLO agreed to evacuate the city.<P>
	While holding the city, Lebanese Christian forces swept into 
Palestinian refugee camps and killed hundreds.  Israeli troops withdrew 
from Lebanon in June of 1986.<P>
	All through the eighties, West Bank and Gaza Strip Palestinians 
became more and more militant with both Jews and Palestinians suffering 
death.  This struggle continues today.<P>
	On January 17th, 1991, Iraq launched SCUD missiles into Israel in 
retailiation for the Coalition attack on Iraq.  This attack on Iraq was 
in response to the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait, and had 
nothing to do with Israeli's despite Iraq President Suddam Hussein's 
claim that he was attacking Kuwait for all the Palestinians.  Israel was 
not part of the Coalition, and after some intense diplomacy with the 
U.S. agreed not to retalitate "at this time".  Several SCUD attacks 
occurred during the period January 17 through February 28th, but Israel 
retained a "cool head" and did not enter the war.  <P>
	Speculation has been that if Iraq had sent SCUDs or artillery 
shells armed with chemical weapons, there would have been no stopping 
Israel, and it is rumored that the Israeli's would have used their most 
dangerous weapons of mass destruction, nuclear weapons.<P>
Note:  8/93:  Israel is reported to either have already built nuclear 
weapons, or at least has the means to quickly assemble and field them.  
The effect of this development is that other Middle Eastern countries 
who fear Israel (Arab Nations naturally), are expected to develop their 
own nuclear weapons.  Moderate Arab Nations such as Saudia Arabia or 
Egypt are not thought to be threats, but other countries such as Iraq, 
Iran, and Syria are of major concern.  See  Nuclear Armed  for more 
information.

it here, however, as a measure of the forces available at that time.

<H1>Saudi Arabia </H1>
<p>
This large mid-Eastern country enjoys the benefit of many years of 
arms accumulation encompassing purchases from both pro-western sellers 
as well as pro-soviet.  The Saudi (male only) is concripted into the 
military between the ages of 18 to 35, with a total in arms of 
approximately 51,500 (.429 % of their 12 million population). 
<p>
It should be noted that at the conclusion of the Gulf War, much of the 
allied armor and other heavy equipment was left in the region.  It is 
expected that a goodly number of main battle tanks, artillery, and other
major war waging weapons were sold in place to Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and/or Kuwait
probably in turn for secret supplies of oil or other concessions.  This 
information is based upon speculation, however, tonnage coming home 
greatly mismatched that one would expect from spent munitions and supplies.
<P>
<B>Total Armed Forces: </B> 51,500<P>
<B>Total defense budget( 1983)</B>:  $22 billion out of a $153 billion

<H1>Egypt </H1>
<p>
Note:  Large amounts of heavy equipment such as main battle tanks, artillery, etc. are presumed to have been left behind at the conclusion of the Gulf War.  Some of this material would naturally be "owned" by the U.S. as prepositioned
war goods, however, it is also thought that a substantial percentage of equipment was sold on the spot to Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and/or Kuwait.
<p>
One of the larger and more powerful Arab Nations, Egypt tends to be a 
major leader in the Middle East, and when Anwar Sadat made peace 
overtures to Israel, it marked a major turning point in the history of 
the Middle East.  Unfortunately, Sadat paid with his life, a terrorist 
bomb killing him during a military parade and review.  Since his death, 
unrest throught the arab nations and incursions into Israel have 
continued.<P>

<H1>Kuwait</H1>
<p>
This small country is perched east of Iraq, and Northeast from Saudi 
Arabia, Oman and Yemen.  Kuwait has a large number of ports on the 
Persian Gulf, and supplies a large number of oil terminals to tankers 
using the Persian Gulf.  Kuwait was ruled by the Al-Sabah dynasty since 
1759.  British rule lasted from 1899 until Kuwati indepence in 1961.  
<p>
The majority of the population **1  are non-Kuwati, and are Palestinian.  
Non-Kuwatis may not vote.  Oil revenues are the chief economy factor of 
the country, and the government provides free medical care, education, 
and social security.  There are no taxes other than customs duties.  
During the  Iraq-Iran  war, Kuwati tankers came under fire by the 
Iranians due to Kuwait's support of Iraq .  In order to gain help in 
transversing the Gulf, Kuwati oil tankers were re-flagged as U.S. 
tankers, and then protectedby U.S., French, and British warships. <P>
<p>
**1 NOTE:  It has been pointed out that our statement on population may
be in error... here is the <a href="/milnet/kuwpop.htm">context</a> of that correction.
<p>

	After the Iraq-Iran war ended and after Iraq's war debt from loans 
granted by Kuwait became too large and cumbersome, Iraq simply refused 
to pay.  Kuwati sought help from the International World Bank, and as 
the Kuwati demands increased, so did the Iraqi anger over the spot Iraq 
was in.  This conflict was a major factor in the invasion of Kuwait by 
Iraq on August 2nd, 1990.  The result was the Gulf War, known by the 
allied code names Operation Desert Shield, and Operation Desert 
Storm.<P>
	After the Gulf War, much of the equipment left in Kuwait was left 
as pre-positioned units.  Some were sold to the Kuwaiti government in 
return for certain oil rights (undisclosed).<P>

<H1>Iraq</H1>
<p>
The Iraqi military forces are supplied with recently modern weaponry 
from the Soviet Union as well as their brother arabs.  Most impressive 
is their mass of Russian T-54, T-55, T-62, and and T-72 tanks.  Other 
threats are the  SCUD-B  Missiles that Iraq possess, along with chemical 
weapons (which Iraq has not hesitated to use in the past), and a small 
possibility of a few nuclear weapons
.<P>
See also  Statistics ,   Iraq-Kuwait  conflict,  Operation Desert Shield  
and  Operation Desert Storm .
<P>
<P>
The Iraqi  Air Force  is not considered to be much of a military threat 
while their Army is well seasoned and fresh from the Iran-Iraq war.  
Note that after the invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent war between 
Iraq and the U.S. led Coalition, Iraq's fighting forces were reduced 
dramatically.  
<P>
<B>NOTE:</B>    After the conclusion of Operation Desert Storm, the
number of Iraqi tanks  appears to half been halved.  This as a result of
both the air war and the destruction in the less than two weeks of
ground fighting.  It appears that the Soviet technique used by the
Iraqis to dig their tanks in only showing the turret, was a primary
cause of the loss of a number of tanks.  U.S. volitle fuel-air weapons
tended to work quite well at blowing the tops of the tanks off, and when
the U.S. tanks streamed around the front lines from the West, the buried
tanks were not able to dig out and move quickly, thus defeating their
purpose as a highly mobile high caliber gun.  <P>
Note also that the U.S. strategy to attack from the West ensured that
when the Iraqis made to withdraw East and North back into Iran, they had
to pass through well positioned and flexible Coalition lines.  Since
U.S. policy at the time would not allow combat units to pass, this in
effect prohibited any of the Iranian fighting equipment to return to
Iran.  This effectively destroyed 50% of the Iranian ground forces,
ending Iran's domination of the region in terms of military strength.<P>
With all the Iraqi chemical and biological facilities in ruin Iraq's
weapons of mass destruction were those limited to those on hand in
protected regions of Iraq, and any remaining SCUD missiles in the Iraqi
inventory.  <P>
Also, during the war, many Iraqi aircraft were, rather than be destroyed on the ground, flown out of Iraq to Iran.  After the war, the U.S. forbid the return of these aircraft, ultimately giving Iran a much needed boost in modern aircraft.  The irony is that Iran has absolutely no spare parts or knowlege of how to maintain the aircraft and at last estimate, few are flyable and most likley beyond major repair.

<H1>Jordan (data from 12/84)</H1>
</center>
The British 1922 mandate included the lands now called Jordon.  In 1921, Abdullah the son of the ruler of Hejaz in Arabia was 
installed by Britain as the emir of an autonomous Transjordan, coering two-thirds of Palestine.  An independent kingdom was 
proclaimed in 1946.  <BR>
	The West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem were added to the kingdom in 1948 as part of land grabs at the end of 
the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 and this new country became Jordan.<BR>
	In the 1967 Yom Kippur war, all these lands added were taken back by  Israel  and Jordon became a site for 
Palestinian refugees.<BR>
	During the weeks before the  Iraq-Kuwait  War, refugees once again streamed into Jordon, fleeing the oppressive 
rule of Suddam Hussein of Iraq.  Finally Jordon had to close her borders as there was no room in the refugee camps.  Later in 
the war, King Hussien of Jordon threw his verbal support to Iraq, and this mistake will undoubtedly not bode well for Jordan in 
the resolution of the Middle East conflicts in the years to come.  See also  Statistics  and  MidEast: Pro-Soviet .<P>

<H1>Lebanon</H1>
</center>

Lebanon is located along the eastern coast of the Mediterannean, north of Israel.  The city of Beirut, once a beautiful tourist 
attraction with wide, beautiful beaches, is now a burned out shell, with gun fights erupting daily between the various factions of 
Christian, Kurdish, and Muslim factions.  The southern parts of the country serves as staging areas for various anti-Israel 
factions incursions into Israeli territory.  The U.S. has a bloody history in Lebanon, when as part of U.N. and unilateral  efforts 
to stem the incursions into Israel and support a more favorable Leganese government, 103 marines were killed in a truck bomb 
attack on their barracks.  A similar attack on the U.S. embassy also killed many Americans, and the U.S. pulled out.  Not after, 
however, retalitating by pounding the city of Beirut and the hillsides with shells from the U.S. Missouri's huge guns.<P>

<H1>Libya</H1>
</center>
<P>
Libya is poised at the northern edge of North Africia, and is situated just across the Mediterranean Sea from Italy, Sicily and 
Greece.  It is almost as large as Saudi Arabia and has a population of around 3.5 million people.<P>
Libya is ruled by Mohamar Quaddafi (spelling disputed), a charismatic leader who has brought the many moslem tribes together in his country, rules with 
an iron hand, but remains the people's hero.  A seemingly devout Moslem, he appears to be a firm believer in the Jihad, the holy war against infidels, with the Western Nations being his nemesis.
<p>
In the middle of Ronald Reagan's administration, the U.S. accussed Libya of fostering terrorism.  U.S. warships entered the Gulf of Sidra to provoke Quaddafi, 
who obliged by sending out aircraft, which were promptly outclassed and shot 
down.  
<p>
When a the frequent hangout for
U.S. Servicemen was bombed, killing several U.S. servicemen, the U.S. released information linking Libya to the 
group claiming responsibility, and arranged for a retalitory strike.
<p>
F-111 fighter bombers originating in the U.K. and refueled in route, bombed 
a barracks where Quaddaffi and his staff were purported to be, as well as key
command and control emplacements.  Quaddafi was not hurt and continues today
a bit more empowered than before due to his survival.
<p>
However, Libya's ties with terrorism and indeed the Libyan rhetoric has 
completely vanished from public view.  The only public view of Quaddafi since
the U.S. attack, was his appearance with Suddam Hussien during the Gulf War where
he pledged (but never delivered) to support Iraq against the U.S. led U.N.
coalition.  Below we list the forces estimated in Libya in 1984, much of which 
remains the same today except where noted:

<BR>
Syria is located just North of Jordon, within striking range of the major oil fields in the Middle East.  Syria has close ties to most 
of the pro-Soviet nations in the Middle East, and next to Iraq (previsu to the Gulf War), could be clasiffied as a major threat to 
the region in terms of military strength and politics.<BR>
	Syria shares borders with Israel, Lebanon, and Jordon, and is a known sanctuary for muslim fundamentalist terrorist 
groups.  PLO, PLFC, and other groups have both training camps and staging areas in Syria, and Israel is in a constant 
struggle to keep her common border clear.<P>

<h1>Japan</h1>
</center>
<hr>


An island of some 123 million inhabitants, Japan  is a major link in the strategic control of the eastern shores of the Soviet Union.   With U.S. bases at a number of choke points, and the 245,000 strong Japan Defense Forces, the island nation provides the U.S. with the ability to control the seasoff the Soviet Union if it becomes necessary.
<p>
The U.S. protection is part of a treaty signed in 1960, which on one hand limited the number of Japanese forces allowable after World War II, as well as defines the comittment the U.S. makes.  
<p>
But in order to aid the U.S. in the coverage of this strategic area in the Pacific, Japan has slowly been growing the Japan Defense Forces.
<p>
<img src="/milnet/note!sm.gif" align=middle>
The data below was verified in 1985.  Obviously it is obsolete.  We include
it here, however, as a measure of the forces available at that time.
We will endeavor to update that information as soon as we can given our
other goals for MILNET.
<p>

The Japanese Self Defense Forces are divided into three uniformed services
<p>
<ul>
<li>Air Self Defense Force (<a href="/milnet/asdf.htm">ASDF</a>)
<li>Marine Self Defense Force (<a href="/milnet/msdf.htm">MSDF</a>)
<li>Ground Self Defense Force (<a href="/milnet/gsdf.htm">GSDF</a>)
</ul>
<p>
Note:  Since the breakup of the Soviet Union, Japan's strategic role is somewhat lessened in the eyes of the U.S., and may effect U.S. funding.

Taiwan
The country of Taiwan is a small set of islands off the coast of mainland China.  The Republic of China (ROC) as Taiwan was officially known until the 
mid-1990s, was formed by refugees from the Communist regime in mainland China.  
Since its formation, the small island chain has been a place of refuge from 
those fleeing from China, and a stepping stone to the western world.

<p>
Economically, Taiwan ranks second behind Japan in the Pacific Rim for its export
of electronic goods.  A major electronics player in the U.S., Taiwan continues 
to produce average quality goods at an excellent price, due to its extremely 
low labor costs.  Unlike Japan, the average citizen has not grown to enjoy 
expensive western culture, and the infrastructure of the country has not 
fostered the high cost of goods found in Japan.  For these reasons, Taiwan 
has the opportunity to overtake the Japanese as the economic leader in the 
Pacific Rim.
<p>
The Taiwan govenment maintains a small naval force which is primarily used to 
patrol the waters between her shores and that of Mainland China.  Any attack 
by the mainland China forces would quickly overwhelm Taiwan however.

<h1>North Korean Incursion Into South Korea</h1>
<p>
Mid way thorugh the year in 1950, a small contingent of U.S. troops in South 
Korea reported alarming movements of North Korean forces near the line 
separating the two countries.  A failure to respond to these movements by 
U.N. and specifically U.S. forces stationed in South Korea (primarily a higher
echelon failing, certiainly not on the part of ground commanders), resulted in
the North Korean invasion of South Korea taking place without plenty of 
resistance, but with little force to stop them.
<p>
However, in a weeks time, the U.N. (specifically U.S.) forces began to
arrive in nearly sufficient numbers as to build a front.  By August of
1950, U.S. Air Commandos were dropping supplies for friendly agents into North Korea
in an effort to build intelligence networks to combat the invading rush.
<p>
U.S. Armored Divisions began to move, and by the end of August, a fully operational
war front was established.
<p>
The resolution of the war was a return to status quo, with both North and South
Korea once again respecting their separating line.  Today, the two countries
remain divided, with saber rattling and an occasional border incident keeping
the two nations at each other's throats diplomatically.  
<p>
One of the most alarming events in the recent past has been the North 
Korean refusal to observe the tenants of the Non-Proliferation Treaty, thus
acting as if they were going to begin production of nuclear weapons.  While 
the noise on this subject has died down, it is clear there is a major desire
for the North Koreans to move into the fraternity of nuclear nations, and 
thus presents a new class of problems to both South Korea, and its chief 
guardian, the United States.

<H1>MILNET: Okalhoma City Federal Building Bombing</h1>
</center>
A synopsis of the event:
<dl>
<dt>It appears that one Terry McVey, a radical anti-government "militia"  
member, built a bomb constructed of fertilizer and certain other components,
set the large device in the back of a pickup truck, then parked this 
truck along the sidewalk next to the Federal Building in downtown Oklahoma
City.  
<p>
In the morning hours on April 29, 1995, the device exploded, killing hundreds 
of Federal
employees and a distressing number of children in the on site daycare center.  
The blast was so large that
one entire side of the building collapsed, making the building look as if a
giant monster had taken a bite out of 1/3, slicing through all the floors of the
building.
<p>
The blast occurred on April 19, 1995, the anniversary date of the
"<a href="uschron.htm#Waco">Waco Massacre</a>", a rallying event for 
anti-government 
radicals concerned with the abridgement of the right to bear arms.

<h1>A U.S. Terrorism Chronology</h1>
<p>
<a name="UnivBar"><B>Berkeley Bar</a>, Berkeley California:  Violence using Terror</B><P>
In the summer of 1992, a deranged student of Middle East descent, took hostages in a popular University bar.  The hostages 
consisted of college students, male and female.  The hostage taker killed two students and injured several others before being 
shot by Berkely SWAT teams.<P>
<P>
Several young woman were forced to perform sexual acts during the 9 hours of captivity, with their peers being forced to look 
on.  The trauma for all hostages was thus fear for their lifes, witnessing rape, and the helplessness to aid their peers during 
the crisis.<P>
<P>
The effect upon the community was severe, as all college students, teachers, and parents in the area easily identified with the 
hostages and their plight.  Counseling was even advertised as a public service for those who felt they had been traumitized by 
the extraordinary media coverage of the event.<P>
<P>
While the motivation for the crime was bitterness over an unhappy life in the U.S., very little political motivation was cited.  This 
example is more a case of terror tactics in the increasing violence in our country.
<p>
<B><a name="oriental">The Oriental Boys, 3/3/91, Sacramento, California: Violence using 
Terror</B><p>
4 gunmen of oriental descent, walked into "The Good Guys" consumer electronics store in Sacremento, California, in the 
late afternoon, March 3, 1991, taking 13 hostages.  A long day of negotiation occurred as Sacramento County Sherriffs 
Emergency Negotiation Team (SCENT) tried to work with the terrorists.  Meanwhile, Sacramento Police SWAT team 
members snuck through the rafters to a room in the back of the store, and waited for the word to rush the gunmen.  Finally, 
right after dusk, the gunmen ran out of patience as negotiations began to fail, and began demanding bullet proof vests.  As a second vest was laid out and a young female hostage was sent out to bring it in (while being tied and controlled by a "leash" made of speaker wire), a SWAT sharpshooter tried to shoot the gunmen through a plate glass window, but missed.  
<p>
The gunmen then opened 
fire on the hostages killing three.  The SWAT team rushed from the room in the back killing three of the 4 gunmen.  The fourth 
recovered from his wounds and will be held for trial.  3 Hostages were killed by the gunmen's gunfire, and a like number were 
seriously wounded.<P>
	Several of the hostages were very outspoken about the poor negotiations, and the lack of responsiveness to the gunmen's 
demands, citing their lives were at stake yet it took 24 hours for two bullet proof vests to be sent in per the gunmen's request.  
Also cited was the lack of good strategy to shoot only one gunmen from the front of the store, rather than a more effective 
means of rushing the gunmen.<P>
<P>
Later information noted that the SWAT team had been using a fiber optic camera, looking into the store to see where the 
hostages and gunmen were located.  This camera is used by drilling a tiny hole in an adjoining wall or door and then slipping 
the un-observable fiber optic thread into the hole.<P>
<P>
Capt. Walt Atkins of the San Jose SWAT team noted that "if there is an indication that negotiations are not being productive, then 
it may be necessary to use force to end the situation."  This was a possible explanation for the seemingly precipitous actions of 
the Sacramento SWAT team, as several hostages confirmed that the gunmen were out of patience and beginning to discuss 
ways to show they were serious.  One hostage was shot in the thigh and told to go out and tell the police how serious the 
gunmen were.<P>
<P>
The gunmen were reported to be part of  "The Oriental Boys", a ruthless Asian gang known to be in the Sacremento area, and 
to be of SouthEast Asian immigrant origin.  Little details were available.  While this is deemed gang violence rather than 
terrorism, it is clearly an escalation of violence using terror tactics.<P>

<B>New York's World Trade Center:  2/26/93, Car Bombing, Terrorist Act</B><P>
At 12:00 noon, Friday,  February 26, 1993, a bomb exploded in the basement garage underneath tower two of the famous New 
York World Trade Center's twin towers.  The bomb, later to be analyzed as being anywhere from 500-1000 lbs of dynamite (a 
conventional explosive, not C-4 or other plastique explosive), ripped a hole upward into the subway station and offices, and 
downward into a lower level of the parking garage.  The bomb, undoutedly terrorist in origin, was claimed by no less than seven 
different callers after the explosion.  One caller called prior to the explosion giving little warning.  This caller was thought to be 
the bomb planter, and investigation moved from there.<P>
<P>
In terms of effect, the media gave on the spot coverage of the fire crews working in the subway station, but little else.  There 
were no political statements broadcast in reference to the explosion, and while speculation as to who planted the bomb 
abounded, no assignment of responsibility was given officially, thus counteracting any plublicity desired by the bomber.<P>
<P>
The World Trade Center number two tower was shut down for nearly two weeks, with workers allowed to go into safe offices to 
pick up belongings as needed to conduct their business outside the tower offices.  Nearly 50,000 workers were without access 
to their offices, and the shops that catered to the World Trade Center workers saw, not surprisingly, a 50% drop in business 
during the two weeks.<P>
<P>
Physchological impact was felt by all the workers of course, as well as a group of kindergarten students and their teachers and  
chaperons (parents volunteering) on a field trip to the World Trade Center.  Trapped in an elevator for many hours, the 
children were received with some relieve by their anxious parents when they arrived back from the trip that evening on their 
school bus.<P>
<P>
The general consensus is that the bomb was planted by members of one of the factions of the Bosnian/Serv/Croatia conflict, 
since the timing coincided with the beginnings of U.S. humanitarian airdrops of food to the seiged Bosnians.	Both 
Serbs and Croatians were blamed.  Also coincident were the resumption of talks between the warring factions in the United 
Nations, just down the street from the World Trade Center.<P>

<B><a name="Waco">
Koresh Madness:  March 1993, Waco, Texas:  Cult Violence</B><P>
Stephen Howard, alias David Karesh, a self-proclaimed Jesus Christ, and a dissident Seventh Day Adventist, ordered his 
followers to fire on Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms agents as they were moving in to arrest Howard/Karesh.  The Karesh 
followers, using high-powered automatic weapons, shot through closed doors and covered windows killing four ATF agents, 
and wounding several others.  The seige on the Karesh compund lasted for two days, the ATF management deciding to allow 
Karesh to release woman and children from the compound in return for a radio station broadcasting Karesh's religious lectures 
every hour (2 children for every hour of broadcast).  Karesh followers promised to release all woman and children as soon as it 
got dark on March 1, prompting hope that the seige would be over by the next day.<P>
<P>
An interesting sideline to this story is a police seargent who appeared to be totally afraid of this cult, as well as others in the 
town of Waco.<P>
<P>
ATF spokespersons said that the agents' deaths were not due to poor planning or execution of the plan, but rather, due to a 
lack of adequate firearms by the ATF.  "...We were simply out-gunned".  <P>
<P>
Several local police forces in the Bay Area agreed with this statement saying that they too felt this effect.  With drug and gang 
arrests  on the rise, the number of fully automatic weapons that the police capture is astonshing.  Many bay area departments 
have armed their officers with expensive semi-automatic handguns (9mm or .45) which can carry up to 15 rounds, thus 
allowing more rapid fire and more shots than the standard police revolver.  But many departments cannot afford the $400 price 
tag on such handguns, thus the officers are issued .38/.357 Magnum revolvers, and the officers are allowed to purchase and 
qualify with semi-automatic handguns on their own.  One officer quoted as saying, "I bought a vest.  I can't afford the semi-
automatic.  I'll just have to get by with the ole' six shooter."<P>
<p>
The affair finally ended on April 19, 1993 in the deaths of Koresh and all his followers who had remained on site when they set fire to the interior of their compound, burning all the buildings to the ground. (see <a href="mar93.htm#koresh">article on Waco Standoff</a>).  
<p>
The event has later proven to be a catalyst for paramilitary groups, since the initial contact from the ABTF resulted from their insistence that Koresh and his followers held illegal weapons.  Other paramilitary groups see the ABTF actions as representative of the U.S. governments intention to disarm all groups maintaining training and weapons for paramilitary or survival reasons.  This may in fact have been a factor in another horrendous terrorist act in the U.S.

<b>Oklahoma City Federal Building Bombing, March 1, 1995</b>
<p>
In the early morning in April of 1995, a young man drove a truck up to the Federal building in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, and parked near the day care center inside.  Four minutes later, the bomb in the truck exploded, killing over 100 and wounding many others.  After two weeks of searching the rubble, the decimated building was torn down.  Suspected and accussed of the attack is Patrick McViey, a self styled paramilitary radical.  The bomb was constructed of fertilzer and other chemicals, demonstrating quite effectively how the components of a bomb are nearly impossible to control.   
<p>
Also apparent, is the inability of the U.S. government to protect its federal workers, nor its buildings.  In fact the Oklahoma City Federal Building had just passed a routine security review.  
<p>
In the wake of the blast, President Bill Clinton began a campaign to add more intrusive powers to the FBI and other agencies tasked with dealing with terrorism in the U.S.  It is doubtful that the Republican controlled Congress will go along with these efforts however.  Among the measures being pushed is the "Clipper Chip" technology which allows for encrypted messages for communications to be decoded via a special technology built right into the encryption device.  Presumably only the proper law enforcement agencies would have access to the special intrusive technology to decrypt (other than the communicating parties).

<H1>Terrorism:  Legal Aspects</H1>
<p>
The  <A HREF = "tbonnsum.htm">Bonn Summit</A>   in 1978 agreed to sanctions against 
states which aided and abetted the hijacking of aircraft.  In the process of finalizing this 
agreement, the attendees defined terrorism as:<P>
  "Acts of <A HREF = "tdefs2.htm">kidnapping</A>, <A HREF = "tdefs2.htm">hostage</A>-taking, <a href="tdefs2.htm#attacks">bomb</a> attacks on <a href="tdefs2.htm#innocents">innocents</a>, <a href="tdefs2.htm#hijacking">hijacking</a>  ..."<P>
It was also recognized later by the signatories, that <A HREF = 
"tdefs2.htm#assassination">assassination</A>  while being a political tool, also is a form of 
terrorism.  Events in the late 1980s and 1990s would seem to bear this extension out...witness the ability of South American Drug Cartels to dissuade the public from reporting 
their activities by murdering both govenment officials and civilians.<P>
This agreement thus sets the boundaries, at least for those recognizing the World Court, for 
which terrorism can be further legally defined.    See <a href="tleghist.htm">Legal History</a> for more information.<P>
But despite the 1978 interest in definition of terrorism, little direct laws or regulation have come 
from these acts in the U.S.  Other countries, such as German, France and Great Britain, have 
enacted at particular times, laws that temporarily suspended certain aspects of their constitution 
in order to more forcibly enforce existing laws.  <P>
In the case of Germany, the anti-terrorist units were given the rights to search and seizure 
without warrant during a two year time-frame.  It was a well controlled suspension of their 
constitutional law, and was only won due to German citizen's fear and abhorence of the level of 
terrorism in their country.<P>
In Northern Ireland, Great Britain has continued to make use of the Terrorism Act to search and 
seize evidence as well as provide fast tracked sentencing for acts of terrorism.
Recent starts in serious disarmement talks between the United Kingdom and Irish radical groups promises to at least scale down the violence if not stop it all together.  The world is hopeful these talks will produce positive results.<P>
Only recently has the U.S. <U> proposed laws </U> aimed directly at the terrorist.  But during 
the Reagan Administration, terrorism and the countries which sponsored terrorism became a key 
thrust in world affairs.  With the capture of hostages by terrorist groups in Lebanon, the U.S. 
President became, for all practical purposes, obssessed with winning the freedom of those 
hostages by almost any means.  <P>
The public statements at the time centered on a "no negotiation" stance, but in some special 
cases, the administration worked through middle men to offer incentives to some countries who 
might deal directly with the hostage takers.  In the end, only a few terrorists were freed due to 
these efforts, and the disclosure of these actions later nearly brought down the Reagan 
administration.  Certainly a number of key members of the President's team faced serious 
charges of defying Congress, in part due to these activities.<P>
Recent large scale terrorist events in the U.S. have finally brought to fruition, the authors predictions 10 years ago...Terrorism has come to the U.S.
<p>
As each new terrorist event occurs (World Trade Center, Oklahoma Federal Building), government has voiced concerns that more intrusive powers be given the FBI or other agencies.
<p>
Anti-gun radicals also use terrorist activities as a rallying cry for abolishment of handguns and so called "assault-weapons" in the U.S.

<H1>Definitions of Terrorist Acts</H1>

<li><a href="#attacks">Direct Attacks</a>
<li><a href="#hijacking">Hijacking</a>

</ul>
<p><a name="kidnapping">
<H2>Kidnapping</H2>
<P>
Kidnapping has been around for along time.  As in the goals of terrorist kidnappings today, 
kidnapping in the past was a means to extort money out of relatives and friends of the victim.  
The most well known modern kidnapping before terrorism became such a worldwide problem was the 
kidnapping of Charles Lindburgh's child. Perhaps the most well known kidnapping
is the kidnapping of legendary King Arthur, the lionheart, by his brother
Prince Johh.  While this story is in legend, it is most likely (like all legends) built upon cases of kidnapping that occurred in that historical time frame.
<P>
Most kidnapping victims are killed, but the fact that a few hostages have been returned alive 
continues to give the relatives and friends false hope.  Today, kidnapping is a means for 
attracting lots of media attention on the kidnapper's cause.  Again, few victims survive.
<P>
<P>
<H3>The Analysis</H3>
<P>
Kidnapping is not as popular a terrorist act as setting a <a href="#bomb">bomb</a> or <a href="#hijacking">hijackingi</a> an aircraft.  But kidnapping does 
gain as much media attention.  More often than not, the victim is killed, especially when 
governments refuse to bargain with kidnappers.<P>
To demonstrate how often kidnappings occurred would require a great deal of information not 
available to the common researcher due to the fact that relatives and friends of kidnap victims 
who do pay ransoms do not want the fact publicized, and rightly so.  <P>
The U.S. government has a stated policy of not negotiating with terrorists (kidnappers or otherwise), but with
some very well publicized exceptions has shown that the frustration and concern for the welfare
of kidnapped citizens will test the sternest resolve.<P>
In any case the following is a sample of kidnappings from 1968 through 1979.<P>
<P>
<H4>Munich Massacre:  The Most Famous Political 
Kidnapping/Murder</H4>
The most notorious terrorist kidnapping and murder occurred in the early morning ours of 
September 5, 1972.  In retaliation for numerous Israeli attacks across their borders, members of 
the  Black September  group (a faction of the  PLO ), kidnapped members of the Israeli Olympic 
Team from the Olympic Village in Munich, West Germany.  <P>
Despite heroric attempts by some of the team members  a few of the athletes were killed on the 
spot, and several taken hostage.  The West German police, at this time, were not prepared for 
anti-terrorist action, and before the affair was over, 3 people were injured and seven of the 
athletes had been killed along with a few of their kidnappers (who were killed with the hostages 
at Munich Airport), bringing the total dead to 11.   The failure at Munich Airport led to the 
formation of the West German  GSG-9  counter-terrorist unit.<P>
<P>
Within 2 years, Israeli Hit Teams managed to kill all but 2 of the kidnap team and their planners.  
The hit teams were not perfect in their target selection though and at least 1 innocent man was 
mistaken for one of the leaders and killed, ending the hit teams revengeful search.<P>
In 1973, Victor Samuelson was kidnapped and ransomed, successfully for $14.2 million dollars.  
His kidnappers were never caught and he was released.<P>
American Consul Terry Leonhardy was also kidnapped in May of 1973, and released.  No details 
whether a ransom was paid or not.<P>
Hanns-Martin Schleyer, a very wealthy industrialist was kidnapped by the Banner-Meinhoff gang 
in 1977.  His body was found within a year.<P>
In Italy, on March 16, 1978, Aldo Moro was kidnapped, his aide being killed at the snatch, and 
oro himself killed later.  This kidnapping made emmense changes in the Italian government, 
and thus would have to be the most politically devastating kidnap in history.<P>
<H4>1980s</H4>
In the eighties, kidnapping has been mainly a political event carried out by radical moslem 
groups.  Several hostages of kidnappings remain in captivity in Beirut, Lebanon today.  The 
captives were snatched despite many governments warning their citizens to leave Lebanon, with 
special warnings for those in and near Beirut.<P>
One nervy kidnapping/murder in the eighties was the kidnap of NATO Col. Francis, a U.S. 
arine assigned to the N.A.T.O. peacekeeping forces in Lebanon.  Photographs of his dead 
body swept through the press within a year of his kidnapping.<P>
In December of 1981, Brigadier General James Dozier was kidnapped in Italy, and later 
released.<P>
The Soviets were not exempt from kidnap attempts any more than they were exempt from airline 
hijackings, with 4 Soviet diplomats being kidnapped and 1 murdered in 1985.<P>
David Jacobsen, Director of an American Hospital in Lebanon was kidnapped by  Hizbollah ,  a 
radical moslem group.<P>
On 10/7/85, Terrorists hijacked the  Achille Lauro , a pleasure cruise ship, and killed American 
Jew, Leon Klinghoffer, and then later tried to deny it.  This murder/kidnapping/hijack was a rare 
case where U.S. military aircraft had the opportunity to force down an Egyptian airliner which 
was carrying the hijackers to safety.  Hijackers were tried in Italy and found guility.<P>
<H4>Released</H4><B><U>
</U></B>Of the hostages held in Lebanon, a few have been released.  One of them, the Rev. 
Benjamin Weir is very vocal in his condemnation of what he calls ineffective U.S. government 
dealings with his abductors.  
<P>
<p><a name="hostage">
<H2>Hostage Taking</H2>
Hostages are the common victim in a terrorist attack.  The typical scenario is the terrorist grabs 
hostages, makes a series of demands which include money and safe passage in exchange for 
the hostages.  Hostages usually gain their freedom, but usually one or more is killed as message 
to the authorities about the seriousness of the terrorists.  The Hezbollah specializes in hostage 
taking, holding the hostages in Beirut, Lebanon.  Even after governments withdraw citizens, 
hostages have still been taken from members of news organizations or from the clergy.  
Hostages seldom recover mentally from their ordeals, and some have committed suicide a few 
years later.  Since 1968, there have been a large number of hostages taken around the 
world.<P>
<H3>The Analysis</H3>
From airline  <A href="#hijacking">hijackings</A>  to outright seizing of buildings, 
terrorists love to grab hostages.  With the media attention that the persecution of the 
innocents  gets, the terrorist quickly brings attention to his or her cause, and has a very 
valuable and proven bargaining tool.  The success of this tool is testified by the rapidity and 
sheer number of hostage situations related to terrorist activity, as well as the phenomonal 
growth in hostage taking since 1968.<P>
By far the most successful hostage taking occurs on aircraft, with attacks on public areas 
leading a not too close second.  Why are aircraft so prone to hostage taking?  It is a matter 
of simple safety in the high altitude flight envelope.  One misplaced shot and you have 
explosive decompression, and a very good possibility of aircraft breakup as a result of major 
structural damage.  <P>
oreover, the aircraft is a world within itself, fairly independent, with all the facilities needed 
for a fair amount of time in hostile negotiations.  In fact, it is a good thing that aircraft have a 
limited amount of food and fuel on board, or we would probably see the standard 3-4 days 
seige of an aircraft extended to 2-3 weeks.<P>
<H4>Long Term Hostages</H4>
Hostages held long term  are usually those captured by a group of people, on the ground, 
and then held for some political purpose.  Unfortunately, many of the times this kind of 
hostage taking occurs on grounds of a country which typically does not have the power to 
satisfy the hostage takers...so are  unable to  pay the "ransom".  <P>
A prime example of this was the taking of the American Embassy in Iran.  This hostage 
situation was inflamed by anti-American sentiment ini the streets of Tehran, and escalated 
into the capture of 96 Americans and their being held for over 1 year.  Politically debilatating 
to the U.S. morale, President Jimmy Carter lost his presidency over the ill feeling of the 
American public toward our nation's seeming helplessness.  From this viewpoint, the hostage 
taking had a severe impact politically, and has helped to establish the "no negotiation with 
terrorists" policy.
<a name="bomb"> <a name="attacks"> <a name="direct"> <a name="bombs"> <p>
<H2>Direct Attacks (Bombs, Grenades, or Guns)</H2>
The bomb is the terrorist's favorite long distance weapon.  Typically a plastic <a href="explosve.htm"> explosive</a>  
triggered by a timing mechanism, this device can be placed on a bus, airplane, or under a car. 
ore people have been killed in bombing attacks on aircraft then have been killed in all 
aircraft accidents put together.<P>
The bombing as a world terrorism event still occurs many times per year.  Despite many 
techniques for locating bombs before they go on aircraft, bombs like the Lockerbie bomb 
hidden in a cassette player still frustrate our best search technology.<P>
<a name="grenades">
<H4>Grenades</H4>
Grenades are a favorite weapon of airline hijackers since the explosion of a 
grenade near the 
cabin walls will instantly depressurize the cabin, and this alone may cause the aircraft to crash.  
And of course a grenade will kill many passengers as well as perhaps do enough structural 
damage to crash the airliner.  Since the grenade itself is a weapon that is armed by pulling a pin,
once armed, no one really wants to take the chance that the terrorist will drop it...since this will 
cause the timer to start its countdown to explosion.<P>
<A name="guns">
<H4>Guns</H4>
Various types of guns are used in the terrorist act, but hijackers have the special problem of 
being able to smuggle guns on board an aircraft.  Hijackers of buses and ships usually do not 
have this problem.<P>
Weapons smuggled must be brought on board (at least in today's environment) by someone 
who can get around airport metal detectors and such.  Lax security in many airports are the
indirect cause of hijackings and there is no excuse for this wanton disregard for the travelling 
public.  Many countries prohibit their aircraft from serving such airports.<P>
<P>
<P>
<H3>The Analysis</H3>
<P>
Bombs used in terrorism are typically found where the terrorist wishes to be far removed 
from the physical event itself, thus living to terrorize again.  This logical development in 
terrorist activity also serves to make more publicity, since a bomb can be quite devastating, 
as well as maximizes the element of surprise.  Surprise yields more shock, thus is more 
traumatic, also a goal of terrorist attacks.<P>
<P>
Pipe Bombs are the most prevalent, with car bombs coming in at a close second.  Pipe 
bombs are easy to build, and several books published around the world spell out their 
construction in great detail using common hardware store items.<P>
<P>
Car bombs, while easily constructed, typically require a larger amount of explosive, or pre-
manufactured explosive, thus require more planning.  Obviously a stolen vehicle is 
preferred, so that the device cannot lead back to the terrorist after the explosion.  Car bombs 
also kill terrorists, though, more often than a pipe bomb, since explosives used in them are 
typically extremely powerful, and also quite sensitive to shock.<P>
<P>
Car bombs are usually of two types, personal attack weapons, or random victim weapons. 
The personal attack genre are those car bombs which are intended to take out a specific 
victim or group of victims.  This is usually the known passengers of the vehicle.  Israeli hit 
teams, for instance, used remote control detonators to ensure that innocents would not be 
killed when they assassinated the Black September members responsible for the Munich 
assacre.  The bomb is usually in the hood, under the chassis or under the seat to ensure 
the victim has no chance to survive.<P>
<P>
The random victim type of car bomb is one where the vehicle is loaded with explosive and a 
timing device, and placed in a location which is destined to either create the most physical 
damage, kill as many innocent people, or both.  An example would be the car bomb 
exploded at the World Trade Center in New York in February, 1993.<P>
<P>
In his book, "Sum of All Fears", Tom Clancey fictionalizes an Islamic Terrorist group which
through a quirk of events, gets their hands on a Israeli built 
<a href=http://www.milnet.com/milnet/nukeweap/NFAQ7.HTM">thermonuclear weapon</a>, repackages 
it into a carton looking like a professional video tape drive for television station usage, then 
plants this weapon next to a football stadium, in...yes...a van.<P>
<P>
The chilling realism in this book may sometime find its way to reality.  The "ideal" terrorist 
weapon would be a atomic or hydrogen weapon, and in fitting with their current patterns, the 
car bomb (or truck or van) holds a high probability as the delivery vehicle.  <P>
<P>
Unfortunately, it is only a matter of time before some terrorist group gains access to one.  
<P>
<P><A name="hijacking">
<H2>Hijacking</H2>
The forceful seizure of a public conveyance, such as an aircraft, ship, or bus for purposes of 
inciting fear and/or murder.  Recently, private vehicles also fall under this definition...i.e. 
carjacking.  Take a look at the <a href="hijchron.htm">history</a> of hijacking.<P>
<H3>An Analysis</H3>
As added above, private vehicles also fall under this definition, and in the early 1990s, 
boldened car thieves in the U.S. began to steal cars from drivers on the street.<P>
But hijacking first became highly visible to U.S. citizens as Cuban refugees tried to be flown back to 
Cuba by forcefully taking over a Southern route airliner.  These flights were typically 
executed with some nervousness by pilots at the end of pistol barrel, but occasionally the 
attacker carried <a HREF="#grenades">grenades</A>, 
<a href="#bombs">bombs</A> or <A HREF="#guns">guns</A>.<P>
At first hijacking was a solo form of assault, but before too long, hijackers were well 
organized bands of terrorists with excellent weaponry and a solid understanding of the target 
aircraft and the flight crew tasks.<P>

While  <A HREF="#skymarshals">Sky Marshals</A>   helped virtually eliminate the 
hijacking of domestic U.S. flights, only the Israelis have been able to effectively reduce 
hijacking and related deaths.  This is due in part to their retaliation policies, as well as full
time Sky Marshals on all flights, and armored luggage and cargo areas on all aircraft.<P>
One other technique for fighting hijacking has been the introduction of the metal detector and 
the upgrade of these and their operators over the last few years.  A number of would-be 
hijackers or their unwitting pawns have been captured with guns or bombs before boarding 
flights.<P>
Incidentally  the data in the Terrfile also shows that airliners and airports are the scene for a large share of all the terrorist attacks in 
the world.  <P>
<P><A name="skymarshals">
<H4>Sky Marshals</H4>
<P>
Sky Marshals are armed deputies whose sole purpose on board an aircraft is to prevent a 
hijacker from completing the hijacking either through negotiation or through the capture or 
death of the hijacker.<P>
<P>
The Israeli Sky Marshals are quite vicious and seldom allow the hijacker to survive.  Also the 
Israelis have Sky Marshals on every flight whereas other countries (probably because the 
incidence of hijacking has been reduced dramatically) do not expend the funds to man every 
aircraft with Sky Marshals.<P>
<P><a name="innocents">
<H2>Innocents</H2>
<P>
The innocents are the prime target of many terrorist acts.  The more innocent the better, in 
fact.  The purpose of many terrorist acts is to cause fear in the "common man".  By attacking 
innocent  bystanders, the terrorist hopes to strike fear in all those who can identify with the 
victims.  <P>
Therefore, the terrorist will invariably attack common carriers such as aircraft, buses, ships, 
etc.   Or will attack a shopping center, market, bus depot, airport, restaurant, or other common 
place public gathering place.<P>
Innocents are defined loosely in terms of civilians, which can further be defined as "...those 
not actively engaged in military activity, aggression, or terrorism".   Without a State of War 
existing, as declared and acknowleged by two countries, there are no valid military targets 
save for planning purposes.<P>
For example when no State of War exists, civilians not currently wanted for terrorist or 
criminal acts by an international court of law are considered innocents.   The direct family of a 
member of the military are considered innocents.  Strategic targets might be 
the family of an important public figure or military leader, and as such are
usually protected by the government.  <P>
When a State of War does exist, the civilian employee of government while at his or her 
workplace is a military target (and thus not an innocent).   A politician and his family may also 
be military targets depending upon their connection with the government.   When at war 
innocents will  be considered targets but are still considered innocents.  Terrorists, of course, 
are at war with the world, and this is how they "justify" their murder of innocents.   Thus Terrorists convince themselves that no one is "an innocent".  Reality is, of course, that Terrorists are 
never innocents and their targets are nearly always innocents.<P>
Unfortunately, military personnel are always a military target, even when "off duty" simply because 
they cannot be readily replaced and therefore have military value.  
<p>
Attacking a 
member of the military is an act of war.  Terrorists are rarely attached, at 
least publiclyi, to any nation, so Terrorists have no compunction to attacking military personell either.   But the attack of military personnel 
off duty or when no State of War exists incites fierce anger in their peers and serves only to 
increase their performance.  As does the "singled out" attack on a military member's 
family.<P>
<P>
<H3>An Analysis of Innocents</H3>
 Innocents  are killed regularly by terrorists, as they are the prime targets of terrorists.  Below 
are other examples of innocents according to the Geneva Convention:<P>
<ul>
<li>Unarmed Children (unarmed...ie. IRA used children as the delivery vehicle for bombs)<P>
<li>Unarmed civilians (men, women, and children, not in the military or engaged in military activities)<P>
<li>Soldiers not in uniform, i.e. at recreation<P>
</ul>
Non-Innocents can be categorized as those, in a declared war (as ratified by the Geneva Convention) 
:<P>
<ul>
<li>Soldiers, identifiable<P>
<li>Clandestine agents of foreign interests, identifiable<P>
<li>Political Leaders<P>
</ul>
It is also recognized that the family of a non-innocent, i.e. a political leader's family, at time of war, are not considered 
innocents as their well-being has a direct influence on the performance of that leader.<P>
any terrorists organizations declare, or their leaders declare that they are at a state of war
with either one or more countries, or with a particular political group, or with a particular
religious group.  This declaration then is used to cover terrorists acts by 
deeming them Acts of War. 
<p> 
The World Court, and in recent years, the United Nations has rejected this subterfuge, 
stating that nationless groups, and specifically nationless terrorist groups (within an eye to 
the PLO and its splinter groups as well as the IRA), have nothing to lose by declaring war on 
anyone they choose, since there is no nation to retaliate against, or to declare War against in 
response.  <P>
Countries that sponser terrorism, of course, refuse to acknowlege the World Court, the 
United Nations, or other world organizations.  In many cases 
the reasons that might be given include "the rest are infidels" or "these organizations are part of the oppressive western conspiracy."<P>
<p><a name="assassination">
<H2>Assassination</H2>
Assassination is also a long standing method for terrorism.  The typical use of assassination in 
the past was aimed at toppling a government by forcebly removing the head of that 
government thru murder.  On occasion a large group of the government leaders have been 
murdered in this fashion leading to instaneous new government.  <P>
Today assassination attempts may serve the same purpose, and is more increasingly aimed at 
anyone in government as targets of convenience.  In recent years, even non-governmental 
figures have been assassinated, typically because of their wealth or a vocal position on a 
political issue.<P>
In Columbia, the Meddian Drug Cartel very effectivlely used assassination to quiet public 
discussions of their affairs by assassinations of public figures as well as vast numbers of 
civilians.<P>
<H3>The Analysis</H3>
Assassination is perhaps the oldest of the terrorist acts known to man.  Next to kidnapping, 
assassination has served to topple governments, promote disarray, and generally provide a 
great deal of commotion.  But very few cases of assassination have really changed 
government in modern times.  There always seems to be someone just about as bad as the 
person assassinated, ready to take over, and while perhaps having a different political 
leaning or goal, it is rare that the change in government lasts.  <P>
For purposes of definition, assassins generally do not assassinate innocents, rather someone 
who they view as guilty of some action, non-action, or perhaps just being guilty of a race or 
nationality.   The intended victim is usually a public official or a member of some political 
party or action group, but on numerous occassions the victim has been a business leader.   
On some rare occassions the intended victim is a member of a standing military organization 
(includes treaty organization such as NATO).<P>
In the distant pass, the fastest way to gain way to the throne was through assassination and 
many an heir apparant took advantage.   Thus the historical record for assassination would 
indicate that even a father is not safe from assassination from those closest to him.  The 
same holds true today.<P>
<H4>Major Assassinations Since World War II</H4>
U.S. President John F. Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963  while waving to 
the crowds from his motorcade through Dallas, Texas, by Lee Harvey Oswald.  Oswald 
never stood trial, but best guess this was a politically oriented assassination.  However, 
Oswald was not really a representative of any foreign government.  Rumors persist today 
that the Kennedy Assassination was a conspiracy rather than the act of one man.  This 
theory is exacerbated by the mysterious actions of the U.S. Secret Service.<P>
In the 1970s, political leaders fell like ducks on a shooting pond.  The most critical was 
Anwar Sadat, the  forward thinking, and peace seeking President of Egypt.  The reason 
thought for the assassination was his signing of the Middle East Peace Treaty with 
Menacham Begin at Camp David, an action even moderate Arabs could not forgive him. (Just as Mabarek was most recently the target of a failed assasination attempt). 
Sadat and a number of his retinue were killed by assassins (bearing machine guns) while he 
watched his Army in formation parade by his reviewing stand.<P>
A famous domestic political assassination was that of peace demonstrator Reverand Martin 
Luther King.  King's death only served to strengthen the cause the assassin was trying to kill along 
with the dynamic leader, and within a year landmark Civil Rights legislation was enacted to 
prevent segration by race in the United States.  The foundations of many other minority 
actions and movements in the U.S. were also created at this time.<P>
Another famous worldwide assassination was the killing of the exiled opposition leader 
President Acquino of the Phillipines, thought to be sponsored by Dictator Ferdinand Marcos.  
Later Acquino's wife, Corozone Acquino, deposed Marcos sending the dictator and his wife 
into exile.  Marcos later died in a hospital in Hawaii while under the guard of U.S. Marshals.  
His wife eventually went back to stand trial for crimes aganst the nation.<P>

<H1>Yugoslavia NATO Chronology By 
</center>
The Associated Press</H1>
<H2>A chronology of NATO air strikes in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina:</H2>
<B>February 28, 1994:</B> U.S. F-16 fighters shoot down four Bosnian Serb warplanes 
violating a ``no-fly'' zone in central Bosnia, the first military strike by NATO in its 45-year 
history. Serbs do not react.<P>
<B>April 10, 1994:</B> Two U.S. F-16s attack Bosnian Serb positions near Gorazde, a Muslim 
enclave and U.N.-designated ``safe area,'' under attack, 35 miles southeast of Sarajevo. Results 
are inconclusive.<P>
<B>April 11, 1994:</B> Two U.S. Marine FA-18s attack Serb positions near Gorazde, 
reportedly destroying a tank. Serbs respond by capturing all strategic points around Gorazde.<P>
<B>April 16, 1995:</B>  a British Sea Harrier jet is shot down near Gorazde; the pilot ejects 
and is rescued. Serbs then shell Gorazde hospital and a hospital annex for two days, reportedly 
killing 38 people.<P>
<B>Aug. 5, 1994:</B> Two U.S. A-10 jets destroy an aging anti-tank weapon near Sarajevo, 
after Serbs seize heavy weapons from a U.N.-guarded compound. The weapons are later 
returned.<P>
<B>Sept. 22, 1994:</B> NATO jets attack a Serb tank near Sarajevo after Serbs attack a French 
armored personnel carrier and defy U.N. demands to remove heavy guns violating a ``no-
weapons'' zone around the city. Serbs respond by harassing peacekeepers, delaying aid convoys, 
grounding helicopter flights and shutting down the aid airlift to Sarajevo.<P>
<B>Nov. 21, 1994:</B> NATO warplanes bomb the air base in Serb-held Croatia used by Serb 
planes to raid the neighboring U.N. ``safe area'' of Bihac in northwestern Bosnia. Serbs fire two 
surface-to-air missiles at two British Harrier jets flying over Bosnia. The missiles miss.<P>
<B>Nov. 23, 1994:</B> About 20 NATO planes hit at least two Serb surface-to-air missile sites 
near Bihac. Warplanes hit one of the targets again because the first raid did not put it out of 
commission. Serbs take dozens of U.N. peacekeepers hostage.<P>
<B>May 25, 1995:</B> NATO jets strike at Bosnian Serb ammunition depot near the Serb 
stronghold of Pale outside Sarajevo, after the Serbs refuse to return heavy weapons taken from 
U.N.-guarded collection sites.<P>
<B>May 26, 1995:</B> NATO jets again attack Bosnian Serb ammunition dump near Pale. 
Serbs respond by taking more than 370 U.N. peacekeepers hostage, chaining some of them to 
possible NATO targets to prevent further airstrikes.<BR>
After intervention by Serbian President Slobdan Milosevic, the Serbs release all the hostages in 
batches over several weeks. There are rumors the Serbs agreed to the release in exchange for 
pledges there would be no more airstrikes.<P>
<B>July 11, 1995:</B> Dutch and American jets from NATO attack Bosnian Serb tanks south 
of the enclave of Srebrenica, a U.N.-declared ``safe area'' in an attempt to protect Dutch U.N. 
peacekeepers and 30,000 people in the town. The Bosnian Serbs overrun the town, sending 
peacekeepers and refugees fleeing in panic.<P>

EX-U.S. MILITARY OFFICERS ASSIST CROAT ARMY By LOUIS J. SALOME<P>
Cox News Service<P>
ZAGREB, Croatia -- Former U.S. military personnel, working in secret near Zagreb, are teaching the 
expanding Croat armed forces western methods of military organization, management and discipline.<P>
About 15 Americans, employed by Military Professional Resources Inc. (MPRI) of Alexandria, Va., have 
been instructing the Croats since mid-November. They arrived in the explosive region two months after 
the firm, which employs about 120 retired and former U.S. military personnel, and the Croat 
government signed a contract with the blessing of the State Department.<P>
Retired U.S. Army Lt. Gen. Ed Soyster, MPRI's vice president for international operations, said in a 
telephone interview that employees of the seven-year-old company are teaching Croat forces how to 
function in a democratic society.<P>
Soyster, director of the super-secret U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency from December 1988 until 
September 1991, said MPRI is not providing Croatia with intelligence information and has no 
intelligence contracts. Soyster said he is the only former intelligence officer at MPRI.<P>
Both Soyster and U.S. officials in Zagreb denied that MPRI is offering military training or teaching 
military tactics. To do so, Soyster said, would violate the international embargo against military 
equipment or services reaching Croatia.<P>
Despite the embargo, Croatia has in the past couple of years bought or been given large quantities of new 
weapons, most of which are believed to have come from former eastern bloc countries.<P>
Newspaper reports published in the Balkans in May said that 30 up-to-date Russian MiG-29 jet fighters, 
bought from the Czech Republic, were about to be added to Croatia's arsenal.<P>
The MPRI-Zagreb arrangement, sanctioned by the State Department, reflects the growing U.S. influence 
in Croatia. U.S. diplomats have ready access to Croat leaders and the Pentagon has signed a military 
agreement that would allow Croats to study at U.S. military bases and schools. Congress has not yet 
approved the deal.<P>
Although there is widespread skepticism in the region that U.S. assistance is limited to helping Croatia's 
military adjust to democracy, Soyster said, ``There is nothing lethal that we teach. We don't teach use of 
weapons because we'd lose our (State Department) license if we did that.''<P>
Soyster said MPRI has a ``long-term contract'' with Croatia. But he refused to reveal its length, the 
amount of money involved or exactly where in Croatia MPRI instructors are teaching.<P>
U.S. officials in Zagreb referred all questions about the contract to MPRI, and Croat officials refused to 
answer questions about the arrangement.<P>
Soyster said MPRI is helping Croatia develop a chain of command for non-commissioned officers. He 
said it is also teaching the Croat armed services new budgeting, management, planning and program 
techniques, helping them draw the distinction between military and civilian law, and instructing them 
on how to act toward civilians during and after a battle.<P>
``We're not teaching tactics or combined military operations,'' Soyster said.<P>
Most of MPRI's employees are former officers, Soyster said. But, he said, two of its employees working in 
Croatia are retired sergeant-majors who are assisting Croatia in developing its non-commissioned 
officers' corps.<P>
The Croat army was widely criticized for human rights abuses against civilians among ethnic Krajina 
Serbs during Croatia's war of secession from the former Yugoslavia in 1991, which Serbia and the 
Krajina Serbs resisted.<P>
But Croatia's successful offensive in early May against the Krajina Serbs in an area known as western 
Slavonia appears to have been marked by fewer human rights abuses against civilians than would have 
been expected 12 months ago. In Croatia, the relative change is widely attributed to American training 
and to the additional weapons Croatia has acquired since 1991.<P>
``The principles we're teaching certainly parallel where they want to go and what the Croats did in 
western Slavonia,'' Soyster said. ``We're good, but we're not into what happened in the Krajina area or 
that sort of thing. We don't have a contract to do that and we're not doing it.''<P>
Croatia's offensive was quick, unexpected and well-coordinated on the ground and in the air. Croat police 
moved in quickly to take control of the area and protect civilians after the military had taken the 
area.<P>
Since last fall, MPRI has had a contract directly with the State Department to provide monitors who 
assist the Geneva-based International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. The monitors work along 
the Bosnia-Serbia border.<P>
Soyster said that contract was a ``short-term one,'' but a State Department official in Washington called 
the contract ``open-ended.''<P>
The State Department official, who asked not to be identified, said in a telephone interview that MPRI 
provides up to 50 monitors at one time to watch for military trucks or equipment crossing into Bosnia 
from Serbia.<P>
When the monitoring began late last summer, U.S. foreign service officers were posted on the border to 
report to the International Conference on the Former Yugoslavia. But they proved insufficient to handle 
the job, so the State Department engaged MPRI, the State Department official said.<P>

<p>
I was hoping to find an objective summary of the events leading to what
we have now.
<p>
I am disappointed.
<p>
Do you think this whole thing started in 1994?
NPR has had many shows discussing the background for these hostilities
and they allow the listener to form their own opinion.
<p>
Your words are loaded i.e., "Ineffectiveness" in describing the UN
results, your description of the mission of the muslims leads into a
discussion of the serbian atrocities - Since when is that the muslim
mission.
<p>
You have also added to the confusion by using the term muslims to depict
a people who are not a part of the land (cf: serbian, croation etc.)
when they are a part of the land and history and have every right to lay
claim to national title.
<p>
Again, I am disappointed I thought you would do better than the "sound
bite" popular media.

We believe the U.N. has been ineffective in bringing this conflict 
to an end.  However, we also hardly blame the organization since it
is clear the conflict is about as complex as they come.
<p>
Also, the term muslims was used in a number of pieces we used in the 
writing of our summary.  It is unfortunate, in that this term applies to
many people outside of the conflict zone.  However, the ethnic cleansing
is repugnant and unacceptable in this century.  
<p>
We do agree that the peoples there have every right to land and title whether
it be local, national and worldwide, and we do hope someday that the people
will get what they deserve.  
<p>
We apologize for any insult we may have inadvertantly placed upon you with
our clumsy summary, and hope that you will accept our apology and take us 
up on our offer to publish a well written correction to the summary.

Pakistan lies along the northern border of <a href="/milnet/indiax.htm">India</a>.  The two countries
have been divided over their religious ideals since their mutual
independce from Britain.  The SIKH clans of Pakistan have taken
credit or blamed for most of all the terrorist activities in India
over the last twenty years, and in the late 1990s their actiivities
have increased to near epedimic proportions.  
<P>
The Pakistani have numerous Soviet supplied weaponry to ensure
no one crosses the border from India, and are one of the countries
being watched for nuclear weapons research as is their neighbor
to the South.

Tourist facilities varying in degree of comfort and amenities are 
widely available in the major population centers and main tourist 
areas.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport and visa (which must be obtained in 
advance) are required for entry into India for tourism or business.  
Evidence of yellow fever immunization is needed if the traveler is 
arriving from an infected area.  For further entry information, the 
traveler can contact the Embassy of India at 2536 Massachusetts 
Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 939-9839 or 
939-9850 or the Indian Consulates in Chicago, New York, San 
Francisco, Honolulu, and New Orleans.
<p>
<b>Terrorism:</b>  During September/October 1994, in what appears to have 
been an isolated incident, one American and three British tourists 
in New Delhi were lured by friendly-seeming members of a 
hitherto-unknown Kashmiri terrorist group and taken hostage.  After 
weeks in captivity, the four were released, unharmed, following a 
police action.
<p>
A series of bombings in Bombay in March 1993 killed several hundred 
people.  Foreigners were not targeted in those attacks and none were 
reported injured.  The threat of terrorist activity remains, but 
there have been no bombings in more than a year.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Countrywide - The potential exists for outbreaks of communal and 
inter-caste violence in most major cities.  Major civil disturbances 
can pose risks to a traveler's personal safety and can disrupt 
transportation systems and city services.  In response to communal 
violence, Indian authorities may occasionally impose curfews.  In 
addition, political rallies and demonstrations in India have the 
potential for violence.  Foreigners have not been the targets of 
either communal or political violence in India, and are principally 
at risk only of becoming inadvertent victims.  U.S. citizens may 
contact the American Embassy or the nearest American Consulate 
General for further information about the current situation in areas 
where they wish to travel.
<li>Kashmir - In July 1994 an American tourist was fatally shot in 
Srinagar, and in June 1994 militants held two British hikers hostage 
for eighteen days before releasing them.  These recent events 
demonstrate that the Kashmir Valley in the State of Jammu and 
Kashmir remains a dangerous place where terrorist activities and 
violent civil disturbances continue.
<li>Uttar Pradesh - In September and October 1994 there were numerous 
incidents of violent encounters between police and activists for a 
separate state for the hill districts of Uttar Pradesh.  Dozens were 
killed and many more injured in the incidents of mob action which 
resulted in imposition of curfew and disruption of public 
transportation in many towns including Dehradun, Rishikesh, Nainital 
and other popular tourist destinations.
<li>Northeast States - Civil unrest pervades the Northeast States.  
Terrorist groups in Assam have bombed trains, buses and bridges.  
The government of India has declared Assam to be a "disturbed area." 
 Numerous political killings have occurred in Nagaland and Manipur.
<li>India/Pakistan Border - Tensions run high between India and 
Pakistan, particularly over Kashmir.  The only official 
India-Pakistan border-crossing point is between Atari, India and 
Wagah, Pakistan.  A Pakistani visa is required for entry to Pakistan.
</ul>
<p>
<b>Restricted Areas:</b>  Permission from the Indian government (from 
Indian diplomatic missions abroad or, in some cases, from the 
Ministry of Home Affairs) is required to visit the states of 
Mizoram, Manipur, Nagaland, Meghalaya, Assam, Tripura, Arunachal 
Pradesh, Sikkim, parts of Kulu District and Spiti District of 
Himachal Pradesh, border areas of Jammu and Kashmir, areas of Uttar 
Pradesh, the area west of National Highway No. 15 running from 
Ganganagar to Sanchar in Rajasthan, the Andaman and Nicobar Islands 
and the Union Territory of the Laccadive Islands.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Adequate medical care is available in the 
major population centers, but is usually limited in the rural areas 
of the country.  Medical authorities suggest that travelers to India 
take preventive measures against malaria, hepatitis, meningitis and 
Japanese encephilitis (if arriving during the monsoon season).  
Travelers arriving from countries where outbreaks of yellow fever 
have occurred will be required to furnish a certificate of yellow 
fever vaccination.  Cholera and gastroenteritis occur during the 
summer monsoon months, mostly in the poorer areas of India.  The 
best protection includes eating only at better quality restaurants 
or hotels, drinking only boiled or bottled mineral water and 
avoiding ice.  Eating untreated fruits and vegetables and cooked 
foods sold by street vendors can be risky.
<p>
U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the United 
States.  Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate payment in 
cash for health services.  Supplemental health insurance which 
specifically covers overseas treatment and medical evacuation has 
proven useful.  The interiors of international flights arriving in 
India may be sprayed with insecticides while passengers are still 
aboard, a practice discontinued in the U.S. because of human health 
concerns.  Additional information on health matters can be obtained 
from the Centers for Disease Control's international travelers 
hotline at (404) 332-4559.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Petty crime, especially theft of personal 
property, is common.  The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad 
should be reported immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. 
Embassy or Consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables, 
protecting personal security, and other matters while traveling 
abroad is provided in the Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe 
Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to South Asia."  They are 
available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  Travelers are subject to the laws and legal 
practices of the country in which they travel.  Penalties for 
possession, use, or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly 
enforced.  Convicted offenders in India can expect a minimum jail 
sentence of ten years and fines.
<p>
<b>Customs Considerations:</b>  Indian customs authorities strictly 
enforce the laws and regulations governing the declaration, 
importation or possession of gold and gold objects.  Travelers have 
sometimes been detained for possession of undeclared gold objects.
<p>
<b>Mountain Climbing:</b>  Both India and Pakistan claim an area of the 
Karakoram mountain range which includes the Siachen Glacier.  The 
two countries have established military outposts in the region, and 
armed clashes have occurred.  Because of this situation, U.S. 
citizens traveling to or climbing peaks anywhere in the disputed 
area face significant risk of injury and death.  The disputed area 
includes the following peaks: Rimo Peak, Apsarasas I, II, and III, 
Tegam Kangri I, II, and III, Suingri Kangri, Ghaint I and II, Indira 
Col, and Sia Kangri.
<p>
<b>Piloting Civil Aircraft:</b>  In past years, there have been a number 
of incidents in which civil aircraft have been detained for 
deviating from approved flight plans.  U.S. citizens piloting civil 
aircraft in India must file any changes to previous flight plans and 
may not overfly restricted airspace.
<p>
<b>Registration:</b>  U.S. citizens who register at the U.S. Embassy in 
New Delhi or at one of the U.S. Consulates in India can obtain 
updated information on travel and security in India and Bhutan and 
can obtain a copy of a booklet, "Guidelines for American Travelers 
in India".
<p>
<b>Embassy Location:</b>  The U.S. Embassy is located in the capital city 
of New Delhi on Shanti Path, Chanakyapuri 110021; telephone (91-11) 
688-9033.  There are U.S. Consulates General in Bombay at Lincoln 
House, 78 Bhulabhai Desai Road, Bombay 400026, telephone (91-22) 
363-3611; in Calcutta at 5/1 Ho Chi Minh Sarani, Calcutta 700071, 
telephone (91-033) 22-3611 through 22-3615 and 22-2335 through 
22-2337; and in Madras on Mount Road, Madras 600006, telephone 
(91-44) 827-3040. The workweek is Monday through Friday.

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION
</h2>
</center>
<b>Pakistan - Public Announcement</b><br>
 October 18, 1996<br>
<p>
 U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE<br>
 Office of the Spokesman<br>
 For Immediate Release<br>
<p>
As we advised on August 15, 1996, the Department of State is 
concerned about the danger of hostile activities directed towards 
U.S. citizens, facilities, and businesses in Pakistan.  The 
Department believes that persons with a history of violence and 
anti-Americanism may still be planning unspecified violence against 
U.S. interests in Pakistan.
<p>
The Department urges American citizens in Pakistan to be mindful of 
their personal security including the following security guidelines: 
 Avoid predictable movements and continue to vary schedules and 
routes; be alert to any surveillance and unusual or inquisitive 
phone calls; be wary of unexpected visitors or packages and any 
incidents perceived to be out of the ordinary; inspect vehicles for 
signs of tampering and park in secure, well-lit areas.
<p>
For further information on travel to Pakistan, consult the 
Departments latest Consular Information Sheet on Pakistan.  This 
Public Announcement expires on January 31, 1997 and supersedes the 
Public Announcement for Pakistan issued August 15, 1996.
<p>

<h2>Pakistan - Consular Information Sheet</h2>
 June 6, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Pakistan is a developing country with a 
parliamentary democracy.  Tourist facilities are available in the 
principal population centers of the country. 
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport and visa are required.  The visa 
must be obtained from a Pakistani embassy or consulate before 
arrival at the point of entry.  Information on entry requirements 
can be obtained from the Embassy of Pakistan, 2315 Massachusetts 
Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C., 20008, telephone (202) 939-6200.  
Travelers may also contact one of the consulates general of 
Pakistan, located at 12 East 65th St., New York, NY 10021, telephone 
(212) 879-5800, and 18050 Wilshire Blvd., Suite 1100, Los Angeles, 
CA 90010, (310) 441-5114.  Due to problems with inadmissible 
passengers, airlines may require travelers departing the U.S. to 
present multiple photographs and complete copies of passports and 
other travel documents.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  Rallies, demonstrations and processions 
occur from time to time throughout Pakistan on very short notice, 
and have occasionally taken on an anti-American or anti-Western 
character.  Karachi, in particular, is experiencing protracted 
political violence, which although not anti-American, poses a danger 
to Americans.  During the Islamic religious observances of Ramadan 
and Moharram, sectarian rivalry and violence often increase.
<p>
<b>Travel in the Northwest Frontier Province:  Because of dangerous 
security conditions, caution is essential when traveling overland 
through the tribal areas to the Khyber Pass.  Substantial areas 
within the Northwest Frontier are designated tribal areas and are 
outside the normal jurisdiction of government law enforcement 
authorities.  Travel within these areas is particularly hazardous.  
Tribal feuds or conflicts between smuggling factions may involve 
foreigners.  Even in the settled areas, ethnic, political, or 
sectarian violence may target foreigners.  Car hijackings and the 
abduction of foreigners are occasionally reported from the tribal 
areas.  If visitors must enter the tribal areas, a permit from the 
Home Department is required.  The permit may stipulate that an armed 
escort must accompany the visitor.
<p>
<b>Travel in Punjab Province:</b>  In early 1996, there were a number of 
bombings of public places and buses in Punjab province.  
Additionally, grenades were thrown at the American center in Lahore 
and anti-American demonstrations were also held there.  No U.S. 
citizens or employees were killed or injured in any of these 
incidents.  While we have no specific information concerning the 
motives behind the attacks, U.S. citizens are advised to avoid 
public bus travel, bus stops, and crowded areas.
<p>
<b>Travel in Sindh Province:</b>  In the areas of Karachi and Hyderabad, 
there have been recurring outbreaks of ethnic and sectarian violence 
characterized by random bombings, shootings and mass demonstrations. 
 These have resulted in deaths and the imposition of curfews.  There 
have also been numerous incidents of kidnappings for ransom.  In 
rural Sindh Province, the security situation is hazardous, 
especially in regard to overland travel.  Foreigners have 
occasionally been kidnapped and, in one incident, the foreign kidnap 
victim was killed in a subsequent gunfight between police and 
bandits.  The Pakistan government has recommended that travelers 
limit their movements in Sindh Province to the city of Karachi.  If 
visitors must go into the interior of Sindh Province, the Pakistan 
government requests that travelers inform police authorities well in 
advance of the trip so that necessary police security arrangements 
can be made.
<p>
<b>Travel in Baluchistan Province:</b>  The province of Baluchistan, which 
borders both Iran and Afghanistan, is notorious for cross-border 
smuggling.  Armed battles between clans are frequent.  Due to a 
limited provincial police presence, travelers wishing to visit the 
interior of Baluchistan should consult with the province's Home 
Secretary.  Advance permission from provincial authorities is 
required for travel into some areas.  Travelers without permission 
have been detained by local authorities.  While quieter than the 
interior, Quetta, the provincial capital, has experienced serious 
ethnic violence which has led to gun battles in the streets and the 
imposition of curfews.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Karachi suffers from a very high level of 
crime and an ineffective police force.  This has been exacerbated by 
the sectarian and political violence, which has distracted the 
police and encouraged criminal gangs to increase their activities.  
Political violence, although not aimed at foreigners, includes 
assassinations of political leaders and random use of bombs.  
Violent criminal activity, such as carjacking, kidnapping, armed 
robbery, arson and other violence against civilians occurs 
frequently in many parts of the city.  In recent months, this 
violence has become increasingly targeted against foreigners and has 
occurred in neighborhoods where foreigners reside.  The police force 
itself has become a target for heavily armed gangs.  Car thieves 
prefer to steal four-wheel drive vehicles, and drivers resisting the 
theft may be shot.  The U.S. Consulate General encourages travelers 
to use hotel shuttles from the airport rather than taxis or 
hotel-provided vehicles.  Similar carjacking incidents have been 
reported in Lahore, Peshawar and Quetta.
<p>
Petty crime, especially theft of personal property, is common 
throughout Pakistan.
<p>
The loss or theft of a U.S. passport abroad should be reported 
immediately to local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or 
consulate.  Useful information on safeguarding valuables, protecting 
personal security and other matters while traveling abroad is 
provided in the Department of State pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" 
and "Tips for Travelers to South Asia."  They are available from the 
Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, 
Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Road Travel:</b>  Road travel in Pakistan is generally risky.  Driving 
without experienced local drivers or guides is not recommended.  For 
specific current information on road conditions along the Karakoram 
Highway, travelers may contact the Frontier Works Organization at 
562918.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Adequate medical care is available in major 
cities in Pakistan, but may be limited in rural areas.  U.S. medical 
insurance is not always valid outside the United States.  Doctors 
and hospitals often expect immediate payment in cash for treatment.  
Supplemental health insurance which specifically covers overseas 
treatment has proven useful.  Information on health problems can be 
obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559 or on the Internet 
at http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in 
illegal drugs are strictly enforced.  Long jail sentences are 
frequently imposed and large fines are assessed in some cases.  
Legislation passed in 1994 makes trafficking offenses punishable by 
death.
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens who register at the 
U.S. Embassy in Islamabad or the Consulates General in Karachi, 
Lahore or Peshawar may obtain updated information on travel and 
security in Pakistan.  The U.S. Embassy is located in Islamabad, 
Diplomatic Enclave, Ramna 5, telephone 92-51-826-161.  The Consular 
Section is located separately in the USAID building, 18 Sixth 
Avenue, Ramna 5, telephone 92-51-824-071.
<p>
<b>-- In Karachi,</b>  the Consulate General is located at 8 Abdullah 
Haroon Road, telephone 92-21-568-5170 (after hours 568-1606).
<p>
<b>-- In Lahore,</b>  the U.S. Consulate General is located on 
Sharah-E-Abdul Hamid Bin Badees (50 Empress Road), New Simla Hills,

<p>
 No. 96-110
<p>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated December 8, 1994 
to update information regarding areas of instability, to advise of 
violence related to travel in Sindh Province, to alert travelers to 
the incidence of crime in Karachi, and to provide information about 
road conditions.

<h1>Zaire</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION
</h2>
</center>
Zaire - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 July 24, 1996<br>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Despite plentiful human and natural 
resources, Zaire is in a deep political and economic crisis which 
has resulted in the dramatic deterioration of its physical 
infrastructure, insecurity and increased crime in cities, occasional 
official hostility to U.S. citizens and other expatriates, periodic 
shortages of basic items such as gasoline, chronic shortages of 
medical supplies, high inflation, corruption, and in some areas, 
serious malnutrition.  Tourism facilities are minimal and only 
essential travel is recommended.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  The government of Zaire has requested all 
first time visitors to Zaire, including those involved in 
humanitarian assistance, to schedule their arrivals in Zaire via 
Kinshasa.  First time visitors and those traveling on a passport 
without a Kinshasa entry stamp should be aware that this measure is 
being interpreted at some ports of entry as barring first time entry 
to Zaire other than through Kinshasa, including holders of valid 
Zairian visas.  Visa must be obtained in advance.  Under no 
circumstances should American citizens travel to Zaire without a 
valid visa.  Additional information may be obtained from the Zairian 
Embassy, 1800 New Hampshire Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009 at 
(202) 234-7690 or 234-7691, or Zaire's Permanent Mission to the U.N. 
at 2 Henry Avenue, North Caldwell, New Jersey 07006, telephone (201) 
812-1636.  Overseas, inquiries should be made at the nearest Zairian 
embassy or consulate.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>
<p>
<b>North and South Kivu Provinces</b> - Travel to North and South Kivu 
Provinces is unsafe due to the presence of armed elements in the 
region, landmines on major thoroughfares, and the possibilities of 
inter-ethnic violence.
<p>
<b>Urban Areas</b> - Military mutinies in 1991 and 1993 caused many deaths 
and major property loss, damage, and destruction in Kinshasa and 
elsewhere.  The underlying causes of these mutinies -- the inability 
of the Zairian government to pay the military enough to support 
themselves and their families -- have not been resolved.  Civil 
disturbances, including looting and the possibility of physical 
harm, can occur without warning in all urban areas.
<p>
Corrupt Zairian security personnel may seek bribes to perform their 
duties, or single out foreigners and stop them on the street for 
proof of immigration status.  The U.S. Embassy advises travelers to 
not be belligerent if confronted with these situations and to 
contact the U.S. Embassy if taken into custody.
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are limited and medicine is 
in short supply.  Doctors and hospitals expect immediate cash 
payment in full for health services.  U.S. medical insurance is not 
always valid or accepted outside the United States.  The 
Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide for payment of medical 
services outside the United States.  Travelers should consider 
supplemental medical insurance, with specific overseas and medical 
evacuation coverage.  For additional information, travelers can 
contact the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 
international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.  Internet:  
http://www.cdc.gov.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  The deterioration of Zaire's economy has led 
to an increase in crime.  Vehicle thefts, including armed 
carjackings, occur, as do burglaries and other crimes.  The loss or 
theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to 
local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The 
pamphlets, "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to 
Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on protecting 
personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in the region 
in general.  Both are available from the Superintendent of 
Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20420.
<p>
<b>Road Safety and In-Country Travel:</b>  Intercity roads are difficult 
and in the rainy season often impassable.  When driving in cities, 
individuals should keep windows up and doors locked.  At roadblocks 
or checkpoints, documents are shown through closed windows.  
Visitors to the interior may be required to obtain a "mining permit" 
in Kinshasa before continuing the trip, regardless of the purpose of 
the trip.
<p>
<b>Zaire/Congo Border Crossing</b> - A special exit permit from Zaire's 
immigration department and a visa from an embassy of the Congo are 
required to cross the Congo River from Kinshasa to Brazzaville.
<p>
<b>Zaire/Central African Republic Border Crossing</b> - Ferry service to 
the Central African Republic is not reliable.
<p>
<b>Currency Regulations: </b> The foreign exchange office at N'Djili 
Airport in Kinshasa remains closed.  U.S. dollars and travelers 
checks can, in theory, be exchanged for local currency (New Zaires) 
at banks, but there is often insufficient New Zaire cash on hand to 
make transactions.  Visitors may be given an unfavorable rate of 
exchange, making daily necessities extremely expensive.  Credit 
cards are not widely accepted, with the exception of a few major 
hotels.  Taking Zairian currency out of the country is illegal.  
With the continued devaluation of the New Zaire currency, U.S. 
currency has become a popular means for unofficial transactions 
greater than 100 dollars.  Participating in unofficial money 
exchanges, however, is illegal.  Foreigners have been picked up for 
infractions and had their money confiscated.  Large denominations of 
U.S. currency may not be accepted.
<p>
<b>Photography Restrictions:</b>  Photography of public buildings, 
military installations, airports, and the banks of the Congo River 
is forbidden.  Offenders can expect to be arrested, held for at 
least several hours, and fined.  Film and cameras may also be 
confiscated.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use, 
and trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly enforced.  Convicted 
offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>Civil Aviation:</b>  As a result of an assessment conducted by the U.S. 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in November 1992, the FAA has 
found the government of Zaire's Civil Aviation Authority to not be 
in compliance with international aviation safety standards for 
oversight of Zaire's air carrier operations.  Operations to the U.S. 
by Zaire's air carriers are not permitted unless they arrange to 
have their flights conducted by a carrier from a country meeting 
international aviation safety standards.  For further information, 
travelers may contact the Department of Transportation at 
1-800-322-7873.
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register at the U.S. Embassy in Kinshasa and to obtain updated 
information on travel and security within Zaire.  The U.S. Embassy 
is at 310 Avenue des Aviateurs, Kinshasa.  The telephone number is 
(243) (12) 21532 or 21628.  The Consular Section of the U.S. Embassy 
is located at Avenue d'Isiro, Mobil Building; the telephone number 
is (243) (12) 21532, extension 2376.  Telephone service is often 
unreliable and cellular phones are becoming increasingly popular.  
The U.S. Embassy's cellular switchboard phone number is (243) (88) 
43608.  The Consular Section may be reached by fax at (243) (88) 
00228.

<H1>Air to Ground Missiles (AGMs)</H1>
</center>
<p>
<a href="agmdb.htm"><img src="agmbut.gif">  AGM Database</a>
<p>
AGMs are used in various air to surface roles, such as anti-tank attacks, attacks against 
ground force personnel, runways, or equipment.  Also lumped in this category of missiles 
is the anti-ship and anti-submarine missiles (or depth charges) launched from aircraft, 
although we will not deal with torpedoes or depth charges here.<P>
Like air-to-air missiles (<a href="aam.htm">AAMs</a>), the air-to-ground missile can be guided by IR 
(InfraRed homing) or Semi-Active Radar Homing (SARH) methods.  But AGMs also have 
been guided by the aircraft's radar all the way in ( RADAR GUIDED or RG).  This type of 
radar guidance can occur via a radio link or as was done with the wire guided type.  As 
you can imagine, wire guided missiles were only effective while aircraft was flying slow 
and in line with the target, and then usually were left on their own after the wire was 
cut.<P>
Modern AGMs can rely on IR or SARH guidance to target, as well as the more efficient, 
accurate, and reliable laser designation method.  The concept is based upon a laser 
illuminating the target at lock on, through the flight, and at termination.  And of course, all 
three segments of the missile attack can be used in any combination.  For instance, you 
could designate via a friendly ground laser, launch, then allow the friendly to duck his head 
while the missile homes in on position only.  Or the missile could be launched from a 
stand-off position (some 10-40 miles away), then the friendly forces designate in the 
terminal portion, say 2-3 miles away from the target.  <P>
Another type of AGM guidance is via the combination of a magnifying and/or low light 
television seeker in the head of the missle.  An example of this is the Maverick.  This AGM 
displays a picture of what it sees in the cockpit of the fighter aircraft.  The pilot (or 
weapons officer if two crew members) sees a magnified picture of the area ahead, and 
specifically the possible targets for the missile.  The pilot can lock the missile onto the 
target he desires, and the missile can be launched and forgotten.  Or in some cases, the 
missile can be "watched" while the pilot is making evasive or departure maneuvers, then 
re-adjusted or re-targeted as it closes in.<P>
Classed with the AGMs are the Durandel, which is a high velocity, high exposive, and high 
penetration missile designed to penetrate the concrete of a runway, and blast away said 
concrete as well as obliterate the underfooting as well.  A Durandel attack by no more than 
two aircraft can virtually shut down a runway for days.<P>
Also shown in the AGM database, are laser guided freeform and cruciform weapons.  
Since they are "smart" bombs, they are included because of the commonality with the 
seekers used for more "traditional" rocker powered AGMs.<P>

<H1>Air to Air Missiles (AAMs)</H1>
</center>
<p>
<a href="aamdb.htm"><img src="aamdb.butt.gif">  AAM Database</a>
<p>
Air to Air Missiles or AAMs are used by air-superiority fighters to attack enemy aircraft 
from a minimum of 1 mile away.  In the case of the U.S. Navy's F-14 Tomcat, up to six 
simultaneous targets can be fired upon, and from ranges up to 40 miles away.  (For 
information on air-to-ground missiles, see  <a href="agm.htm">AGMs</a>).<P>
Air to Air Missiles are also used for self defense, for instance  bombers or reconaissance 
aircraft will use AAMs to keep themselves safe from opponents fighter aircraft  while performing their missions.  A more recent example is the use by helicopters on the battlefield to defend against attack fighter aircraft swooping in to 
"clean up" the battlefield.<P>
Typically AAMs are supersonic, being capable of themselves being launched while at 
supersonic speeds and accellerating to catch and destroy quickly the targeted aircraft.<P>
Modern AAMs are usually infrared guided (the seeker head of the missile makes changes 
to control surfaces as it follows the high temperature source it was aimed at) or radar 
guided (the missile's seeking head follows the target which was designated by a radar lock 
from the aircraft, and then follows on its own radar.<P>
Radar used in radar guided missiles typically uses a techinque called SARH or Semi-
Active Radar Homing.  This allows the radar to operate in a pulsed fashion, thus not 
providing a target itself to missiles which might be launched to take out radar emitters.  
(See also  AGMs ). <P>
Infrared guided missiles, as mentioned previously, are guided by the thermal energy 
"displayed" by the target aircraft.  Some have been known to be used against ground targets 
which also emit high heat signatures, but this is very rare.  The seeker for infrared guided 
missiles (also called IR seekers), tend to be very sensistive to shock.  To provide for more 
sensistivity, many seekers are cooled while on board the aircraft via low temperature 
liquids like liquid nitrogen or liquid oxygen, via aircraft refrigeration units.  When the 
rocket "leaves the rail" (i.e. is launched), the sensor begins to lose sensitivity, but is also 
getting closer to the source.<P>
Some missiles use both the IR and radar guidance methods.  This can be a radar lock on 
from the aircraft, radar guided to within pursuit range, then IR guided to terminate in 
destruction.  Or the missile could be IR designated, then when closing for the kill achieve a 
close up radar lock on and then homing in that way.<P>
In either guidance case, the AAM must attempt to catch its prey in a very short time, 
because due to weight limitations of the carrying aircraft, there is fuel only for a few 
minutes "run" to target.  With Mach 3 or Mach 4  missiles, this run is in terms of seconds.  
The target aircraft may try to maneuver drastically enough to force the missile to "fly by" or 
continue to create a condition where the missile loses its lock, even if only for a moment.  
By getting "outside the envelop" or manuevering where the missile's seeker is less 
sensitive to your aircraft, a pilot can cause the AAM to self destruct because it no longer 
has a target.<P>
AAMs typically are proximity armed, that is, they detect when they are within lethal range 
and explode, rather than waiting to actually strike the target aircraft.  This way, if a missile 
just misses striking the target aircraft, it will still be able to cause substantial damage.  And 
since the typical aspect for missile attack is from the rear, the missile will most likely 
damage critical air surfaces such as rudder, horizontal or vertical stablizers or rear 
portions of the engine.  Typically, the IR guided AAM will fly right up the target aircrafts 
engine outlet before exploding.<P>
Warheads on AAMs are typically form 10 to 40 pounds of blast fragmentation design.  One 
exception was the Genie nuclear warheaded AAM flown on the F-106 Air Defense 
Command fighter interceptor.  This missile is probably not flown anymore, but are surely 
in storage for the eventuality that one might be needed.  There are most likely a few F-106s 
left in National Guard Units. <P>

<H1>History of Aviation</H1>
The first airplane was flown by the Wright Brothers at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in 
1903.  This was little more than a powered glider.  Below are the crucial dates in aviation 
history from 1903 to 1959.  Beyond 1959, records have practically fallen daily, with the  
SR-71  or the  U-2  setting speed and altitude records all through their operational

<LI>May Day, 1960, Francis Gary Powers was shot down overflying the Soviet Union 
while flying  U-2   #56-6693 (CIA article 361, NASA aircraft 360).
<LI>
<LI>April 26, 1962, first flight of the A-12 (predecessor to the  SR-71 ) a long range 
penetration reconaissance aircraft which flew at speeds greater than Mach 3.
<LI> 
<LI>March 21, 1968, First operational flight of the SR-71.  Over the next 22 years, 
SR-71 flew 3,551 operational missions, and 385 people (pilots and RSOs) have flown 
in her over Mach 3.
<LI>
<LI>March 6, 1990, Last operational flight of the  SR-71* , sets four new speed records including 
transcontinental record of 2,112.52 mph (1:08.17 elapsed time), 2,404.05 statute mile 
course, from Edwards AFB, CA. to Dulles International Airport, Washington, D.C. 
where the aircraft was later installed in the Smithsonian Air and Space Museum's 
Ground Display outside Washington.
<LI>
<LI>June 26, 1990, rollout of the Northrop/McDonnell Douglas version of the 
Advanced Tactical Fighter (ATF), the YF-23A.
<LI>
<LI>August 27, 1990, first flight of the Northrop/McDonnel Douglas YF-23A.
<LI>
<LI>August 29, 1990, rollout of the Lockheed/General Dynamics version of the ATF, 
the YF-22A.
<LI>
<LI>July 17, 1989, B-2 Stealth bomber #21066 makes its maiden flight from the Air 
Force Plant 42, Palmdale (near Edwards AFB), CA. 
</UL>
<hr>
*  Note:  The SR-71 was retired after the indicated flight, thereby ending the operation of the most distinguished exotic aircraft ever built.  NASA received at least one of the SR-71s, and was proported to have made several flights. 
<p>
Late in 1995, the USAF quietly released the information that a few SR-71 aircraft had been taken out of mothballs and placed back into operational service beginning on an unspecified date.  Supposition is that the aircraft are needed to supplement overhead reconnaissance assets not purchased or delayed by the draw down of U.S. forces per the "peace bonus" afforded by the breakup of the former 
Soviet Union.
<p>
This also would tend to indicate that the much rumored "Aurora" spaceplane is only an author's imagination at work, or the spaceplane has been lost to unknown
reasons.  In any case, it does not seem reasonable to operate both platforms.
<p>
In 1986, there was a budget item known as the CSIRS (Covert Surviellance/Intelligence Reconaissance System) that was accidentally released off the "black"
budget request before Congress.  Whether this was actually a request to support the F-117A, a UAV, or the "Aurora" craft will remain to be seen.

<TITLE>Fighter Aircraft</TITLE>
<H1>Fighter Aircraft</H1>
The modern fighter is used either as an air-superiority aircraft, or a surface (ground, anti-
ship, or anti-submarine) attack aircraft.   In many cases the aircraft will be designed for the 
anti-submarine or close air support role, or will be a dual role aircraft.<P>
Most surface attack aircraft are sub-sonic, since the need for supersonic speed is reduced 
for ground targeting.  But the dual role aircraft such as the Navy's F/A-18 may also be 
called upon to dump ordnance and engage the enemy in the air.<P>
Modern air-superiority fighters have max speeds in the Mach 1.8 to 2.3 range, and carry 
AAMs (infrared or radar guided).  See also  ATF .<P>

<TITLE>Jet Engines</TITLE>
<H1>Jet Engines</H1>
Jet engines, or more properly, turbine engines, are based upon the idea of a central shaft connected 
to canted blades mounted like a wheel, one at the front and one at the rear.  These wheels 
are called turbines.  The front turbine is called the compressor, and its job is to take air 
into the engine, and compress it to high pressures.  A combustion chamber area takes this 
compressed air, adds fuel to it, and the fuel ignites.  The fuel and air mixture provides a 
rearward thrust, which blows out the back, as well as turns the rear turbine.  The turning 
rear turbine rotates on the central shaft, and thus spins the front turbine bringing in more 
air.<P>
At some point this process reaches a point where an equilibrium is met, and the engine will produce no more power per RPM.  Thus designers have added other 
devices to increase the thrust as need, for example, an afterburner, which injecrts
raw fuel (at dangerously prodigious rates) directly into the outlet area.  Another more efficient technique is to add larger turbines 
at the front which blow air by the outside of the engine, cooling as well 
as providing high "bypass"  air at the rear for additional thrust.  These are called turbo-fan 
engines.  
The afterburner gobbles fuel at alarming rates, so pilots do not select the afterburner for normal 
cruise, relying upon this additional thrust only for takeoff and high dash capability and then usually for only short moments to create acceleration.
<p>
More modern aircraft and engines are designed with thrust to weight ratios that
allow the aircraft to cruise at supersonic without the necessity to use the
afterburner.<P>

<TITLE>Bomber Aircraft</TITLE>
<H1>Bomber Aircraft</H1>
The modern bomber features high speed, low observable construction (the USAF B-1B 
bomber radar signature is only 14% of that of the B-52, and the USAF  B-2  is much less 
than that), and is designed to carry aloft short range attack missiles (SRAM), long range 
air-launched cruise missiles (ALCM), as well as nuclear or conventional bomb loads.<P>
One of the current bombers being phased into tactical use is the USAF FB-111 swept wing 
bomber.  A smaller aircraft, the FB-111 was both conventional and nuclear capable, with 
pinpoint bombing accuracy as one of its conventional strong points.<P>
The B-1 is a high supersonic, or low flying high-subsonic aircraft capableof low level 
penetration, while the B-2 is designed for pure stealth attack.<P>

<TITLE>Turboprop Aircraft</TITLE>
<H1>Turboprop Aircraft</H1>
Turboprop engines are basically designed around a jet engine tied to a propeller shaft.  The 
constant speed of a jet engine, combined with a variable speed, variable pitch propeller 
makes for an extremely agile propulsion unit, as well as both an economic as well as a 
efficient powerplant.  Examples today are the venerable  C-130 Hercules  built by 
Lockheed, the P-3 Orion also built by Lockheed, and the Soviet Bear Bomber.  The latter, 
in production in the Soviet Union since 1954, has a max speed of over 575 mph at 41,000 
feet., a range of 7,800 miles carrying 25,000 lbs of bombs and a un-refueled combat radius 
of 5,150 miles.   The P-3 Orion has a speed of over 473 mph and a mission radius of 2383 
miles and about half the ordance load.  The P-3  is probably a lot more agile in persecution 
of a marine target, but the Bear, with its long range, is certainly better at protecting a larger 
section of the Soviet coastline.<P>

<TITLE>Overhead Reconnaissance</TITLE>
<H1>Overhead Reconnaissance</H1>
Overhead reconnaissance provides a new "high ground" for military intelligence.  In fact 
every asset placed in space by the military serves a number of differing roles, not 
excluding useful and timely peaceful uses as well.  Overhead Reconnaissance is nothing 
more than another means for intelligence  collection .  There are two types of overhead 
reconnaissance, that performed by surveillance  aircraft  such as the  SR-71  (retired), the 
TR-1 <P>
( U-2 ), the  RC-135 , and the  F-117  and that performed by   Satellites  .   See also  
Related Articles .<P>
<H3>Satellite Reconnaissance</H3>
Satellite reconnaissance is a "modern" method for intelligence collection.  From space, 
high overhead, the satellite can peer down with cameras, and with modern resolution, make 
out remarkable details.  So efficient is this technique, that the major powers are said to 
chart where suspected recon satellites are orbiting, so that secret installations, aircraft, 
ships or troop movements can be performed when these satellites are not overhead.<P>
Because of the incredible capabilities, as well as the highly sophisticated nature of 
satellites used in this role, few real details of performance or even operation is available.  
Suffice to say that orbital physics are fixed, thus the military must use the same techniques 
for launch, tracking, and on-orbit maintenance as for either the close orbit or geo-
synchronous commercial communications satellites.<P>
And of course, one would suspect that film, camera, communications, and electronic sensor 
technology used in military satellites is at the leading edge, and most likely exceeds that 
found in the commercial satellite field.  See also  U.S. Satellite Summary .<P>
<H3>Aircraft Reconnaissance</H3>
The use of  aircraft  for reconnaissance has a long history, the first being that of a Capt. 
Pizazz who reconoiterred in an aircraft and returned to report on troop positionings.  Later 
that same year, he took photographs of enemy troops from the air.<P>
Today, a number of aircraft are used for reconaissance.  To limit the discussion, we will 
not provide details on the various ECM, EM, and other ELINT aircraft, instead we will 
concentrate on four representative types of aircraft, the  SR-71  (high speed, high altitude), 
the  U-2/TR-1  (low speed, high altitude), the lower altitude  RC-135  (Electronic 
eavesdropping), and stealth (viturally undectable future aircraft).<P>
The SR-71 was the fastest aircraft in the world when retired in June of 1990, and today 
still holds most speed and altitude records.  The aircraft is so unique, that only its 
ancestors the YF-12 and the A-12 reside in the same class of aircraft.  At greater than 
Mach 3, and higher than 85,000 feet, the SR-71 was a formidable reconaissance platform.  
And unlike satellites, the SR-71 could be on target in two days under normal 
circumstances, or significantly sooner if required.  And of course the coverage pattern of 
the SR-71 (and for that matter its cousin the U-2) is far more flexible than a satellite.  With 
its "blazing" speed, the SR-71 was also extremely hard to attack successfully, and in its 30 
year history, it was never shot down.<P>
The SR-71 was used to take photographs and of course carried a variety of other 
sensors.<P>
The U-2, also a high flyer, is subsonic, and thus is much more vulnerable to surface-to-air 
missiles.  In fact, in its history, the U-2 has been shot down at least twice that we know of 
(Francis Gary Powers over the Soviet Union, and another shot down over Cuba during the 
most tension filled days of the Cuban Crisis).<P>
The  TR-1  and its predecessor the U-2 are capable of carrying just about any kind of recon 
payload above 80,000 feet, and they have been in operation since the early fifties.    In fact 
the SR-71 was designed to be a follow on as it was felt the U-2 had a useful life of only 
three years (due to the prediction of the discovery, and the subsequent design of weaponry 
to bring the aircraft down).<P>
The  RC-135  is essentially an ELINT bird, designed to eavesdrop on their target's 
electronic emmanations.  The aircraft bristle with receiving attenna of many various types, 
and some even carry side cheeks such as that used for Side Looking Apeture Radar, used to 
peer over a border deep inside the target area without encroaching into the target country's 
airspace.  Another derivative of the RC-135 called Joint Stars is also useable as remote 
targeting sensor, allowing battlefield commanders to get relays of details of targets over 
the horizon.  This of course increases the desirability of the RC-135s as targets, and any 
other RC-135s which may be mistaken as a Joint Stars aircraft.<P>
The fourth type of reconaissance aircraft is likened to the  F-117   Stealth Fighter.  Since 
this aircraft has just recently been publicized, no details of its mission are available.  But it 
is clear that a stealthy aircraft like the F-117 has great advantages when used in the aerial 
recon role.  To be able to "sneak-up" and be virtually undetected allows for a near perfect 
reconaissance aircraft.  If the stealth implementation is good enough, acquisition by 
attacking aircraft or surface-to-air missiles radar is extremely difficult.  So even if the 
aircraft is detected, unless the guiding radar (from the ground or from the air) can continue 
to lock on and guide the attacking craft directly to the stealth aircraft, it may slip away.  
Moreover, at night, visual acquisition would be near to impossible, and a bad lock-on 
would make the aircraft impossible to shoot down.   <P>
Of course the  F-117  is proported to be a sub-sonic aircraft, so once a lock-on occurs or 
visual contact is made, it would most likely be a sitting duck.  In any case, the possibilities 
are tremendous.  Also note that in 1986, there was to have been designed the Covert 
Survivable In-weather Recon/Strike (CSIRS) aircraft (according to the ARCO Illustrated 
Guide to Spy Planes).  Other reports have indicated the concept had lost funding.  Perhaps 
another aircraft similar in function could have replaced it.  Certainly, with the nearly 
untouchable  SR-71 out of service, there may a gaping hole left in the Strategic 
Reconaissance role.<P>

<TITLE>Satellites</TITLE>
<H1>Satellites</H1>
U.S. intelligence satellites fall into several basic categories (See also:  collection )<P>
<UL>
<LI>	SIGINT (electrical sensing, including  COMINT, TELINT, RADINT, ELINT, LASINT, 
etc.)
<LI>	PHOTOINT (photo sensing...i.e. film)
<LI>	Electro-Optical (television, infrared sensors, imaging radar, etc.)
<LI>	Aggressive (anti-satellite satellite).
</UL>
In the early years of military satellites, the most common sensors were of the PHOTOINT 
variety, with infrared and SIGINT satellites following very quickly.  Today the watchword 
for overhead recon is "real time".  This literally means the gathering of data from the 
satellite and transmittal to the ground station and the "observers" on the ground, all as it 
happens.  This being a much desired upgrade over the early versions of recon satellites 
which spit out film packages or recording packages on a parachute each of which had to 
be recovered in order to get the data you desired.   Also of concern today are the  launch 
vehicles  for satellites especially since the Challenger explosion.<P>
U.S. satellites today serve one of three combinations of basic mission in terms of 
intelligence gathering:<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Dedicated :    Primary mission is to gather overhead reconaissance
<LI>	Collateral:      Military Satellite with a primary mission is other than space surveillance 
but either there is  a second set of sensors on board or the primary sensor can be used for overhead 
reconaissance. 
<LI>	Contributing:  Non-military satellites with a means for providing overhead surveillance 
as a second or lower priority.  Example:  The French SPOT satellite photography and its uses by Tactical Air Command (TAC) and the concerns for its use during the Gulf War (<a href="/milnet/gulfwar.htm">Desert Shield/Desert Storm</a>).
</UL>
<P>
<H2>Satellite Programs</H2>
There have been a number of distinct satellite programs in the public knowlege:<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Chalet renamed to Vortex (7000 series, SIGINT)
<LI>	DSP                  Defense Support Program (Ballistic missile launch and nuclear 
detonation detection)
<LI>	DSCS III            Defense Satellite Communications System ( secure SHF voice and data)
<LI>	DMSP               Defense Meteorological Support Program (weather reconnaissance)  
<LI>	GPS                   Global Positioning System
<LI>	Jumpseat           (Radar Surveillance)
<LI>	Keyhole            <a href="/milnet/declass.htm">CORONA</a> KH-4 (also LANYARD and ARGON), GAMBIT KH-7/8, HEXAGON KH-9, 
KENNAN/CRYSTAL, KH-11,"KH-12")
<LI>	LACROSSE      (Radar Imaging)   
<LI>	Magnum            (TELINT, proported to be carried aloft by the Discovery Space Shuttle)
<LI>	NUDET            Nuclear Detonation Detection System (possibly carried aboard GPS, 
DSP and DMSP)
<LI>	Rhyolite             (7600 series, re-named to  Aquacade, UHF and Microwave TELINT)
<LI>	SAMOS-2          Satellite and Missile Observation System
<LI>	VELA HOTEL   (High orbiting (60,000 miles) x-ray, gamma ray, and neutron sensing 
nuclear detection)
<LI>	White Cloud	   U.S. Navy Ocean Surveillance satellite, intercepts ships to shore, 
ship to ship and shore to ship tactical and/or strategic communications.

<H1>MILNET:  Collection of Information</h1>
<p>
According to Richelson, 
<p><blockquote>"Collection can be defined as the purposeful acquisition of any information that might be desired by analyst, consumer, or operator." <b>1</b></blockquote>
<p>
  The collection of Intelligence information can be categorized under a number of various collection methodologies:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/milnet/humint.htm">HUMINT</a>  (Human Intelligence)
 <li><a href="/milnet/techint.htm">TECHINT</a> (Technical means for collection) which includes:
<UL>    
<li><a href="/milnet/acousint.htm">ACOUSINT</a>  (Acoustic Intelligence-Underwater)
<li><a href="/milnet/comint.htm">COMINT</a> (Communications Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/elint.htm">ELINT</a>  (Electronics Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/lasint.htm">LASINT</a>  (Laser Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/photoint.htm">PHOTOINT</a>  (Photgraphic Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/radint.htm">RADINT</a>  (Radar Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/comint.htm">SIGINT</a> (Signals Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/telint.htm">TELINT</a>  (Telemetry Intelligence)
</UL>
</ul>
<p>
Collection can be accomplished by a number of surveillance or reconaissance  
methods ...i.e. by the "tailing" of someone as in human surveillance (HUMINT), 
or as in a recon satellite photographic mission...photographing military 
equipment on the ground as in <a href="overhead.htm">overhead reconaissance</a>.  Another very important element in collection are the various  <a href="/milnet/sensors.htm">sensors</a>  involved.  Also,  interpretation  of imagery, the  analysis  of collected information, and the  planning  that makes the collection operation a success, plays a huge role in the value of that information.

<h1>Bosnia:  U.S. Foreign Service Employee Shot</h1>
</center>
<p>
A U.S. Foreign Service Employee, while driving back from a visit to Kiseljak
toward Sarejevo, was shot in the back by a passing motorist, according to 
Col Max Mariner.  However, U.S. Embasssy officials do not believe the attack
was politically motivated.

<p>
The randomness of the attack indiates, in our opinion a severe danger for all
foreign travellers in the region.  The recommendation is to simply avoid this
region of the world unless you are part of diplomatic or military missions
there, and of course travel under armed bodyguard protection.

<h1>MILNET:  Travel Advisory for Colombia</h1>
</center>
The U.S. Government has announced it is revoking the visa for Ernesto Samper,
the current President
of Colombia, prohibiting him from travelling into the U.S.
<p>
The action is a culminating event in the war against drugs in the U.S. and 
is symbolic of the U.S. frustration with cooperation with the Colombian
government. In the State Department decision, it was made clear the U.S. 
government believes Samper is tied to the drug cartels and that they helped
bankroll his election. 
<p>
U.S. citizens are warned that possible retalitory actions may be in planning,
and as such U.S. citizens may be at risk in that country.  Citizens are

<h1>Moscow:  2nd Bomb on Trolly Bus</h1>
</center>
<p>
A bomb left under the seat of a Moscow trolly bus seriously injured 20 riders
in Moscow on July 11, 1996.  This is the 2nd such incident in as many days.
Moscow authorities have announced a crackdown on "undesirables in the city".
Increased police action in the city is thought to not bode well for travellers
as tensions rise.  Please see the official U.S. State Department 
<a href="http://travel.state.gov/russia_announce.html">travel warning</a> for
Russia.

<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL INFORMATION
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
Burundi - Consular Information Sheet<br>
 February 13, 1996<br>
<p>
<b><blink>Warning:</blink>  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer all 
travel to Burundi and recommends that U.S. citizens in Burundi, who 
do not consider their circumstances to afford them effective 
protection, to consider departure.  The Department of State has 
restricted U.S. Government personnel from traveling outside the 
capital due to increasing and unpredictable incidents of violence 
throughout Burundi.  Further, U.S. personnel may travel only to 
areas within Bujumbura deemed safe by the U.S. Regional Security 
Officer.  Dependents are prohibited from accompanying U.S. 
Government employees assigned to Burundi.
</b>
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  Burundi is a small, inland African nation 
passing through a period of instability following a coup attempt in 
October 1993.  Facilities for tourism, particularly in the interior, 
are limited.
<p>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A visa, and evidence of immunization against 
yellow fever and meningococcal meningitis are required.  Only those 
travelers resident in countries where there is no Burundian Embassy 
are eligible for entry stamps, without a visa, at the airport upon 
arrival.  These entry stamps are not a substitute for a visa, which 
must be obtained from the Immigration Service within 24 hours of 
arrival.  Travelers who have failed to obtain a visa will not be 
permitted to leave the country.  Travelers should obtain the latest 
information and details from the Embassy of the Republic of Burundi, 
Suite 212, 2233 Wisconsin Avenue, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20007; 
telephone (202) 342-2574 or the Permanent Mission of Burundi to the 
United Nations in New York, telephone (212) 687-1180.  Overseas 
inquiries may be made at the nearest Burundian embassy or consulate.
<p>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  In light of the October 1993 coup attempt 
and subsequent ethnic/political tensions, all areas of the country 
are potentially unstable.  Sporadic violence remains a problem, in 
Bujumbura as well as in the interior where large numbers of 
displaced persons are encamped or in hiding.  Local authorities 
cannot guarantee safety.  The U.S. Embassy has reiterated the 
importance of using extreme caution, and respecting any curfews in 
effect, with no travel to the troubled neighborhoods of the capital. 
 Burundi periodically has closed its land borders without notice and 
suspended air travel and telephone service in response to political 
disturbances.  
<p>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>  Medical facilities are limited in Burundi.  
Doctors and hospitals often expect immediate cash payment for health 
care services.  U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside 
the United States.  The Medicare/Medicaid program does not provide 
for payment of medical services outside the United States.  
Travelers have found that supplemental medical insurance with 
specific overseas and medical evacuation coverage has proven to be 
useful.  For additional health information, travelers can contact 
the Centers For Disease Control and Prevention's international 
travelers hotline, telephone (404) 332-4559.
<p>
<b>Information on Crime:</b>  Street crime in Burundi poses a high risk 
for visitors.  Crime involves muggings, purse-snatching, 
pickpocketing, burglary, and auto break-ins.  Criminals operate 
individually or in small groups.  There have been reports of 
muggings of persons jogging or walking alone in all sections of 
Bujumbura, and especially on public roads bordering Lake Tanganyika. 
 The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported 
immediately to local police and to the nearest U.S. Embassy or 
Consulate.  The pamphlets "A Safe Trip Abroad" and "Tips for 
Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on 
protecting personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in the region in 
general.  Both are available from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.
<p>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the 
country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use 
or trafficking in illegal drugs are strictly enforced.  Convicted 
offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.
<p>
<b>In-Country Travel:</b>  Given the fragile security situation, travelers 
should check with the U.S. Embassy in Bujumbura before traveling out 
of the capital.  Burundi has a good network of roads between the 
major towns and border posts.  Travel on other roads is difficult, 
particularly in the rainy season.  Public transportation to border 
points is often difficult and frequently unavailable.
<p>
<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens are encouraged to 
register with the consular section of the U.S. Embassy in Bujumbura 
on the Avenue des Etats-Unis, and to obtain updated information on 
travel and security.  The mailing address is B.P. 34, 1720 
Bujumbura.  The telephone number is (257) 223-454. 
<p>
 No. 96-026
<p>
This replaces the information sheet dated October 6, 1995, to 
include a revised Travel Warning issued December 29, 1995.

<h1>Rwanda</h1>
<hr>
<p>
<h2>STATE DEPARTMENT TRAVEL WARNING
</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>Rwanda - Consular Information Sheet</b><br>
April 17, 1996<p>

<b>Warning:</b>  The Department of State warns U.S. citizens to defer travel to Rwanda.  Sporadic
fighting continues inside Rwanda; border areas in particular have been the site of low-key
insurgent outbreaks.  Further, poor communication, transportation, and health services continue
to make travel in Rwanda difficult and potentially hazardous.  The U.S. Embassy in Kigali
resumed consular services on July 26, 1995.<p>

<b>Country Description:</b>  Rwanda is a central/east African country recovering from years of ethnic
and political strife that culminated in a three-month civil war ending in July 1994.  Infrastructure
damaged in the war is slowly being repaired but services such as telephone, electricity, and water
are not reliable, particularly outside the capital city of Kigali.  Tourism facilities in Rwanda are
very limited.  International air services generally operate on schedule.  Public transportation is
almost non-existent.<p>

<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  A passport, a visa, and evidence of yellow fever immunization are
required.  Airport visas are not available.  Travelers should obtain the latest information and
details from the Embassy of the Republic of Rwanda, 1714 New Hampshire Ave., NW,
Washington D.C. 20009, Tel: 202-232-2882.  Overseas, inquiries may be made at the nearest
Rwandan embassy or consulate.<p>

<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  While there has been no open warfare in Rwanda since July 1994, border
areas continue to suffer from low-key insurgent attacks, especially along the western and southern
frontiers with Zaire and Burundi, where there are large concentrations of refugees.  Although
such violence is generally not directed against foreign visitors, there is a danger of being caught in
the middle of the fighting.  Random and unpredictable use of land mines has increased nationwide
since January 1996, particularly along unpaved roads in the western border areas of Cyangugu,
Kibuye, Gisenyi, and Ruhengeri prefectures.  Travelers are subjected to frequent stops at
roadblocks throughout the country, during which their vehicles and luggage may be searched. 
Curfews are also sporadically applied in some areas and may not be apparent to visitors.<p>

<b>Medical Facilities:  </b>Medical facilities are extremely limited and dependent on irregular utility
service.  Trained medical personnel are in short supply; doctors and hospitals usually expect cash
payment for services and will not accept U.S. medical insurance.  The Medicare/Medicaid
Program does not provide for payment of medical services outside the United States. 
Supplemental medical insurance with specific overseas coverage and a medical evacuation
provision is recommended.  Travelers generally bring their own supplies of prescription drugs and
preventive medicines.  For additional health information, travelers may contact the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers hotline at (404) 332-4559.<p>

<b>Information on Crime:  </b>Pickpocketing in crowded public places is common as is petty theft
from cars and hotel rooms.  The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported
immediately to local police and to the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The pamphlets "A Safe
Trip Abroad" and "Tips for Travelers to Sub-Saharan Africa" provide useful information on
protecting personal security while traveling abroad and on travel in the region in general.  Both
are available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office,
Washington, D.C. 20402.<p>

<b>Currency Regulations:  </b>The Rwandan franc is freely exchangeable for hard currencies in
bureaux de change and banks.  Several Kigali banks can efficiently handle wire transfers from U.S.
banks; banks outside Kigali are slowly re-opening.  Credit cards are acceptable at only a few
hotels in Kigali and travelers should expect to handle most expenses in cash.<p>

<b>Registration/Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens who plan to enter Rwanda are encouraged to
register at the U.S. Embassy located at Boulevard de la Revolution, B.P. 28, Kigali.  The
telephone is (250) 75601/75602 and the fax is (250) 72128.<p>

No. 96-085<p>

This replaces the Consular Information Sheet issued September 13, 1995 to update the
information on Areas of Instability.<p>

<B>Serbia and Montenegro - Consular Information Sheet</B><BR>
 January 31, 1996
<p>
<b>Country Description:</b>  The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) is a moderately developed European country undergoing profound political and economic change.  In January 1996, the U.S. implemented the suspension of UN economic sanctions.  U.S. citizens and companies may now undertake normal business and personal transactions involving the export and import of goods to and from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.  Tourist facilities are widely available, but conditions vary considerably and some services and supplies found in other European countries are unavailable.<P>
<b>Entry Requirements:</b>  U.S. citizens require a passport and visa.  Visas should be obtained prior to departure from the U.S. as they are not normally granted at land border points, and never granted at airports.  The Embassy of the Former Republic of Yugoslavia at 2410 California Street, N.W., Washington, D.C. 20008, telephone (202) 462-6566, may be contacted for updated entry requirements.  Visitors staying in private homes need to register with police immediately upon arrival; failure to comply may result in a fine, imprisonment and/or expulsion.<P>
<b>Areas of Instability:</b>  The potential for violent incidents persists throughout the country.  Ethnic tensions remain high, particularly in the Kosovo and Sandzak regions.  Travelers may be stopped by government militia at any time and should be prepared to cooperate.  Border regions, particularly near Croatia and along the Drina River, are sensitive areas.<P>
<b>Medical Facilities:</b>   Although many physicians are highly trained, hospitals and clinics are generally not equipped and maintained to U.S. standards.  Medicines and basic medical supplies are usually available in private pharmacies.  Because U.S. medical insurance is not always valid outside the United States, travelers have found that supplemental insurance with overseas coverage, including specific provision for air evacuation, has proven beneficial.  However, even with special coverage, payment is required in cash at the time of service.  Further information on health matters can be obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's international travelers hotline, telephone (404) 332-4559.<P>
<b>Crime Information:</b>  There is a continuing trend toward lawlessness and disorder.  Robberies are often perpetrated near railroad and bus stations, on public transport, and in city centers.  Violent crime has increased dramatically, with many incidents taking place in broad daylight at popular public places.  Possession of firearms (including grenades and mines) is widespread and weapons are frequently discharged in public.<P>
The loss or theft abroad of a U.S. passport should be reported immediately to the local police and the nearest U.S. embassy or consulate.  The Department of State's pamphlet "A Safe Trip Abroad" provides useful information on protecting personal security and possessions while traveling abroad.  It is available from the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402.<P>
<b>Currency Information:</b>  All currency must be declared upon entry and a customs receipt issued.  Failure to produce this receipt upon departure may result in all funds being confiscated.  Credit cards, personal checks and traveler's checks are generally not accepted.<P>
<b>Drug Penalties:</b>  U.S. citizens are subject to the laws of the country in which they are traveling.  Penalties for possession, use or trafficking in illegal drugs are strict, and convicted offenders can expect jail sentences and fines.<P>
<b>Internal Travel:</b>  The suspension of sanctions and increased commercial traffic across the border have added to long delays when entering the country by car or bus.  Purchase of third party insurance is required for cars.  Road tolls for foreign registered vehicles are very high.  Overland travel between Serbia and Croatia and between Montenegro and Croatia generally is not possible for private individuals.<P>
<b>Registration and Embassy Location:</b>  U.S. citizens may register with the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade and obtain updated information on travel and security in Serbia and Montenegro.  The Embassy is located at Kneza Milosa 50, telephone (381)(11) 645-655.  The after hours telephone number is (381) (11) 646-481.<P>
No. 96-006<P>
This replaces the Consular Information Sheet dated November 2, 1994, to remove the travel warning, delete sanctions information and update all information.

today for a historic event.  Vice President Gore is here to announce the 
signing of an Executive Order declassifying imagery from our early 
intelligence satellite systems.  Within 18 months, imagery from the 
CORONA, ARGON, and LANYARD systems will be available to the public 
through the National Archives and the US Geological Survey. <p>
These satellite systems are obsolete now, but in their time they played 
a pivotal role in our national security.  As we debate the role and 
mission of intelligence in the next century, it is important to 
understand how the images sent back by these early satellites altered 
our view of the world during the Cold War and how satellite imagery 
continues to shape our worldview today.
<p>
I would like to focus on one system--CORONA.  CORONA was conceived in 
the late 1950's, an era when facts were scarce and fears were rampant.  
The size and nature of the Soviet threat were largely unknown, but many 
believed that the United States was falling dangerously behind Moscow in 
critical areas.  The Soviet threat grew in the imagination of the public 
as our leaders debated the supposed "bomber gap," the "missile gap," and 
the "science gap."  The successful launch of Sputnik in 1957 even raised 
public fears that the Soviets would drop bombs on the US from space.  
<p>
In 1958, President Eisenhower approved a program that would answer our 
questions about Soviet missile capabilities and replace risky U-2 
reconnaissance flights over Soviet territory.  The CIA and the Air Force 
would jointly develop satellites to photograph denied areas from space.  
That program had both a secret mission and a secret name--CORONA.
<p>
The CIA and Air Force developed this first-generation space program with 
great speed and tight secrecy.  In August of 1960, we successfully 
launched a CORONA satellite and recovered the film capsule it dropped 
from space.  It was 110 days after Moscow shot down the U-2 aircraft 
piloted by Gary Powers, ending U-2 flights over Soviet territory.  
During the next 12 years, CORONA satellites would usher in a new era of 
technical intelligence and a new era of "firsts."
<p>
The CORONA system successfully photographed its first intelligence 
target on August 18, 1960.  We have that image here on the left; it 
shows a military airfield near Mys Schmidta, on the Chukchi Sea in 
far-northeastern Russia.  By today's standards, the image looks fuzzy 
and distant, but technical advances soon produced sharper pictures.  The 
image on the right, taken in 1966, shows a Soviet Long-Range Aviation 
Airfield near Dolon, Kazakhstan.
<p>
Such pictures held enormous significance for the course of the Cold 
War.  They provided information that allowed our leaders to weigh the 
Soviet threat and measure our response.  CORONA debunked the missile 
gap.  It allowed us to base our national security strategy--and 
spending--on facts rather than fear, on information rather than 
imagination.  These images, combined with the expertise of photo 
interpreters and analysts on the ground, provided us with precise 
information on our adversaries' offensive and defensive capabilities.  
Continuing advances in surveillance and reconnaissance technology 
allowed the United States to closely monitor the development, testing, 
production, and deployment of weapons in denied areas.
<p>
CORONA ushered in technological firsts that contributed to advancements 
in other areas.  The program taught us how to recover objects from 
orbit--methods that were adapted by NASA to recover astronauts.  It gave 
us a fast and relatively inexpensive way to map the earth from space.  
Before CORONA, cartographers had adequately mapped only a quarter of the 
earth's surface.  CORONA also provided the first stereo-optical images 
from space, which gave photo interpreters a 3-dimensional view of terrain.  
<p>
The most important contribution of the CORONA system to national 
security came from the intelligence it provided.  CORONA looked through 
the Iron Curtain and helped to lay the groundwork for disarmament 
agreements and the collapse of the Berlin Wall.  With satellites, we 
could verify reductions in missiles without on-site inspections.  
Satellite imagery gave the United States the confidence to enter into 
negotiations and to sign arms control treaties with the Soviet Union.  
Successor programs continued to monitor ICBM sites, and verify strategic 
arms agreements and the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.
<p>
The CORONA program has now taken its place in history, but satellite 
imagery continues to play a vital role today.  Satellite imagery 
confirmed that North Korea was developing an offensive nuclear 
capability in the early nineties and gave us early warning when Saddam 
Hussein deployed two elite Republican Guard Divisions to the Kuwaiti 
border last Fall.
<p>
The lessons of the CORONA program can tell us much about how the 
Intelligence Community operates today.
<p>
First, CORONA demonstrated that the ability to adapt rapidly to a 
changing world is critical to the success of US intelligence.  The CIA 
and Air Force pushed the CORONA program at breakneck pace, because we 
knew that the Soviets were working on countermeasures against the U-2.  
While the Soviets developed ways to hide their weapons programs from 
CORONA, American intelligence experts were working on the next 
generation of satellites to defeat those measures.  For the Intelligence 
Community, this process of adaptation has been continuous.  The need to 
adapt will grow even more acute as the pace of technological advancement 
increases.  It is not enough to answer the questions that policymakers 
and military commanders ask today, we must anticipate the questions they 
will ask in the next century.  We must design the technologies, methods, 
and collection strategies that will provide the answers.
<p>
The second lesson--satellites alone don't provide answers, you need 
experts on the ground to tell them where to look, to analyze the images, 
and to get information quickly to the people who need it.  To give you 
an example from Desert Storm; after Iraq invaded Kuwait, our analysts 
anticipated that Saddam might release stored oil into the gulf.  Early 
on 24 January, shortly after the war began, satellites sent images of a 
massive oil slick forming around Kuwait's offshore oil loading 
facilities.  Analysts were well prepared.  They had studied the Kuwaiti 
oil facilities and knew how the oil flowed through manifold valves to 
the offshore terminal.  They provided the military with the precise 
location of the manifold and an image of the target.  On 26 January
 laser-guided bombs struck the manifolds, greatly reducing the flow of 
oil.  It was a success that involved people from across the Intelligence 
Community working in cooperation with the military.  The Pentagon later 
released the footage of the bombing tha t we all saw on TV news. 
<p>
The third lesson from the CORONA system--it is cheaper to counter a 
known threat than an imagined threat.  Just as military planners in 1960 
needed to know Soviet missile capabilities to make prudent decisions, 
today's planners need to know which countries are developing weapons of 
mass destruction, how long it will be until such weapons are 
operational, and what systems these countries have for delivering weapons.
<p>
The fourth lesson--secrecy for current collection systems is critical.  
The more the adversary knows about the collection system, the faster and 
cheaper he can develop measures to counter it.  That principle applied 
in the era of Nikita Khrushchev and it applies in the era of Saddam 
Hussein.  We must constantly weigh national security interests against a 
real need for greater openness.
<p>
The final lesson from the CORONA program is that these intelligence 
systems are valuable assets that belong to the American people.  We 
should declassify them when their secrets are no longer critical to 
national security.  Film from these early broad-area-search systems 
still contains a wealth of information.
<p>
When he was in the Senate, Vice President Gore led an effort to make 
this data available for environmental studies.  He approached former DCI 
Robert Gates with the idea and their discussions led to the formation of 
the Environmental Task Force in the spring of 1992.  The purpose of the 
task force was to determine how we could apply classified systems and 
data to environmental studies.
<p>
At the same time, the Central Imagery Office conducted an extensive 
review of classification policy and procedures under a DCI 
Classification Review Task Force.  That group, made up of both military 
and civilian members, concluded that the declassification of the 
satellite imagery collected by the obsolete, broad-area-search satellite 
systems does not present a risk to national security.
<p>
Just as CORONA gave the Intelligence Community a view through the Iron 
Curtain, today that program offers information that can open doors not 
only for environmentalists, but also for scientists, scholars, and historians.
<p>
The process of bringing these early spy satellites in from the cold has 
been long.  We are working on ways to provide critical information to 
people who need it sooner, without compromising national security concerns.
<p>
Before I turn over the podium, I would like to call your attention to 
this camera from the CORONA Program.  Later this year, we will transfer 
the camera to the Smithsonian to commemorate the 35th anniversary of the 
beginning of CORONA.  On 24 May, there will be an unclassified symposium 
on the revolution in intelligence collection and analysis inaugurated by 
the CORONA system.  That evening, there will be a commemoration ceremony 
at the Smithsonian to honor Americans who made major contributions to the pr
ogram.
<p>
At this time it is my pleasure to introduce Vice President Gore, who 
played a key role in bringing about the Executive Order on imagery 
declassification.

<H2>DCI Speech 5/23/95</H2>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>DCI John M. Deutch's Address to CSI CORONA Symposium</h3>
<p>
	Good morning.  It is a pleasure to participate 
in this conference on the CORONA program.  I would 
like to welcome all of the distinguished 
representatives of government, academia, and 
industry who are here today and thank you for 
taking the time to participate.  I want to 
especially thank George Washington University and 
its Space Policy Institute for cosponsoring this 
event with the Center for the Study of 
Intelligence.
<p>
	It is hard to project ourselves back to an era 
when we knew so little about the most important 
national security challenge of the day.  We knew 
that in 1953 the Soviets had tested a hydrogen 
bomb;  that in August 1957 they had successfully 
tested an intercontinental ballistic missile; that 
in October, they had launched Sputnik.  
<p>
	Beyond that, however, we had little hard 
evidence of the real military capabilities of the 
Soviet Union.  Many believed that the Soviets were 
far ahead of the United States in developing and 
producing guided missiles.  In the absence of 
reliable information about the nature of the Soviet 
threat, we had no choice but to build up our own 
forces.  
<p>
	Unknown to the public, our leaders got their 
first look behind the iron curtain through 
photographs from the U-2 reconnaissance plane.  As 
President Eisenhower and the Intelligence Community 
well knew, however, the U-2 was a limited and an 
interim solution.  It only covered a fraction of 
the territory of the Soviet Union.  Its flights 
were infrequent and each carried enormous physical 
risks for the pilot and political risks for the 
country.  But the U-2 did show us things we had 
never seen, from the nuclear test sites at Novaya 
Zemlya and Semipalatinsk to the missile launch 
facility at Tyuratam.   When a Soviet missile 
brought down Gary Power's plane in May of 1960, it 
left an intelligence gap that stretched across the 
11 time zones of the Soviet Union.  
<p>
	Exactly 110 days later, pictures from a CORONA 
satellite began to fill this intelligence gap with 
a quantity and quality of information unimaginable 
before.   
<p>
	Today, you will be hearing from many experts 
who participated in the CORONA project.  I would 
like to focus on just a few elements of the process 
that led to CORONA because I believe this history 
has relevance for today.  The elements contain 
simple lessons that should be relearned.  These 
elements are: (1) the process that led to the 
decision to build CORONA, (2) the characteristics 
of the industry-government team that accomplished 
this goal in such a short time and under such 
enormous pressure, and (3) the significance of that 
first successful satellite reconnaissance mission. 
<p>
(1) The Impetus for CORONA.  I take some pride that 
two individuals related to MIT were important 
driving forces behind the decision to build a 
photoreconnaissance satellite system.  Jim Killian 
Jr., president of MIT, chaired the Killian 
Committee, which was established to examine the 
threat of any surprise enemy attack on the United 
States.  Din Land, of the Polaroid Corporation, 
chaired a subcommittee responsible for finding ways 
to monitor Soviet military capabilities.  
<p>
	The concept of this CORONA photoreconnaissance 
system was first broached in late 1957.  The 
charter of the system was no less than to resolve 
the great debate over the number and capabilities 
of Soviet missiles targeted on the United States.  
In other words, to take the dimensions of the 
missile gap, if one existed.  At that time, 
however, the United States was still more than 
three months away from successfully launching its 
first small satellite.  
<p>
	President Eisenhower formally endorsed the 
project in February of 1958.  CORONA moved forward 
in a series of swift decisions, hastily-called 
meetings, and short memoranda.  The DCI's 
memorandum approving funding for CORONA's 
photographic payload, for example, is a model of 
simplicity.  In three short paragraphs, it commits 
seven million dollars to this phase of the project.  
<p>
	Today, such haste would seem a recipe for 
disaster.  But in a little more than two years 
time, we had the first successful recovery of film 
from space on 18 August, 1960.  The lesson here is 
when there is an intelligence need, the 
intelligence community and the highest governmental 
leadership can and should take prompt action to 
collect the information needed to make critical 
national security decisions.  
<p>
2. The Team.  A CIA/Air Force/industry team made 
this achievement possible.  CORONA was managed 
jointly by the Central Intelligence Agency and the 
US Air Force.  The CIA Project Director was Richard 
M. Bissell, Jr., the Special Assistant to the DCI 
for Planning and Development.  Brig. Gen. Osmund 
Ridland was in charge of Air Force CORONA support 
for Maj. Gen. Bernard A. Schriever.  They brought 
in an industry team that included Lockheed Missiles 
& Space Company, Itek Corporation, Fairchild Camera 
& Instrument Corporation, Eastman Kodak, General 
Electric, and Douglas Aircraft Company.
<p>
	The government and industry team pulled 
together a group of talented individuals who could 
turn this concept into reality in a very short 
time.  They had to reach out for the best 
technology and expertise that private industry 
could offer.  They had to encourage innovation and 
collegial effort and they had to accomplish all of 
this under conditions of the utmost secrecy.  
<p>
	This team had enormous technical obstacles to 
overcome and no time for lengthy preliminary 
studies.  They suffered a number of mission 
failures, each with a unique cause:  weakness in 
the reentry system, camera malfunction, or failure 
in the recovery system.  Richard Bissell fought for 
the time to move the program from failure to 
success.  
<p>
	The lesson here is that when the government and 
industry work together on an important project, it 
is possible to achieve great results in a short 
period of time at surprisingly low cost.  Today, 
unfortunately, except perhaps in the intelligence 
area, the relationship between government sponsor 
and industry performer is too often adversarial. 
<p>
3.  The consequences of the project
<p>
	Once success was achieved, it was spectacular.  
The first capsule successfully recovered from 
CORONA contained 3,000 feet of film and covered 
more than 1,650,000 square miles of Soviet 
territory.  This was more overhead photographic 
coverage of the Soviet Union than the U-2 obtained 
in all of its 24 flights over Soviet territory.
<p>
	CORONA marked the beginning of an explosion of 
intelligence data.  As Richard Bissell said, 
overnight we went from "famine to feast" in terms 
of intelligence information.  In sum, decisions in 
Washington were made with the benefit of hard 
information.  That situation profoundly altered the 
course of the Cold War and was probably 
instrumental in keeping us back from the nuclear 
threshold.
<p>
	But, for me the important lesson of CORONA is 
the role that technology can play in intelligence.  
At the right time, taking advantage of an advance 
in technology can revolutionize the business of 
intelligence.  Today, we should not lose sight of 
the need to boldly grasp the opportunities that new 
technology presents.
<p>
Openness.  Satellite photoreconnaissance was 
nothing short of a revolution--for intelligence 
analysis, for the conduct of foreign policy, for 
the planning of our defense strategy.  It was a 
revolution, however, that had to be kept from the 
American public for many years for legitimate 
security reasons. 
<p>
	That brings me to the final point I will 
emphasize today, the opportunity for openness in 
the Intelligence Community.  As CORONA 
demonstrates, intelligence has played a vital role 
in our history.  We have an obligation to explain 
that role to the public when it is appropriate to 
do so, that is when the national security is not 
jeopardized by releasing information about sources 
and methods.
<p>
	The idea of declassifying the CORONA program 
has been around for a long time.  We know, back in 
1972, former DCI Richard Helms, who has been kind 
enough to join us today, was talking about 
eventually declassifying the program.  This step 
has taken much longer than he probably anticipated.  
There were two catalysts that finally spurred the 
effort to release this information to the public:  
the end of the Cold War, and the determination of 
then-Senator Gore, who led an effort to make this 
data available for environmental studies.  He 
approached former DCI Robert Gates with the idea in 
the spring of 1992.  
<p>
	In February, the President signed an executive 
order declassifying imagery from the early 
satellite systems, CORONA, ARGON, and LANYARD.  
This historical resource will be available to the 
public through the National Archives and the US 
Geological Survey, and will even be available on 
the Internet.
<p>
	The release of the imagery is only one aspect 
of the story.  This conference is also part of a 
larger effort to educate the public about the role 
of intelligence in US history and to share 
information with academia and the public.  One of 
the challenges for intelligence today is to decide 
what can be released to the public. 
<p>
	Telling the story of CORONA is the easy part of 
the openness policy.  The story is positive, and 
the rapid pace of technological change has made the 
decision to declassify imagery from these obsolete 
systems much easier.  It is important, however, for 
the Intelligence Community to be just as open about 
the stories that are not so positive.  We are 
determined to do that.  
<p>
New Challenges.  Before I conclude, I would like to 
point out that the experience of CORONA remains 
relevant.  Imagery continues to play an important 
role in countering today's threats, from monitoring 
the North Korean nuclear program, to keeping track 
of the movements of Iraq's army.  
<p>
	One of the things I intend to do to ensure that 
we get the most out of our imagery capabilities is 
to establish a National Imagery Agency that will 
pull together all aspects of collection, analysis, 
and distribution of imagery.  We need to go beyond 
the technical magic of space photos, to develop 
better ways to present this information to the 
people who need it, from the President, to the 
military commander on the battlefield.
<p>
	As we search for new ways to apply technology 
to intelligence challenges, we would do well to 
study the experience of the CORONA team.  Their 
determination, innovative spirit, and the 
enormously productive partnership they established 
between industry and government is a model of 
effective problem-solving.  Once again, I would 
like to salute all of the people who were involved 
in the CORONA project.

<p>
<p>
The following glossary presents brief explanations for commonly used terms in the use and development of WorldWide Web servers.
<p>
<dl compact>
<b><dt>WWW</b>
<dd><b>World Wide Web</b>, the core system for the graphical presentation of information over the Internet.  Servers are linked via the Internet to users who request data from the servers, and in some cases may input data (ordering information or simply comments).
<p>
<b><dt>Web Servers</b>
<dd>A Web Server is a series of pages stored on the host computer where different "Information Providers" place the information viewed by users.  But don't confuse Web Server with host computer (sometimes the two are in essence the same entity, but not always...for instance, the host computer the OneStep Internet Services Web Server is residing on actually is the home for many different home pages and thus appears to be a virtual web server).
<p>
<b><dt>Host Computer</b>
<dd>This terminology comes from the development of the client/server model of computing, where a server provides services to clients (users) upon request.  A Web Server providese information when the user makes a request while using an application on their PC, X Terminal, or Workstation.  The application in this case is the client, and the server is the host computer.
<p>
<b><dt>Home Page</b> 
<dd>The home page is nothing more than the first page for a particular Web Server area...i.e. the first page of the OneStep Internet Services web server.  A home page usually servers as the top layer in a heirarchy of lower level pages, each which allow the user to move down into different categories of interest before arriving at the actual information they wish to see.  Remember, multiple home pages can reside on a single host computer.
<p>
<b><dt>Browser</b>
<dd>A web Browser is nothing more than a special application which allows end users to view the Home Page and any pages below it in the web server's heirarchy.  For instance, the page you are reading has been formatted by your browser so you see some indented descriptions that make up this glossary.
To see what this "page" really looks like, look at the file or edit menu to find the "View Source" option.   This will display the "HTML" encoded text which the browser program must interpret.
<p>
<b><dt>HTML</b>
<dd><b>Heiarchical Text Markup Language</b>.  This is the standard method for using symbols such as <b>;lt&ADDRESS;lt&/a></b> to indicate how a particular web page should be formatted.  Formatting can include bold or italicized text, adding header test of various sizes, or the formatting that creates this indented list you are now reading.

<p>
Okay, good decision (if you look at the NT branch, we say the same thing...either choice is good).  If you choose a SUN OS platform, you should immediately start looking at the public domain <a href="http://hoohoo.ncsa.uiuc.edu/">Httpd</a> source code available.  There will probably be ready to roll executable code availabe as well.  In fact, the SUN environment is well understood on the Internet. If you want some info on commercially supported software for SUN or SGI platforms, there are a few web pages that will help in the the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/world_wide_web/HTTP/Servers/Platforms/">Yahoo</a> collection. 
<p>
If you are looking at a very low cost approach, then you might consider using SCO Open Enterprise servers.  This is one of the approaches we have tried (actually was are NT, SUN OS, and SCO capable).  If you choose SCO, there are a number of special considerations you must make...Here is what you need to price before finalizing your decision.
<ul>
<b><li></b>486, 33Mhz minimum (don't buy a Pentium if you are using 14.400 baud and PPP...a 486 will stay ahead of the datacomm, no problem!), 
16MB RAM (more is better), 200MB disk space (more is better).  If you're installiing NT or SCO, you only really need a 640X480 VGA card, but higher res is more fun.  
Obviously your monitor should match your VGA card.
We recommend you go SCSI interface for Disks and CDROMs...it costs more but allows you more flexibility as you grow your server requirements (moving a SCSI disk to a new system is easier than any other).
<p>
You'll need a SCSI tape drive (set to SCSI address #2) to load SCO Open Server.  Version 3.0 is quite acceptable.  If you find a good deal on 
an older version, don't take it. The older versions run okay, but it is far to easy to screw up the instalation to the point you will never get your httpd server running.  Plus, 3.0 has some basic installation features that make it so much easier to install without screwing up.
<p>
<b><li></b>You should buy yourself a 16 bit or better NE2000 compatible network card.  We recommend this cuz the NE2000 compatibles easily transport across all OS and hardware environments in the Intel based server world.  The card will offer you great utility for years.
<p>
<b><li></b>For http software (that's the server software that makes web pages available over the Internet), you really have to buy it from SCO if you're using OPen Server.  Fortunately, the "Global Access" server product is acceptable, and is only around $150.  SCO Open Desktop may appear to be more expensive than say Microsft NT, but it is loaded with TCP/IP features, making it a good buy for any kind of expansion later on . 
<p>
Now a word to our friends visiting from NT land. Much of the Internet is implemented in UNIX environments.  Certainly the networking is TCP/IP expert land at the least.  So when we start talking about building UNIX systems for Web Servers,
we are going to relate to the UNIX and TCP/IP audience.  You Windows gurus will just have to ignore the UNIX and TCP/IP rhetoric as best as you can.<p>
<p>
Installing SCO Open Server 3.0 is actually quite easy.  In fact, so easy, that we will only list those things you need to have handy before you start...
<ol>
<b><li></b>
Initial load  - Chunk in the tape (150MB QIK-150 format), and boot the machine.
<b><li></b>If your SCSI card wasn't in the list from the installation guide, you may need to learn how to change it to the correct SCSI info via the "Boot" string method.
<b><li></b>If necessary you may to slip in the SCSI driver disk and go through 
the disk.  
<b><li></b>
You'll need your domain name, i.e. yourdomain.com, your assigned IP address, and most importantly have the installation serial number and activiation key close by, SCO won't as for this until after the lion share of the installation is done, and not having it ready to enter into the appropriate place  may mean you have to reload the whole system.
<b><li></b>
SCO Open Server installation will ask a number of questions up front, almost eliminating the need to answer any further questions later on during the installation.  
<b><li></b>
Choose all the installation options with Open Server 3.0.  But if you decide to try to limit the amount of disk space used, you really only need the basic system plus the networking options.
<b><li></b>Once the tape draw completes, the actual installation script will run.  
<b><li></b>
<b><li></b>Eventually you are asked to reboot the system.  Things get interesting again.
</ol>
<p>
<p>
<h2>
Installing Mail, NFS, and NIS</h2>
<p>
Before installing the Global Access package, you'll want to install Mail, NFS, and NIS.  This prepares the system for upgrades in these three areas during the Global Access installation.  Follow the Open Server Installation and Release Notes to make these changes easy.  You might look into purchasing the Open Server Administration manual so you will have a good reference book on hand during you instalation.
<p>
A number of sites may need to be true Primary Domain sites, and thus will need some special help on configuring <a href="nishelp.htm">NIS</a>.  Fortunately SCO does a good job with Global Access.
<p>
Once you have the three utilities above installed, then its time to install Global Access.  Global Access is installed just like any other custom application on SCO, by using the "custom" command.  Once the upgrade has been read from tape, you will be asked to run the "mkdev internet" command.  You will need the following information...
<p>
<ul>
<li>The IP address of the gateway (the machine your PPP links calls into)
<li>The name of the gateway machinee (teh full name thank you very much)
<li>The IP address of the Internet provider's nameserver
<li>The name of the Internet provider's nameserver machine
<li>Your machine's IP address
</ul>
<p>
Global Access will modify some key files for you in order to get the PPP link configured properly.  In order to adequalty test and maintain the PPP interface, we
recommmend you look at how Global Access modifies the following files:
<p>
<code>/usr/lib/uucp/Dialers<br>
/usr/lib/uucp/Systems<br>
/usr/lib/uucp/Devices<br>
/etc/rc2.d/S85tcp<br>
</code><p>
We also find what we believe is a major bug in the SCO implementation, the 
<code>named</code> nameserver startup script does not handle the file
<code>/etc/resolv.conf.d</code> properly.  Modify this script to do the following
if the administrator request startup of NIS...
<p>
<code>mv resolv.conf.d resolv.conf</code>
<p>
Also, in the "stop" section of the script, you will need to do the following:
<code>mv resolv.conf resolv.conf.d</code>
<p>
You might to look this script over.  There are a number of holes in the way
SCO handles the NIS startup...for instance, if the script fails, a later invokation will most likely clobber the resolv.conf and named.boot files.  Serious trouble here!
<p>
Another problem, is that the Global Access's script for "mkdev internet" (which is run after the installation has been completed), changes the permissions on <code>/etc/routed</code>, so that it won't run, wile at the same time adding a "static" route which points at the PPP host (your gateway to the Internet).  
<p>
We believe this (and perhaps the lack of a <code>gated</code> configuation prevents the machine with global access configured, to act as a gateway to teh 
internet for other machines on your local LAN.  Course, this might be a nice 
feature if you have machines you don't want on the net.  But if the converse is true, i.e. you  want to add a number of servers to the web, then you will need to take some special action.  At this point we should recommend a good text on networking...so we will!:
<p>
O'Reilly & Associates, Inc. has an excellent text whch can help you with setting up for connection to the Internet.  The title is <i><b>TCP/IP Network Administration</b>/i>.  The copy I have seen as a big 'ole crab drawing on the front.  (ISBN 0-937175-82-X).

</center><H1>OneStep Internet Services Provider Services - Do Your Own NT 
</h1>
<p>
Okay, good decision (if you look at the UNIX branch, we say the same thing...either choice is good).  Here is what you need to price before finalizing your decision.
<ul>
<b><li></b>486, 33Mhz minimum (don't buy a Pentium if you are using 14.400 baud and PPP...a 486 will stay ahead of the datacomm, no problem!), 
16MB RAM (more is better), 200MB disk space (more is better).  If you're installiing NT or SCO, you only really need a 640X480 VGA card, but higher res is more fun.  
Obviously you rmonitro should match your VGA card.
We recommend you go SCSI interface for Disks and CDROMs...it costs more but allows you more flexibility as you grow your server requirements (moving a SCSI disk to a new system is easier than any other).
<p>
You'll need a mouse and CDROM to load Microsoft NT.  Version 3.5 is a must.  If you find a good deal on NT version 3.1, consider it only costs about $100 to upgrade that to 3.5 (as of 6/7/95...I know I bought the upgrade).  At the same store,  I would have had to pay $395 for a "full" NT version 3.5 OS package.
<p>
<b><li></b>You should buy yourself a 16 bit or better NE2000 compatible network card.  We recommend this cuz the NE2000 compatibles easily transport across all OS and hardware environments in the Intel based server world.  The card will offer you great utility for years.
<p>
<b><li></b>For http software (that's the server software that makes web pages available over the Internet), you also have two choices...buy a commercial (low end first please) package, or download one of several public domain packages.  
If you pick the right commercial package, you can upgrade later to a "transaction" based commercial server that will allow for secure financial transactions (a must for really doing any realtime order fulfillment over the Internet).  
We are compiling a list of good NT server packages as we test...for now we can give you a thumbs up on "Purveyor".  We'll get a link or an address on here in the next week or so.
<p>
Okay, let's assume you got an eval copy of Purveyor.  What does that give you.  Like many Windows NT packages, a CDROM falls out when you pop open the packaging, and if you forgot to buy the CD, this is where that grimace hits you.  Same goes for the Windows 3.5 upgrade package.  Our bargain 3.5 software kept asking for "Disk #4" when trying to install from floppy...good thing we had the CD drive, cuz they packaged both media.

<p>
Now a word to our friends from UNIX land.  Windows NT experts should take note as well.  Much of the Internet is implemented in UNIX environments.  Certainly the networking is TCP/IP expert land at the least.  So when we start talking about Windows NT,
we are going to try to relate back to the UNIX and TCP/IP audience.  You Windows gurus will just have to ignore the UNIX and TCP/IP rhetoric as best as you can.<p>
The installation steps for Windows NT are as numerous as UNIX, but you feel better about it cuz its pretty Microsoft Windows...well at least after awhile.  Here is a summary of the steps we went through:
<ol>
<b><li></b>Initial load - Pop in CD, and the CD boot disk for Windows 3.1 (assuming you go the buy 3.1 and upgrade route).  Boot the machine.
<b><li><Our SCSI card wasn't in the list...NT has to know where the CDROM is, and ours is SCSI.  Required a quick search of the SCSI controller packaging to find a OS/2 and NT drivers disk.
<b><li></b>Slip in the SCSI driver disk and go through three, count 'em, three prompts to make sure this is really what you want to do (makes you wonder if you are about to crush the machine, huh.  We used to kid about a machine that would intone in a sepuchrial voice, "Please duck, ejecting sharp pointy disk thingy!"
<b><li></b>Now confirm your hard disk is to converted into a "NTFS" system disk.  You will not get very far if you don't do this...you need the added security of NTFS for WEB access.
<b><li></b>NT goes away and converts (may include formatting).
<b><li></b>Now you get to choose your directory for the OS. Go ahead and use C:\WINNT, it can't hurt.   
<b><li></b>And away you go...it now looks a lot like standard Windows installation.
<b><li></b>Eventually you are asked to reboot the system.  Things get interesting again.
<b><li></b>NT will now take the DOS formatted disk and add the NTFS structure on top.  This will take some time, and yes, another reboot.
<b><li><As you get closer to the more generic windows installation, you will find that you are building windows "group" with familar icons such as Control Panel and the like.
<b><li></b>You will make some networking decisions along the way, telling NT how to be a Windows for Workgroup smart computer.  You might try skipping this as NT 3.5 upgrade will force you to do it over again.  But...we recommend you deny that impulse and go through it.
<b><li></b>You will be asked to create a password for Administrator (for you former UNIX lovers, that is root's password we are messing with here).  Just for fun, we always create a second admin password by using the User Admin utility...you can simply selet Administrator and pull down on the edit menu for COPY,and wholla! you have a backup admin user...UNIX lovers might make this new user named root.
<b><li></b>Now that you have NT installed.  Its time to do the upgrade. 
</ol>
<p>
<h2>Adding Windows 3.5 Upgrade</h2>
<p>
Well now.  If you already have a machine with NT 3.1 on it, you should have skipped here first.  The NT 3.5 upgrade kit has a CDROM or 3 floppies.  As we mentioned earlier, ours had a problem asking for floppy number four.  So we had to abort our upgrade and go back to using the CDROM. Here are some of the more interesting steps we had to take to get NT 3.5 installed:
<p>
<ol>
<b><li></b>Select Custom installation, just to see what's going on if nothing else.  Oh by the way, we are going to go through the SCSI driver exercise again if you have a SCSI controller not recognized by NT.  Don't ask me why...I guess Microsoft want you to!
<b><li></b>As you wind up the OS installation, the services start to configure and this is where you get busy.
<b><li></b>Install everything. 
<b><li></b>USE TCP/IP options were you are given them.  In otherwords, the INTERNET is not a Windows for Workgroup domain...and we are not sure how you can get non-TCP/IP networks to talk to the INTERNET. 
<b><li></b>You will be pleased to note that if you had installed Word For Windows or Excel (or we presume other 32 bit apps for Windows), they will still be there after you upgrade to 3.5.
<b><li></b>For UNIX lovers, you'll find some standard TCP/IP ASCII files in \WINNT\SYSMTEM32\ETC (ain't that sweet?), like /etc/hosts (\etc\hosts), resolv.cfg (resolv.conf).  You will also see protocols.ini (NDIS style stack variables) and some samples.
<b><li></b>If you didn't understand the item above, don't worry you may not need to.
The installation will prompt you for IP addresses.  If you understand IP addresses, go see our <a href="ipprimer.htm">IP primer</a>.  In any case the Windows NT approach is to help you type in the four octets of the IP address, then you click on a add button.  This copies the octet from the box at the left (where you entered it) into a box on the right (this is good user interface?).  When you are done, don't click on okay.
<b><li></b>There are several other similar functions to go through.  You will need IP address for your domain name server (probably one on your access provider's side of the network), your gateway (if your using PPP this is the IP of the host you connect to), and the name of of your machine (your provider probably helped you pick one).
<b><li></b>We should note that WINS and LMHOSTS are terms from non-TCP/IP parts of the world, and we are not all that sure how to use them so we'll skip them for now, as they don't seem necessary to get the server up and running.
<b><li></b>Once you have selected and entered and "ok'ed a few times, your TCP/IP experience on NT will finish.  
<b><li></b>Guess what, you don't have to recreate any users or reinstall sofware.  Just thought we'd point that out again.  Major updates in the UNIX world sometime require a lot of file backups to preserve your administrative environment...not so on NT.
</ol>
<p>
Now that you have NT up, it's time to install your WEB Server software.  This is not too bad, until you start getting asked about access rights.  Most of the packages we've glanced at do this through the file manager, so if you are Windows illiterate it will be a shock.  Heck even if you use Windows everyday, its a shock.  We should say you need to be NT admin literate...user admin and access rights on NT use a whole new vocabulary and is not familiar to Windows or UNIX users alike.  The functionality appears to be there, just a little different viewpoint.
<p>
We used the Purveyor package as our final choice to spend time on a full install.  This was easy until it came time to figure out what the data directory was.  We knew it had to do with where the web pages went...but what did it really mean.  It became clear a little later when we got to setting up server access the directory.  The Purveyor (and possibly other NT based WEB servers) package automatically user level authentication, and quite easily.  In fact, you have to read the book a little to figure out how NOT to lock everybody out of your web pages.
<p>
UNIX lovers will fight this for a little bit, but when the light bulb goes off, we think they'll agree its really cool!  For instance, implementing an "internal only" web space within your existing web pages is trivial.  Just enter a wildcarded IP address for the appropriate individuals and away you go.  Doing this for a diverse group is a little harder, and you may still need some CGI routines to grab a password from an external membership, but that is the only complex part of this NT implementation.
<p>
We set up our data directory as c:\httpd\htdocs so that it would look like our SCO directory setup.  Presumably we can add our CGI-BIN directory later.  In order to do this, we had to add an access descriptor (in one box,  click on add to get it to appear in another box...NT strikes again).  We used a user of "*", and an IP of "*".  This allows anyone in.
<p>
Note:  Purveyor will not let you out of the initial configuration until you add at least some kind of access restriction, even if it is like ours...no restriction.  You just have to be EXPLICIT about alllowing everyone in.  Not much different than UNIX...the Purveyor package just doesn't have a set of defaults that are are like those you take for granted in the UNIX environment

<H1>OneStep Internet Services Provider Services - Write Your Own</h1>
<p>
 Designing and implementing your own home page is not as daunting task as you may think.  The majority of the work you will be doing is nothing more than what you or someone in your organization already knows how to do, organize and write clearly.  We provide the following documents online for those who wish to skip directly to the technical jargon and bypass this tutorial:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../html/htmlprim.html">Short Tutorial</a>
<li><a href="../html/htmlqref.html">Quick Reference Guide</a>
<li>Complete <a href="../html/tags.html">HTML Specification</a> 
<li>Complete <a href="../html/htmldtd.html">HTML DTD</a>
<li>An <a href="../html/htmlalph.html">Alphabetical Summary</a>
<li>A <a href="gloss.htm">Brief Glossary</a>
</ul>
<p>
Home page's are nothing more than a document (or series of documents) that deliver your message to your intended audience.  Whether it be your current employees, your current customer base or a host of new potential customers on the Internet, most likely you already have messages and formats for how you deliver those messages. 
<p>
<h2>Graphics Conversion</h2>
 If your message is comprised of simply plain text, then you are already about 90% done.  If there is graphics involved however, you will need to convert those graphics into an electronically readable form...a form such as a <a href="htbitmap.htm">bitmap</a> or GIF file.  We can help you in making these "<a href="htbitmap.htm#weconvert">file conversions</a>".
<p>
Once you have the graphics converted, and your text written, then it is just a matter of marrying the two together into a consistent looking document suitable for your audience.
<p>
<p>
<pre>				   <img src="heirarch.gif">
</pre>
<h2>Creating the Heirarchy</h2>
<p>
A Home Page is more than just a single page of data displayed on the audience's computer screen.  It is actually a series of interlocked pages, held together in a loose heirachy by the first page the computer user sees.  The Home Page itself is the first page, and it is where you first get the attention of  your target user, allowing them to peruse your messages by clicking on links to the other pages.
<p>
But before you start writing home page text and symbols, you probably should take a some time to <a href="layout.htm">layout</a> the heirarchy of the pages that follow your home page.^M
<p>
<p>
<center>			   <img src="1xx.gif">
</center>
<H2>Creating the Home Page</h2>
<p>
Once you know how your are going to piece your web pages together, then it is time to actually begin creating your home page.  The first thing to be done is create a "document" using a standard plain text editor such as "vi", "ed", or others in the UNIX environment, or "Wordstar", "Word for Windows", "Write", "Notepad", or "Edit" in the DOS environment, or "MacWrite" or "Microsoft Word for Mac" in the Macintosh environment.  In any of the cases above, you output your text into an ASCII (plain text) file.  This file then is loaded into a special area where Internet users can "browse" around in it using Mosaic or other World Wide Web "browsers".
<p>
The text will need to have special symbols embedded along with your messages, symbols that tell our target user's Web Browsers how to pretty up the words in your document.
<p>
<a NAME="boldedtext"></a>For instance, the heading for this section, <b>Creating the Home Page</b> consists of nothing more than plain text with a couple of special symbols embedded to make "Creating the Home Page" bolded and a bit larger.  This is the bold command.  To bold text you would type:<p>
<pre>      <b><tt>&lt;b></tt></b>Creating the Home Page<b><tt>&lt;/b></tt></b></pre><p>
These symbols, and a few more like them, are all part of the special language used to create documents for your web server...a language called HTML (Hyperlink Text Markup Language).
<p>
We have a <a href="../html/htmlprim.html">Short Tutorial</a> available, a <a href="../html/htmlqref.html">quick reference guide</a>, as well as a document series that provides the complete <a href="../html/tags.html">Specification</a> for the "HTML" language. We also have a local copy of the <a href="../html/htmlalph.html">Alphabetical Summary</a> online as well.   And for the more technical folks interested in learning about HTML, we have the complete <a href="../html/htmldtd.html">HTML DTD</a> available locally as well.   Don't worry about all these documents however, the language really is as simple as our <a href="#boldedtext">bolded</a> text example shown above.

<h1>Overview</h1>
<P>
The National Security Act of 1947 provided the foundation for
today's Intelligence Community (IC). That act established the
Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), headed by the DCI, who is charged
with both conducting foreign intelligence activities and coordinating
those of other US Government elements. The collection of agencies
and organizations involved in foreign intelligence evolved over
time and became known as the &quot;Intelligence Community.&quot;
 (See Appendix I.)
<P>
Today, the Intelligence Community consists of 13 agencies and
organizations that receive resources through the National Foreign
Intelligence Program (NFIP), for which the DCI is responsible.
Associated also are Department of Defense (DoD)-wide intelligence
activities funded in the Joint Military Intelligence Program (JMIP)-and
military service/agency activities funded in the resource aggregation known as Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities
(TIARA). The Secretary of Defense is responsible for JMIP and TIARA resources.
The process for managing this complex array of resources has recently
been reinvented. (See Appendix II.)

<h1>Mission and Goals</h1>
<P>
The DCI has three principal responsibilities: serving as the head
of the US Intelligence Community, the principal advisor to the
President for intelligence matters related to national security,
and head of the CIA. The DCI is responsible for providing timely
and objective intelligence-independent of political considerations
and based on all sources of information available to the Community-to
the President, heads of executive departments and agencies, the Chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and senior military commanders, and where
appropriate, to the Senate and House of Representatives. The DCI
is also responsible for performing &quot;such other functions
as the President or the National Security Council may direct.&quot; <b>(1)</b>
<P>
In today's uncertain world, the mission of US intelligence is
to provide an information advantage to those who formulate and
execute national policy. Unlike the more predictable needs of
Cold War intelligence consumers, the needs of today's consumers
are in constant motion. To meet these needs with significantly
decreased funding and personnel, the Community has set forth four
basic principles: &quot;To strive for responsive global reach,
to emphasize flexibility in collection resources, to develop expert
and diversified personnel, and to ensure that surge capacity is
available for the highest priority crises or wartime targets on
demand-and that it is used effectively for peacetime needs.&quot; <b>(2)</b>

<h1>Initiatives</h1>
<P>
<h3>1.  Consolidating Imagery Intelligence</h3>
<P>
A top priority of DCI Deutch is to consolidate management of all
Community imagery activities into a National Imagery Agency (NIA).
The main objectives are to improve the effectiveness and efficiency
of resource allocation, and to provide more responsiveness to
national- and tactical-level customers. The DCI has established
a Steering Group composed of principals from all parts of the
Intelligence Community that are involved with imagery. The Steering
Group is co-chaired by the DCI's Executive Director for Intelligence
Community Affairs and the Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff.
<P>
The Steering Group established an interagency Task Force to develop
criteria for evaluating NIA options. The Task Force developed
an internal benchmarking process and conducted two rounds of evaluation
of potential options with respect to consolidating imagery resources,
facilities, and support services. Based on recommendations from
the NIA Task Force and Steering Group, the DCI and Secretary of
Defense are expected to make a final decision on the functions
and composition of the NIA in October 1995, with implementation
to occur by October 1, 1996.
<P>
<h3>2.  Integrating Military and Intelligence Satellite Acquisition</h3>
<P>
 Today, major space initiatives are limited by budgets, but the
intelligence needs of those who plan and implement US policy have
not diminished. In particular, warfighters have come to recognize
the advantage gained from the fusion of space-based information
in planning and executing military operations, and their requirements
are on the increase.  
<P>
In response, the IC is working with the DoD to integrate the management
of space programs in an effort to reduce costs. To accomplish
this integration, the IC and DoD are considering the establishment
of a Joint Space Management Board composed of senior officials
from the Defense and Intelligence Communities.
<P>
<h3>3.  Reforming Intelligence Community Human Resource Management</h3>
<P>
The DCI is committed to a major reform        of human resource
management at CIA and throughout the Intelligence Community over
the next decade. Groundwork has been done both at CIA and across
the Community that will pave the way to reform.  
<P>
At CIA, the Executive Director has established-and will chair-a
Senior Human Resources Oversight Council. Members will include
the Deputy Directors, whom the DCI has charged with bringing in
a &quot;new generation&quot; of managers.  Along with immediate
policy decisions, the Council will review and approve implementation
of initiatives designed to make sure that we have a human resources
system providing CIA with the very best people to do the job for
the future. The Council will address recruitment, diversity, work
force planning, performance management, career development, training,
managerial accountability, promotion processes, and award systems.
A program office reporting to the Executive Director will implement
Council decisions. The DCI believes these efforts will improve
the morale of employees by institutionalizing better development
of work force skills and abilities and by eliminating no-value-added
administrative burdens that characterize the current system. In
the short term, employee morale will also be the focus of a working
group established by the Executive Director to formulate quality-of-life
initiatives.  
<P>
For the Intelligence Community, a Task Force on Personnel Reform
has recently completed its work. The Community study &quot;benchmarked&quot;
a number of other human resource management systems inside and
outside government (as did the CIA study), and their recommendations
include a number of &quot;best practices&quot; found elsewhere.
The Task Force's report identifies a number of areas in which
it recommends Community-wide improvements-even wholesale change.
These include performance appraisals, career    development, promotion systems, &quot;broadbanding&quot; of grade
levels, awards, management training, diversity goals, and systematic management of initial appointments
and separations. Many of the Task Force recommendations parallel
those stemming from the CIA work. The Task Force recommends the
adoption of Community-wide human resource management practices
and policies wherever possible. The Task Force published its report
in early August 1995.
<P>
<h3>4.  Consolidating Intelligence Collection Activities</h3>
<P>
Based on changing customer priorities, reduced resources, and
supported in part by new technologies, the  Community plans to
reduce the number of sites used for intelligence collection efforts
worldwide. This effort-which is ongoing and will be accomplished
over the next several years-will result in improved effectiveness
and significant cost savings. 
<P>
  Due to changing collection priorities, the National Security Agency (NSA) will eliminate a number of
collection sites. 
<P>
  To respond to changing customer needs   and to reduce costs,
the National Reconnaissance Office (NRO) is making   comprehensive
changes to its collection   programs. These changes will provide
flexible worldwide coverage with timely, integrated reports, higher
performance, and a lower cost. 
<P>
  The Department of Defense will terminate, consolidate or reduce
many collection programs in order to accommodate ongoing resource
cutbacks, reorient activities to address the highest priority threats to US national security,
and provide maximum responsiveness to customer needs. Of particular
note was the creation of the Defense Human Intelligence (HUMINT)
Service, which consolidated and streamlined military HUMINT operations
under a single entity. 
<P>
<h3>5.  Consolidating Office Space</h3>
<P>
To reduce costs, the Community is consolidating many of its operations
in the greater Washington, DC area.
<P>
  CIA will vacate several leased buildings and occupy only a very
few new buildings leased at reduced market rates. 
<P>
  Changes in mission requirements, organizational restructuring,
personnel reductions, and communications improvements will permit
NSA to terminate the leases of a number of buildings by FY 1997.

<P>
  NRO colocation at the new Westfields facility, and potential
additional tenants, will eliminate leases on several buildings
by the end of FY 1997. 
<P>
<h3>6.  Consolidating Warehousing</h3>
<P>
The Community manages about 1.3 million sq. ft. of warehouse space in the Washington, DC area. Through the use of improved inventory management
techniques, large reductions of required space are possible. These inventory
management techniques are exemplified by just-in-time stock acquisition systems such as the NSA Vendor Agreement Partnerships (VAP), cooperative agreements with the General Services Administration (GSA) and Defense Logistics
Agency (DLA) on excess property, and modern inventory and material
handling techniques such as &quot;cross-docking,&quot; which has
eliminated the need for off-loading, staging, and double handling
of incoming shipments. Together, NSA and CIA will eliminate approximately 55 percent of overall warehouse space by the end
of FY 1997.   
<P>
<h3>7.  Privatizing Supply and Equipment Acquisition</h3>
<P>
The Community spends over $100 million every year on supplies and equipment, ranging from paper clips
to personal computers. A sizable work force and infrastructure
has been established over the years to purchase, store, and distribute
these supplies to customers throughout the Community. The VAP,
a new acquisition and distribution concept pioneered by NSA, may
revolutionize the way supplies and equipment are purchased by the Community. This concept is based on agreements with private
vendors to deliver supplies directly to customers under strict
timelines at market-rate prices. 
<P>
To further reduce the cost of administrative supplies, the Community
will explore central contract agreements that establish the best price, delivery, and
payment terms with commercial vendors for large-volume purchases.
Although accurate cost savings for Community-wide adoption of new supply
acquisition initiatives are not available at this time, this new
procedure is likely to reduce substantially the size and number
of government-owned and -operated warehouses and supply rooms,
shrink distribution networks, establish government-contractor
partnerships, and enable the supply systems to meet critical mission
requirements in a timely fashion. (See Annex A for additional details.)
<P>
<h3>8.  Franchising Microelectronics Production</h3>
<P>
NSA operates a microelectronics chip design and manufacturing
facility in partnership with the National Semiconductor Corporation. The facility produces specialized chips for highly sophisticated collection and processing components needed for
classified Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) and information security
(INFOSEC) systems. NSA's microelectronics production facility could franchise a limited amount of the excess capacity to other Community components and possibly to
other government agencies needing classified microelectronics
components on a fee-for-service basis. (See Annex B for additional
details.)
<P>
<h3>9.  Reinventing Travel</h3>
<P>
Community personnel conduct about 120,000 business trips every
year. Under current travel policy, significant resources are expended
on the administrative aspects of the travel process such as ticket
acquisition, monetary advances, and post-travel accounting. In
one agency, administrative costs in excess of $230 are incurred
for every trip that is conducted. A reengineered and automated
process developed by NSA, and based primarily on the concept of flat per diem travel and the use of
electronic funds transfer, will greatly streamline the administrative
aspects of government-sponsored travel. This new process, which
is currently under pilot, will be investigated for use throughout
the Community. (See Annex C for additional details.)
<P>
<h3>10.  Reinventing Community Courier Service</h3>
<P>
Each member of the Community maintains its own courier service for delivering classified material throughout
the Washington, DC area. There is significant overlap between
the destinations and routes of the different courier services.
Total travel for Community couriers is more than 1 million miles
per year. Efficiencies and cost savings are possible through better
cross-agency work-sharing agreements and through the establishment
of one or more hubs. Preliminary estimates indicate that total
mileage could be reduced by 30 percent with no diminution in customer
service. (See Annex D for additional details.)
<P>
<h3>11.  Reinventing Training and Education</h3>
<P>
Development of a highly trained and flexible work force will be
essential to realize the intelligence strategies of the 1990s
and beyond. To create a qualified work force will require significant
improvements in intelligence training programs.  At present, several
members of the Community maintain their own training components,
with little cross coordination between programs. Reforms such
as CIA's fee-for-service training concept will be expanded, where
feasible, to other Community components, as could the NSA/Defense
Intelligence Agency (DIA) distance learning network. All aspects
of Community training will be examined to eliminate duplication,
terminate marginal courses, explore opportunities for further
privatization, and leverage the use of technology. (See Annexes
E1-E3 for additional details.)
<P>
<h3>12.  Reinventing Excess Equipment Reutilization</h3>
<P>
Process reengineering by NSA has significantly reduced cycle time,
handling costs, and storage costs for removing and disposing of
excess equipment. This reengineering gained DLA waivers from bureaucratic processes, eliminated some external
advertising, and eliminated many steps from the equipment pick-up
process. Community-wide adoption of these new procedures and better
cross-agency coordination of excess equipment disposal efforts will likely result in savings
across the Community. To facilitate the distribution of excess
equipment that may be of use to other Community components, excess
equipment lists will be &quot;advertised&quot; via Intelink (a classified computer network patterned after the Internet).
Improvements are also possible in the distribution of equipment
outside the Community and the federal government. To increase
the availability of computer equipment for educational purposes,
there will be a Community effort to maximize distribution of excess
equipment to schools and universities. (See Annex F for additional
details.)
<P>
<h3>13.  Reinventing Security</h3>
<P>
The Security Policy Board, co-chaired by the Director of Central
Intelligence and the Deputy Secretary of Defense, is guiding an
extensive review and reform of security systems. The Intelligence
Community is reinventing its security systems to ensure that they
match threats, are  flexible, consistent, cost effective, and
affordable. Seventy-seven Joint Security Commission recommendations
are actively being reviewed. Long-term savings will be significant
to the IC and to our industrial partners.  (See Annex G for additional
details.)
<P>
<h3>14.  Reinventing Foreign Language Activities</h3>
<P>
The DCI Foreign Language Committee, as the focal point for all
foreign language-related issues within the Community, will standardize
foreign language testing. It will also develop and coordinate
plans for a unified language training system and explore ways
to open the system to other federal agencies, to create partnerships
with the private sector, and to market government-developed language
training materials for secondary commercial use. Finally, it will
explore ways to leverage the use of technology for improved training
and operational use.  (See Annex H for additional details.)

<h1>Resources</h1>
<P>
The Intelligence Community will use savings identified in this
report to help accomplish its mission within the funding and manning levels
set forth in the President's FY 1996 budget submission to Congress.
Based on figures in that submission, overall funding for US intelligence
will decrease nearly 21 percent, in real terms, between FY 1990
and FY 1997. Overall personnel strength will decrease more than 23 percent between FY 1990 and FY 1999.  
<P>
Savings identified in this report do not decrease intelligence
funding needs identified in the President's budget request. In fact, savings
associated with several of the major actions in this report are
already incorporated in that submission. These include &quot;Consolidating
Intelligence Collection Activities&quot; and &quot;Consolidating
Office Space.&quot; A number of the other recommended actions
have been implemented by one or more elements of the Intelligence
Community, and investigation of wider application is warranted.
Finally, several of the actions are new and need to be evaluated
for cost savings and effectiveness to determine how best they should
be pursued.

<h2><i>Initiative 7</i></h2>

<h1>Annex A: Privatizing Supply and Equipment Acquisition</h1>
<P>
<h3>Definition </h3>
<P>
Develop partnerships with vendors for direct delivery of supplies
and equipment to customers. These items generally have a line-item
value of less than $25,000. Develop a program to purchase office
supplies for the Intelligence Community.
<P>
<h3>Background</h3>
<P>
In the current supply process, the government is involved in costly
warehousing and distribution functions. This proposal will mirror
private-sector supply systems and will streamline this process
by having the supplier deliver goods directly to the customer
under strict time requirements. In November 1994, NSA initiated
a pilot program to acquire computer spare parts and plans to expand
the program to other commodities.
<P>
Each IC organization has its own mechanism for purchasing supplies.
The Community could reduce the cost of standard supplies through
volume buying if we purchased these goods from a single source.
<P>
<h3>Initiative </h3>
<P>
Orders are placed on a daily basis by soliciting potential vendors.
Award is based on &quot;best value&quot; to the government, which
includes delivery of what the customers want, when they want it,
at the lowest price. Contractors are continually evaluated on
their performance, and those receiving the highest ratings will
receive more business.
<P>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<P>
This initiative could save dollars by:
<ul>
<li>Reducing the number of supply rooms and accompanying stock.</li>
<P>
<li>Reducing the internal distribution costs.</li>
<P>
<li>Reducing the number of warehouses and accompanying stock and
personnel.</li>
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Implementation </h3>
<P>
<ul>
<li>NSA will expand the new process to administrative supplies, boxes, and other commodities.</li>
<P>
<li>CIA has a Process Action Team (PAT) reviewing these principles for direct delivery of supplies to CIA.</li>
<P>
<li>A Community-wide PAT will be established to investigate best
practices and develop a recommendation for implementation.</li>
</ul>

<h2><i>Initiative 8</i></h2>

<h1>Franchising Microelectronics Production</h1>
<P>
<h3>Current Function  </h3>
<P>
The National Security Agency operates a microelectronics chip design and manufacturing facility in partnership
with National Semiconductor Corporation at Fort Meade, Maryland.
The facility was justified and constructed because it was becoming
increasingly cost-prohibitive to contract out for highly classified,
small-production-run chips necessary for the highly sophisticated
collection and processing components needed in SIGINT and INFOSEC
systems. Commercial manufacturers were also becoming hesitant
to bother with production runs which, by their standards, were
extremely small and compounded by the security requirements necessary
for their protection during manufacture.
<P>
<h3>Initiative </h3>
<P>
Franchise any excess capacity at the NSA Microelectronics Facility to other IC agencies and possibly to the government at large for any classified or
specialized microelectronics components on a fee-for-service basis.
<P>
<h3>Rationale  </h3>
<P>
The NSA facility is increasing production every year for its SIGINT and INFOSEC missions. Nonetheless, additional
capacity exists that could be used for another agency on a fee-for-service
basis.
<P>
<h3>Implementation  </h3>
<P>
The Community Management Staff (CMS) will coordinate with the
appropriate acquisition and technology personnel in each IC agency
to describe the capabilities of NSA's Microelectronics Facility and
to solicit work to use any excess capacity and be competitive in the commercial market place.
<P>
<h3>Benefits  </h3>
<P>
This would use excess capacity at an already government-owned
facility rather than incur expensive contracted costs encountered
with small, specialized and/or classified microelectronics chip
requirements.


<p>
<pre>

</pre>
<p><a href="/milnet/toc.htm"><img src="/milnet/rettoc.gif" alt="Table of Contents"></a><p>




<a name="annexc"><HR></a>

<h2><i>Initiative 9</i></h2>

<h1>Reinventing Travel</h1>
<P>
<h3>Current Function</h3>
<P>
Each IC agency has its own temporary duty travel requirements.
The current process used to approve, administer, account for,
and reconcile such travel is labor-intensive and bound by bureaucratic
rules developed over the years to prevent employee cheating. The
costs simply to process the paperwork are excessive. These costs
are multiplied by the estimated 120,000 trips per year conducted
in the Intelligence Community.
<P>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<P>
The travel process will be reengineered throughout the IC to incorporate
the following key actions:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Assign responsibility for authorizing and approving the travel
request to a single individual (supervisor or other operating official).</li>
<P>
<li>Compensate the traveler on a flat per diem basis based on travel
location.</li>
<P>
<li>Simplify the post-travel accounting procedures.</li>
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<P>
At NSA, the travel process has been reengineered. The new process
will: decrease processing time by 93 percent; reduce man-years to administer
the process by 83 percent; cut the time involved for the traveler
by 74 percent; and most importantly lower administrative costs
by 71 percent. This approach could be adopted by all IC organizations. Once fully implemented, the streamlined process developed at NSA would save significant
administrative costs. DoD is now considering a streamlined system
based on the NSA and other models.
<P>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<P>
NSA has submitted a series of waiver requests to DoD, GSA, and
the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) to make the current process
more efficient. Most of these waivers have been granted, and the
remainder are expected to be approved. One of the strongest impediments
to success has been and will continue to be cultural in nature.
Formidable bureaucratic processes have been built over the years
to prevent &quot;cheating&quot; by employees. The improved process
has post-travel-audit safeguards.  
<P>
<h3>Implementation </h3>
<P>
At NSA, a Travel Project Management Office has been established
and a transitional pilot is currently being conducted. Intelligence
agencies will establish Process Action Teams to investigate the
NSA reinvention actions for use in their respective components.
<P>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Significant reduction of processing time and effort for each
travel request processed.</li>
<P>
<li>Improved service for the traveler, with less effort and cycle
time.</li>
<P>
<li>Significant savings in administrative costs, including labor
to process travel orders, tickets, and vouchers.</li>
</ul>

<h2><i>Initiative 10</i></h2>

<h1>Reinventing Community Courier Service</h1>
<P>
<h3>Current Function </h3>
<P>
Ten separate IC organizations have courier staffs servicing numerous
common destinations and &quot;clients&quot; in the Washington,
DC area. Currently, there are security and cultural barriers that
prohibit the courier services from delivering mail to other organizations
in a fully cost-effective and timely manner.
<P>
<h3>Alternative Proposals</h3>
<P>
<b>Alternative Proposal 1:</b>  Create one hub. For example, NRO would
continue to carry mail between its nearby buildings, but NRO's
mail to and from more distant sites could be routed through a
hub for subsequent delivery by another IC courier service.
<P>
<b>Alternative Proposal 2:</b>  No hub consolidation. Allow couriers
from any IC agency to deliver between any pair of locations in
the Washington, DC area.
<P>
<b>Alternative Proposal 3:</b>  Multiple hubs. For example, NSA would
continue to carry mail between its nearby buildings. Long distance
items would travel from the originator, to the originator's hub,
to the destination's hub, to the destination, by another courier
service.
<P>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<P>
 It may be possible to increase efficiency and decrease total
courier costs by consolidating trips among organizations. If consolidation
in the Washington, DC area were undertaken and successful, then
a worldwide scenario could potentially reap even more benefits.
<P>
<h3>Discussion</h3>
<P>
Currently, each IC organization delivers its own mail and secure
equipment.  Some agencies have routes that pass near other agencies'
destinations. Many shipments are small, and trucks often have
spare capacity. It may be possible to increase efficiency and
decrease total courier costs by consolidating trips among organizations.
<P>
An extensive study of DIA, Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), NSA and State resources was conducted
by DIA in early 1993. Modeling techniques concluded that the most
savings would be achieved by the one-hub consolidation idea ($477,000
per year), followed by the multiple-hub ($456,000) and the no-hub
($407,000) with the same level of customer service. 
<P>
<h3>Implementation </h3>
<P>
The Intelligence Community courier services will investigate best
practices and develop a recommendation for implementation. 
<P>
<h3>Benefits</h3>
<P>
<li>Reduces burden on each courier service.</li>
<P>
<li>Eliminates overlapping routes.</li>
<P>
<li>Fewer trucks required at each site.</li>
<P>

<h2>Annex E1: Reinventing Training and Education</h2>
<P>
<h3>Current Function  </h3>
<P>
On December 13, 1994  the Director of Central Intelligence signed
DCI Directive (DCID) 3/27 establishing the Intelligence Community's
Training Directors' Consortium (TDC) as the DCI's focal point
for training and education issues. The mission of the TDC includes
fostering interagency communications and working relationships
in training matters and facilitating the consolidation and sharing
of training facilities, techniques, equipment, and other resources.
Members of the Consortium are the directors of training (or functional
equivalents) from CIA, NSA, DIA, FBI, Central Imagery Office (CIO), NRO, and the Department of State (National Foreign Affairs Training Center
and the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR)). Representatives
from the Intelligence Community Management Staff and the Assistant Secretary
of Defense/C3I (ASD(C3I)) participate in Consortium meetings.

<P>
<h3>Initiative </h3>
<P>
In NPR Phase II the Training Directors' Consortium will do the
following:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Work with IC senior management to identify and assess core knowledge,
skills, and training priorities required to meet IC missions and
goals. The Consortium also will identify the resources associated
with non-core intelligence training. </li>
<P>
<li>Assess current capabilities by reviewing all courses offered by Consortium member agencies. TDC members
will take full advantage of Intelink and other networks to make
all relevant training catalogues and interactive, multimedia training
courses available to Community customers on line.</li>
<P>
<li>Use the results of the needs and capabilities studies to identify
areas for privatization, franchising, establishment of executive
agents, termination of duplicative or irrelevant courses, and
market dynamics among IC agencies. The CIA's tuition-based training
program, begun in FY 1995 in response to heavy budget cuts, will
be tracked by the Consortium for lessons learned and potential
use elsewhere. </li>
<P>
<li>Encourage member agencies to develop initiatives for technology-based
training and forward proposals to the National Foreign Intelligence
Board (NFIB) to support such initiatives. Potential initiatives
include training imbedded in automated systems,  interactive multimedia
tutorials, and distance learning like the NSA/DIA Secure Distance
Learning Network (GIGSTER) that could be shared throughout the
Community. Sponsor industry, academic, and government expositions
to identify automated tools to meet Community-wide needs for knowledge
and skills training.</li>
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Rationale </h3>
<P>
The above strategy will allow the Training Directors' Consortium to meet Consortium and NPR goals of fostering
greater cooperation, stimulating joint training ventures, and sharing resources by
avoiding unnecessary duplication. This strategy also will improve
quality and cost-effectiveness through introducing competition.

<P>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<P>
The TDC will solicit input from the leadership of member agencies
in identifying and assessing the core knowledge and skills required
to perform the IC mission. Maintenance of the on-line catalogues
will require the appointment of a lead agency with focal points
in each member agency. Alternatively, each agency could maintain
its own catalogues of available courses and depend on Intelink
to provide seamless interconnectivity for easy customer access.
The industry, academic, and government expositions for training
tools and technology could be sponsored by the Consortium or individual
members of the Consortium and be based on the training identified
in the needs and capabilities assessment exercise. 
<P>
<h3>Benefits/Issues</h3>
<P>
Benefit:  The TDC assessment will facilitate identifying the need
for skills and knowledge training to rise to the challenge of
changing requirements, tasks, and functions in a downsizing environment.
It also will lead to the increased use of shared resources, facilities,
and automated tools. 
<P>
Benefit:  This strategy also introduces constructive competition,
with resultant drops in costs and increase in quality. Early indications
suggest that CIA's tuition-based training program contains costs
and sets curriculum priorities by placing funding decisions in
the hands of the customers. CIA has customized a number of regular
curriculum courses and delivered them to customers in the desired
form and time frame. 
<P>
Issue:<B>  </B>Compiling and maintaining both hardcopy and on-line
catalogues requires commitment of resources from all agencies.
Some up-front expenditures to establish on-line catalogues will
also be necessary. 
<P>
<h3>Customer Impact </h3>
<P>
<B> </B>IC managers, as major customers of the Training Directors'
Consortium, will have to work with the Consortium in assessing needs. Increased introduction of competition, including tuition-based
training, will require hard budget decisions by customer offices.
 The result of this extra effort will be more control over the
training being offered and more efficient use of training resources.
For employees, this strategy will result in more choices, opportunities,
and tools to obtain the necessary skills and knowledge to survive
and contribute in a constantly changing workplace.

<h2><i>Initiative 11B</i></h2>

<h1>Annex E2: Joint Training Reinvention Activities</h1>
<P>
<h3>Current Issues </h3>
<P>
All IC training offices are facing the challenges of reduced or
flat resources at the same time requirements for developing a
highly trained and flexible work force are increasing. To meet
these challenges, several agencies are already undertaking some
joint activities to make the most efficient use of resources.
Although the IC Training Directors'<B> </B>Consortium has a lot
of coordination work ahead, several ongoing or planned activities
should be used as models and seeds for future reinvention.
<P>
<h3>Ongoing Activities</h3>
<P>
  DIA's Joint Military Intelligence Training Center (JMITC) has
developed a videotape series on the fundamentals of intelligence
resource management to supplement a 5-day training course. It has also completed a computer-based multimedia training program on the intelligence process/cycle. Both of these products
will be shared with the Community. An NSA/CIA/DIA working group
sponsored by the IC Training Directors' Consortium is developing a computer-based multimedia
program to ensure that employees understand the intelligence oversight
process and conduct their mission operations in accordance with
the requirements of Executive Order (EO) 12333.
<P>
  DIA and NSA, under the auspices of the Training Directors' Consortium,
have transferred funds to a central source to facilitate savings through bulk purchases of commercial training support software, joint renegotiation of
annual software site licenses, and sharing of developmental and
operating costs for on-line training support. When this program
becomes fully operational in FY 1997, it will provide a number
of on-line services: course registration, schedules, career service
requirements, catalogues, training records, and employee development plans.

<P>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<P>
All of the programs outlined above should be continued and, where feasible, applied to other IC agencies.
When actual participation by other agencies is not possible, the
Training Directors' Consortium should at least ensure that the
programs are studied for lessons learned. 
<P>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<P>
Since many of these activities are underway, the implementation
plan has already been established by the responsible agencies.
The Training Directors' Consortium, where applicable, will arrange
briefings at its monthly meetings on these activities and incorporate
these initiatives into the needs and capabilities assessment it
is conducting under Phase II of the National Performance Review.
<P>
<h3>Benefits/Issues</h3>
<P>
<b>Benefit:</b> Any effort to share resources or to make more efficient
use of resources through joint projects and planning will help
offset past training budget cuts. These efforts will also help
training offices meet the many new challenges arising from a downsized
work force adapting to a rapidly changing environment.
<P>
<b>Issue:</b> The ongoing efforts are scattered and not Community-wide.
They must be incorporated into the Community-wide needs and capabilities
assessment to be conducted by the Training Directors' Consortium.

<h2><i>Initiative 11C</i></h2>

<h1>Annex E3: Reinventing Security Training</h1>
<P>
<h3>Current Function</h3>
<P>
A December 17, 1994 Presidential Decision Directive approved the
creation of the Security Policy Board (SPB), including the Training
and Professional Development Committee (TPDC). TPDC membership
reflects the SPB, with 27 different Executive Branch federal departments and agencies represented.
The TPDC mission is to develop professionalization standards and training for the
security field. Accomplishment of this mission requires reinvention to reflect a paradigm shift
from risk avoidance to risk management. Initial tasks for the
Committee include fostering interdepartmental/agency communications
and working relationships; identifying and cataloguing existing
courses, products, and training resources; consolidating duplicative
training; identifying educational gaps, coordinating the development of new Community training, promoting centralized training
and awareness resources, and creating professional development
policy, standardization, and criteria.  
<P>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<P>
In NPR Phase II, the TPDC will do the following:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Develop a government-wide security training catalogue of existing
courses. This catalogue will include training aids and security
awareness products that could be shared with the Community. Consideration
should be given to placing this catalogue on Intelink and other
wide-area nets to reach a large audience.</li>
<P>
<li>Review and develop recommendations for common security professionalization
criteria. Develop a methodology for identifying and cataloguing
security-related knowledge and skills common to all government
security professionals. This information could then be compared
to existing courses to identify both redundancies and gaps. </li>
<P>
<li>Identify minimum curriculum development standards to be used
to modify existing and create new security training courses. Develop
procedures to encourage organizations to structure courses to
meet minimum common standards, thus allowing reciprocal training
of security professionals. </li>
<P>
<li>Develop a plan for more centralized training of security officers;
easier access to security awareness products, and focused investment
in new, cost-effective automated training technology. </li>
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<P>
The TPDC will work with other committees under the Security Policy
Board and with the respective departments and agencies in the
federal government, as represented by the Board, to reinvent professional
security training. 
<P>
<h3>Benefits/Issues </h3>
<P>
<b>Benefit:</b> Reinventing the security professional field will enhance
the overall national security posture within the federal government.
<P>
<b>Benefit:</b> A better-trained security professional will be able to
make more cost-effective, risk-managed decisions in support of
customers.
<P>
<b>Issue:</b> There will be initial cost outlays associated with enhancing
professional security training. As with other training programs,
however, long-term savings will accrue with a strong training
program.

<h2><i>Initiative 12</i></h2>

<h1>Annex F: Reinventing Excess Equipment Reutilization</h1>
<P>
<h3>Current Function</h3>
<P>
When government property becomes excess to the needs of an IC
agency, a formal bureaucratic process is undertaken to release
that equipment from the property inventory. Often usable and unusable
property is treated similarly, in that it must be reported to
DLA or GSA for possible reuse. This process takes too long; as
a consequence, valuable warehouse space is used awaiting permission
to release the equipment. Also, since each IC agency acts as an
independent entity, otherwise usable property might be lost to
the IC.
<P>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<P>
Some reform of the excess property process has already taken place,
especially at NSA, which has received waivers from DLA permitting
unserviceable equipment to bypass DLA screening. It is recommended
that more interagency screening take place to permit maximum utilization
of serviceable equipment throughout the IC. To facilitate this
screening, excess equipment lists will be advertised via Intelink.
Where waivers have not been received, application should be made
for them. Within the last year, IC agencies have transferred more
than $17 million of serviceable equipment to local primary schools
and universities (Project Outreach). To the greatest extent possible,
this outreach effort should be expanded in the name of community
service and in the spirit of openness being fostered within the
IC. 
<P>
<h3>Rationale  </h3>
<P>
Technology is moving so rapidly that replacement of capitalized
equipment, especially terminals, workstations, and servers, is
being pursued on as short a recapitalization schedule as budgetary
constraints will permit. Since each IC agency has a different
fiscal capacity to recapitalize, some offices and projects may
lag significantly behind technology advances. Proper reutilization
could provide, in some cases, a bridge to programmed recapitalization.
<P>
<h3>Implementation </h3>
<P>
An interagency process action team will be formed to institutionalize
best practices within the IC. This PAT will also assure that to
the maximum extent possible an interagency swapping program is
encouraged and Project Outreach is expanded. To the extent possible,
Project Outreach contributions should be advertised in order to
maximize positive publicity in the community. Sharing of warehouse
space should be investigated.
<P>
<h3>Benefits  </h3>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Elimination of warehouse space.</li>
<P>
<li>Maximum utilization of available capacity.</li>
<P>
<li>Positive impact on local schools and public image of the IC.</li>

<h2><i>Initiative 13</i></h2>

<h1>Annex G: Reinventing Security</h1>
<P>
<h3>Background</h3>
<P>
The Security Policy Board was formed to centralize security policy
development, evaluation, and implementation of many of the recommendations
made by the Joint Security Commission. A vast majority of the
recommendations will create tremendous cost savings, benefits,
and efficiencies for the IC and its industrial base. A security
cost model is currently under development by the Security Policy
Board, because historically the cost of security has been extremely
difficult to ascertain.
<P>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<P>
Community-Wide Badge Reciprocity Program:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Advance clearance certification messages for visits between
NSA, CIA, DIA, Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS), CIO, INR, and NRO
have been eliminated.</li>
<P>
<li>NSA and CIA badges are interoperable, and ultimately the IC
intends to have a uniform badge for all Community members.</li>
</ul>
<P>
CIA, NRO and NSA implemented the Automated Information System
Security Implementation Manual (AISSIM 200) to maximize efficiencies
allowed by DCID 1/16. For the first time, these organizations
are using the same set of standards for protecting automated information.

<P>
All organizations are working toward implementation of the new
DCID 1/21 for physical security of Sensitive Compartmented Information
 Facilities (SCIFs). This will allow great opportunity for elimination
of the multiple security inspections contractors must currently
support, because the various IC organizations will be able to
accept each other's accreditations. The accreditation process
also presents the greatest potential for savings, since costly
errors tend to occur at the front end of SCIF construction.
<P>
<ul>
 <li>DIA and NSA are streamlining the DoD SCIF accreditation and
inspection program. DIA has taken over DoD contractor and Service
HQ SCIFs, and the Service Cryptologic Elements have been transferred
to NSA. As a result of the reengineering process:</li>
<P>
<li>The IC is expected to realize substan-   tial savings in the
number of inspec-   tors and in travel funds.</li>
<P>
<li>Lengthy administrative delays have    been eliminated, and
standardized   IC security countermeasures are   being used.</li>
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Ongoing Activities</h3>
<P>
<ul>
<li>NRO reduced personnel security processing time in half.</li>
<P>
<li>NRO overhauled its classification system, reducing several hundred
individual security compartments and studies into one compartment.
This has vastly increased flexibility in the use of SCIFs, especially
at contractor sites. CIA, too, has promoted SCIF co-utilization
at contractor sites having multiple agency users.</li>
<P>
<li>NRO has also eliminated several unnecessary physical security
requirements.  </li>
<P>
<li>NSA has fully executed Memoranda of Agreement (MOAs) with other
agencies to permit sharing of personnel security databases. </li>
<P>
<li>NSA has taken steps to facilitate smoother interoperability
and information sharing with other agencies.</li>
<P>
<li>NSA has also taken many steps to streamline its personnel reinvestigation
process.</li>
<P>
<li>Implementation of National Industrial Security Program Operating Manual (NISPOM) between the government
and contractors, which increases security reciprocity, thereby
reducing duplication of effort and overhead costs.</li>
<P>
<li>DCI approval of DCID 1/19, Security Policy for SCI, which streamlines security procedures and facilitates
reciprocity across the Intelligence Community and US Government.</li>

<h2><i>Initiative 14</i></h2>

<h1>Annex H: Reinventing Foreign Language Activities</h1>
<P>
<h3>Background</h3>
<P>
DCI Directive 3/15 dated August 2, 1993 establishes the DCI Foreign Language Committee (FLC) as the focal
point for all foreign language-related issues within the IC. Among
the Committee's tasks are strategic planning, program and budget
reviews, special studies on foreign language capabilities and
needs, and fostering interagency coordination and cooperation. The FLC also is charged
with outreach to other elements of the US Government and to academia
and the private sector.
<P>
The FLC has reinvented the way it serves its IC customers. Through
its efforts to foster Community-level analysis and response to
problems, it is breaking down the parochialism that characterized a number
of the individual IC agencies in the past. In the place of parochialism, we now have strengthened
lines of communication, the sharing of resources, the avoidance
of unnecessary or duplicative expenditures, and a renewed sense
of creativity.  
<P>
Because of their success in reinventing the way they support their
customers, four components working under the auspices of the FLC
were designated as &quot;Reinvention Laboratories.&quot; In December
1994, the FLC's achievements in &quot;making the government work
better and cost less&quot; were recognized by Vice President 
Al Gore, who presented the Committee with a &quot;Hammer Award.&quot;
<P>
Despite the fact that it is a committee and does not have the
infrastructure of a program office, the FLC has crafted a strategic
plan to chart a course of action for the future that capitalizes
on current strengths, and positions the foreign language community
for the challenges of the post-Cold War environment, while embracing
the ideals of good government embedded in the NPR program.  The
Committee's plan defines the goals and activities that it needs
to undertake to reach its goals.  
<P>
<h3>Initiative</h3>
<P>
In NPR Phase II, the FLC will take steps to implement its strategic
goals in the following areas:
<P>
<i>Standardizing foreign language testing:</i>  In response to tasking
in NPR Phase I, the FLC developed and published a methodology
by which to standardize foreign language testing among the four
federal language schools. As it reaches major milestones in this
multiyear effort, the FLC will report on its progress to the NPR
and other stakeholders within the IC.
<P>
<i>Unification and commercialization:</i>  The FLC will coordinate plans
for a unified language training system for the IC and explore
the feasibility and advisability of opening the system to other
federal agencies and marketing government-developed language training materials for secondary commercial use.
<P>
<i>Leveraging the use of technology:</i>  The FLC will continue to explore ways to introduce technology into
the workplace to support distributed foreign language training
and to enhance the productivity of linguists in an operational environment. Further, it will support programs to provide interconnectivity among linguists to enhance their individual capabilities, to foster their professional
development, and to provide access to central repositories of
on-line data.
<P>
<h3>Rationale</h3>
<P>
Through its &quot;Reinvention Laboratories,&quot; the FLC has demonstrated its commitment to customer service and the cost-effective use of resources. Its strategic goals are consistent with NPR objectives, and it has a track record of success.
<P>
<h3>Implementation</h3>
<P>
The FLC will continue to rely on the active participation of its
members and an ongoing dialogue with its stakeholders to implement its strategic goals.
<P>
<h3>Benefits/Issues</h3>
<P>
<i><b>Standardizing foreign language testing</b></i>
<P>
<ul>
<b>Benefit:</b> Will facilitate assignment of linguists anywhere in the
IC to support national security objectives or priorities.
<P>
<b>Issue:</b> Reassessment of language skills may result in a linguist
being ineligible for language-designated positions or earning
less language incentive and maintenance pay.
</ul>
<P>
<i><b>Unifying foreign language training system</b></i>
<P>
<ul>
<b>Benefit:</b>  Elimination of unnecessary duplicative activities and
rationalization of use of resources.
<P>
<b>Issue:</b>  &quot;Turf&quot; issues associated with new divisions
of labor or joint endeavors.
</ul>
<P>
<i><b>Commercialization</b></i>
<P>
<ul>
<b>Benefit:</b>  A return on federal investment.
<P>
<b>Issue:</b>  May require enabling directives, regulations or legislation.
</ul>
<P>
<i><b>Leveraging the use of technology</b></i>
<P>
<ul>
<b>Benefit:</b>  Linguists will be relieved of mundane, &quot;information
handling&quot; tasks;  students can study a foreign language at
their workplace, if not at their work station.
<P>
<b>Issue:</b>  Many linguists will need computer training.
</ul>
<P>
<h3>Customer Impact </h3>
<P>
The customer now will find openness and a spirit of cooperation
in the foreign language community, where parochialism and &quot;turf&quot;
prevailed in the past. As a taxpayer, the customer will be satisfied
that tax dollars are being spent in ways that make sense,
that support important objectives, and that procure essential products and services.

<h2>Appendix I: The US Intelligence Community</h2>

<h1>A History of Change</h1>
<P>
<h3>History</h3>
<P>
The United States has engaged in foreign intelligence activities since the days of George Washington, but only since World War II have those activities been coordinated on a government-wide basis. Following the war, the nucleus of what is now known as the &quot;Intelligence Community&quot; was set in place by the National Security Act of 1947. The &quot;Community,&quot; as it is often called, has evolved since that time, with significant changes following the end of the Cold War.  Further changes lie ahead as Community leaders and a bipartisan commission seek to redefine the roles and capabilities of US intelligence in a rapidly changing world.
<P>
The need for a centralized intelligence system was recognized
when the Office of Strategic Services3 was abolished after the
end of World War II. Following considerable debate-and after an
interim arrangement-President Harry S. Truman signed the National
Security Act, establishing the National Security Council (NSC);
the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); the Department of Defense
(DoD); and the Departments of the Army, Navy, and Air Force.
<P>
The National Security Act charged the CIA with coordinating the
nation's intelligence activities; and correlating, evaluating,
and disseminating intelligence which affects national security.
In addition, CIA was to perform such other duties and functions
related to intelligence as the NSC might direct. The Act also
made the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) responsible for
protecting intelligence sources and methods.

<P>

<h3>DCI Responsibilities</h3>
<P>
The 1947 Act has been amended by legislation and supplemented
by executive direction on a number of occasions since its enactment.
Today, it calls for the DCI to:
<P>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Serve as head of the United States Intelligence Community;</li>
<P>
<li>Act as the principal adviser to the President for intelligence matters related to the national security; and</li>
<P>
<li>Serve as head of the Central Intelligence Agency.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<P>
The National Security Act directs the DCI, as head of the Intelligence Community, to:
<ul><P>
<li>&quot;Develop and present to the President an annual budget for the National Foreign Intelligence Program of the United States;</li>
<P>
<li> Establish the requirements and priorities to govern the collection of national intelligence by elements
of the Intelligence Community;</li>
<P>
<li> Promote and evaluate the utility of national intelligence to consumers within the Government;</li>
<P>
<li>Eliminate waste and unnecessary duplication within the Intelligence
Community;</li>
<P>
<li>Protect intelligence sources and methods from unauthorized disclosure;
and</li>
<P>
<li>Perform such other functions as the President or the National
Security Council may direct.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<h3>A History of  Recent Change</h3>
<P>
To its credit, the Intelligence Community recognized the need for change early, and took actions to address that change. In the mid-1980's, before the
fall of the Berlin Wall, the Community was already expanding the
resources it devoted to new national priorities such as counterterrorism, nonproliferation,
and counternarcotics. As a result, by the time the Berlin Wall
fell in 1989, the share of resources devoted to the Soviet target
had already been decreased.
<P>
The Community placed even greater emphasis on change following
the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. Intelligence customer
needs were reassessed through the National Security Review (NSR)
29 process and reported in National Security Directive (NSD) 67.
A wide range of topics were addressed by more than 60 Intelligence
Community task forces: the analytical and the estimative process, the structure and management of intelligence,
politicization, Community management, support to military operations,
and many others.  Task Force recommendations led to a number of important actions, including:

<ul><P>
<li>The establishment of a single oversight authority for each collection discipline, including a new entity-the CIO-for imagery.</li>
<P>
<li>A fundamental restructuring of the NRO.</li>
<P>
<li>A restructuring of military intelligence and a strengthening
of the link between CIA and the military.</li>
<P>
<li>A slimming, restructuring, and strengthening of the staff that
supports the DCI in his Community role.</li>
<P>
<li>A restructuring and strengthening of the National Intelligence
Council (NIC).</li>
<P>
<li>Improved coordination of foreign liaison through a central monitoring
office on the DCI's staff.</li>
</ul>

<P>
Additional steps were soon taken to further integrate intelligence
activities. These steps included:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Better alignment of DoD and non-DoD intelligence activities through joint development of the National
Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP) and DoD's Tactical Intelligence
and Related Activities (TIARA). (See Appendix II.)
<P>
<li>The use of a common budget framework for DoD and non-DoD resources.</li>
<P>
<li>The establishment of a new, Community-wide, National Intelligence
Needs Process to better support intelligence customers.</li>
<P>
<li>The establishment of Community coordinators for open source,
foreign language, and research and development activities.</li>
<P>
<li>The establishment of a new Intelligence Systems Board to integrate
Community and DoD management of intelligence information systems.</li>
<P>
<li>The establishment of a Joint Security Commission to integrate and simplify DoD and Community security policies and procedures.</li>
<P>
<li>The establishment of Community-wide forums for personnel, training, and facilities.</li>
</ul>

<P>
With the assistance of the Congress, the Intelligence Community
has been streamlining its work force-beginning well in advance
of the 1993 NPR-related executive order on streamlining. The Community
set forth a downsizing strategy in 1990 as it noted that the rising
cost of personnel could only be afforded at the risk of future
investment, and that its long-term capabilities to provide customer
support would suffer without major investments. Streamlining was
greatly aided by two pieces of legislation, the National Defense
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 1993 and the CIA Voluntary Separation
Act, which authorized the payment of separation incentives.
<P>
By 1999, in response to Congressional direction and other factors,
the three major Community agencies (CIA, NSA, and DIA) will have
reduced personnel more than 23 percent from their 1990 baselines-almost
double the NPR goal of 12 percent for all federal agencies. CIA, NSA, and DIA each developed strategies for streamlining and analyzing
personnel needs for the future, and stressed vigorous communications with their work forces as
downsizing proceeded. NRO is also being affected by drawdowns
in organizations which supply their personnel, including CIA,
the Air Force, and the Navy.
<P>
Reductions are proceeding as planned; layers of management and
staff personnel have been reduced substantially while consolidating
functions and organizations, reducing infrastructure costs, and
eliminating duplication. Challenges still lie ahead:  maintaining
the proper skills mix, sustaining response to incentivized separation,
and down-sizing the executive corps. The Community is sharing
downsizing experience with other government agencies through the
President's Management Council.
<P>
The NPR provided an opportunity to build further upon the process
of change already in place in the Intelligence Community. Beginning
in the spring of 1993, the Community became a full participant
in NPR's effort to &quot;build a government that works better
and costs less.&quot; Two teams were formed, one building an outside
view and the other an inside view of the Community. Their work
resulted in an NPR report on the Community4 that reached two fundamental
conclusions:
<P>
<ul>
<li>&quot;The first and perhaps most important finding of the National Performance Review is that there must
be an overarching vision for the IC. The members must come together
as a team working toward common goals and must realign resources
and functions to make the Community most effective in a post-Cold War environment.&quot;</li>
<P>
<li>&quot;The second major finding of the NPR is that the Community and its customers must redefine and re-energize their relationships. The customer
must become an active partner.&quot;</li>
</ul>
<P>
The DCI discussed the NPR report on the Community with the Vice
President in August 1993. The DCI and the Vice President agreed
on a set of more than 30 actions in seven areas:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Enhancing Intelligence Community integration.<li>
<P>
<li>Enhancing Community responsiveness to customers.<//li>
<P>
<li>Reassessing information collection to meet new analytical challenges.</li>
<P>
<li>Integrating Intelligence Community information management systems.</li>
<P>
<li>Developing integrated personnel and training systems.</li>
<P>
<li>Merging the President's Intelligence Oversight Board and the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.</li>
<P>
<li>Improving support to ground troops during combat operations.</li>
</ul>
<P>
All of the NPR actions are being addressed at this time. More than 50 percent are complete, more will be
complete soon, and all are either on or ahead of schedule. Highlights
include the advancement of work on the National Intelligence Needs
Process, the establishment of the Intelink network to interconnect
Intelligence Community elements and their customers, and the establishment
of a government-wide set of standards for foreign language testing.
<P>
Other fundamental changes were made in the Community in response to the broader recommendations of the
main NPR report. For example, Community elements are on track
with programs to reduce internal regulations by 50 percent. In
addition, the Community established a Quality Council, chaired
by the Deputy Director of Central Intelligence (DDCI), in compliance
with an executive order on managing reforms. The Council is overseeing
implementation of NPR actions and promoting quality initiatives
throughout the Intelligence Community. In further compliance with
the order's recommendations, components of the Community are performing self-assessments using the criteria
of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality Award/Presidential Award
for Quality-and are using the results to guide action.
<P>
In keeping with the spirit of NPR, the Community has also established
four &quot;reinvention labs,&quot; activities supported from the
top where innovative thinking and action is the norm, and where waivers
of cumbersome rules and regulations are granted. A Battlefield
Reinvention Lab, led jointly by DIA and the Joint Staff, was established
as a result of an NPR report recommendation, with its focus shaped
by the Vice President and the DCI. It examined how to improve
intelligence support to ground forces in combat, at Division level and below. Its results have been briefed to seniors,
and an action plan will guide their implementation.
<P>
Another of the labs consists of a collection of activities under the sponsorship of the DCI's Foreign Language
Committee. The activities resulted in publication of a Unified
Testing Plan for foreign languages, with common standards; significantly improved
interagency cooperation and sharing in language learning; the
development of tools to help the Coast Guard and the Immigration and Naturalization Service deal with illegal immigration;
and the creation and marketing of innovative, interactive video
language training in a joint venture with the private sector.
The team members participating in the activities were recently
awarded Vice President Gore's reinventing government &quot;Hammer
Award.&quot;
<P>
The third lab is the TIPSTER Text Project, whose objective is to develop fundamentally new tools for rapid
search and retrieval of needed information from massive, multilingual
bodies of text. It is an innovative partnership between intelligence
agencies, Defense, industry, and academia. Commercial products
are already emerging, and there are several prototype government
applications. TIPSTER is now developing a common text-processing architecture and moving from the research to the operational environment.
<P>
The fourth lab, added only recently, is a reengineering activity
directed at improvement of imagery exploitation. The effort has been designated as project
&quot;ExPReS&quot; (Exploitation Process Reengineering Study).
<P>
The quality movement itself is taking root in Community elements
and is already producing significant results. The National Security
Agency, for example, has a quality activity that is several years
old. Its teams have:
<P>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the time needed to install computers and networks from
over 100 days to just 14 days.</li>
<P>
<li>Saved over $2 million per year by streamlining the bill-paying
processes, thus avoiding late-payment penalties.</li>
<P>
<li>Improved in-house manufacturing yields of leading-edge-technology printed circuit boards by 50 percent.</li>
<P>
<li>Reduced stock purchases by $25 million per year.</li>
<P>
<li>Increased the in-processing rate for supplies and materials
deliveries by 20 percent per month with no increase in staff or
budget.</li>
<P>
<li>Reduced the average time to award certain types of contracts
by 40 percent.</li>
</ul>
<P>
NSA is making extensive use of the Malcolm Baldrige National Quality
Award as a guide to management processes and is using it as the
basis for a new &quot;NSA Improvement Cycle,&quot; a long-term
framework for performance improvement within the organization.
In that context, NSA has placed emphasis on leadership and strategic
planning over the last several months. Its efforts are now focusing
on process improvement/reengineering and performance measurement.
<P>
CIA also has a several-year-old quality management activity that
has produced significant results. Exemplifying progress, CIA's Office of Information Technology
(OIT) was a finalist in the 1994 competition for the President's
Quality Improvement Prototype award, the second highest award
for quality in government. Examples of quality achievements in
CIA include the following:
<P>
<ul>
<li>A Quality Team in OIT identified a need for timely deletion
of inactive mainframe users, releasing associated disk storage
space resulting in a one-time cost-avoidance of $1 million.</li>
<P>
<li>OIT also instituted self-assignment of passwords on Agency computers
at a savings of $400,000 annually in administrative costs.</li>
<P>
<li>The Office of Logistics charted, analyzed, and documented all
material handling processes, resulting in an estimated savings
of 50,000 labor hours for one year.</li>
<P>
<li>CIA and NSA together implemented a Community badge reciprocity
system developed by a team, eliminating time-consuming passing of clearances for over 80 percent of visitors to the Headquarters compound. A CIA-NSA
pilot program allows badges from one organization to be accepted in the other organization's badge readers.</li>
</ul>
<P>
CIA is also using the Baldrige Award criteria.  Last year, each
of its major components conducted a self-assessment using the
criteria of the award, and follow-on actions were taken. A new
round of assessments is just beginning, using a refined and even more
sharply targeted &quot;performance excellence&quot; approach.
<P>
Quality management approaches are being used elsewhere in the
Community, as well. DIA, for instance, used business process improvement
methodology to streamline their Automated Data Processing (ADP)
acquisition process, cutting their processing time by 65 percent.
DIA is now applying the methodology to non-ADP acquisitions such
as services contracting and security.  In addition, DIA recently
conducted a survey of its entire work force to seek ideas for
achieving positive change. In response, DIA formed 28 volunteer
task forces to help streamline and improve Agency performance.
<P>
DIA and other DoD intelligence counterparts undertook an initiative
to revolutionize intelligence printing, publishing, and dissemination
in the &quot;information age.&quot; The Combined Intelligence
Publishing Service (CIPS) makes published information more readily
available to the decisionmaker and warfighter by identifying and
eliminating non-value-added activities; and simplifying, stream-lining,
and consolidating core activities. The CIPS also emphasizes cost
savings and reuse of assets wherever possible. As a result, the
Office of Naval Intelligence printing facility was combined with
DIA without degradation of service to the customer; and several
other support memoranda of agreement between members were executed
to maximize resource use.
<P>
Elsewhere among the DoD elements of the Intelligence Community,
a number of physical consolidation actions have already been taken
to help deal with personnel reductions and limit the effects of
those reductions. For example, the DoD Intelligence Production
Community (DoDIPC) has eliminated 17 production organizations,
reassigning their missions to the remaining production centers.
DoDIPC has also reduced and consolidated theater intelligence
personnel into combined-Service Joint Intelligence Centers (JICs)
at each combatant command. A number of General Military Intelligence
(GMI) and Scientific and Technical Intelligence (S&amp;TI) resources have likewise been consolidated
and realigned throughout the Service intelligence agencies. And
the General Defense Intelligience Program (GDIP) Program Manager
relocated US Southern Command and US Space Command resources to
two other existing JICs. All of the above efforts have resulted
in enormous savings and better use of available resources, as
well as increasing timeliness, quality, and customer responsiveness.
<P>
CIO, the Community's newest member, has embraced the principles
of quality management from its inception. It held an all-hands
seminar on quality as part of a &quot;CIO Quality Day&quot; last December. CIO has published a strategic plan and a management plan, both of which are firmly based on quality
management precepts. CIO will begin implementing a formal quality
training curriculum for its senior management early in FY 1996,
to be followed by quality training for the entire work force over
the next two years.
<P>
The National Reconnaissance Office in the late 1980s embarked
on an intensive examination of its basic mission. Working with
its customers, the NRO put in place major changes to its organizational
structure and programs to improve customer support, to enhance
synergy between program offices, and to provide greater opportunities
for NRO personnel to contribute to a wide range of intelligence
missions.
<P>
To further its work in the quality area, the Intelligence Community became a member of the Council for Continuous
Improvement (CCI) in mid-1994. CCI is a non-profit consortium
of approximately 170 private and public sector organizations who
have banded together to learn from each other in application of
quality management techniques. CCI membership affords access to
extensive, up-to-date training materials; extensive conferencing
and networking opportunities; and pathways to experts for advice
and consultation. Government membership is growing, and CCI has
just assigned a resident customer representative to the Washington,
DC area. The Community is playing a leadership role in CCI regional
activities, participating fully in the first CCI eastern regional
conference last October and serving on the eastern regional core
group. This participation will help shape CCI activities to best
meet Community needs.
<P>
It is clear that the Intelligence Community has already made use of the tools advocated in NPR Phase II. The
Community contracts with the private sector to provide support in areas such as intelligence analysis, collection systems, and administrative
services. For example, the NRO now has contractor support in conducting
security background investigations, and CIA is planning a similar
approach. In addition, an example of franchising is found in NSA's
handling of DIA payroll.  
<P>
The Intelligence Community has recently been recognized for the
proactive steps it has taken to meet the challenges of a changed
world. Articles in such periodicals as <I>The Quality Observer
</I> and <I>Quality Digest</I> have praised the Community's efforts-participating
in the National Performance Review and in embracing a quality
management philosophy-to &quot;reinvent the intelligence process
to better serve&quot; its customers, the American people.

<h2>Appendix II: The US Intelligence Community</h2>

<h1>Reinventing the Budget Process</h1>
<P>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<P>
Over the last several years, the Intelligence Community has instituted
fundamental changes in the way it manages its budget resources,
and more changes are on the way. During the 1995-1999 Intelligence
Program budget reviews, the Deputy Secretary of Defense (DepSecDef)
and the Director of Central Intelligence (DCI) decided that the
current intelligence budget structure should be modified to reflect
changes in US intelligence since the end of the Cold War and to
institute management efficiencies in a reduced fiscal environment.
A new focus on the customer being served was clearly needed.
<P>
Concurrently, the House Armed Services Committee (HASC) in its
FY 1994/1995 Defense Authorization report, directed the Secretary
of Defense to consider a new set of funding categories for intelligence
in the Defense budget. It specifically requested a report that identified intelligence programs and activities which supported:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Primarily national purposes.</li>
<P>
<li>Primarily defense-wide, theater activities and the Unified commands.</li>
<P>
<li>Primarily a single Service or Agency.</li>
</ul>
<P>
As a result of the above direction, a general review was conducted
of intelligence activities.  Subsequently, the DepSecDef, with
the concurrence of the DCI, approved establishment of the Joint
Military Intelligence Program (JMIP) on June 1, 1994. 
<P>
With this change, resources for US intelligence activities are
now set forth in the:
<ul>
<P>
<li>National Foreign Intelligence Program (NFIP).</li>
<P>
<li>JMIP.</li>
<P>
<li>Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities (TIARA) funding aggregation.</li>
</ul>
<P>
The NFIP was established by several Presidential executive orders
(EO 11905 in 1976, EO 12036 in 1978, and EO 12333 in 1981), and subsequently codified in the Intelligence Organization Act of
1992. The DCI is responsible for developing and presenting to the President an annual NFIP budget for national intelligence activities.
<P>
JMIP provides a more structured approach to the management of
intelligence activities in order to:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Focus on joint, Defense-wide initiatives, activities, and programs that predominantly provide intelligence
information and support to multiple Defense consumers.</li>
<P>
<li>Bridge existing programmatic divisions across Service/departmental
and national intelligence lines to provide more effective and
coherent intelligence programmatic decisionmaking.</li>
<P>
<li>Support military intelligence consumers, i.e., warfighters,
policymakers, and force modernization planners.</li>
</ul>
<P>
TIARA was constituted more than a decade ago and defined to be
an aggregation of Defense intelligence, reconnaissance, surveillance,
and target acquisition programs that are outside the NFIP and that:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Respond to operational commanders' tasking for time-sensitive information on foreign entities.</li>
<P>
<li>Respond to national Intelligence Community tasking of systems
whose primary mission is to support operating forces.</li>
<P>
<li>Train personnel for intelligence duties.</li>
<P>
<li>Provide an intelligence reserve.</li>
<P>
<li>Are devoted to research and development of intelligence or related
capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<P>
Further details regarding NFIP, JMIP, and TIARA are provided below.
<P>
<h3>National Foreign Intelligence Program</h3>
<P>
The NFIP is comprised of all programs, projects, and activities
of the Intelligence Community designated jointly by the Director
of Central Intelligence and the head of a United States department
or agency, or by the President. Excluded are those portions of
the Defense budget that are set aside for TIARA and JMIP.
<P>
Programmatically, the NFIP incorporates all national-level intelligence, counterintelligence, and reconnaissance
activities of the Central Intelligence Agency, the Department
of Defense, and all civilian federal agencies and departments,
as well as the Intelligence Community management structure. The
NFIP is comprised of two major components: national level intelligence
programs within the Defense Department and those in federal departments and agencies outside the DoD:
<P>
<b>Defense programs</b>
<ul>
<P>
<li>General Defense Intelligence Program (GDIP).</li>
<P>
<li>Consolidated Cryptologic Program (CCP).</li>
<P>
<li>DoD Foreign Counterintelligence Program (FCIP).</li>
<P>
<li>Central Imagery Office Program (CIOP).</li>
<P>
<li>National Reconnaissance Program (NRP).</li>
<P>
<li>Special Activities, Navy Program (SpN).</li>
</ul>
<P>
<b>Civilian programs</b>
<ul>
<P>
<li>Central Intelligence Agency Program (CIAP).</li>
<P>
<li>Department of State, Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR)
Program.</li>
<P>
<li>Department of Justice, FBI Foreign Counterintelligence Program
(FBI FCIP).</li>
<P>
<li>Department of Treasury, Office of Intelligence Support Program.</li> 
<P>
<li>Department of Energy, Foreign Intelligence Program.</li>
<P>
<li>Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System
(CIARDS).</li>
</ul>
<P>
<b>Community-wide NFIP program</b>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Community Management Account (CMA).</li>
</ul>
<P>
The <B>programs</B> above are not organizations, but structures
that manage resources for intelligence operations and activities.
Organizationally, the NFIP provides funding for the Central Intelligence
Agency, an independent agency; a number of foreign intelligence
and counterintelligence elements attached to the Department of
Defense; and foreign intelligence and counterintelligence elements
of the Department of State, Department of Energy, Department of
Treasury, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Two central
staffs are attached to the DCI to assist him in carrying out his
Community management and intelligence production responsibilities.
These are the Community Management Staff and the National Intelligence
Council. 
<P>
The component programs of the NFIP are independently managed by officials known as program managers.
They receive policy and fiscal guidance from the Director of Central
Intelligence and submit their individual budgets to the DCI through
the Community Management Staff (CMS). Once they have been approved
by the DCI, the CMS consolidates them into a single NFIP budget
that is submitted to the Congress as a part of the President's budget. During execution, military
and civilian organizations expend funds approved by the Congress,
with the CMS monitoring these expenditures and the DCI approving
and managing requests for reprogramming of funds into, within,
and out of the NFIP.
<P>
<h3>Joint Military Intelligence Program</h3>
<P>
In light of the need for better integration of intelligence capabilities
within a joint structure, the JMIP was established in Defense
to:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Provide efficiencies in management of programs and activities.</li>
<P>
<li>Align decision authority with the customer served.</li>
<P>
<li>Promote integration of NFIP and Defense Intelligence by establishing
single program managers wherever possible-across NFIP and Defense
Intelligence programs and activities.</li>
</ul>
<P>
JMIP is composed of four programs:
<ul>
<P>
<li>Defense Cryptologic Program (DCP). Defense-wide cryptologic activities outside the NFIP.  Program manager: Director, NSA.</li>
<P>
<li>Defense Imagery Program (DIP). Defense-wide imagery programs
outside the NFIP. Program manager:  Director, CIO.</li>
<P>
<li>Defense Mapping, Charting, and Geodesy Program (DMC&amp;GP).
Defense-wide MC&amp;G activities. Program manager: Director, DMA.</li>
<P>
<li>Defense General Intelligence and Applications Program (DGIAP).
For this program, the Director, DIA is the Program Coordinator
for five Defense component programs. Each component focuses on
a certain key area of joint support. The Program Coordinator works
with each component to best integrate and utilize available resources.
 Further, the Program coordinator is the principal interface with
the other JMIP, NFIP, and TIARA program activities for the DGIAP.
The component programs include:</li>
<P>
<ul>
<li>Defense Intelligence Agency Tactical Program (DIATP); Program manager: Director, DIA</li>
<li>Defense Intelligence Special Technology Program (DISTP); Program manager: Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Intelligence &amp; Security)</li>
<li>Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Program  (DARP); Program manager: Director, Defense Airborne Reconnaissance Office</li>
<li>Defense Space Reconnaissance Program (DSRP); Program manager: Director, NRO </li>
<li>Defense Counterdrug Intelligence Program (DCIP); Program manager: Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense (Drug Enforcement Policy and Support)</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<P>
Each of the above programs currently consists of former TIARA
or selected NFIP programs (such as the U-2 and other airborne
reconnaissance aircraft that were transferred to Defense due to
realignment of general program responsibilities agreed to by the
DepSecDef and the DCI) whose primary customer base was judged
to be multiple Service, or Defense-wide. Review will be taken
in the future to determine if other programs should also be realigned.
<P>
<h3>Tactical Intelligence and Related Activities</h3>
<P>
TIARA is comprised primarily of many separate intelligence or
intelligence-related capabilities that are essential for tactical
operations conducted by the military forces of a single Service.
Originally, the principal reason for aggregating these accounts
was to identify those portions of the Defense budget to the Congress that specifically supported intelligence and intelligence-related activities outside the NFIP. Today, it is more important to account
for all intelligence capabilities on the battlefield in order
to ensure that commanders at all levels can readily draw upon
intelligence in times of crisis or conflict. Since many of the timely collection and exploitation capabilities are at
the tactical level, it is essential that they be included in overall
planning and programming which addresses national, theater/joint,
and tactical support needs.
<P>
TIARA programs are designed, built, and/or operated by the Military
Services and compete for funding with all other Service combat
and combat support programs. As such, there is no resource &quot;fence&quot;
placed around TIARA; rather they compete within the overall resource
top line provided to the Service by the Department. It should
be noted that the intelligence-related programs of the Advanced
Research Projects Agency are also included in the TIARA aggregation
due to the focus on Service tactical needs. Likewise, Special
Operations Command (SOCOM) is included in TIARA rather than JMIP.
<P>
There is no single program manager for TIARA. Each Service uses
its own management structure in overseeing and implementing TIARA
efforts. TIARA is thus highly decentralized as compared to the
NFIP and the JMIP. This allows the Services greater flexibility
in meeting and balancing their needs and responsibilities for
supporting tactical operations.
<P>
The Assistant Secretary of Defense (Command, Control, Communications
and Intelligence) monitors, oversees, and coordinates TIARA activities
for the Department. In certain areas, such as inter-operability
of systems or information exchange, implementing standards are
issued so that critical support can be provided across Service/joint
command boundaries. Further, the ASD(C3I) is responsible for recommending
programmatic changes as part of his overall responsibilities within
the Department's Planning, Programming, and Budgeting System (PPBS)
process. However, as stated previously, there is no single program
manager or program executive specifically for TIARA capabilities.
<P>
In summary, the composition of TIARA has changed significantly
in the past year. While still based on the definition created
over a decade ago, its focus under the recent reorganization of
intelligence programs is on integral capabilities of the tactical
commander. Through this realignment, the Department of Defense
believes that much greater effectiveness will be achieved, and
the Services/Defense Agencies can better focus on specific customers
to meet their needs.
<P>
<h3>Budget Process Reinvention</h3>
<P>
The Deputy Secretary of Defense and the Director of Central Intelligence have reached an agreement that
all US Intelligence-national, departmental, and tactical-will
be reviewed jointly. This is to ensure that critical issues are
addressed in a corporate manner, thereby providing the most effective
intelligence support possible for all US intelligence customers.
<P>
This reinvented process relies on a new framework of program analysis
and evaluation of intelligence programs against the missions of
US intelligence. This framework seeks to ensure that decisions
on US intelligence investments and operations are based on an understanding of the needs of intelligence
customers, whether they are national policymakers, military commanders,
or law enforcement officials. This new approach will entail changes
in the structure of US intelligence programs, as well as the identification
of the success factors for intelligence support to missions across
the US government.
<P>
In June of this year, an Intelligence Program Review Group (IPRG)
was established to review intelligence resources, programmatics,
and priority issues involving the NFIP, JMIP, and TIARA. The IPRG
is co-chaired by the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for
Intelligence and Security (DASD(I&amp;S)) and the Executive Director
for Intelligence Community Affairs (EXDIR/ICA). The IPRG will,
based on the issue reviewed, recommend courses of action to an
expanded Defense Resources Board (E/DRB) for TIARA, JMIP, and
Defense NFIP issues or to the Intelligence Community Executive
Committee (IC/EXCOM) for non-Defense NFIP issues.
<P>
The E/DRB is co-chaired by the Deputy Secretary of Defense and
the Director of Central Intelligence. The broad and diverse membership
of the IPRG and the E/DRB assures that a corporate perspective
will drive decisions and recommendations. It also assures coordination
of all intelligence activities across US military and civilian
intelligence programs.
<P>
The IC/EXCOM is chaired by the Director of Central Intelligence and attended by the Deputy Secretary of
Defense. Other members include directors of intelligence components within the NFIP, to include
non-Department of Defense participants, such as the Departments
of State and Energy. This body will address all intelligence 
activities and issues that affect non-Department of Defense components.

<p>
</B>Congress, following the Vietnam War and further involvement in other 
country's conflicts, felt it needed more control over the Executive 
Branch and the power of the President in actions other than a Declared 
War.  <P>
	The War Powers Act prohibits the President from waging war beyond 
60 days without Congressional approval.  Authorization can be made in 
many froms such as a temporary waiver of the Act or via a Declaration of 
War.<P>
	In December of 1982, Congress, still not satisfied with the 
control for support for the Sadinistas who were getting U.S. support to 
overthrow the government of Nicaragua, added an amendment, <a href="boland.htm">Boland Amendment</a>).  See also the <a href="hughes.htm">Hughes Ryan</a> Act of 1974 and the

<TITLE>Modern Military Aircraft </TITLE>
<H1>Modern-Military Aircraft</H1>
In the  history  of aviation, military aircraft were first used for reconnaissance, then guns 
were added, and finally somene decided to drop a bottle of gasoline its cloth fuse alight 
with fire.  Those fabric winged aircraft were built in sheds and powered by little more than 
motorcycle engines.  Today military aircraft are built in huge factories, with technologies 
and materials not even imagined by the pioneers.   Our aircraft are driven by one of two 
basic propulsion standards, turbo-jet or turbo-fan jet aircraft, and turbo-prop aircraft.  Jet 
aircraft comprise the majority of heavy combat aircraft, providing high speed and heavy lift 
capability, as well as increased maneuverability and higher altitude performance.   See  
Modern U.S. Aircraft  .<P>
Among the military jet aircraft designs today, the fastestand most publicized operational 
aircraft was the<P>
 SR-71 .  This all black, long fuselaged reconnaissance aircraft served for 30 years before 
being retired from service in 1990, only after breaking all speed at altitude records on the 
books of operational aircraft.  At Mach 3+ the SR-71 was designed to be refueled soon 
after takeoff, climb to greater than 80,000 feet, transit to the target area, reduce speed for 
the recon run, then repeat the cycle to return to base.  No less than 2 fuel stops usually 
occurred, with three being most typical (one after takeoff, one before entering the target 
area, and one after exiting the target area.<P>
<H3>Fighter Aircraft</H3>
 Fighter aircraft  are typified in the F-15 (USAF), the F-14 (USN), the MIG-28 (USSR), 
and the MIG-25 (USSR) and compose the faster of the jet aircraft.  At speeds better than 
Mach 1.5, these aircraft have the dash capability to move into the combat radius of their 
target, slow to air-to-air combat speeds if necessary, or launch highly effective air-to-air 
missiles.  In some cases the missile launch could be from as far out as 40 miles from their 
airborne target, and in the case of the F-14, engage up to six simultaneous targets. <P>
For air-to-air combat, the weapon of choice might be considered the  air-to-air missile , 
but only for a reason than you might not suspect.  If a fighter aircraft closes into battle, it is 
preferable to launch the missile before actually engaging the target aircraft in air-to-air 
combat.  For in the throes of air-to-air, missile launches are of no use, and the pilot must 
rely on guns.  As experienced by U.S. pilots in Vietnam, if you trained only to fire missiles 
at your foe, you were sure to be shot down.  In other words, the missile is the weapon of 
choice only because you hoped you wouldn't have to get close enough to force you into the 
hijinks of a "dog fight".<P>
For surface attack, fighters use air-to-ground, anti-tank, or anti-ship, or anti-submarine 
weapons, generally lumped as  air-to-ground missiles  (AGMs).<P>
<H3>Transport Aircraft </H3>
Transport aircraft are typically two or four jet engine aircraft designed for long haul of 
equipment and men.  For the most part, these aircraft are designed with heavy, wide wings 
and bodies designed for drive through capbability, that is, you load tanks, artillery, trucks, 
or even helicopters in one end, and when you arrive you offload at the other...or perhaps 
this takes place at both ends.  In any case, the idea is to provide 400 knot air travel or more 
for lots of heavy gear.   Typical of this type of aircraft would be the USAF's C-141 or C-
5A.  Both aircraft feature turbofan engines (also known as high-bypass engines...see also   
Jet Engines ).  The exception to this rule are some special duty aircraft or in some cases 
aircraft that have been pressed into continuous duty despite their being very old (see 
Turboprop Aircraft below).  <P>
<H3>Bombers</H3>
 Bombers  have increased the speed and altitude limits.  From high altitude to low altitude, 
from low speed manueverability to high speed, the bomber today is more a technological 
wonder than it ever was.  The B-1B is a supersonic capable, low altitude, penetration 
bomber which offers pivoting wing technology, aircraft like avionics and electronic 
warfare gear, and terrain following radar that allows it to sweep in low to enemy targets 
virtually undetectable to the majority of the opposition radar.  Only sophisticated look 
down radar capability found in only the most modern fighters or in yet unknown 
surveillance satellites can spot low level aircraft until they are very close to target.  
Moreover, with high dash speed and electronic warfare suite of the B-1B, it makes it even 
more difficult to close and shoot.  <P>
In contrast to the B-1B, the U.S.  B-2 , the "Stealth Bomber", relys on very low observable 
technology to reduce its radar signature down to a point where the aircraft is nearly 
invisible to radar.  Using composites in most of its construction and techniques such as 
placing the engines abovee teh wing to reduce heat signatures from below the aircraft, as 
well as the inherent low radar cross ssection of the flying wing design (learned in the 
1950s with the old Northrop Corporations flying wing), the B-2 will be undetectable by 
most Soviet Radars.<P>
But not all bombers are jet aircraft, see the remarks about the Soviet Bear bomber below 
under Turboprop Aircraft.<P>
<H3>Turboprop Aircraft </H3>
The most prevalent aircraft throughout the world for a number of endurance or short field 
tasks, are the<P>
  turboprop aircraft .  Turboprop aircraft remain in service both for their easy restart ability 
(thus you can safely shut down one or more engines) for use in economic crusing, as well 
as their power on demand and easy maintenance.  The U.S. Navy uses the P-3 Orion to 
patrol U.S. and other strategic coastlines to detect SLBM submarines.  The Soviets use 
Bear bombers very much in the same role.<P>
The short field characteristics of the  C-130  Hercules is legendary, and it is the most 
modified and updated aircraft in existence, with Lockheed still manufacturing or updating 
airframes well into the year 2000.<P>

<H1>Naval War Ships</H1>
</center>
Since World War II, the had been little decline in the navies of the world.  The U.S. for 
instance has slowly climbed to a 12 to 13 carrier navy, boasting no less than three air 
wings aboard.  The Soviet Navy also is putting carriers to sea, albeit that these carriers 
carry more surface weapons such as missiles and guns then their US counterparts, but 
never-the-less provide the power extension capabilities afforded by the carrier-borne 
aircaft capability.<P>
In the case of more traditional surface and below surface combatants, both the two super 
powers the U.S. and the Soviet Union have emmensely powerful and a large number of 
ships.  Also,  NATO War Ships   have significantly potent vessels including the British and 
French nuclear submarines.<P>
The general classes of modern naval vessels are comprised of the following:<P>
<h2>Aircraft Carriers</h2>
<UL>
<LI>CV		Aircarft Carrier		Carries Attack &amp  Air Superiority Fighters as 
well as 							helicopters for ASW use, typically
					uses catapults to place heavy aircraft in the air.
<LI>CVA	Attack Carrier		Carries VTOL, helicopters or small ground attack aircraft
<LI>CVH	Helicopter Carrier	Carries helicopters and support equipment for either ASW or 
					ground attack
<LI>CVGH	Helicopter &amp 		Carries helos and guided missiles for ASW, anti-
surface, or 						ground attack Guided Missile
<LI>CVL	Aircraft Carrier		Carries light aircraft or helicopters typically without 	
					catapults.
<LI>CVN	Nuclear Powered		Same as CV, but uses nuclear powerplant rather than steam 	
					turbine.
</ul>
<h2>Cruisers</h2>
<ul>
<LI> BB  	Battleship		Carries huge guns, i.e. U.S.S. Iowa's 16 inch guns.
<LI>CC		Heavy Cruiser		typically has a proponderance of  
ASW and 						guided missiles (cruise for land or anti-
shipping attack), may 						carry two or more ASW 
helicopters.
<LI>CG	Guided Missile		carries a majority of anti-aircraft cruise missiles and 	
					some small ASW capability (mostly self defense).  Newer AEGIS class CGs powered by COGAS (twin gas powered turbines mounted horizontally in the ships hold with thrust directed to power turbine, exhaust then vectored upward through the twin stacks).
<LI>CGN	Nuclear Powered		same as CG but uses nuclear powerplants rather than COGAS 
					or steam turbines
</ul>
<h2>Destroyers</h2>
<ul>
<LI>DD	Destroyer		Smaller than cruiser, much more maneuverable.  Typically 	
					tasked with ASW, may have one ASW helicopter.
<LI>DDG	Guide Missile		Tasked with anti-ship and anti-aircraft guided missile attack.
<p>
</ul>
<LI>Frigates
<ul>
<LI>FF		Frigate			Tasked with anti-submarine warfare, may have one 
ASW 						helicopter
<LI>FFG	Guided Missile		Frigate configured for guided missile attack. 
</ul>
<p>
<h2>Submarines</h2>
<p>
Typically, submarine depths are considered highly classified.  Non-actual figures are used to 
express the relative diving depths for purposes of illustration only:  
<pre>
<b>Name            Cntry   Depth                   Type</b>
Alfa		USSR	1,400 ft (425m)		SSN
Los Angeles	USA	1,475 ft (450m)		SSN
Rubis		France	   980 ft (300m)		SSN
Victor III		USSR	1,300 ft (400m)		SSN
</pre>
<p>
Below we list the submarine types:
<p>
<ul> 
<li>SSN	Attack Submarine	Nuclear powered attack submarine, typically carries somes 	
					means for land attack as well as anti-submarine or anti-	
					shipping attack, i.e. tube launched (torpedo tube or 
<LI>					dedicated launcher) or vertical launch system.
<LI>SS		Attack Submarine	Typicaly Diesel-Electric powered patrol submarine
<LI>SSB	Ballistic Missile		Diesel-Electric powered ballist missile submarine
<LI>SSGN	Guided Missile		Typically a nuclear powered cruise missile launching 	
					submarine of Soviet Navy
<LI>SSBN	Nuclear			Nuclear powered ballistic missile submarine
<p>
</ul>
<h2>Amphibious</h2>
<p>
Amphibious Vessels are likened to hover craft, landing craft, etc.  But these
smaller vessels must be carried to their destination.   During World War II this
was accomplished by using standard cargo vessels, and learning from the 
difficulties this entailed, western nations quickly began developing special 
purpose ships with areas open to the water, allowing launch and recovery of the smaller
assault craft at water level.
<ul>
<LI>LHA	Amphibous Support	Supports amphibious landing operations, typically carries `	
					amphibious troops and landing craft.
<LI>LPH	Amphibious Assault	Carries troops, landing craft, and helicopters
</UL>

<p>
<H1>The Threat of Terrorism</h1>
</center>
<img src="/milnet/rainbar3.gif">
<p>
<img src="/undrcon2.gif">  Under Construction: While not a new threat to the security of any of the world's countries, public exposure to this threat and large funding to combat this threat are only recently getting the attention they
deserve.  Consequently, we are behind in detailing much of this threat area.  
<p>
In the mid to late 1960s, terrorism was one of the top three threats to Israel in the MidEast, and one of the top ten throughout Europe.  Since that period,
terrorism has become a strategic level threat to every country in the world.
<p>
Strategic in that resources necessary to combat this worldwide threat must 
be planned and implemented at the highest level of a nation's government.
In addition,,those watching the progressive destructive ability of Terrorism
have remarked in private and now recently publicly that the threat of use of 
weapons of mass destruction is only an event waiting to happen. 
<p>
In any case, the threat consists of various components:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/milnet/tweap.htm">Weapons used in Terrorism</a>
<li><a href="/milnet/tgroups.htm">Terrorist Groups</a>
<li><a href="/milnet/terrfile.htm">Terrorist Activities</a>
</ul>

<p>
In general however, the activities category is the most dynamic of the
components and bears the most scrutiny.
<p>
Early terrorist activities (we speak now of modern terrorism) became a plague
in the mid 1960s as part of the Arab-Jew conflict which began in the early
years of recorded time.  The modern version, for perhaps the first time in 
human history spread well beyond a limited sphere of influence.  The exception
is the spread of the British-Irish and Protestant-Catholic conflicts 
one associates with the "Irish Problem", which is perhaps the other most
significant "event producer".
<p>
This spread of terrorist activity beyond a small sphere of influence has 
produced the fear and response that terrorism has never had in the past. Most
key however, is that this terrorism development requires worldwide planning
<b>AND</b> worldwide assets to combat.  Thus the increased level of threat
has produced an increased threat response.
<p>
Hardly a country is left where there is not an <a href="/milnet/elite.htm">elite</a> crew
of special forces are assigned (dedicated duties typically) to go where the
terrorist can be found, rescue hostages, and eliminate as necessary.
<p>
Terrorist Activities starting in the 1980s took on a new significance as 
Terrorists were able to muster the resources to not only attack innocent 
civilians, but attack military forces at rest.  Sad examples for the American
soldier were the truck bombs used at the Marine Barracks in Lebanon, and 
the attack on the <a href="/milnet/dhahran.htm">Khobar Towers</a> outside of Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.
<p>
It is a sad state of affairs when a sophisticated military force such as
that of the U.S. cannot protect itself from a few individuals and a truck
bomb.  However, rather than place blame on our leaders, it is clear that the
situations our troops are placed in are as much at fault as any human error.
<p>
Today, soldiers worldwide are exchanged in an effort to foster better
combined force operations, as well as based together in order to facilitate
more efficient-less costly basing arrangements.  However, any good military
manager will tell you that this breaks a major military tenet, and thus 
provides for opportunities for an increased number of human errors which
thus provide additional opportunities for terrorist attacks on military
forces.
<p>
See the <a href="/milnet/terror.htm">Terrorism</a> section of MILNET for definitions of terrorism and other
related information.

<h1>MILNET:  Former USSR Intelligence Agencies </h1>
<p>
The Soviets are known for their unprecedented spending on arms, some 60% of their GNP in the years between 1950 and 1970.  This twenty year buildup produced a like buildup of arms thorughout the world.  It is against this <a href="sovthrt.htm">Soviet Threat</a> that the U.S. has spent billions in what has been coined, "the arms race".
<p>
Following the lead in military spending, the Soviets also built up an incredible intelligence network, based upon the two sister intelligence organizations, the  <a href="kgb.htm">KGB</a> and the <a href= "gru.htm">GRU</a>, the KGB being the "civilian" intelligence agency, and the GRU being the military intelligence agency.  Both however, have authority to work within and without their own territory and are feared by the Russian people.
<p>
<dl>
<dt><strong>NOTE:</strong>
<dd>Both intelligence agencies have gone through many changes since the breakup of the former Soviet Union.  However, it is clear that both organizations, while operating under new names and possibly slightly different missions, never-the-less remain dangerous antagonists.  Espionage continues today, and it would be naive to think that all the KGB and GRU agents of the past have gone home or that there are  no longer any recruiting attempts made throughout the world.</dl>
<p>
KGB, Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti (Committee  for State Security) - organized into five numbered  "Chief" directorates, several large un-numbered directorates, and a number of directly reporting deparments.  According to Viktor Suvorov in the book <i>Soviet Military Intelligence</i>, the mission of the KGB is "...not to allow the collapse of the Soviet Union from the inside...".  Of course this stated mission does not prevent the KGB from mounting missions anywhere in the world.
 <p>   
GRU, Glavnoye Razvedyvatelnoye Upravleniye (Chief Intelligence Directorate of the General Staff.   According to Suvorov, the GRU's role is  "...to prevent the collapse of the Soviet Union from an external blow...". 
 <p>
The Soviets, like the U.S., employ <a href="sovsats.htm">satellites </a>  to garner technical intelligence as part of their own  <a href="sovc3i.htm">C3I</a> system.

<h1>MILNET: Soviet Satellites </h1>
</center>
<p>
Since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, it is usual not to use the term Soviet or Soviet Union.  However the current satellite fleet in existence were developed, launched and maintained by the former Soviet Union, therefore it is simpliar to refer to them today as Soviet Satellites.  Since there would seem to be little forward progress in the Russian Space Program (or in any of the other former Soviet Union members), it is likely that the following information is still quite accurate.
<p>
The Soviet has been highly prolific in the launching of reconaissance and communications satellites.  Although little is public about the Soviet imaging technology, it is clear they feel they gain useful information, as they have more than doubled the number of spacecraft launched by the U.S. for recon purposes.  In terms of Soviet   C3I , as of January 1985, the USSR maintained 21 satellites in 12 geostationary orbits (Gorizont 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10; Raduga 7, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15; Ekran 7, 10, 11, 12, 13; and Kosmos 1366, 1540, and 1546) and have launched more than 60 recon or comm satellites since 1962.
<p>
Up until the breakup of the Soviet Union, the satellite launch program accelerated, with probably as many short life satellites in orbit as there were geosynchronous.  But with the dissolution of the Soviet Space Program since the breakup, the short life satellites have probably dropped in number dramatically.  
<P>
However as the Russian government has begun revitalizing the Space Program (starting in 1994), it is probable that once again recon satellites have been launched.  In any case, former Soviet overhead intelligence satellites launches thru 1984 are listed below:

<h1>MILNET: Soviet Command, Control, and Communications (C3I) </h1>
</center>
<p>
The former  Soviet Union enjoyed an extensive network of C3I systems, the components of which can be categorized in the following three classes:
<ul>
<li>The Soviet National Command Authority (NCA).
<li>Early Warning and attack assessment systems.
<li>Communications for dissemination of early warning intelligence to the Soviet NCA and Attack commands from the Soviet NCA to  the Soviet Strategic Forces.
</ul>
<p>
The Soviet NCA consists of the Council of Defense, the Main Military Council, and the General Staff.  Together they control the entire Soviet military.  The chain of control for the Soviet Strategic Forces flows from the Defense Council (General Secretary of the Supreme Soviet presiding), through the Military council, to the General Staff.  From the General Staff, control flows to the Strategic Rocket Forces (SRF), the Navy's SLBM forces, and to the Soviet Air Force's Long-Range Aviation (LRA).  
<p>
The NCA and the headquarters for the commands of all the five services are located in Moscow.  Moscow thus has the world's only operational ABM system, and maintained passive protection such as huge underground shelters.

<title>MILNET - U.S. Military Police Actions</title>

<h1>MILNET:  U.S. Military Police Actions</h1>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
Following World War II, the United States, as a member of the United Nations,
has participated in a number of "police actions", military operations, that 
either alone or in conjunction with a coalition of United Nations members, have
been initiated to help police choatic or cruel conditions in nations 
throughout the world.  Many of these operations have been to help police and
protect citizens during times of upheaval (Somalia) or to repulse or eject invaders into smaller nations (Kuwait during the Gulf War).  In most modern cases, U.S.
troops have acted as part of a broad spectrum of U.N. forces, sometimes as 
the leaders or as willing followers.  There are, of course, a number of <a href="/milnet/conflict.htm">conflicts</a> the U.S. has participated in.  
<p>
Due to the force projection capabilities of the U.S. Navy, the U.S. has been called on during a number of crisis to provide a show of force, and in some cases
actually take action from Naval Bombardment positions (Beirut).  And in some 
cases retaliation from warring factions has resulted in many U.S. servicemen's 
death.  And of course actions on the ground, Naval bombardment, or from the 
air (Air Force or Navy) have resulted in U.S. losses.  Thus there is a price 
we as a nation pay to be part of the global police force, just as every police
department knows in a major metropolitan city.
<p>
Below is a summary of some of the important police actions the U.S. has taken 
part in since since World War II:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/milnet/nokorea.htm">Korea</a>:  Mission to repel 
a North Korean invasion into South Korea resulting in a protracted war 
costing a large number of U.S. lives (the leader of an otherwise token
U.N. force).  The U.S. used aircraft carriers and Naval Aviation from 
those carriers for the first time, to mount sorties against North Korean
forces, solidifing the techniques used later in the Vietnam War.
<li>Vietnam:  While perhaps intended as a police action, the Vietnam War became
a major political effort which stemmed from a fairly minor incident in the 
Gulf of Tonkin in Vietnam.  U.S. forces up to that point were mostly clandestine
and "consultants".  However, after this event, the U.S. went in "with both feet"
and the war escalated quickly to something well beyond the U.N. intensions.
<li>Middle East - Various attempts to help U.N. forces stem the fall of 
middle eastern nations to chaos, including the bombardment of Beirut to 
force compliance of Syrian forces to exit Lebanon.  The result of this operation
was a terrorist bombing (technically a state of war existed in the nation
however, the forces thought to have caused the bombing had no country to 
retaliate against, therefore are defined as terrorists) of the U.S. Marine 
Barracks outside of Beirut, killing hundreds of U.S. soldiers.
<li>Africa - A number of small nations have gone through famine and tribal
disintegration, with the resulting chaos compelling U.N. forces to intervene.
The U.S. has been part of these actions.  The most visible was 
<a href="/milnet/reshope.htm">Operation Restore Hope in Somalia</a>.
Recently there has been a similar opportunity to help Rawandian refugees who 
have fled to <a href="/milnet/zaire.htm">Zaire</a>, however the situation has been in such flux (the refugees
deciding en masse to return with no notice) that no forces have officially been
sent. 
<li> <a href="/milnet/gulfwar.htm">Kuwait</a>:  Resulting in the Gulf War, ejecting 
Iraqi forces from this small country.  Probably one of the shortest actual fighting war in the history books.
<li>Haiti:  To prevent the overthrow of the duly elected government, the U.S.
threatened to invade <a href="/milnet/haitix.htm">Haiti</a>, and in fact were
offshore poised to invade before the malcreants relented.
<li><a href="/milnet/bosnia.htm">Bosnia</a>:  U.N. forces (led by the U.S) 
moved in to relieve Sarejevo, a city
surrounded by one of the warring factions.  The issues here, as usual, are 
complex, and while clearly on their way to being resolved, there is still 
sporadic fighting and we are still learning of atrocities committed by both
warring factions.
</ul>
<p>
There are of course many other U.N. missions that U.S. troops have been 
part of, the list is rather long.  A fun way to look at these would be to 
scan the U.N. Service decorations of the Canadians, posted on the 
<a href="http://www.lfc.dnd.ca/english/equip/unidec/decor/dec02.htm">
Land Forces Command</a> Home Page (Official Candian Army Page)
; the link is to their decorations pages.

According  to Jeffery T. Richelson in his tome <i><b>The U.S. Intelligence Community</b></i> 1
<p>
<blockquote>  "...intelligence can be defined as the 
"<a href="product.htm">product</a>" resulting from the 
<a href="collecti.htm">collection</a>, evaluation, 
<a href="analysis.htm">analysis</a>, integration, and  
<a href="interp.htm">interpretation</a> of all available information which concerns one or more aspects of foreign nations or of areas of operation which is immediately or potentially significant for  <a href="planning.htm">planning</a> ." 2  </blockquote>

U.S. Intelligence activities are based upon a chain of <a href="/milnet/ilaws.htm">legislation</a> over
the years prior to and after World War II.

<H1>MILNET:  Collection of Information</h1>
<p>
According to Richelson, 
<p><blockquote>"Collection can be defined as the purposeful acquisition of any information that might be desired by analyst, consumer, or operator." <b>1</b></blockquote>
<p>
  The collection of Intelligence information can be categorized under a number of various collection methodologies:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/milnet/humint.htm">HUMINT</a>  (Human Intelligence)
 <li><a href="/milnet/techint.htm">TECHINT</a> (Technical means for collection) which includes:
<UL>    
<li><a href="/milnet/acousint.htm">ACOUSINT</a>  (Acoustic Intelligence-Underwater)
<li><a href="/milnet/comint.htm">COMINT</a> (Communications Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/elint.htm">ELINT</a>  (Electronics Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/lasint.htm">LASINT</a>  (Laser Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/photoint.htm">PHOTOINT</a>  (Photgraphic Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/radint.htm">RADINT</a>  (Radar Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/comint.htm">SIGINT</a> (Signals Intelligence)
<li><a href="/milnet/telint.htm">TELINT</a>  (Telemetry Intelligence)
</UL>
</ul>
<p>
Collection can be accomplished by a number of surveillance or reconaissance  
methods ...i.e. by the "tailing" of someone as in human surveillance (HUMINT), 
or as in a recon satellite photographic mission...photographing military 
equipment on the ground as in <a href="overhead.htm">overhead reconaissance</a>.  Another very important element in collection are the various  <a href="/milnet/sensors.htm">sensors</a>  involved.  Also,  interpretation  of imagery, the  analysis  of collected information, and the  planning  that makes the collection operation a success, plays a huge role in the value of that information.

<H1>MILNET: National Security Agency</h1>
<p></center>
The NSA was formed by a Presidential Directive, with the authority provided the President by the National Security Act of 1947.  The charter for the NSA still remains classified, and mention of its duties in later directives are also classified.  It is clear that the task of the agency is related to cryptology and SIGINT or SIGnals INTelligence.  Apart from a small amount of information about the management structure of the organization, little else has been officially released about the NSA.  
<p>
In James Bamford's <a href="biblio.htm#puzzle"><i><b>The Puzzle Palace</b></i></a>, some supposition about what the NSA is tasked to do is based upon study of the early years of cryptology and signals analysis that lead to the National Security Act of 1947.  Richelson's  <a href="biblio.htm#usintel"><i><b>The U.S. Intelligence Community</b></i></a>  also supports many of Bamford's theories.
<p>
It is Bamford's theory that the NSA still operates within the USA today, collecting information on Foreign Nationals and those suspected of working with Foreign Nationals.  It appears that Bamford believes that the NSA has wide powers do so, those powers being hidden in the classified statement of its mission and authority that can be found in "The Act".

<H1>MILNET:  U.S. Intelligence Agencies - The FBI</h1>
<p>
The FBI conducts counter-intelligence activities in the U.S. (among its other, more visible duties).  The FBI is also concerned with anti-terrorism as a subset of counter-intelligence.  Neither organizations within the FBI have public visibility and data on their structures is almost non existent.  The FBIs counter-intelligence performance has been likened in the recent past to "...spys fall all over themselves to get caught and occassionally the FBI is successful in their capture." 
<p>
<pre>
			   <a href="fbifail.htm"><img src="fbifail.gif"></a></pre>
<p>
<p>
The structure of the FBI is based roughly on their assigned tasks (as defined in the National Security Act of 1947):
<p>
<ul>
<li>Counter-Intelligence - Investigation,  Surveillance, Tracking, Capturing, and otherwise Disabling espionage in the U.S.
<li>Persuing Federal Offenders - Investigation, Surveillance, Tracking, and Capture of those criminals breaking federal criminal statutes.
<li>Assisting local authorities in crimes suspected of crossing state boundaries.
<li>Anti-Terrorism (classed as a federal crime)
</ul>

<H1>MILNET:  Intelligence Analysis</h1>
<p>
<b>Analysis:</b>  The process of producing the finished intelligence
<a href="product.htm">product</a> such as  a report or table of data.  The analysis of intelligence information involves looking at all aspects of all data available and making a judgement based solely on the facts and tempered with past experience or history.  
<p>
In many cases analysis will include information acquired through both open sources as well as clandestine sources.  Comparison of disparate sources is very desirable, for example, while technical collection is impressive it is usually backed up with a data collected via HUMINT.  Too much reliance on any one kind of data may lead the analyst into vastly erroneous judgements.

<H1>Central Intelligence Agency 
(CIA)</H1>
</center>
The CIA is chartered to consolidate intelligence data from all the 
<a href="http://www.odci.gov/ic/usic/contents.html">intelligence agencies</a> of 
the U.S. government and prepare regular reports on this data.  Various direcorates of the 
CIA provide both covert and overt collection capabilities as well, with the least visible of 
these directorates being the Operations Directorate which conducts all field activities.  The 
CIA is prohibited by law from practicing its arts within the confines of the U.S., except 
under very <a href="/milnet/ilaws.htm#domestic">special conditions</a>...mainly when tracking agents movements from outside the 
country to the inside.  In this case, the CIA must involve the FBI which is responsible for 
Counter-Intelligence.  Historically, the CIA has also been tasked with management of 
overhead intelligence gathering (<a href="/milnet/techint.htm">TECHINT</a>).<P>

<TITLE>SPACECOM Intelligence</TITLE>
<H1>SPACECOM Intelligence</H1>
Intelligence Activities for the U.S. Space Command fall under the responsibility of the 
Directorate of Intelligence, woh is subordinate to the Commander in Chief 
USSPACECOM.  Subordinate to the Director is the Deputy Director for Plans and 
Programs, and the Deputy Directore for Intelligence Operations.<P>
USSPACECOM is comprised of the USAF Space Command, the USN Space Command, 
and the US Army Space Command and each has their own intelligence activities, all of 
which are coordinated by the Deputy Directors for Plans and Programss and Intelligence 
Operations<P>
<P>
<H2>Plans and Programs</H2>
The Directorate for Plans and Programs is tasked with the preperation of intelligence plans 
and programs supporting the missions of the USSPACECOM.<P>
<P>
<H2>Intelligence Operations</H2>
The USSPACECOM management of the Space Operational Intelligence Center is a key 
mission of the Intelligence Operations Directorate, as well as the preperation of 
intelligence estimates and related command input to national intelligence authorities.    The 
Directorate produces the Defense Inteligence Space Order of Battle (DSIOB) for the 
DOD as well as coordinates and manages intelligence support to the US anti-satellite 
program.<P>
<P>
<H2>USAF Space Command</H2>
THE USAF maintains its own intelligence function (as does the Army and Navy), tasked 
with space surveillance,, nuclear detection monitoring, and weather reconnaissance.  The 
1st Space Wing is responsible for operation of the Defense Support Program (DSP) 
satellite system, and the Defense Meteorological  Satellite Program (DMSP), and a 
network of 24 radar and optical sensors sites for space surveillance.  The 1st Space Wing 
also operates the Space Defense Operations Center which is tasked with:<P>
<UL>
<LI>	Detecting, tracking, and providing information on space objects by employing all source 
input data
<LI>	Providing real-time coordination for status and alert of U.S. and allied space assets to 
owners, operators, and users of interference, attack, malfunctions, and damage assessment
<LI>	Providing space object indentification data for all satellites
<LI>	Generating alert, warning and verification of potentially hostile space-related events that 
affect space systems survivability, by employing all source data"
</UL>
<P>
The real-time operation of the Space Surveillance Center (SSC) was integrated into the 
Space Defense Operations Cener (SPADOC) in December of 1985, and falls under the 
Deputy Director of Space Control, Directorate of Operations, and also is responsible for 
tasking and alerting of sensors for "tracking support of routine catalog maintenance, space 
object identification support, space launches and maneuvers, decays, and deorbits, as well 
as maintains a catalog of orbital characteristics of all observable man-made space objects.  
This involves the more than 20,000 daily space obeservations to monitor the status of 
more than 5,400 man-made space objects."<P>
<P>
<H2>Naval Space Command</H2>
Operates the Naval Space Surveillance network (NAVSPASUR), which consists of a non-
steerable fan-shaped radar beam, with a 7,500 mile range.  This beam extends inan east-
west direction, from between San Diego, California to Ft. Stewart, Georgia.  The central 
tranmitter is located at Lake Kicapoo, Texas, with two smaller transmitting stations 
located at Gila River, Arizona, an Jordan Lake, Alabama.  The transmitters are poised 
along a great circle inclined about thirty-three degrees to the equator.<P>
<P>
The receiving network is composed of six receiver stations at:<P>
<OL>
<LI>	San Diego, CA
<LI>	Elephant Butte, New Mexico
<LI>	Red River, Arkansas
<LI>	Silver Lake, Mississippi
<LI>	Hawkinsville, Georgia
<LI>	Ft. Stewart, Georgia
</OL>
<P>
Data gathered at the receiving stations is transmitted to the NAVSPASUR Headquarters 
and Computation Center at Dahlgren, Virginia.  In October of 1984, NAVSPASUR 
became the Alternate NORAD Space Surveillance Center, which adds the responsibility 
for tasking space sensors and space catalog maintenance backup to the Cheyenne 
Mountain  Complex.<P>
NAVSPASUR also includes two mechanically steered AN/GPS-10 60 foot dish radars, 
with ranges of 23,000 miles, located at Sna Miguel, Phillipines and Saipan, North Mariana 
Islands.  These two radars are two-thirds of the Pacific Radar Barrier (PACBAR), with 
the ALTAIR radar at Kwajalein Atoll being the other section.<P>
In addition, two dedicated electro-optical telescopes at Haleakala, Maui, and Malabar, 
Florida, code named TEAL BLUE and TEAL AMBER respectively.  TEAL BLUE is also 
known as the MOTIF radar which stands for Maui Optical Tracking and Identification 
Facility.  These telescopes are used primarily for near-earth and deep space satellite 
tracking and space object identification using visual light as well as long-wave infrared 
imaging.<P>
Other sensors which provide data on a non-primary basis are the BMEWS and PAVE 
PAWS systems.  <P>

<TITLE>Freedom of Information Act</TITLE>
<H1>Freedom of Information Act</H1>
The Freedom of Information Act allows for a petitioner to request information about 
him or herself from the U.S. government.  The Act is quite liberal in its definition, 
with the intent to ensure the government cannot overstep its authoirty or misuse its 
aurthority to prevent a person from access to pertenent personnel information.  It 
also allows the press, for instance, access to information which is not patently 
dangerous to the National Security.  Of course this requires judicial review, a 
Federal Judge deciding "en-camera" whether the information is dangerous (usually 
the contention of the government or one of its agencies such as the CIA or 
FBI).<P>
An amendment to the Freedom of Information Act (1967 Amendment, Sub Section 
A, PUB.1.90-23), states that "...documents describing clandestine intelligence 
operations...are exempt from disclosure covered under the section...where 
disclosure could only cause damage to National Security in that it would 
necessarily reveal intelligene operations and appartus and could easily lead to 
disclosure of the identity of individuals within the United States and abroad, who 
aided in such operations....but could well place their lives in danger, and would 
inhibit other individuals from aiding in future intelligence efforts."  The amendment 
has repeatedly held up in court, for instance in Bennet vs. U.S. Dept of Defense, 
1976, 419 F. Supp. 663.  <b>1</b><P>
This amendment allowed the CIA and other agencies to broadly classify 
documents as being exempt from action of the Freedom of Information Act, and 
thus eliminating the need to respond to Freedom of Information Act requests on 
such documents.  The exception for the CIA though is when employees or former 
employees are in legal action with the government and the documents pertain to 
that employee or his or her activities while employed or under investigation.<P>
In other documents, however, government agencies must respond and in many 
cases are required to "sanitize" requested documents removing sensitive 
information.  An example might be an investigative work document which mentions 
the name of the requestor, as well as individuals clandestinely investigating that 
person.  The names of the investigator might be a plant inside a violent organization 
who would take violent action if the identity were known.  Therefore the government 
agency would be required to remove all information from a copy of the document, 
such that the identity cannot be ascertained.  <P>

<H2>U.S. Military Satellites</H2>
<P></center>
U.S. intelligence satellites fall into several basic categories (See 
also:  <a href="collecti.htm">collection</a>)<P>
<UL>
<LI>SIGINT (electrical sensing, including  COMINT, TELINT, RADINT, ELINT, LASINT, etc.)
<LI>PHOTOINT (photo sensing...i.e. film)
<LI>Electro-Optical (television, infrared sensors, imaging radar, etc.)
<LI>Aggressive (anti-satellite satellite).
</UL>
In the early years of military satellites, the most common sensors were 
of the PHOTOINT variety, with infrared and SIGINT satellites following 
very quickly.  Today the watchword for overhead recon is "real time".  
This literally means the gathering of data from the satellite and 
transmittal to the ground station and the "observers" on the ground, all 
as it happens.  This being a much desired upgrade over the early 
versions of recon satellites which spit out film packages or recording 
packages on a parachute each of which had to be recovered in order to 
get the data you desired.   Also of concern today are the  <a href="/milnet/launch.htm">launch 
vehicles</a>  for satellites especially since the Challenger explosion.<P>
U.S. satellites today serve one of three combinations of basic mission 
in terms of intelligence gathering:<P>

Subject: Your Entry about Kuwait <br>
<br>
Hi,<br>
<br>
I have just read your entry about Kuwait and found one line about the
population of Kuwait which does not represent the truth. So it would be great
if you correct your entry and try to present the correct truthfull information.
The line is on the URL : http://www.onestep.com/milnet/kuwait.htm
and it says : "The majority of the population are non-Kuwati, and are
Palestinian."
<p>
This statement is not true, the population of Kuwait before the Iraqi invasion
was more foreign workers than Kuwaitis, but was never the majority
Palestinians. The Palestinian population was 350,000, and the Kuwaiti
(Kuwaitis) population was  around 900,000. So how can you state that the
majority of the population are non-kuwaiti and are Palestinian ?
<p>
Thank you and have a good day.
<p>
Regards<br>
Qutaiba<br>

<P>
<B>UPDATE: U.S. EMBASSY IN BELGRADE IS TARGET OF "MINOR" GRENADE 
ATTACK</B>  BELGRADE (MARCH 3) UPI - Gunmen threw what police said was a hand 
grenade near the main entrance of the U.S. Embassy and fired several shots at the facility late 
Wednesday, but no injuries were reported in the driveby attack.<P>
	Belgrade police called the blast outside the embassy "a minor explosion" and reported a 
plaque that read "American Embassy" was struck by gunfire as the assailants drove past.<P>
	The explosion, which occurred several yards outside the main entrance of the embassy, 
caused some plaster chips to fall from an exterior wall around the embassy courtyard and shook 
some windows on the embassy building.<P>
 	Meanwhile, U.S. officials said only that the blast was caused by a small incendiary device 
that exploded near the U.S. Embassy in Belgrade but reported no injuries and said the 
"firecracker-like noise" caused no damage to the complex.<P>
 	A State Department spokesman, Martin Judge, said in Washington that the device 
apparently was set off late Wednesday evening when U.S. workers were not present.<P>
 	"There was a loud firecracker-like noise outside the embassy at 11 p.m. their time," he 
said.<P>
	Judge said no report was immediately available about the incident but was able to confirm 
that no U.S. officials were harmed and that the embassy was undamaged.<P>
 	He said an embassy official was "on the way there" to investigate the situation. "We expect 
further reports but not before tomorrow morning," he added.<P>

<B>UPDATE: FBI SEEKS PEACEFUL END TO STANDOFF DESPITE KORESH'S REFUSAL 
TO GIVE UP</B>   WACO, TX (MARCH 3) UPI - Cult leader David<P>
 Koresh told negotiators he reneged on his promise to peacefully end his bloody four-day 
standoff with federal officers because he received a message from God telling him to wait, the 
FBI said Wednesday.<P>
 	FBI Special Agent in Charge Jeff Jamar revealed Koresh's explanation during a news 
conference, but he vowed federal authorities would continue to seek a peaceful end to the siege 
that cost the lives of four federal agents and an unknown number of Koresh's followers.<P>
  	Jamar said negotiators contacted Koresh two hours after his 58- minute religious message 
was broadcast nationally Tuesday. The Branch Davidian leader had promised to surrender with 
his followers immediately after the sermon-like statement ended.<P>
 	"Subsequent contacts with Koresh indicated that he had received a message from God 
instructing him to wait," he said. "The negotiation team undertook efforts to convince Koresh to 
fulfill his promise and surrender immediately. Koresh refused to honor his promise and has 
indicated he will keep his promise when he receives further instruction from God."<P>
 	Jamar also said Koresh claims there were 110 people still inside the compound, more than 
officials had originally estimated. Jamar said Koresh gave a breakdown of 20 children, 47 
women and 43 men still inside the 77-acre compound 10 miles east of Waco.<P>
 	Since the siege began, Jamar said 18 children and two elderly women have been 
released.<P>
 	Jamar said interviews with those who had been released and with officers who took part in 
Sunday's gunbattle left the impression that Koresh and two others were wounded. He said the 
interviews "indicated there are some bodies in the compound, the precise number we don't 
know. "<P>
 	Asked why the agents assaulted the compound if they knew it was heavily armed, Hartman 
said "months and months" of preparation had gone into the investigation and they were acting 
because of the threat the arsenal of firearms posed to public safety. 	<P>
	"The element of surprise was essential for us to get in," Hartman said. "There were over 75 
women and children. We have a fire discipline. We are law enforcement officers who can't fire 
without having a target. So when we went in and they opened fire,  we were halfway into the 
place when they opened fire."<P>
  	Child welfare officials have reported no signs of physical abuse in the children released. 
There have been charges by former cult members that Koresh physically and sexually abused 
children, but he has denied the accusations.<P>
 	The siege began at 9:30 a.m. Sunday when 150 to 200 ATF agents tried to execute a search 
warrant to look for illegal firearms and explosives at the compound - located in open central 
Texas farmland.<P>
 	Four ATF agents were killed and 15 wounded in the initial assault. Koresh claims a 2-year-
old child died, but ATF has been unable to confirm it. A cult member was killed, another 
wounded and a third arrested late Sunday in a separate firefight, the ATF said.<P>
  	An ATF spokeswoman has admitted that the ATF agents were "outgunned" by the so-called 
Branch Davidians, who had an arsenal of firearms including a 50-caliber heavy machinegun. 
Criticism of ATF planning is increasing.<P>
  	In an interview Wednesday with KRLD, retired Col. Charles Beckwith, former commander of 
the Army's Delta Force, called the ATF assault badly planned and a "disaster" for the federal 
agency.<P>
 	"The ATF says they were outgunned," he said. "That, to me, is an indicator that there was 
actually no intelligence collected from inside to know precisely what the capabilities of this 
organization were, and they just went charging in there with their jackets on saying ATF and 
everybody was suppose to lay down and nobody did and as a result it was a disaster."<P>
 	Hundreds of FBI and ATF agents, backed up by seven Bradley infantry fighting vehicles and 
armed personnel carriers, surround the Branch Davidian compound ruled by Koresh, a 33-year-
old former member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church who claims to be Christ.<P>
 	The elderly women who left the compound early Tuesday were charged with conspiracy to 
murder federal agents. Another cult member arrested Sunday is also charged with the attempted 
murder of a federal agent.<P>

 <B>FOUR KILLED IN SOUTHERN PHILIPPINE BOAT EXPLOSION ZAMBOANGA,</B> 
PHILIPPINES (MARCH 3) UPI - Four people, including two Muslim government officials, were 
killed when an explosion ripped their boat apart in southern Philippine waters, the military and 
relatives said Wednesday.<P>
  	Relatives said the four died of their wounds at a hospital one day after a blast of 
undetermined origin rocked their speedboat Tuesday off Tawi-tawi province, 700 miles south of 
Manila.<P>
  	Tawi-tawi Gov. Gerry Matba, who was also aboard the vessel at the time of the explosion, 
was escaped without injury.<P>
 	Authorities identified the fatalities as regional assemblyman Kadir Ibrahim, provincial board 
member Hashim Diamalul and their two security escorts.<P>
 	A report to military headquarters in Zamboanga, 190 miles northeast of Tawi-tawi, said the 
victims were en route from Languyan town to another village when the blast occurred.<P>
 	Ibrahim was running for a second term as a legislator in the Muslim autonomous region 
during elections scheduled later this month. The other people in the boat were his 
supporters.<P>
 	Military officials said the cause of the blast could not be determined.<P>
  	One of the victims relatives told United Press International the engine of the boat "backfired," 
triggering the blast. But a second relative said he was not ruling out the possibility a time bomb 
had been placed on the vessel before it sailed.<P>
 	The autonomous region comprises four Muslim-dominated provinces in the main southern 
island of Mindanao. It was formed in 1989 as an alternative to demands for a separate Muslim 
state in the largely Roman Catholic country.<P>
  	Muslim rebels have fought a bloody war for independence in Mindanao since the 1970s, but 
the rebellion has largely been crushed.<P>
  	President Fidel Ramos last year offered to talk peace with the Muslim separatists and the 
country's two other main insurgent groups - communist guerrillas and right-wing army rebels.

 <B>BOMBS EXPLODE IN CENTRAL MADRID DAMAGING OFFICES; NO INJURIES 
REPORTED</B>, MADRID, SPAIN (MARCH 3) UPI - Three bombs exploded in central Madrid 
Wednesday, damaging buildings but causing no injuries in attacks police attributed to the First of 
October Revolutionary Anti-Fascist Group (GRAPO).<P>
  	"What we know is that a voice claiming to speak on behalf of GRAPO telephoned and said 
these attacks were going to happen," said the government delegate in Madrid, Miguel 
Solans.<P>
 	"That is the only information we have. But from the form of the attacks you can assume that 
it was them. This shows the signs of a GRAPO operation."<P>
  	The three bombs exploded within half an hour in the headquarters buildings of the Spanish 
Confederation of Business Organizations (CEOE), the Provincial Work Delegation of Madrid and 
the country's Steel Confederation.<P>
  	All were placed in the building's toilets and warning phone calls were received at each place 
from someone claiming to represent GRAPO.<P>
  	The attacks were similar to two carried out at the Ministry of Works and National Industry 
Institute in April 1992. Two policemen were injured in those attacks. Both were claimed by 
GRAPO.<P>
  	The organization - which carried out its first attack with the murder of four police officers on 
Oct 1, 1975 - has previously also planted bombs in the Stock Exchange, the Finance Ministry 
and the Constitutional Court.<P>

<B> GUNMEN KILL HIGH-RANKING EGYPTIAN POLICE OFFICER, SHOOT SON</B>, 
CAIRO (MARCH 3) UPI - Gunmen shot and killed a high-ranking member of Egypt's state 
security force and seriously injured his son late Wednesday in what police believe was a 
planned attack by Muslim militants.<P>
 	Lt. Col. Mohamed Mahran of the state security force was killed and his son seriously injured 
while driving in a private vehicle in El Daweer in the Assiut state, police said.<P>
 	Police said they believed the fatal shooting was planned and suspect Muslim militants. The 
attack occurred in an area where at least 90 people have been killed since last March in similar 
incidents.<P>
 	Muslim militants in Assiut are waging a campaign of violence in an attempt to topple the 
moderate secular government, and replace it with an Iranian-style theocracy. Militants have also 
launched attacks against tourists to further cripple the government.<P>
  	The latest incident occurred last Friday when a popular cafe in central Cairo was bombed, 
killing two tourists and an Egyptian.<P>

and   "massive weapons cache" inside his fortified compound. As many as 14  people may have 
died in a shootout on Sunday.  End<P>

<H1>The History of Laws Effecting
Terrorism and Terrorists</H1>
<P>
<H4>Hague Convention, 1970</H4>
One of the first legal documents dealing directly with terrorism was created as a draft treaty at the Haque Convention in 1970.  
The convention deals mainly with hijackers as prompted by a rash of airplane hijackers.  Its signatories must permit extradition, 
must prosecute criminals under the legal system in the country where the crime was committed.  Modified in Montreal in 1971 
to add the same requirements for acts against airports or airplanes on the ground.<P>
<P>
<H4>US and Cuba, 1973</H4>
The US and Cuba agreed in 1973 to a treaty that requres the retun of aircraft, crews, passengers, and hijackers.<P>
<P>
<H4>Bonn Summit, 1978</H4>
Agreement to enforce sanctions against countries which aid or abet hijackings.  The signatories were:<P>
<ul>
<li>Canada<P>
<li>France<P>
<li>Italy<P>
<li>Japan<P>
<li>United Kingdom<P>
<li>United States<P>
<li>West Germany<P>
</ul>
<P>
<H4>EEC TRVI Agreement</H4>
Agreement on police coordination by supporting and staffing representatives to the Terrorism, Radicalism, Violence 
International)  Members include:<P>
<ul>
<li>France<P>
<li>Israel<P>
<li>Switzerland<P>
<li>United Kingdom<P>
<li>All other EEC countries<P>
</ul>
At the same NATO adopted similar rules for coordination of information gathered (presumably by accident) by military 
intelligence sources.  Details of the agreements and the countries agreeing is not available at this time.<P>
<P>
<H4>Northern Ireland Emergency Provisions Act, 1973</H4>
Allows for search and siezure for whole areas and a special three person court expedites terrorist trials.  This act must be 
renewed every 6 months.  In 1995, talks between Northern Irish groups and the United Kingdom promised to dissuade the British Government from renewing the act.<P>
<P>
<H4>Prevention of Terrorism Act, 1974</H4>
Allows for British Police and SAS members to blockade areas, make arrests, search and seizure.  Must be renewed every 12 
months. In 1995, talks between Northern Irish groups and the United Kingdom promised to dissuade the British Government from renewing the act.<P>
<P>
<H4>Council of Europe:  </H4>
<H5>"Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism"</H5>
January 1977, 17 of the 19 council members signed this document which lists the following acts as terrorist acts:<P>
<ul>
<li><a href="tdefs2.htm#assassin">Assassination</a>
<li><a href="tdefs2.htm#kidnapping">Kidnapping</a>
<li><a href="tdefs2.htm#hostage">Hostage-taking</a>
<li><a href="tdefs2.htm#attacks">Bomb attacks (including rockets and grenades)</a>
<li><a href="tdefs2.htm#hijacking">Hijacking</a>
</ul>
<p>
The Council of Europe, in later action, also defined the meaning of the term <a href="tdefs2.htm#innocents">innocent</a>, following very closely the wording in the Geneva Convention.
<P>
<H4>Canadian Emergency Repeal</H4>
Premeir Trudeau implemented a temporary repeal of some Canadian constitutional rights in order to fight and eliminate 
activities of the Quebec Separtist group Front du Liberation Du Quebec - FLQ.  After the terrorists were captured and 
executed, full constitutionality was restored.  It is widely accepted that the move by Trudeau while effective, was a major factor in his eventual ouster as the Premier of Canada.  The controversy over his actions and his own flamboyant life style certainly combined to end his career.<P>

<H1>MILNET:  Explosives</h1>
<p>
This is not a course on how to build explosives, rather an examination of the
types of explosives available to military or terrorists...or actually,
available to just about anyone.
<p>
<h2>Explosive Classes</h2>
<p>
Ignoring Nuclear Weapons (now that's an explosive" quoteth the demolitions instructor at a police training session), there are four classes of explosives:
<dl><dl>
<dl><dl>
<ul>
<li>Home Equipped
<li>Factory Equipped
<li>Laboratory Equipped
<li>Military Equipped
</ul>
</dl></dl>
</dl></dl>
<p>
Now for any demolitions types out there, this probably looks like a strange 
way to classify explosives, but read on, it will become clear.  Remember this is
a briefing for the layman. And again, this briefing will 
refrain from giving much detail, and with respect to the younger folks out
there, DON'T EVEN THINK ABOUT THIS STUFF!  Right, like that's gonna stop 'em.
<p>
Before we carry on about these classes of explosives, lets talk about the level of explosive power
these  classes describe.  <p>
A <b>Home Equipped</b> class explosive (no not HE dunderhead), is
like gasoline.  Take a can of lawnmower gas, stick it in the trunk of a car and
light a very long cloth fuse.  When the flame starts to get close to the 
gas can, the fumes from the gasoline ignite, rupture the can from overpressure, spread more gasoline around in a fine mist, which in turn gets ignited, and so on.  A simple chemical chain reaction.  The combustion process, if unconfined, makes 
a nice ball of flame that expands til the outer fireball begins to cool, in which case the flame starts to smoke a bit, and thus you have a black smokey 
covering around a bright orange fireball.  Contained, the expansion of this 
fireball will rip a car to shreds, as well as knock walls out of a room if the
doors and windows are closed.  It will send glass flying at 60-70 MPH as it races away from the center of the explosion, being propelled by the rapid 
fireball expansion.  The heat would be felt by anyone 50 feet away, but then 
unless a person at 50 feet were extremly lucky, the shrapnel and debris would 
reach them much about the same time...the heat would probably not be an issue.
Anyone within 25 feet will be knocked down and probably suffer internal bleeding
and loss of lung tissue due to inhalation of the fireball.  Exterior surface 
burns would probably be near fatal, and the shock would certainly be terminal.
<p>
A <b>Factory Equipped</b> class explosive will have similar effects but at up to 3 times the range.  This class of explosion will most likely leave a mark on concrete (not
just a smudge, but heat distortion, pressure cracking, etc.).  This would be in
the class of a pipe bomb.  If shrapnel were added to the weapon, the shrapnel would speed ahead of the shockwave and pierce the siding of a house, building or
automobile at up to 100 feet.  Anyone standing in the open will get knocked down at that range, and survive if shrapnel didn't get them before they hit the 
ground.  At between 50 and 75 feet, the shockwave will compress the chest 
cavity and abdomen enough to cause internal bleeding, unconciousness, and 
probably the victim will go into terminal shock.  Within 50 feet, the effects 
are almost always deadly.
<p>
<b>Laboratory Equipped</b> class weapons are deadly if you are unprotected and
within 200 - 300 feet.  The explosive content in this class of weapon will 
leave a 20 - 30 foot crater.  Anything in that radius will be reduced to fragments, with large fragments being tossed away, not coincidentally to about
200 to 300 feet from the blast.  The reason this is the lethal radius of this 
type of explosive is that anything and everything inside the 100 foot readius will be ejected outward at the nearly the speed of sound.  Shrapnel will 
probably slow down quickly due to its non-aerodynamic properties, but within 
that 300 foot radius, still pierce just about anything it encounters, and 
treat human flesh as transparent.
<p>
<b>Military Equipped</b> class weapons carry the impact radius of a 500 lb bomb 
or larger.  This doesn't mean it has to be a 500 lb bomb, just have the explosive
power of such a weapon.  500 lbs of TNT will generate a fireball of several 
thousand degrees from impact to 200 feet almost instantaneously.  A 1000lb 
TNT blast will do the same at about 300 feet, and so on.  A trainful of 500 and 1000 lb bombs were in railroad cars on their way through Roseville, California 
in the 1975 to 1976 timeframe, when they caught fire.  At 20 to 30 miles
away, people heard and felt, distinctly, each and every explosion of each 
weapon.  Sounded much like sonic booms, one, right, after, another.  Chilling
actually.  Needless to say the people at the front of the long train ran like hell,
and still were pretty well banged up.  Homes a mile way suffered structural 
damage, and windows were broken up to 2 miles away.  SEMTEC won't do that, it
will just turn an automobile into fine, deadly shrapnel, or in "large amounts" will do about as much
damage as the Oklahoma City Bomb, while being able to be carried in a 
heavy but normal looking briefcase.
<p>
A 1 to 2lb brick of SEMTEC is kind of like a 500 lb bomb, perhaps not as much 
overall force, but it ignites and expands the fireball and shockwave at such 
a fierce rate, that it does very similar damage.  A brick as described could 
easily take out a support on a bridge.  Two or three such bricks and a terrorist
could topple a building, a bridge, an airport tower.  Good thing this stuff is
not all that easy to come by.  Unfortunately, there are military powers out 
there who have been selling this stuff to terrorists...we know cuz you can 
trace where the stuff is manufactured.   Eastern bloc countries have been
responsible for so much damage from their supply of this type of explosive, well
it is, simply put, criminal.  Oh, it could be supposed that the Western countries have 
"lost" a few hundred pounds over time as well.  It is not necessary to know where it has
dissappeared from, don't want to give anyone any ideas.  But again, it is 
difficult to find and VERY expensive.  You don't want any, or
want to know anyone who wants or has any.
Nor do you want to be around anyone who has any.  Plastique, C-4 for instance,
is not that dangerous to hold or carry, but its probably not a good idea to
 toss it out the window.
<p>
Now for a brief discussion on what these weapons are comprised of...no gory detail, just
 an idea of what's required, so you understand the dilemna low enforcement and goverment
agencies face when combatting people who build bombs. 
<p>
<h3>Home Equipped</h3>
<p>
Home Equipped explosives are those found around the house.  Taking certain
chemicals around the house, you can build yourself quite a nasty explosive.
If you are a farmer, you can probably buy enough fertilizer without raising
any eyebrows, to build a mean weapon (think Oklahoma City here).
<p>
As kids we used to make quite noisy and substantially deadly little toys out of
matches.  So devising a deadly weapon at home is even quite easy for 11 year 
olds.  Kinda scary huh.  Take a "toy" bomb of this type, and add something
pointy or lots of little somethings pointy, and you have a homemade grenade.
<P.
Another obvious example are bombs based upon normal "household" items such as
a can of gasoline.  Mix up a "cocktail" and you are armed.  There are lots
of ideas floating around, to go into them is pointless and again dangerous to
our younger visitors.   
<p>
Enough on that.  The point is that one does not have to gather huge funding to build
nasty killer weapons, nor a warehouse in the boonies to beginning manufacturing
such items.
<p>
<h3>A word about Fertilizer Bombs</h3>
<p>
Take two standard metal garbage cans, fill with fertilizer and some other 
easily obtainable stuff (you think it appropriate to go into detail...Nuts to
that!), and you now have a pretty big bang.  Fill the bed of a pickup with 
such cans and oh my, that's a major big deal.  It's not like you can walk into 
the local McDonalds with one of these.  But a crazy could...well never mind.  
Suffice to say, if someone wants to make a big bang and take out lots of people
in the process, all they have to do is buy fertilirzer, steal a car or pickup
truck, do a little mixing and "whoa-boy" its a hot time tonight!
<p>
Just about anyone who has lived on a big farm and half the people living near them can tell you how to 
do it.  Is that scary?  It should be.  Is this suddenly a new thing?  Nope.
Until Oklahoma City, the rest of us just didn't know just how deadly this 
kind of trash can bomb could be.
<P>
<h3>Factory Equipped</h3>
<p>
This class is those types of explosives that, by their nature, require some 
level of machining, drying, or mixing required to make the explosives at all.
Whether it is stable or too dangerous to handle at that point is really not
important to the manufacturer, we are still talking about low cost.  I exclude
such chemical reaction based weapons such as nitroglyceride based compounds,
however, cuz the more would be bombers that try to fry up nitro on their 
little hot plates, the less would be bombers we will have to worry about.
Examples of this class might be salt peter and sulfur smoke bombs, or other 
more flamei and gas producing mixtures.  
<p>
We say "Factory Equipped" because this kind of explosive, while probably not as dangerous as the next class, still require a repeatable process to be followed in order to repeatedly build significantly volatile explosives with dependablly accurate yields.  
<p>
In other words, you can make em at home, but to get the 
controllability and stablity, you would probably want to have a through and
stable process running in factory like conditions.  
<p>
Don't misunderstand, people can build such factories 
at home, so this doesn't preclude doing this in a spare bedroom or garage. 
<p>
One other point.  A good machinist can probably build a device that would 
mist liquid, then ignite it.  This is called a volatile weapon and multiples
the explosive force up to 10 times that of a liquid propellant in normal
evaporative or pressure separated explosion.  Air-Fuel mixtures require 
some precise timings to get those kind of multipliers, though, so unless
somebody has a laboratory to experiment with, they are probably gonna blow
themselves to hell and gone before they find the right setup for a 10 times
multiplier.
<p>
<h3>Laboratory Equipped</h3>
The next class is Laboratory Equipped.  This is the real stuff.  TNT is based
upon nitroglycerin or other such highly unstable and volatile chemical 
reaction by products.  By their nature, these kinds of explosives while possibly
built in modest surroundings, still require temperature control (cooling and 
heating at just right time or else an early "boom"), controlled mixing, and or
precise quanitities and measurements.  Thus a chemical laboratory is needed.
<p>
Again, a household bomb builder can find the necessary ingredients, but it
will take some real expertise to get it all to go together right while at the
same time not making a crater out of the wacko and his house. 
<p>
<h3>Military Equipped</h3>
For this class, you don't only need laboratory conditions, but access to 
chemical compounds that are known to be used primarily for explosives work.  Trying to buy the
ingredients for plastique, for example, is extremely difficult in most countries.  Not to say
it is impossible.  However, most users of plastique have purchased it either
directly from a military connection (stolen or "sanctioned" theft), or has 
themselves access to the chemicals in question (i.e. a commercial explosives
house might have access if they have military contracts).  
<p>
SEMTEC is a good
example.  In nearly all the SEMTEC bombs exploded in terrorist attacks, the
SEMTEC came from an Eastern Bloc country who either sold it at a huge discount, 
gave it away to their "partners", or after the wall came down, sold it just to
make a few bucks to get by.  SEMTEC is impossible to make without the 
access governments have to the ingredients.
<p>
Another example is called HE (High Energy) explosive.  Think solid rocket fuel.  Finding HE that is also not dangerous to carry
is difficult.  
<p>Plastique is find to carry, so is SEMTEC (actually a more potent, oderless, and probably tasteless plastique).  Rumor has it that Viet
Vets used C-4 plastique as sterno.  Don't know if I believe that, but I have 
heard from several reliable sources that the stuff is rather slow burning.  It
is when you can finally get it REAL hot or "concuss" it (as with a blasting
cap), that it finally goes nutsoid and makes the big bang.  Gladly I don't 
enough about it at that detail to say yay or nay to such claims.
<p>
Anyway, TNT, HE, SEMTEC and other exotics are found in various special devices 
like land mines, bomb warheads, tank shells, artillery shells, etc.  We won't
even go into such nasties as depleted uranium and HEAT rounds.  When terrorists
get their hands on that stuff, well it is truly war at that point.  Need a 
bunch of tanks and fighter bombers to counter that.
<p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
As you can see, this briefing didn't go into much detail.  Sorry if you were 
dissapointed,
but the goal was to give a brief description of the explosives in use
today by terrorists or other crazies.  The alarming
thing that should have gleaned from all this is that save the military stuff
(which probably can't be  controlled any better than they are being controlling 
now), it is easy for someone to pull together the ingredients to make a 
pretty deadly bomb.  Some inexperienced folk may blast themselves to little 
pieces trying to make even bigger bangs (and if no one else is close, that might not be so bad),
but to make really big bangs the crazy probably needs some sophisticated 
manufacturing facility.  The exception might be the fertilizer bomb, but
that is probably a special case (see notes on fertilizer bombs above) and hard
to hide.  A little better effort at peripheral security would probably have
prevented the deaths in Okalhoma.  A good security firm can probably tell
you what to do...think Beirut Marine Barracks and Oklahoma City, and you will
have saved yourself a lot of money paying a security firm!
<p>
Bomb manufacturing for mass destruction probably won't go undetected unless 
someone has a fairly large facility and no visitors.  Of course there are 
exceptions (time will certainly illustrate these exceptions), but for the most
part, it would be difficult to build a bomb to take out a major bridge without
someone noticing (or so we hope!).
<p>
On the other hand, a bomb to take out a car and its occupants can be made
in your kitchen, and a landmine probably in your garage with a drill press.
<p>
<p>
<h3>Building Safety</h3>
<p>
And finally, it should be noted that a little more attention to building
security in EVERY case of mass murder in an office complex could have saved
most of the lives lost.  Even the World Trade Center could have been avoided.
Large underground parking lots are setup up to take your money, not provide
security of any sort, let alone prevent large amounts of explosive to be
trucked in.  When is the last time you had your trunk viewed?  It doesn't have
to be an intrusive search...pop it open at an inspection point upon entering
an undergroudn parking lot, or if you need to get close to a large building, andthat should suffice.  
<p>
Too intrusive.  Bull.   Tell that to the parents of the children in the 
Oklahoma City Federal Building.  Double Bull!
<p>
Any company not concerned enough to limit access to physical proximity of
their building is just asking for a huge damage suit in the future.  And it
is really not all that hard to do if you have a bit of space next to your
building.
<p>
<p>
<h3>Political Statement</h3>
So rather than try to think up some way to stop the ingredients from being a
available (no more oven cleaner...now that is a disaster for spare rib lovers
out there!), we need to concentrate on the people factor.  In other words,
stop terrorists, not terrorist weapons.  
<p>
If you no longer have assault rifles, than people who want
to assault will use volatile gas bombs, pipe bombs, wall bombs, sachel charges,
stolen dynamite, or even large garbage cans of fertilizer, knives, bows and
arrows, bamboo stuffed with salt peter. <p>
Have you heard of what the IRA did with bombs in a country where there are less semi-automatics than there are in Los Angeles?
<p>
Get the message?  Anything can be made into a bomb.  Fortunatly, not everyone is prone to
doing so.  Let's concentrate on identifying those prone to doing such things, 
and watch 'em close.  When we detect them doing something strange (like buying 
200 lbs of fertilizer when they live in an apartment with no lawn), then we
watch 'em a little closer.
<p>
I like the idea of a convicted felon not being able to buy a weapon.  How about 
having to have a license to buy gasoline?  Sounds ludicrous doesn't it.  But
a can of gasoline is ten times more dangerous than an AK-47, and the bloke
doesn't even have to be there when he (or she) set it off to do the damage!
<p>
Moreover, if one looks at the information made available AFTER someone shoots 
a bunch of people up, you'll find that in most cases someone knew something
was wrong.  And where someone didn't percieve there was a problem...why that 
very same crazy could just as easily have built a homemade grenade!
<p>
And this briefing didn't go into chemical weapons that don't explode or have
a trigger!
What has been happening in Japanese train 
stations could easily be happening in the U.S..  Unfortunately chemical 
dispersant
weapons are not as hard to buy components for and are relatively much more
safer to build than explosives.
<p>
This is really an excellent example.  In Japan, people don't have guns.  
Mass murdereres there slice peoples throats or plant chemical weapons
killing bunches all at once if they don't want the personal touch. Stopping
the common bloke from owning a gun doesn't seem to help Japan control the
crazies any more than it would help curb them in the U.S..

<H1>A Chronology of Hijackings (1968-
1978)</H1>
1968:  In the Middle East, starting in 1968, PLO sympathizers hijacked an El Al (Israeli 
National Airline).  While getting lots of publicity, the  PLO  hijackers did not kill anyone.<P>
The Rome to Tel Aviv flight of TWA flight 840 was hijacked on 8/29/69, also with no one 
killed.  But this "non-violent" approach to hijacking was not to continue.<P>
9/16/70:  Five airliners were hijacked in unison by five separate attacking groups of PLO 
hijackers.    Sky Marshals   killed 1 hijacker, and disarmed one bomb.<P>
By1972, the hijack violence was on a meteoric rise.<P>
5/8/72:  A Belgian Sabina airliner was seized by hijackers with  guns .  One person killed, 4 
injured.  <P>
5/30/72:  22 days after the Sabina airliner was hijacked,  hijackers entered Lod Airport,  
grabbed an airliner on the ground and while fleeing the aircraft sprayed the airport lounge 
with machine guns killing 26  and injuring 76.<P>
An El Al airliner was attacked with a bomb in the luggage compartment, but by then El Al 
had armored the compartements on all their flights and no one was harmed.<P>
9/5/72:  In retaliation for this failure and an Israeli reprisal raid, the  Munich Massacre  was 
planned and carried out, the attack taking place at the Olympic village on the morning of 
9/5/72.<P>
10/72:  Lufthansa 615 was hijacked in October of '72 with no one being injured.<P>
4/73:  The USSR was not exempt from terrorist attacks as an Aeroflot airliner was hijacked 
by a bomb carrying hijacker in April of 1973.  The flight crew overcame the hijacker, and the 
hijacker and one crew member were killed when the bomb exploded.  <P>
7/20/73:  Three months later,  1 person was killed and 1 injured by explosion when a JAL 
airliner was hijacked.<P>
<P>
8/5/73:  A TWA airliner was hijacked to Athens, and while on the ground, 5 people were 
killed and 55 injured.<P>
12/73:  Four months later the same terrorist group hijacked a Lufthansa airliner, but 
fortunately no one was hurt.<P>
12/73:  But five days later, the Pan Am customs area was attacked, and a Pan Am airliner 
was taken over on the ground, with 30 people killed, and 28 injured.<P>
2/20/74:  An Air Vietnam airliner bomb in an aircharft carrying hijackers exploded the bomb 
in the air killing 3 and injuring 6 on Februrary 20, 1974.<P>
While other terrorist actions occurred, things calmed down on airliners...at least until ...<P>
6/03/75:   when 1 person was killed and 14 injured by a small bomb exploding and 
decompressing the aircraft, killing the would-be hijacker.<P>
6/27/76:  One of the most publicized airliner hijackings was the hijacking of  Air France flight 
139, an Airbus, by a  PLO  faction.  The aircraft had a very large number of Israelis on 
board, and when the aircraft finally landed at Entebbe Airport in Uganda, Israeli commandos 
went in and repatrioted the hostages.  Only four were killed, including the commando 
commander, Yani.  No hostage survived the rescue.<P>
7/2/76:  An Eastern Airlines aircraft suffered an explosion killing the hijacker.  No one else 
was killed.<P>
12/4/77:  Malaysian Airlines suffered their worse tragedy when an aircraft was hijacked and 
when the crew tried to overpower the hijacker, an explosion killed the aircrew and the aircraft 
crashed immediately killing all 93 on board.<P>
8/18/78:  Another Phillipines Airlines hijacker was killed by his bomb, injuring a crew member 
and two passengers.<P>
An El Al crewbus was hijacked while transporting the crew to an aircraft, 1 killed, 1 
injured.<P>
By the end of 1979, actual hijackings began to slow down with perhaps only 1 a year.<P>
But in areas where tensions remain, hijackings occur with alarming regularity...i.e.  Shiite 
Muslim  extremists hijacked a TWA airliner and forced it to land at Beirut airport (in 
Lebanon), and killed a U.S. Navy sailor.  <P>
Hijackings began to taper off as Islamic groups began to use other, more successful means 
to deliver their message.  Incidents at airports and against airliners on the ground have also 
occurred.<P>

AGMs are used in various air to surface roles, such as anti-tank attacks, attacks against 
ground force personnel, runways, or equipment. Included in this class of 
missiles are anti-shipping weapons..i.e. those weapons launched by aircraft i
upon surface or under-surface vessels, but excluding torpedoes.<P>

<H1>Air-to-Air Missile (AAMs) Database</H1>
</center>
Air-to-Air Missiles or AAMs are used by air-superiority fighters to attack enemy aircraft from the air.   Guidance may be by radar (beam follower or on-board missile Active all the time or Semi-
Active ranging) or InfraRed.  In most cases a radar lock from the aircraft is used to point the seeker to the target aircraft, then the seeker begins homing.  Once the seeker is locked on, the missile is 
released, upon which it follows its own guidance to the target.  In recent aircraft (fixed wing and helicopters), AAMs have been loaded in order to provide defensive capabilities, thus reducing the 
reliance on air cover aircraft.  For example, helicopter gunships may now carry AAMs in order to provide defensive or offensive tactics against other battlefield support helicopters, as well as 
defend against the faster and more agile attack fighters providing close air support to the battlefield.  The AAM in this role clearly removes the speed advantages of the attack fighter, since the 
AAM can move at speeds exceeding most aircraft designs, allowing the helicopter to add the reach of the AAM to its battlefield capability.<P>
The following is a list of the AAMs in use today throughout the world.<P>

<H1>Intelligence:  HUMINT Definition</h1>
<p></center>
Human intelligence gathering is performed either by interviewing a subject with knowlege of the target area, via the "tailing" of a subject of investigation, or by using a combination of "black" techniques to gain confessions or involuntary disclosure of information.  For example, the  <a href="/milnet/kgb.htm">KGB</a>  considered (in the cold war days) the following as standard practice and even have defined the "MICE" acronym  to help Soviet agents remember the "tricks of the trade" :

<dl>
<dt>M  =  <dd>Money...buy the agent (usually an agent can be bought for a ridicously low price). 
<dt>I   =  <dd>Ideology...turn dislike of his own country's system, or use a passion for socialism or communism. 
<dt>C   =  <dd>Comprimise...trick the target into a comprimising situation or use the person's past as a means of blackmail. 
<dt>E   =  <dd>Ego...appeal to the target who feels they deserve better treatment than they are getting, and/or
         make them feel more important in their own eyes. 
</dl>
<p>
Note that many intelligence types, at least in public, refer to the HUMINT task
in terms of phrases like "Having feet on the ground" or "Having a source on the
ground".  This refers to the need for hard HUMINT data to backup or supplant

<H1>Intelligence:  TECHINT Definition</h1>
<p></center>
Technical Intelligence (TECHINT) is the intelligence gathering method which uses technical means, i.e. computers, radio gear, overhead photography, etc. as the primary means of collection of the material.  
<p>
Many Intelligence Directors have made the career limiting mistake of relying 
too much on TECHINT, assuming that everything can be seen or heard using the
various sensors designed under the realm of TECHINT.  But as they have learned
the hard way, it is difficult (and sometimes deadly) to mount a mission with
solid <a href="/milnet/humint.htm">HUMINT</a> data.  <p>

<H1>Intelligence:  ACOUSINT Definition</h1>
<p></center>
ACOUSINT is the collection of acoustical information underwater such as sonar "signatures" or sound signatures (gathered via sensitive hydrophones).  

One example of the gathering technique and implementation is the SOSUS line which is a long line of hydrophones laid under the Bering Straight.  The mission of this sensor line is to note the passing of Soviet ships leaving their waters through the Straight.  For instance, a massive movement of submarines across the line would indicate a possible move to wartime footing.  The data from the SOSUS network is used to identify a number of submarines by their  unique acoustical signature.  Thus a nation's Navy is able to track individual submarines.<p>

<H1>Intelligence:  COMINT/SIGINT</H1>
<p></center>
COMINT (Communications Intelligence) is the collection capability for 
the interception and decoding of communications traffic.  Usually the most
desired type of traffic is clandestine or private, but clearly there is a
role in monitoring and analysing traffic sent in the "clear" as military
protocol does sometime fail and information of incredible worth is sometimes
sent without the usual coding.  Various <a href="/milnet/iagency.htm#SIGINT">organizations</a> provide COMINT 
functions for various governments around the world, with these groups usually
part of the intelligence apparatus of those nations.  For instance, the group
in the U.S. that collects COMINT is the <a href="/milnet/nsa.htm">NSA</a>
(according to the unclassified portions of the <a href="/milnet/intauth.htm">Intelligence Authorization
Act of 1981</a> and its predecessor, the <a href="/milnet/ilaws.htm"#NSA47">National Security Act of 1947</a>. 

A more <a href="/milnet/comint2.htm">precise definition</a> is available.

<p>
The SIGINT acronym stands for Signals Intelligence and is a left over from
the days of intercepting radio traffic.  While today we hear of many cases
of signals intercepts (like the fabled intercept of Kremlin power brokers
using their car phones), most traffic today can be found on some kind of
"land line", and thus is a requires a much different approach to tap.  However, many such 
land lines terminate in a satellite uplink, and thus either the uplink or
the downlink can be monitored as well, thus keeping SIGINT a high priority
means of gathering COMINT.

<p></center>
ELINT is the collection of electronics intelligence, typically the collection of the target's electronic countermeasures capabilities, including such things as jamming capability, electronic deception capability, and other electronic emanations.  ELINT overlaps the areas of RADINT (Radar Intelligence) , COMINT (Communications Intelligence) , and
 TELINT (Telemetery Intelligence...i.e. intercepts of space vehicle telemetery during launch, in orbit, or during terminal stages)  since these areas are also concerned primarily with electronic emmissions.

ELINT can be gathered by means of  airborne platforms, ships on or below the sea, and in rising numbers via  satellites .

<p></center>
LASINT or laser intelligence, is a fairly new category in TECHINT, dealing with the collection of information on the target's laser capability.  This may include such items as laser designators (used to guide "smart" weapons onto target via illumination with an infrared laser), laser weapons (ala the Strategic Defense Initiative), or anti-laser capabilities (as in rejection or absorbsion of laser light to prevent successful laser designation).

As this is a recent "INT", there are few details, with much of the activity still remaining classified.  LASINT can, of course, be gathered by space-borne or
airborne reconnaissance/surveillance platforms.

PHOTOINT (Photographic Intelligence) is the collection of intelligence via  <a href="/milnet/overhead.htm">overhead reconaissance</a>, typically gathered by high flying aircraft or satellites.  There are a number of ways photography aids in the reconaissance effort. 

Obviously, the first is the spotting of a suspicious object on the film plate.  But more often, it is the change noticed between sucessive photographs over a period of time.  For instance if a barren field is photographed with infrared, then sometime later another picture shows a cooler spot there, it might mean that an underground bunker has been dug.

<H1>Intelligence:  RADINT Definition</h1>
<p></center>
RADINT or radar intelligence is a specialized form of ELINT, which categorizes and locates the target's radar emmissions.  This is extremely useful information in time of battle, as one of the first steps taken to ensure a successful attack is to take out the target's radar systems to disable their detection of and defense against incoming missiles or aircraft.

There are special  aircraft  used to "ferret" out radar signatures by encroaching into target airspace or by performing other activities which entice the target to "light up" and illuminate the enticing aircraft with their radar.  Once on the air, the "ferret" aircraft then records the location of the emmitter, its type and strength for later tactical use.

<H1>Intelligence:  TELINT Definition</h1>
<p></center>
TELINT or telemetry intelligence, is the collection and analysis of telemetry data from the target's missile or sometimes (rarely) from aircraft tests.  The data gathered is typically sent from the test vehicle in order for ground crews to analyze how the test vehicle is performing and in the case of catastrophic failures provide very valuable information on what may have caused the failure.  TELINT tells us a lot about our target's test vehicles, and thus telemetry from test vehicles is now encoded.  Thus the decoding of TELINT usually must take place after the TELINT data is passed onto the de-crypting agency.  In the U.S., this de-crypting probably takes place at the <a href="/milnet/nsa.htm">NSA</a>.

<H1>Intelligence:  Sensors</h1>
<p></center>
As described in the C3I Handbook  1,  there are a number of important sensor characteristics which govern how effective a nation's C3I system will be in even the most limited warfare.  Sensors have been used basically in one of three functions:
   o  Threat warning or detection and identification of hostile weapons systems (i.e. radar warning receivers, passive sonar)
   o  Surveillance and detection or the tracking and identification of all targets and events within a general area.
   o  Fire control or acquiring, tracking, and engaging targets using a fire control sensor (i.e. radar) to director weapon delivery.
These sensors can be either passive, active, or combine both modes to provide for one of the functions listed.

Today, Knowlege based systems are being experimented with to help make the kinds of decisions only a human operator can make, and to combine the comuter's ability to manipulate larger amounts of data while applying the human decision process to sensor supplied data.  

The technology is being explored as part of the Army/Air Force Joint Tactical Fusion Program.  One element of this program is the All Source Analysis System (ASAS), a transportable semiautomatic tactical intelligence data processing system known as the Enemy Situation Correlation Element (ENSCE).  The objective is to combine data from a large variety of sensors to provide verified data about the conditions in the battlefield.

There are a number of discrete sensor characteristics that must be considered in evaluating sensor systems:
<p>
<dl> 
<dt><b>Detection Performance</b>                  	<dd>Detection characteristics (false alarm rate, detection probabilities and ranges) for a
                                                           	calibrated target characteristic in a given noise background.
<dt><b>Spatial/Temporal Resolution</b>        	<dd>Ability to distinquish between two or more targets in space or time.

<dt><b>Spatial Coverage</b>                           	<dd>Spatial volume covered by the sensor, for scanning sensors this may be described

                                                       	regard achievable by moving the scan pattern.

<dt><b>Detection/Tracking Modes</b>         	<dd>Search and tracking modes performed:
                                                                1.  Staring or scanning

                                                                3.  Single or multimode (track-while-scan/stare)

<dt><b>Target Revist Rate</b>                        	<dd>Rate at which a given target is revisted by the sensor to perform sample 
                                                         	measurement (for instance, staring sensors are rated as continous).

<dt><b>Measurement Accuracy</b>                    	<dd>Accuracy of sensor measurements in terms of statistics.

<dt><b>Measurement Dimensionality</b>   	<dd>Number of measurement variables (range, range rate, and spectral features)
                                                         	between target categories.

<dt><b>Hard/Soft Data Reporting</b>       	<dd>Sensor outputs are provided either as hard-decision (threshold) reports or as

NIS in terms of the Internet is quite complex.  We hope we can help out by giving you a tutorial on how NIS is supposed to work.  First, however, let's look at the file structure that supports NIS:

Now let's look at how we fill in these files to get the job done!

</center><H1>OneStep Internet Services Provider Services - Do Your Own NT 
</h1>
<p>
Okay, its not that tough.  An IP address is nothing more than 4 sets of numbers,kind of like your telephone area code, prefix and last four digits.  In this case however we use a speical notation to write them down.  This is usually called an octet.  Here is what one looks like:
<p>
<center>
<img src="blumrbt4.gif">
</center>
<p>
IP Octets are created by a network administrator.  The admin type is tasked with choosing the addresses from a pool handed over for his or her administration by an organization known as the NIC.  In truth however, the IP address has grown into a larger than life element of something called Domain Name Services.  So really, the NIC hands out a domain name, and establishes an IP address range for that domain.  What's a domain...just a range of IP addresses.  Simple.  
<p>
There are three kinds of Domains that used to available, a class A (like having your own 800 number and all those digits behind it!), a class B (like having all the numbers in your prefix), and a class C (like having say a third of all the numbers in the last four digits of your phone number.
<p>
Using the standard IP octed, here is how you can view the three classes:
<p><center>
<img src="ipclass.gif">
<p></center>
So you might be assigned an IP address of 203.190.112.143.  Your office mate might be assigned 203.190.112.46.  If everyone in your building has a 203.190.112 as the first three numbers in the octet, then chances are your building (at least) has been assigned a class C domain.
<p>
<h2>URLs</h2>
<p>
URLs are nothing more than a symbolic reference that will take a web user to a new page or a new place on the same page.  See the URL primer</a> for more info.
<p>
We mention them here, cuz often inside a URL is a domain name...i.e. www.onestep.com, is a domain with WWW tacked on the front.  If you wanted to go to see the onestep WWW home page, you'd use the URL of "http://www.onestep.com/".  Obviously you know now tha the onestep.com is really an IP address (205.185.9.42 at the writing of this document).  The WWW tells us the URL is for the home page of a server, and the "http" tells us the kind of TCP/IP service we should be looking for.  In this case, "http" stands for the protocol that delivers WEB pages across the Internet.
<p>
So there you have it...IP addresses, Domains, and URLs...all in one swell fwoop!

Do It Yourself:  Layout</h1>
<p>
The best idea we've seen for creating a layout of your web pages comes from software engineers who, thinking of themselves as artists, copied an idea from Hollywood.  
<p>
<p>
<center>			<img src="pages.gif">
</center>
<h2>Storyboards</h2>
<p>
The idea is nothing more than just taking a sheaf of papers and roughly sketching out what you want your heirarchy to look like.  Each page represents a level of the heirarchy...usually themselves comprised of text and graphics that represent a particular subject or group of topics.  This is very much like the storyboard process used in hollywood to figure out scenes flows from one to another, establishing transistion points as well as "forks" in the plot.
<p>
Your web pages are not much different.  To start yourself out, try just putting down headings and wavy lines for the text that goes in place under them.  Draw a square for each graphic you want to use.  Later we will size them to fit better, but for now just note their existence and roughly where they should go on the page.
<p>
Once you have your pages laid out (and you don't have to lay out all of them, perhaps just a few layers, from the home page down the links to say two or three layers), then its time to think about how your going to link them.  
<p>
<P>
<center>			<img src="trans.gif">
</center>
<H2>Transitions</h2>
Just like in good literature or a decent movie, your transitions must "hook" the reader into reading further.  Fortunately, html and web browsers help a lot by underlining and coloring the link text blue for you.  Doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out how to move to a new topic in the World Wide Web.  But you are the one now trying to guide your target user to the message you want to deliver.
<p>
In your storyboards, you laid out subjects that led from the home page down through a heirarchy, to the last pages.  This heirarchy probably represents a heirarchy of topics...subjects of interest to your target user.  Now you just figure out a keyword that will be highlighted by the linking process, a keyword that your target user will intuitively understand leads to the message you have prepared.  Sounds difficult?  Nonsense.  Look at the previous pages in this tutorial heirarchy.   
<p>
We started from creating a home page down into the basic topics needed to make you a pro at creating your web pages.  
<p>
And if you find that the keyword used today is not right tomorrow, simply change it.  The html system makes this easy to do with no fuss.

<p>
<B><H1>The Boland Amendment</H1>
<p>
</center>
</B>Passed on December 8, 1982, this amendment to the  War Powers  Act 
of 1973, states that U.S. Agencies are prohibited from providing 
military equipment, training or support to anyone "for the purpose of 
overthrowing the Government of Nicaragua."  <P>
The literal purpose was to prevent any CIA funds or support to go to the 
Sadinista (rebels fighting against the communist Nicaraguan government).  
Congress felt this was necessary because the Reagan administration had 
pledged to support the Sadinistas in their battle for freedom for their 
country.  Unfortunately a very left leaning Democratic Congress 
prohibited the administration from continuing funding to support the 
Sandinistas at a critical time.  As it became evident this was a 
mistake, Congress repealed the Amendment and re-instituted the funding.  
Eventually the U.S. and Sandinista pressure resulted in democratic 
elections in Nicaragua.<P>
The actual wording of the Amendment was interpreted to disallow only 
U.S. Intelligence Agencies, thus allowing members of the staff of the 
NSC (which is not an Intelligence Agency of the U.S. government) to 
route funds to the Sandinistas.  A angry democratic Congress responded 
by attempting to prosecute Col. Oliver North, Adm. John Poindexter and 
others in a set of public hearings.  North was convicted on a number of 
charges but finally exonerated of all but a minor infraction, Adm. John 
Poindextor (ret'd) was convicted of lieing to Congress.  <P>

<h1>MILNET:  former KGB </h1>
<p>

<h2>Komitet Gosudarstvennoy Bezopasnosti</h2> 
Translation:  "Committee  for State Security" 
<p>
Organized into five numbered  "Chief" directorates, several large un-numbered  directorates, and a number of directly reporting  deparments.  According to Viktor Suvorov in  "Soviet Military Intelligence", the mission of the KGB is "...not to allow the collapse of the Soviet Union from the inside...". 
<p>
The KGB is thought to have had more power than the GRU, its sister organization tasked with military intelligence.  
<p>
The following are notes on the KGB, taken from Richelson's <i><b>Sword and Shield</b></i>  and verified by research in a number of titles listed in the <a href="biblio.htm#sword">MILNET Bibliography</a>.  In fact you haven't read any of Richelson's works yet, and you have in interest in the details of world intelligence organizations, consult the bibliography and go check them out of your library.
<p>
The notes below are dated...since the breakup of the former Soviet Union, who knows what is the structure of the replacement for the KGB.  The naive person might expect that there was no replacement.  However recent events have shown that the Russian Intelligence apparatus still exists, at least for the purposes of espionage and external security.
<p>
<h2> The Committee for State Security (KGB)</h2>
 <p> 
 The KGB is an extremely large organization, taking a far  
 greater number of tasks that any Western counterpart, simply  
 because in the strictly controlled society, there are far  
 more things to investigate and just about every person will  
 be watched.  The Chief Directorates and other groups at that  
 same level are: 
<p>

<H1>MILNET:  Intelligence Interpretation</h1>
<p>
<b>Intrepretation:</b>  The process of making rational conclusions based upon
the <a href="analysis.htm">analysis</a> of <a href="collecti.htm">collected</a> 
intelligence.  The intrepretation can be anything from discerning a particular
shape in a photograph to mean a silo has been captured on film, to making a
judgement that a particular activity or event has some new or special impact on 
other events, countries, or even world activity.

<H1>MILNET:  Intelligence Planning</h1>
<p></center>
 
</pre>
The planning portion of Intelligence is possible the most important.  Planning includes how to manage intelligence data gathered, as well as operations planning.  For instance, the U.S. <a href= "cia.htm">CIA</a> has a covert operations group, which has a director for planning.  This planning directorate ensures logistics, personnel, and supply are all ready to aid the covert action group in their task.  This planning directorate, through its director and any of the chain of command below it, works closely with the other directorates in covert actions to ensure coordination and  successful operations.  Planning may also lay out strategies for a complex operation which might include psychological operations, air drops of supplies, and placement of agents in the field.

<H2>Laws and Directives </H2>
<H2>Enabling Intelligence Work 
</H2>
<H2>Or Counter-Terrorism</H2>
</center>
<p>
In the following paragraphs, we outline major aspects of various legal 
actions taken by the U.S. legislature.  In many cases, the legislation
is incremental, that is, approves all previous legislation, modifies that
older legislation, or makes additions.  In our research, the only exception
to this statements occurred during fights between Congress and a minority 
party President over War Operations, or Clandestine Operations (such as 
President Reagan and the Contras).  For more information on this and related 
topics, see <a href="/milnet/hughes.htm">Hughes-Ryan Act</a>.  One exception
to the stated exception is the rescinding of the ability for CIA covert
operations to assassinate world leaders by President Ford in February of 
1976 (<a href="#ford">see below</a>).
<a name="NSA47">
<H1>National Security Act of 
1947</H1>
<p>
</B>Established the Central Intelligence Agency, giving the DCI the 
authority to protect secrets,  specifically sources and methods.  The 
agency would receive its funds directly from Congress in a lump sum so 
as to insure secrecy of activity and of which there would be no 
accounting outside the agency.  Details of the types of overt and covert 
information collection sources were spelled out and the drafters of the 
act thought that the CIA  should have an "instant" capability for 
subversive operations.  Note the use of capability  rather than 
establishing the the CIA could actually execute  subversive operations.  
<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 4/A</H2>
</B>December, 1947, placed the CIA in charge of covert "psychological" 
operations, with the US State Department supplying policy guidance.  1 
<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Un-numbered Document, 
1948</H2>
</B>Truman, Forrestal, and Marshall overruled DCI Hillenkoetter thus 
allowing James Angleton to set up a covert operation in Italy to counter 
communist subversion of the Italian government.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 10/2</H2>
</B>June 1948, superseded NSC Directive 4/A, established a covert 
operational branch within the CIA in the interests of world peace and US 
national security.  Specifically, its covert operations would have to be 
of a type for which "the US Government can plausibly disclaim any 
responsibility", and could not involve "armed conflict by recognized 
military forces".  Activities premitted included "propaganda; economic 
warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, 
demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, 
including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerillas and 
refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist 
elements in threatened countries of the free world".  <P>
<P>
The "10/2 Panel" containing representatives from the Department of 
Defense and Department of State, was given the responsiblity to 
supervise covert operations with the NSC being the mediator on disputes.  
2<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Central Intelligence Act of 
1949</H2>
</B>Authorized the Director of Central Intelligence to receive, 
exchange, and spend money without giving account to Congress in 
accordance with the laws governing other agencies.  It also authorized 
special training for CIA officers as well as other administrative things 
such as employment conditions; hiring practices (storage or shipment of 
household goods, etc.); allowed CIA to borrow personnel from other 
agencies or the military; to ignore immigration laws in recruiting up to 
100 defecters per year; and gave the DCI the authority to declare and 
keep secrets.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 68</H2>
</B>04/14/50, called for nuclear and conventional arms build up as well 
as covert operations to subvert Communist regimes.  3<P>
<P>
<B><H2>McCarren Act of 1951</H2>
</B>Passed via override of Truman's veto, placed severe restrictions on 
civil liberties, also known as the internal security law.  Chief concern 
to intelligence agencies was the provision which prohibited the 
admission to the U.S. of territory and citizenship of radical aliens, 
thus cutting off the supply of valuable defectors.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Communications Intelligence 
Activities Memorandum</H2>
</B>Approximate date, 10/24/52, President Harry S. Truman, an eight page 
document, only now partially declassified, abolishing the Armed Forces 
Security Agency and placing their resources into the new National 
Security Agency.  Specifically gives to the NSA the control over, and 
coordination of, the collection and processing of Communications 
Intelligence.  NSA considered to be "within but not part of the DOD". 
6<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 5412/I</H2>
</B>03/12/55, Defines covert operations as "all activities...so planned 
and executed that any U.S. Government responsibility for them is not 
evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the U.S. 
Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them."  Thus we 
have plausible deniability.  It also listed the covert operations the 
CIA was expected to undertake as:<P>
"Propoganda, political action; economic warfare; escape and evasion and 
evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states or groups 
including assistance to underground movements, guerillas and refugee 
liberation groups; support of indigenous and anti-communist elements in 
threatened countries of the free world; deception plans and operations; 
and all activities compatible with this directive necessary to 
accomplish the foregoing."  4<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Decision Memorandum 40, 
1970</H2>
</B>February 17, 1970, established the 40 Committee to oversea covert 
operations just as in the 303 Committee and Special Groups had in the 
past, in this case, the 40 Committee was made up of the Chairman, Henry 
Kissinger (Nixon's Foreign Policy Advisor) as the Chairman of the 
committee, the Deputy Secratary of State, the Deputy Secratary of 
Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and DCI Richard 
Helms.<P>
The Committee quickly established the following set of requirements of 
covert operations that would be brought before the Committee for 
review:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Operations costing more than $25,000, or
<LI>Support political or military groups, or 
<LI>Economic, paramilitary, counterinsurgence in nature, or
<LI>Politically sensitive
</UL>
<P>
<B><H2>1971 Fund Cuts for CIA SEA 
Action</H2>
</B>12/71, Congress cut off CIA funds for use in Laos and Cambodia.  
Proposed by Senator Clifford P. Case in July of 1971, prohibiting the 
use of funds to pay for U.S. paramilitary operations in Cambodia and 
Laos (especially prohibiting the CIA).<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Case-Zablocki Act of 1972</H2>
</B>Insisted on Congressional review of all executive agreements.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>War Powers Act of 1973</H2>
</B>Prohibited the President from waging war for more than sixty days 
without congressional approval.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>HUGHES-RYAN ACT OF 
1974</H2>
</B>Amendment to the Foreign Assitance Act of 1974, requiring the 
President to report and  nonintelligence CIA operations to relevant 
Congressional committees (at the time this numbered around 8 committee) 
in a timely fashion.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Church Committee, 1974</H2>
</B>On January 27, 1974, the U.S. Senate voted to create the Select 
Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence 
Activities.  During the study, a complete history of the CIA was 
documented by Anne Karalekas. 1<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Clark Amendment, 1975</H2>
</B>1/75, the House passed this amendment (having already been passed in 
the Senate) to cut off funds for covert operations in Angola.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>House Select Committee on 
Intelligence, 1975 </H2>
</B>02/19/75, created by the U.S. House of Representatives to provide 
House oversight in addition to Senate oversight, since the House 
provides all appropriations.  The Committee was made the House Permanent 
Committee on Intelligence on July 14, 1977.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence, 1976</H2>
</B>05/19/76, US Senate voted to establish their own committee to 
oversee Intelligence operations in the U.S.<P>
<P>
<a name="ford">
<B><H2>1976 Presidential Directive</H2>
</B>2/18/76:  Henry Kissinger, Chairman of the NSC under Ford, created 
the Committee on Foreign Intelligence reporting to the NSC Chairman, 
with the DCI as the chair of the new Committee.  Ford also replaced the 
40 Committee with a five-man Operations Advisory Group.  Ford also 
<b>outlawed assassination</b> as an instrument of American Policy.  In this 
directive he also detailed the CIAs domestic duties, and accepted the 
principle of a joint Congressional oversight committee.  Congress did 
not set up a joint committee however, the House and Senate each having 
their own committees.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Presidential Executive Order 
12036, 1978</H2>
</B>President Carter, reiterating changes made by his predecessor Gerald 
Ford, retension of the Intelligence Oversight Board to mointor activiies 
possibly involving illegality or impropriety, listed a number of 
prohibited activities which might concievably impinge upon the rights or 
privacy of U.S. citizens and resident aliens.  The order was rescinded 
until 1981.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Foreign Intelligence Surviellance 
Act of 1978</H2>
</B>10/25/78:  Following the lead by the Carter administration, Congress 
passed this law which legalizes the use of wiretaps and bugs in 
suspected cases of foreign espionage, terrorism, and sabotage; but only 
after a case by case review by a new set of Federal Judges, who must 
issue a Federal Warrant.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Classified Information Protection 
Act of 1980</H2>
</B>Sets a procedure for revealing of sensitive classified information 
in a trial, such that only a few of the people in the trial may see it, 
and who must also sign an oath not to reveal any part of the 
information.  It's intent is to allow the course of justice to continue 
in cases where the government pleads that release of information needed 
in the case will damage National Security if released to the public.  
<P>
This law was used in the April 1986 trial of former U.S. Army 
Intelligence agent Richard C. Smith who was acquitted of all charges.  
Smith's story was that he had been an agent posing, at the bequest of 
the CIA, as a disgrunlted former Intelligence officer to entrap KGB 
agents.  <P>
Althought the story was never confirmed, certainly there was not enough 
evidence to the contary leaving room for much doubt in the government's 
case and Smith was acquitted.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Intelligence Authorization Act of 
1981</H2>
</B>In the case of necessary immediate action, only the Chairman and 
Vice Chairman of each committee, and the majority leaders of the Senate 
and House would have to be notified with a follow on briefing when time 
permitted.  The method for notification was specified as a "finding" 
which would fully describe the activity, and be given to Congress within 
a reasonable period of time following the activity beginning. <P>
<P>
<a name="domestic">
<B><H2>Presidential Directive 12333, 
1981</H2>
</B>President Reagan, on December 12, 1981, re-issued the Presidental 
Directive which defines the U.S. Intelligence community.  In this 
directive, Reagan is purported to have allowed more scope to spy at home 
and to follow up the <b>domestic</b> dimensions of foreign agent activity with 
which it was concerned.  CIA was given more power to act within the 
confines of the U.S., but only where surveillance or covert activities 
did not target U.S. corporations or citizens, and where such activities 
are not intended to influence U.S. political processes, public opinion 
or the media.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Boland Amendment, 1982</H2>
</B>12/08/82, Introduced by the chairman of the House Intelligence 
Committee, Edward P. Boland, prohibiting intelligence agencies from 
providing military equipment, training or support to anyone "for the 
purpose of overthrowing the Government of Nicaragua". 5<P>
<P>
<B><H2>House Intelligence Identities Act of 
1982</H2>
</B>06/82, protects against disclosure of the identities of agents 
either directly or through release of incriminating information.  
Provides for penalities for those who named names in a deliberate 
attempt to harm the U.S. Intelligence effort.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Amendment to the Freedom of 
Information Act, 1984</H2>
</B>11/84, sponsored by Senator Barry Goldwater, Head of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence, exempts CIA employees from responding 
to Freedom of Information Act requests except where such requests are 
from former employees of the CIA who are in legal action with the 
government.<P>

<title>MILNET:  U.S. Launch Vehicles</title><BR>


<H1>U.S. Launch Vehicles</H1>

<P>
The U.S.' use of rockets to place military payloads into orbit
started with the U.S.' first entry into space, a payload atop
the Redstone Rocket. Today, the launch vehicles fall into two
classes, the expendable, and re-useable launch vehicles.
<H2>Re-useable</H2>

<P>
The primary example of the re-useable launch vehicle class is
the Shuttle Transportation System (STS) otherwise known as the
Space Shuttle. In fact, the USAF had very ambitious plans to operate
their own space shuttle launch faclity at Vandenburg, AFB, California,
until the Challenger disaster curtailed launches of the STS system,
and the resultant weakening political environment made it impossible
to continue.
<P>
Currently one other re-useable space craft launch system is under
consideration, as part of the National AeroSpace Plane (NASP)
program (also known as the X-30A program. Few details are available
on the actual system, but it is intended to be a re-useable, hypersonic
vehicle, capable of one stage insertion into space, and launch
and recovery from standard airfields. Currently the program is
under the management of NASA.
<H2>Expendables</H2>

<P>
The expendable launch vehicles are currently based upon liquid
fueled, multi-staged rockets, with rather enormous lifting cababiliity.
In the case of military launches, NASA launches help fill some
of the lift needs of all the services, with the USAF launch facility
at Vandenberg AFB, CA. providing all other launches.
<P>
Expendable launch vehicles have been mostly centered around the
same boosters used in the U.S. civilian space program. For instance,
an old standard for U.S. military launches was the Atlas launch
vehicle series.
<P>
Today, payloads have increased to a size that requires the Space
Shuttle in order to place them in orbit, and with Shuttle's mission
load, it has placed the services in position of not having the
launch vehicles they need against the time table required.
<P>
To insure that this occurrance does not repeat itself, the military
is expediting the delivery of the Titan IVD launch vehicle derivative
Titan Centaur.
<P>
The following is a list of the current launch vehicles in use
by the U.S. military:

On August 16, 1988, the USAF awarded contracts to Boeing Aerospace,
General Dynamics Space Systems Division, and the team of McDonnell
Douglas Space Systems for design and technology demonstration
of a heavy-lift Advanced Launch System (ALS) capable of lifting
160,000 pounds into low-earth orbit. NASA is a major participant
in this effort as well. Intended IOC was to be in the year 2000,
but budget problems may slip this as &quot;stretchouts&quot; occur.

<H1>National Security Council Intelligence Directives (NSCIDs)</H1>
<P></center>
NSCIDs are executive 
level directives intended to provide guidance to all of the elements of 
the intelligence community.   As such they might detail guidelines for 
executing roles within the intelligence community as in the case of 
NSCID No. 1, which details the "Basic Duties and Responsibilities" for 
the <a href="dcis.htm">DCI</a> (Director of Central Intelligence).  According to Richelson, the first 
NSCID was issued in 1947, then upgraded as necessary in 1952, 
1958, 1961, 1964, and "...As of 1981 the last major revision appears to 
have been completed on February 17, 1972."  <B>1</B> <P>
NSCIDs are sometimes instrumental in stimulating other directives in 
lower deparments, and in fact give the DCI authority to issue DCIDs.  
<P>
The following are the NSCIDs thought to be in effect as of 2/17/72:<P>
                                                              <P>
<h2>NSCIDs</h2>
<hr>
<OL>
<LI>"Basic Duties and Responsibilities" -  assigns  DCI  four major responsibilities and authorizes 
issuance of <a href="dcids.htm">DCIDs</a>.
<LI>"Coordination of Overt Activities" - makes DCI responsible for planning of collection and 
reporting of various government agencies.
<LI>"Coordination of Intelligence Production" - outlines the split of production responsibilities 
between the Dept. of State, Department of Defense (DOD),  CIA, and <a href="nfib.htm">NFIB</a>.
<LI>"The Defector Program" - presumably CIA program specific.
<LI>"U.S. Espionage and Counterintelligence Activities Abroad".
<LI>"Signals Intelligence" - Charter for the <a href="nsa.htm">NSA</a>, secret.
<LI>"Critical Information" - Changed from 1947 title, secret.
<LI>"Photographic Interpretation" -  directs activities of the National Photographic Interpretation 
Center (<a href="npic.htm">NPIC</a>).

<H1>Presidential Directive of 1976</H1>
<p></center>
President Ford, in this Presidential Directive, established the 
Committee on Foreign Intelligence, reporting to the NSC Chairman, 
Kissinger, and with the DCI as the Chairman of this new committee.<P>
This directive also outlawed assassination as an instrument of American 
policy.<P>
This directive also (as each President does) outlines the CIAs domestic 
duties, and accepted the principle of a joint Congressional Oversight 
committee, however the Congress chose not to setup a joint committe, 
rather elected to each have their own committees.<P>

<H1>CIA Covert Operations</H1>
</center>

<P>
<H2>Historical Beginnings</H2>

<P>
<B>1947:</B>  Formed by Truman, as supported by section 102 of
the National Security Act of 1947 principally assigned the missions
of:
<UL>
<LI>Coordinate the U.S. intelligence effort.
<LI>Correlate and evaluate intelligence (but other intelligence
agencies may also do so).
<LI>CIA will access to the product of other intelligence agencies
(including information from the FBI)
<LI>Eschew police and internal security functions (in other words
no domestic operation
<LI>CIA reports to the President through the National Security
Council and should perform such other functions and duties related
to intelligence affecting the national security as the National
Security Council may from time to time direct.
</UL>

<P>

<P>
<B>12/47:</B>  NSC Directive 4/A placed the CIA in charge of &quot;psychological
operations&quot;, most likely in response to the October formation
of the Cominform, a collective propoganda organization whose members
were not only the Eastern Bloc countries but included the Soviet
Union, France, Italy, Bulgariak, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Poland,
Romania, and Yugoslavia.  The addition of France and Italy in
this list did not come as a surprise, as it was seen that the
Soviet Union was already infiltrating labor unions, student organizations,
women's organizations, and others in both countries.  The CIA
had already been directed by the CIA to &quot;prop up&quot; the
democracy in Italy.
<P>
<B>12/22/47:</B>  DCI Hillinkoetter sent James Angleton to Italy
to set up a &quot;special procedure group&quot; to direct such
covert operations as &quot;might be authorized&quot;.  By 1948,
Angleton was receiving adequate sums to be used to subsidize the
center right in Italian politics, and to manipulate opinion through
forgeries and other devices.
<P>
<B>1/48:</B>  Secratary of State Forrestal urged DCI Hillenkoetter
to intensify cover operations in Italy to support the democratic
government.  Forrestal was reluctant both becuase of the repercussions
to any public disclosure which could occur, and because he the
agency's legal counsel did not believe they had the authority
to conduct covert operations without the advice and consent of
the U.S. Senate. 
<P>
<B>2/48:</B>  NSC declared Italy essential to the U.S. national
security, and that the country be preserved from external attack
and from subversion by Soviet dominated communist movements within
Italy.
<P>
<B>4/9/48:</B>  During meetings to setup the charter for the Organization
of American States (OAS), the Liberal Party opposition leader
Jorge Eliecar Gaitan was killed by an assasin.  This touched off
riots, all occuring on the same day as the U.S. Washington Post
had released the precepts of a U.S. propoganda program to &quot;counter-inform&quot;.
 The CIA was wrongly taken to task for not providing intelligence
on the riot.    
<P>
<B>5/48:</B>  NSC 10/2 cancelled 4/A and established a new covert
operational branch of the CIA.  Its covert operations would have
to be of a type which the U.S. Government can plausibly disclaim
any responsibility and could not involve armed conflict by recognized
military forces, but could include propoganda; economic warfare;
preventitive direct action, including sabotage, anti- sabotage,
demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile
states, includingg assistance to underground resistance movements,
guerillas and refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous
anti-communist elements in threatened countries of the free world.

<P>
<B>1949:</B>  Central Intelligence Act of 1949, provided the CIA
with a seal of office, authorized training for CIA officers, and
specified employment conditions (personnel issues).  More importantly,
the act specified how the CIA could use secret funds (one budget
item to be doled out by the DCI as needed without normal accounting
review), the right to borrow personnel from other agencies of
government (Military, FBI, NSA, etc.), to ignore immigration laws,
allowing up to one hundred illegal aliens  per year (allowing
the use of defectors), and gave the DCI the right to determine
what in the CIA is should be kept secret. 
<H2>Chronological History of Operations</H2>

<P>
<B>RADIO FREE EUROPE, 1949  </B>
<P>
Radio Free Europe setup as a major propoganda tool, broadcasting
into Eastern Europe.
<P>
<B>GREECE, 1949</B>
<P>
Truman authorized major aid to Greek anti-communists as part of
a coopertive plan with the British MI-6.
<P>
<B>ALBANIA, 1949  </B>
<P>
CIA's first (as far as we know) attempt to topple a government,
was against the goverment of Enver Hoxha of Albania.  This was
also a plan taken over from the financially strapped British (MI-6).
  Funds were given to the British to support their agents in Albania.
 The operations failed, primarily it would seem due to Kim Philby,
a very famous Soviet Agent in the British MI-6 contingent in Washington,
D.C.
<P>
<B>PHILIPPINES 1948</B>
<P>
<B>1948-1954:</B>  CIA worked with indigenous folk in the Philippines
to help defeat the HUK left wing insurgency movement (funds and
support were used rather than actual CIA agents).  This was a
clear case of successful counter-insurgency due to a major contribution
of Lt. Colonel Edward G. Lansdale, an Air Force Officer actually
volunteered to the the CIA who befriended Ramon Magsaysay who
was eventually elected in 1953.  As part of this operation the
U.S. built 4000 prefabricated schoolhouses.  The key to the victory
was the advocacy of local nationalism and promotion by indigenous
personnel rather than advocacy from external sources.
<P>
<B>10/10/49:</B>  Civil Air Transport began operating exclusively
as part of the CIA's worlwide air transport company, and now the
most well known of the CIA &quot;propietaries&quot;.
<P>
<B>IRAN 1953</B>
<P>
<B>8/53:</B>  Prime Minister of Iran, Mohammed Mosaddeq was ousted
by Mohammed Reza Shah Pahlavi, who became the Shah of Iran.  The
&quot;legned&quot; is that five U.S. Army officers on loan to
the CIA financed the coup with US$1 million worth of Iranian cash
in Tehran, led by Kermit (Kim) Roosevelt, the grandson of Teddy
Roosevelt and cousin to FDR.  British Petroleum (in their wholly
owned company Anglo-Iranian Old Company) probably contributed
a great deal to the coup as well.
<P>
<B>GUATEMALA 1954</B>
<P>
<B>1954:</B>  CIA engineered the downfall of the democratically
elected leftward leaning President of Guatemala Jacobo Arbenz
Guzman.  Unfortunately the man taking over was Colonel Carlos
Castillo Armas who soon became a notorious dictator.  The coup
was in part due to propoganda broadcasts from the &quot;Voice
of Liberation&quot; radio stations run by the CIA accusing Arbenz
of ineptitude, and having communist sympathies (including faking
news of a shipment of arms from Czechoslovakia).  The final lie
was news of a massive overland invading force of rebels, which
were in fact air missions by CAT and the CIA.  It should be noted
that Che Guevara narrowly escaped capture in the operation, and
became a problem thereafter until his murder later in another
CIA operation.
<P>
<B>HUNGARY 1956</B>
<P>
Due to a promise made by the Republican administration to free
Eastern Europe, a means for enciting trouble within the Eastern
bloc countries was being searched for.  A copy of Kruschev's secret
de-Stalinization speech was broadcast over Radio Free Europe.
 The members of the Hungarian Desk at Radio Free Europe further
hinted at U.S. aid coming to help East European countries who
rose against the communists.  Hungarian dissidents killed 7000
Russians while taking losses of 30,000 themselves before the revolt
was crushed by some 200,000 Russian troops and 2,500 Russian tanks.
<P>
<B>INDONESIA 1958</B>
<P>
CIA attempted to topple the leftward leaning government of President
Achmed Sukarno.  In May of '58, a B-26 aircraft being operated
by C.A.T. was shot down while it was on a bombing and strafing
mission to aid the rebels.  The CIA involvement became apparent
and ended the operation.
<P>
<B>NORTH VIETNAM 1954-1958</B>
<P>
Edward Lansdale could not succeed at overthrowing the existing
government in North Vietname despite his working on it from 1954
to 1958.
<P>
<B>CUBA 1959-60s</B>
<P>
Major propoganda and support of young dissedents in Cuba.  On
December 11, 1959, CIA gave the recommendation to eliminate Castro.
 Operation Mongoose was approved in by Eisenhower within a few
months, and reaffirmed by Kennedy to Lansdale in November of 1961.
 Techniques were discussed from several different methods of poisoning
him, to the outrageous ideas of putting bombs in sea shells by
his beachhouse.  The last of actual Mongoose operations died along
with Kennedy in November, 1963. 
<P>
<B>BAY OF PIGS APPROVAL, 8/18/60</B>
<P>
Eisenhower approved the Bay of Pigs as a paramilitary operation
using indigenous personnel, approving $13 million of covert funds.
<P>
<B>DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</B>
<P>
President Rafael Leonidas Trujillo was targetted for assasination
as well.
<P>
<B>CONGO (Ziare)</B>
<P>
Patrice Lumumba of the Congo was to be assasinated but it appears
his own people took the problem out of the hands of the CIA.
<P>
<B>SINGAPORE, SPRING 1961</B>
<P>
CIA attempts to infiltrate and subvert the Singapore Secret Police,
and when discovered, tries to bribe the Prime Minister to hush
it up, requiring a very hasty apology from Secretary of State
Dean Rusk.
<P>
<B>BAY OF PIGS, April 1961</B>
<P>
A seven ship armarda dropped anchor in the Bay of Pigs, composed
of indigenous Cuban exiles.  Very poor intelligence on the landing
site, resulted in the landing force seeing that the area chosen
was in fact an amusement park like area.  With no air cover, and
the unreported concrete roads crisscrossing the area, the Cuban
forces were able to crush the invaders, and the CIA cover story
for the operation soon collapsed.  Holding back of Office of Naval
Intelligence that pointed out that Castro was in fact quite popular,
and lack of oversight into the prerequisites for making the operation
viable were blamed for the mishap as well. 
<P>

<h1>MILNET:  Intelligence Agencies  by Function</h1>
</center>
<p>
Below we list the various intelligence agencies, grouped by the intelligence function they 
perform.  Note however, that in some cases the missions are sheer conjecture, since outside 
of the U.S., intelligence agency missions are not public knowlege.  Note too that even in 
the U.S. it is rumored that parts of the National Security Act remain classified.  This 
being the body of law that defines the activities of U.S. intelligence agencies, it is 
quite possible that the U.S. public is also unaware of certain missions of certain 
agencies.

Note also that this material originally was compiled prior to the breakup of the former 
Soviet Union, thus country names have not been changed to reflect modern renamings and 
borders (for instance East and West Germany are shown as separate countries).  Where 
former Soviet Union countries are shown, it is thought that the same organizations exist 
but under new names, and one would hope new management.

<H1>Intelligence:  COMINT Definition</h1>
<p></center>
COMINT is defined as the collection of communications intelligence.  This is more accurately defined as the collection of information pertaining to the patterns of, the codes used in, the frequencies used, and the sites used for communications.  Thus COMINT is the collection of information about the target's communications capabilities and procedures.  

Typically COMINT is gathered by ground sites who are able to "listen-in" on the target's communications wether it be by radio, telegraph, telephone, television, or even laser.  Recently the Clinton administration urged adoption of the "Clipper Chip" encryption technology to aid commercial and financial uses of digital communictions in securing data, but at the same time allowing authorized agencies such as law enforcement, FBI, and NSA to easily decrypt encoded messages.  The controversy has been going on since the Bush Administration.

There are, of course, a number of different methods for collecting COMINT besides from a ground station, the most notable two being the collection via aircraft or satellite, known as   <a href="/milnet/overhead.htm">overhead reconaissance</a>.

<H2>7 Americans Killed In Crash</H2>
<B>By The Associated Press</B><P><B>
</B><P>
The seven Americans aboard the French DC-10 jetliner that crashed in northern Africa included a U.S. Peace Corps volunteer returning home after two years as an English teacher in Chad.<P>
	Also on board was Bonnie Barnes Pugh, wife of the U.S. ambassador to Chad and four Americans who had been working at an oilfield in southern Chad.<P>
	 A radical Shiite group Wednesday claimed responsibility for the downing of a jetliner, the airline UTA said. All 171 people aboard died. The airline said a bomb most likely caused the crash of the jetliner, which exploded Tuesday shortly after taking off from Chad for Paris.<P>
	Jim Flanigan, a Peace Corps spokesman in Washington, said Margaret Schutzius, 23, of Dallas, had completed her work in Chad and was headed home.<P>
	Miss Schutzius joined the Peace Corps in June 1987 as a secondary education teacher, he said. She had attended the University of Chicago before joining the Peace Corps. The Peace Corps has about 30 volunteers in Chad.<P>
	Exxon Corp. spokeswoman Sara Johnson in New York said two Americans working in southern Chad for the company's Esso Exploration &amp amp  Production Chad Inc. subsidiary were also on the UTA flight.<P>
	They were petroleum geologist Mark Corder, 35, of Houston, and senior operation supervisor James Turlington, Sr., 48, of Bellville.<P>
	Miss Johnson said an Esso Resources Canada employee on loan to Exxon was also on the flight. Russell O. Jordan Jr, 29, a senior projects engineer, is Canadian, but listed his hometown as Houston, she said.<P>
	The Tulsa, Okla.-based Parker Drilling Co. said four of its employees were aboard the French airliner, including two Americans. They were returning home from a 28-day work rotation.<P>
	Parker Drilling spokesman Tim Colwell said the four men worked at a rig in southern Chad that Parker owns and operates under a contract with Exxon.<P>
	He identified the Parker employees as Pat Huff, 38, of Franklin, Texas; Donald Warner, 25, of Terry, Mont.; David Middleton, 38, of Rowland Gill, England, and a Bolivian truck driver, whose name was not released pending notification of relatives.<P>
	A camp medic, Warner had been with the company for a month.<P>
	Huff, a rig manager, liked working in oilfields overseas and never expressed any concerns about traveling, his mother said Wednesday.<P>
	"He had no fears,'' said Janice Huff, of Franklin. ``I said something to him a few months ago after so many planes had been going down and he said, `No, not really.' You always think it's going to happen to someone else.''<P>
	The State Department identified the seventh American as Mihai Ali Manestianu, but no further information was immediately available.<P>

<H2>Reports: Plastics Blew Up DC10</H2>
<B>PARIS (AP)</B> - Investigators believe they have found traces of a powerful plastic explosive in the wreckage of a French DC-10 airliner that exploded over the Niger desert, two French newspapers reported Tuesday.<P>
   The dailies Liberation and Le Parisien said the discovery strengthened the link between last week's UTA crash and the December 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie,<P>
Scotland.<P>
   The news accounts, quoting unidentified sources involved in the inquiry, said the presence of Semtex, a malleable and difficult-to-detect explosive made in Czechoslovakia, still had to be confirmed by laboratory tests in Paris.<P>
   Liberation reported the explosive may have been hidden in a shipment of farm chemicals put on the plane in Brazzaville, Congo, where it originated.<P>
   The plane disappeared less than an hour after takeoff following a stopover in N'Djamena, Chad. All 171 people aboard were killed.<P>
   French investigators have said it appears certain an ``explosive substance'' in a front cargo compartment caused the crash but have not elaborated publicly on what explosive may have been used.<P>
   The parallels between last week's crash and the Dec. 21 Lockerbie disaster have already been widely noted.<P>
   It is believed that a radio-cassette player rigged with Semtex was placed aboard the Pan Am flight in Frankfurt that made a change of planes in London before the explosion.<P>
   The Syrian-backed Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine-General Command is considered the prime suspect behind that attack, though the group's leader Ahmed Jibril has denied involvement.<P>
   Police in West Germany seized an air pressure-activated bomb hidden in a radio when they raided houses and apartments occupied by suspected radical Palestinians in October last year.<P>
   Claims of responsibility for the UTA crash from anonymous callers in Beirut and London on behalf of the Moslem extremist group Islamic Jihad and a previously unknown Chadian organization have not been authenticated. French police appear to be treating the claims with great skepticism.<P>
   On Monday, Investigating Magistrate Jean-Louis Bruguieres, an anti-terrorism specialist heading the criminal investigation, officially called on the DST, France's counterespionage police, to aid in the probe, judicial sources said.<P>
  The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Bruguieres made a specific written request to the Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire for assistance. The sources said they did not know exactly what tasks the agency's officers were called on to undertake.<P>

<H2><a name="rogers">Probe Of Van Bombing Shifts?</H2>
<B>SAN DIEGO (AP)</B> - A federal inquiry into the bombing of a van driven by the wife of the skipper of the USS Vincennes has shifted the suspected motive from terrorism to a possible personal vendetta, a newspaper reported Sunday.<P>
   Investigators are concentrating on an individual who may have had a grudge against the ship's captain, The Los Angeles Times reported, adding that international terrorism hasn't been ruled out as motive.<P>
   Authorities initially interpreted the bombing as a terrorist retribution for the mistaken downing of an Iranian commercial jetliner by the Vincennes, an Aegis-class guided missile cruiser commanded at the time by Capt. Will Rogers III.<P>
   Rogers' wife, Sharon, was alone in the van and narrowly escaped injury when it was destroyed March 10.<P>
  The Times, citing four unnamed sources, said investigators believe the attack may have been the result of an unnamed individual's animosity toward Capt. Rogers. Two sources said the suspect was an American citizen.<P>
   Tom Hughes, FBI special agent in charge in San Diego, refused to discuss any aspect of the six-month probe. ``We will have the same position we have in any ongoing investigation,'' he said, ``and that is `no comment.'''<P>
   Capt. Rogers expressed surprise.<P>
   ``I have not the remotest idea of anyone who would take a personal vendetta against me or my family,'' the captain said.<P>
   Rogers was in charge of the Vincennes on July 3, 1988, when the commercial Iranian airliner was shot down over the Persian Gulf. All 290 people aboard the plane died.<P>
   Rogers told Navy investigators he thought the jetliner was an Iranian jet fighter preparing to attack his ship.<P>
   The Pentagon later concluded the ship's crew made crucial errors in their analysis of the aircraft and its intentions, but exonerated Rogers, in part because the airliner failed to respond to the Vincennes' repeated warnings.<P>

<H2>Rogers Bombing Not Terrorists?</H2>
<B>SAN DIEGO (AP)</B> - Federal investigators now believe someone with a grudge against the USS Vincennes' former skipper, not revenge-minded terrorists, may have bombed the van his wife drove, according to published reports.<P>
   The FBI probe has shifted its focus to the possibility that the March 10 bombing was carried out by a U.S. citizen, unconnected with the military, who has a personal vendetta against Capt. Will C. Rogers III, The San Diego Union reported Monday. The paper quoted a Navy official who asked to remain anonymous.<P>
   Federal agents have identified such an individual and are checking his alibis, but no further identification or elaboration was available, a Justice Department official said.<P>
   The Los Angeles Times quoted four unidentified sources Sunday who also said the FBI probe is focusing on the personal vendetta theory. Two of those sources said the individual being investigated was a U.S. citizen.<P>
  The pipe bomb explosion drew national attention because investigators initially interpreted it as terrorist retribution for the mistaken downing eight months earlier of an Iranian commercial jetliner by the Vincennes, an Aegis-class guided missile cruiser commanded by Rogers.<P>
   All 290 people aboard the plane died.  Rogers' wife, Sharon, was alone in the van but got out uninjured moments before it was destroyed by fire at an intersection near the couple's home in San Diego, where the Vincennes is based.<P>
   Tom Hughes, FBI special agent in charge in San Diego, refused to discuss any aspect of the six-month probe. ``We will have the same position we have in any ongoing investigation,'' he said, ``and that is `no comment.'''<P>
    Rogers expressed surprise at the possibility of a personal motive in the attack, saying, ``I have not the remotest idea of anyone who would take a personal vendetta against me or my family.''<P>

<H2>Swiss Red Cross Men Kidnapped In Lebanon</H2>
<B>SIDON, Lebanon (AP)</B> - Gunmen today kidnapped two Swiss men who work for the International Committee of the Red Cross in this southern port city, police said.<P>
   The two were seized at 8:30 a.m. (1:30 a.m. EDT) after they left their headquarters in a white Peugeot car, heading for a Red Cross center in this port 40 miles south of Beirut, police said.<P>
   The Beirut office of the Geneva-based International Committee of the Red Cross refused to comment.<P>
   Police said they could not yet provide the names of the two men.<P>
   There was no claim of responsibility for the abduction, the latest in a chain that targeted relief workers with foreign humanitarian organizations in south Lebanon.<P>
   Most of the previous south Lebanon kidnappings were blamed by police on Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the radical Palestinian guerrilla group headed by terrorist mastermind<P>
<a href="twhoswho.htm#AbuNidal"><b>Abu Nidal</b></a>.<P>
   Abu Nidal is the nom de guerre of Sabri al-Banna, a former official in Yasser Arafat's mainstream Fatah movement who split with the Palestinian leader in 1973.<P>
   Sidon houses the teeming Palestinian refugee camp of Ein el-Hilweh and the nearby town of Mieh Mieh, where Abu Nidal's group maintain bases.<P>
   The Red Cross pulled all its 31 Swiss delegates from Lebanon on Dec. 20 after the abduction of Peter Winkler, a Red Cross official in Sidon. The Swiss man was kidnapped Nov. 17, 1988 and released Dec. 16.<P>
   News reports in Switzerland and Lebanon said at the time that Winkler's kidnappers threatened new anti-Swiss attacks, claiming the Red Cross and Swiss authorities reneged on a pledge to pay ransom for Winkler's freedom.<P>
   The Red Cross mission returned to Lebanon Jan. 22 after obtaining pledges from all parties in Lebanon that the humanitarian organization would not be subjected to any attacks.<P>
  Apart from the two Swiss abducted today, 16 Westerners, including eight Americans, are held hostage in Lebanon.<P>
   Most of them are held by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremist factions. The longest held is American journalist Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.<P>

<H2>Woman Abducted In Lebanon</H2>
<B>BERN, Switzerland (AP)</B> - A Swiss woman was kidnapped in northern Lebanon Sunday, two days after the abduction of two Swiss Red Cross workers, the Foreign Ministry said Thursday.<P>
   Ministry spokesman Clemens Birrer said the part-time flight attendant was kidnapped by armed civilians during a visit to the Mediterranean port of Tripoli.<P>
   The woman's name and age were withheld at the request of her parents, Birrer said.<P>
   Her disappearance brings to 19 the number of Westerners missing in Lebanon, including eight Americans. Most are believed captives of Shiite Moslems loyal to Iran.<P>
   Birrer said the woman's parents asked authorities not to publicize the case, but he confirmed the kidnapping after being asked to comment on unattributed news reports.<P>
   Switzerland requested help from Syria because Syrian troops control much of northern Lebanon, he added.<P>
   Last Friday, two Swiss International Red Cross workers, Elio Erriquez and Emmanual Christen, were abducted in southern Lebanon.<P>
   There have been no demands and no claims of responsibility in the kidnappings so far, and Birrer said Swiss officials did not assume the woman's abduction was connected to the most recent kidnappings.<P>
   Lebanese police said Monday that Erriquez and Christen are being held by radical Palestinian guerrillas led by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal, whose group denied taking part.<P>
   PLO spokesmen last week accused Abu Nidal's group of the kidnappings, linking them to a Shiite Moslem militant, Mohammed Hariri, who is serving a life sentence in Switzerland for hijacking an Air Afrique jetliner in 1987 and killing a French passenger.<P>
   Longest-held of the Western hostages is Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985.<P>

<H2>Peru Seeks Kidnapped TV Exec.</H2>
<B>LIMA, Peru, (AP)</B> - Police detained about 16,000 people in a massive search this week for a television executive kidnapped by gunmen thought to be leftist guerrillas, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry said Friday.<P>
   All but 4,000 were released after questioning, said the spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity. About 3,000 police officers using dogs and backed by light armored cars took part in the mass roundup.<P>
   Hector Delgado Parker, senior news executive of Channel 5 and former adviser to President Alan Garcia, was abducted Wednesday. The gunmen shot up his armored-plated car, killed his driver and badly wounded his bodyguard in the ambush, police said.<P>
   Police said pamphlets from the pro-Cuban Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement were found at the site. Witnesses said that up to eight kidnappers took part.<P>

Congress has intrepreted the law to include uniformed members of the 
Armed Forces engaged in Intelligence Activities.  EO 12333 also broaden 
the internal surviellance capabilities of certain agencies when pursuing 
known foreign nationals inside the U.S.<P>

<p></center>
</B>The NFIB acts as a clearing house for all information gleaned by 
national intelligence assets on foreign powers.  This could very well 
include economic intelligence gathered via both covert or overt means.  
As with all organizations within the U.S. Intelligence Community, its 
existence may be only a front since being reported upon by various 
authors, having been replaced with another agency within the community.  
The name may have changed to the NFIC or National Foreign Intelligence 
Center.<P>

<H1>National Photographic Interpretation Center</H1>
<p></center>
The NPIC was originally formed to bring together national resources 
in order to ensure accurate and timely analysis and reporting on 
photographic imagery produced by national intelligence assets (read this 
as satellite and aircraft photographic imagery).  At the time of its 
formation, the concept of satellite imagery was so top secret that many 
interpreters did not know where the imagery was taken...or at least such 
speculation was discouraged.<P>
Today, the NPIC is thought to have been gobbled up and given over to the 
National Reconnaisance Office (NRO), and managed by the US Air Force 
under the auspices of the Undersecratery of the Air Force.<P>

<H1>Laws and Directives </H1>
<H1>Enabling Intelligence Work 
</H1>
<H1>Or Counter-Terrorism</H1>
<hr>
</center>
<p>
<H2>National Security Act of 
1947</H2>
</B>Established the Central Intelligence Agency, giving the DCI the 
authority to protect secrets,  specifically sources and methods.  The 
agency would receive its funds directly from Congress in a lump sum so 
as to insure secrecy of activity and of which there would be no 
accounting outside the agency.  Details of the types of overt and covert 
information collection sources were spelled out and the drafters of the 
act thought that the CIA  should have an "instant" capability for 
subversive operations.  Note the use of capability  rather than 
establishing the the CIA could actually execute  subversive operations.  
<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 4/A</H2>
</B>December, 1947, placed the CIA in charge of covert "psychological" 
operations, with the US State Department supplying policy guidance.  1 
<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Un-numbered Document, 
1948</H2>
</B>Truman, Forrestal, and Marshall overruled DCI Hillenkoetter thus 
allowing James Angleton to set up a covert operation in Italy to counter 
communist subversion of the Italian government.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 10/2</H2>
</B>June 1948, superseded NSC Directive 4/A, established a covert 
operational branch within the CIA in the interests of world peace and US 
national security.  Specifically, its covert operations would have to be 
of a type for which "the US Government can plausibly disclaim any 
responsibility", and could not involve "armed conflict by recognized 
military forces".  Activities premitted included "propaganda; economic 
warfare; preventive direct action, including sabotage, anti-sabotage, 
demolition, and evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states, 
including assistance to underground resistance movements, guerillas and 
refugee liberation groups, and support of indigenous anti-communist 
elements in threatened countries of the free world".  <P>
<P>
The "10/2 Panel" containing representatives from the Department of 
Defense and Department of State, was given the responsiblity to 
supervise covert operations with the NSC being the mediator on disputes.  
2<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Central Intelligence Act of 
1949</H2>
</B>Authorized the Director of Central Intelligence to receive, 
exchange, and spend money without giving account to Congress in 
accordance with the laws governing other agencies.  It also authorized 
special training for CIA officers as well as other administrative things 
such as employment conditions; hiring practices (storage or shipment of 
household goods, etc.); allowed CIA to borrow personnel from other 
agencies or the military; to ignore immigration laws in recruiting up to 
100 defecters per year; and gave the DCI the authority to declare and 
keep secrets.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 68</H2>
</B>04/14/50, called for nuclear and conventional arms build up as well 
as covert operations to subvert Communist regimes.  3<P>
<P>
<B><H2>McCarren Act of 1951</H2>
</B>Passed via override of Truman's veto, placed severe restrictions on 
civil liberties, also known as the internal security law.  Chief concern 
to intelligence agencies was the provision which prohibited the 
admission to the U.S. of territory and citizenship of radical aliens, 
thus cutting off the supply of valuable defectors.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Communications Intelligence 
Activities Memorandum</H2>
</B>Approximate date, 10/24/52, President Harry S. Truman, an eight page 
document, only now partially declassified, abolishing the Armed Forces 
Security Agency and placing their resources into the new National 
Security Agency.  Specifically gives to the NSA the control over, and 
coordination of, the collection and processing of Communications 
Intelligence.  NSA considered to be "within but not part of the DOD". 
6<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Directive 5412/I</H2>
</B>03/12/55, Defines covert operations as "all activities...so planned 
and executed that any U.S. Government responsibility for them is not 
evident to unauthorized persons and that if uncovered the U.S. 
Government can plausibly disclaim any responsibility for them."  Thus we 
have plausible deniability.  It also listed the covert operations the 
CIA was expected to undertake as:<P>
"Propoganda, political action; economic warfare; escape and evasion and 
evacuation measures; subversion against hostile states or groups 
including assistance to underground movements, guerillas and refugee 
liberation groups; support of indigenous and anti-communist elements in 
threatened countries of the free world; deception plans and operations; 
and all activities compatible with this directive necessary to 
accomplish the foregoing."  4<P>
<P>
<B><H2>NSC Decision Memorandum 40, 
1970</H2>
</B>February 17, 1970, established the 40 Committee to oversea covert 
operations just as in the 303 Committee and Special Groups had in the 
past, in this case, the 40 Committee was made up of the Chairman, Henry 
Kissinger (Nixon's Foreign Policy Advisor) as the Chairman of the 
committee, the Deputy Secratary of State, the Deputy Secratary of 
Defense, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and DCI Richard 
Helms.<P>
The Committee quickly established the following set of requirements of 
covert operations that would be brought before the Committee for 
review:<P>
<UL>
<LI>Operations costing more than $25,000, or
<LI>Support political or military groups, or 
<LI>Economic, paramilitary, counterinsurgence in nature, or
<LI>Politically sensitive
</UL>
<P>
<B><H2>1971 Fund Cuts for CIA SEA 
Action</H2>
</B>12/71, Congress cut off CIA funds for use in Laos and Cambodia.  
Proposed by Senator Clifford P. Case in July of 1971, prohibiting the 
use of funds to pay for U.S. paramilitary operations in Cambodia and 
Laos (especially prohibiting the CIA).<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Case-Zablocki Act of 1972</H2>
</B>Insisted on Congressional review of all executive agreements.<P>
<P>
<B><H2><a href="/milnet/warpower.htm">War Powers Act of 1973</a></H2>
</B>Prohibited the President from waging war for more than sixty days 
without congressional approval.<P>
<P>
<B><H2><a href="/milnet/hughes.htm">HUGHES-RYAN ACT OF 
1974</a></H2>
</B>Amendment to the Foreign Assitance Act of 1974, requiring the 
President to report and  nonintelligence CIA operations to relevant 
Congressional committees (at the time this numbered around 8 committee) 
in a timely fashion.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Church Committee, 1974</H2>
</B>On January 27, 1974, the U.S. Senate voted to create the Select 
Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence 
Activities.  During the study, a complete history of the CIA was 
documented by Anne Karalekas. 1<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Clark Amendment, 1975</H2>
</B>1/75, the House passed this amendment (having already been passed in 
the Senate) to cut off funds for covert operations in Angola.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>House Select Committee on 
Intelligence, 1975 </H2>
</B>02/19/75, created by the U.S. House of Representatives to provide 
House oversight in addition to Senate oversight, since the House 
provides all appropriations.  The Committee was made the House Permanent 
Committee on Intelligence on July 14, 1977.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Senate Select Committee on 
Intelligence, 1976</H2>
</B>05/19/76, US Senate voted to establish their own committee to 
oversee Intelligence operations in the U.S.<P>
<P>
<B><H2><a href="/milnet/presdir.htm">1976 Presidential Directive</a></H2>
</B>2/18/76:  Henry Kissinger, Chairman of the NSC under Ford, created 
the Committee on Foreign Intelligence reporting to the NSC Chairman, 
with the DCI as the chair of the new Committee.  Ford also replaced the 
40 Committee with a five-man Operations Advisory Group.  Ford also 
outlawed assassination as an instrument of American Policy.  In this 
directive he also detailed the CIAs domestic duties, and accepted the 
principle of a joint Congressional oversight committee.  Congress did 
not set up a joint committee however, the House and Senate each having 
their own committees.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Presidential Executive Order 
12036, 1978</H2>
</B>President Carter, reiterating changes made by his predecessor Gerald 
Ford, retension of the Intelligence Oversight Board to mointor activiies 
possibly involving illegality or impropriety, listed a number of 
prohibited activities which might concievably impinge upon the rights or 
privacy of U.S. citizens and resident aliens.  The order was rescinded 
until 1981.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Foreign Intelligence Surviellance 
Act of 1978</H2>
</B>10/25/78:  Following the lead by the Carter administration, Congress 
passed this law which legalizes the use of wiretaps and bugs in 
suspected cases of foreign espionage, terrorism, and sabotage; but only 
after a case by case review by a new set of Federal Judges, who must 
issue a Federal Warrant.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Classified Information Protection 
Act of 1980</H2>
</B>Sets a procedure for revealing of sensitive classified information 
in a trial, such that only a few of the people in the trial may see it, 
and who must also sign an oath not to reveal any part of the 
information.  It's intent is to allow the course of justice to continue 
in cases where the government pleads that release of information needed 
in the case will damage National Security if released to the public.  
<P>
This law was used in the April 1986 trial of former U.S. Army 
Intelligence agent Richard C. Smith who was acquitted of all charges.  
Smith's story was that he had been an agent posing, at the bequest of 
the CIA, as a disgrunlted former Intelligence officer to entrap KGB 
agents.  <P>
Althought the story was never confirmed, certainly there was not enough 
evidence to the contary leaving room for much doubt in the government's 
case and Smith was acquitted.<P>
<P>
<B><H2><a href="/milnet/intauth.htm">Intelligence Authorization Act of 
1981</a></H2>
</B>In the case of necessary immediate action, only the Chairman and 
Vice Chairman of each committee, and the majority leaders of the Senate 
and House would have to be notified with a follow on briefing when time 
permitted.  The method for notification was specified as a "finding" 
which would fully describe the activity, and be given to Congress within 
a reasonable period of time following the activity beginning. <P>
<P>
<B><H2><a href="/milnet/eo12333.htm">Presidential Directive 12333, 
1981</a></H2>
</B>President Reagan, on December 12, 1981, re-issued the Presidental 
Directive which defines the U.S. Intelligence community.  In this 
directive, Reagan is purported to have allowed more scope to spy at home 
and to follow up the domestic dimensions of foreign agent activity with 
which it was concerned.  CIA was given more power to act within the 
confines of the U.S., but only where surveillance or covert activities 
did not target U.S. corporations or citizens, and where such activities 
are not intended to influence U.S. political processes, public opinion 
or the media.<P>
<P>
<B><H2><a href="/milnet/boland.htm">Boland Amendment, 1982</a></H2>
</B>12/08/82, Introduced by the chairman of the House Intelligence 
Committee, Edward P. Boland, prohibiting intelligence agencies from 
providing military equipment, training or support to anyone "for the 
purpose of overthrowing the Government of Nicaragua". 5<P>
<P>
<B><H2>House Intelligence Identities Act of 
1982</H2>
</B>06/82, protects against disclosure of the identities of agents 
either directly or through release of incriminating information.  
Provides for penalities for those who named names in a deliberate 
attempt to harm the U.S. Intelligence effort.<P>
<P>
<B><H2>Amendment to the Freedom of 
Information Act, 1984</H2>
</B>11/84, sponsored by Senator Barry Goldwater, Head of the Senate 
Select Committee on Intelligence, exempts CIA employees from responding 
to Freedom of Information Act requests except where such requests are 
from former employees of the CIA who are in legal action with the 
government.<P>

<h1>C3I Database, 1990</h1>
</center>
<p>
The database below is based upon declassified information available to the
defense industry just prior to the start of the Gulf War.  Some of the programs
listed in the database have been completed (with little or no fan fare as is the custom with those programs whose original IOC dates were classified or subject
of dis-information).
Others may have been cancelled and replaced with funding from other undisclosed
funding.  In any case, this should give you an indication of the kinds of systems, and 
upgrades the U.S. has made in the key area of Command, Control, Communications,
and Intelligence.
<p>
<a name="SDI">
<h2>Satellite Reconnaissance </h2>
The major emphasis in U.S. funded programs over the last 6 years (1985 through 1990) has been on Strategic Modernization, plus 
the surveillance components of <b>SDI</b> and ADI (Air Defense Initiative) 
programs. <P>
[Editor's Note:  It is interesting to note that in 1995, the choice of 
beefing up surveillance appears to be an excellent decision...what with the
increasing lack of funds for other purposes, it appears that the military
establishment is in excellent position to watch outside U.S. borders as well
as their allies borders.  In a long period of isolationism (which we appear
to be in), surveillance is an excellent tool to keep small fires from becoming
major damaging fires due to a lack of discovery.]

 Strategic communications provide command and control of  nuclear forces 
under wartime conditions, thus must survive  repeated nuclear attack and 
the environmentals associated  with post-nuclear attack.    This 
includes both atmospheric post-attack conditions as  well as hardness 
during the actual attack and ecompasses  various transmission techniques 
across a widely separated  number of frequencies.<P>

increase substantially in the FY 1991 and              beyond.    <BR>

<B>Defense Wide Systems  </B>  <P>
Defense wide programs will be on a decline throughout FY  1990, but it 
is expected that the $2.3 billion market will  rise sharply in a few 
years, but still not sufficient to  offset continued mild inflation.<P>

dropping due to the costs driven by a need              to make the

<BR>
<dt><B>DDN</B>	      <dd>Defense Data Network met with a major delay

the Block 5D-3              satellites.    <BR>
<dt><B>DSCS</B>	      <dd>Defense Satellite Communications System will              
remain the principal wideband communications              system 
servicing the Tri-Service needs.  The              loss of U.S. space 
launch capability has              delayed the transition to full 
<B>DSCSIII</B>              operational capability until about 1991.  FY              
1990 and FY 1991 funding will decline with              <B>DSCSIII</B> 
satellites being placed in inventory              against contracts.  
This will further delay              any follow-on to the <B>DSCSIII</B>

significant build up              in FY 1991 and beyond.  Second source
